136,"After reading their assigned material, participants completed the Free Will and Determinism scale (FWD; Paulhus & Margesson, 1994) and the Positive and Negative Affectivity Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), which we used to assess whether the reading manipulation affected their beliefs and mood. Subsequently, participants were given a computer-based mental-arithmetic task (von Hippel, Lakin, & Shakarchi, 2005) in which they were asked to calculate the answers to 20 problems (e.g., 11 81 18 121 19 71 17 21 8 45 ?), presented individually.

146,"Consider in this context the two noun-phrase examples given earlier. If word order constrains phonological activation, then the canonical word order will initially lead to greater activation of adjective than noun phonology in English, and the opposite pattern in French. Navarrete and Costa (2006) extended the evidence in support of a cascading flow of activation to the situation in which an adjective and a noun are active concurrently. In their study, Spanish participants named the color of colored objects faster when the phonological onsets of the color and object names were congruent (e.g., vela verde, ‘‘green candle’’) than when they",1.0,4.0

In this study, participants either pointed to or grasped a target defined by a conjunction of its orientation and color. Saccades to distractors having the same orientation as the target were more likely when a grasping response was made than when a pointing response was made. This suggests that contrasting actions can differentially weight visual information, with orientation being weighted more strongly for selection when a grasping rather than a pointing response is required (see also Hannus, Cornelissen, Lindemann, & Bekkering, 2005).

Haidt and colleagues (e.g., Haidt & Joseph, 2008) have proposed that the notion of purity constitutes a basic moral intuition that developed from the need to safeguard oneself from potentially harmful substances. According to this approach, disgust evolved as an emotion to protect the body from germs, parasites, and spoilt food, but it was then extended to social and moral domains (Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000). As a consequence, people often report finding immoral acts disgusting. Indeed, similar neural structures appear to be involved in",0.0,3.0

The inclusion of the horizontal trials was not theoretically motivated, but rather allowed us to systematically control for individual differences in speed, which are quite pronounced on nearly any choice reaction time task (Jensen, 1998; Robinson & Oishi, 2006). In our second study, we also administered a spatial attention task in which the location of the spatial probes was perfectly predictable because they alternated between an upper position and a lower position (in",0.0,2.0

Such conflict-adaptation effects suggest that response conflicts induce enhanced target processing, distractor suppression, or both on the following trial (but see Mayr, Awh, & Laurey, 2003). According to the conflict-monitoring theory proposed by Botvinick et al. (2001), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the medial frontal lobe monitors response conflicts and signals the demand for increased control to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is thought to support active maintenance of goal representations and top-down modulation of lower-level processing modules (Miller & Cohen, 2001; Ridderinkhof, Ullsperger, Crone, & Nieuwenhuis, 2004).

In addition, there are reports of superior detection of modern threatening stimuli (e.g., syringes, guns, and knives; Blanchette, 2006; Brosch & Sharma, 2005). Furthermore, in some of these studies, results varied with the number of distractors, contrary to the analysis offered by Öhman et al. All of these visual search results and claims are based on adult participants, who presumably have extensive knowledge about snakes and various kinds and degrees of experience with them (Rachman, 2002).

For instance, branches and clouds are typically overhead, whereas roots and puddles are typically underfoot. Indeed, object words are judged faster when presented on a computer screen in the objects’ canonical locations (Zwaan & Yaxley, 2003). For instance, eagle is judged faster when presented at the top rather than the bottom of a display, whereas snake is judged faster at the bottom (Šetić & Domijan, 2007).
