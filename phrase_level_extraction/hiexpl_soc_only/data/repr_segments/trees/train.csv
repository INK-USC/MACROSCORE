Two types of emotions have been linked consistently to distinct stages of openness to change. Emotions such as interest and curiosity motivate exploration and seeking of novel stimuli (for a review, see Silvia, 2008). According to Frijda (1986), curiosity reflects openness and orients people toward novelty, enabling them to identify potential rewards.

An alternative explanation is that social transmission of fear is counteracted by safety learning prior to observational fear learning.","(ROOT  (S    (PP (IN For)      (NP (NN instance)))    (, ,)    (SBAR (IN although)      (S        (NP          (NP (JJ social) (NN transmission))          (PP (IN of)            (NP              (NP (NN fear))              (PP (IN between)                (NP                  (NP (NNS individuals))                  (VP (VBG living)                    (PP (IN in)                      (NP (JJ close) (NN proximity)))))))))        (VP (VBZ occurs)          (ADVP (RB readily)))))    (, ,)    (NP      (NP (DT a) (NN proportion))      (PP (IN of)        (NP (JJ such) (NNS fears))))    (VP (MD may)      (VP (VB be)        (VP (VBN extinguished)          (PP (IN through)            (NP              (NP (JJ observational)                (NML (NN safety) (VBG learning))                (NNS experiences))              (, ,)              (SBAR                (WHNP (WDT which))                (S                  (VP (VBP serve)                    (PP (IN as)                      (NP                        (NP (DT a)                          (ADJP (RB particularly) (JJ efficient))                          (NN form))                        (PP (IN of)                          (NP (NN safety) (NN learning))))))))))          (PRN (-LRB- -LRB-)            (FRAG              (NP                (NP (NNP Bandura) (, ,) (NNP Grusec) (, ,))                (CC &)                (NP (NNP Menlove)))              (, ,)              (NP (CD 1967)))            (: ;)            (FRAG              (NP                (NP (NNP Golkar) (, ,) (NNP Selbing) (, ,) (NNP Flygare) (, ,) (NNP Öhman) (, ,))                (CC &)                (NP (NNP Olsson)))              (, ,)              (NP (CD 2013)))            (-RRB- -RRB-)))))    (. .)))"

Mixing costs—i.e., the cost of monitoring and coordinating multiple streams of incoming information—entail activation of global and sustained control mechanisms (Rubin & Meiran, 2005).","(ROOT  (S    (NP      (NP (NNS Bilinguals) (POS ’))      (ADJP (NN task) (HYPH -) (VBG switching))      (NNS abilities))    (VP (VBP have)      (VP (VBN been)        (VP (VBN studied)          (PP (IN by)            (S              (VP                (VP (VBG using)                  (NP                    (NP (DT a) (JJ typical)                      (ADJP (NN task) (HYPH -) (VBG switching))                      (NN paradigm))                    (SBAR                      (WHNP (WDT that))                      (S                        (VP (VBZ considers)                          (NP (DT both) (NN switch) (NNS costs)))))))                (CC and)                (VP (VBG mixing)                  (NP                    (NP (NNS costs))                    (, ,)                    (SBAR                      (WHNP (WDT which))                      (S                        (VP (VBP have)                          (VP (VBN been)                            (VP (VBN found)                              (S                                (VP (TO to)                                  (VP (VB implicate)                                    (NP (JJ different) (NN control) (NNS mechanisms)))))                              (PRN (-LRB- -LRB-)                                (NP                                  (NP (NNP Braver) (, ,) (NNP Reynolds) (, ,))                                  (CC &)                                  (NP (NNP Donaldson)))                                (, ,)                                (NP (CD 2003))                                (-RRB- -RRB-)))))))))))))))    (. .)))"

More specifically, motivational CQ refers to intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy in adapting to new cultures.","(ROOT  (S    (NP      (NP (NNS Individuals))      (PP (IN with)        (NP          (ADJP            (NP (JJ high) (NN meta))            (HYPH -) (JJ cognitive))          (NN CQ))))    (VP (VB engage)      (PP (IN in)        (NP (NN higherorder) (JJ cognitive) (NNS processes)))      (SBAR        (WHADVP (WRB when))        (S          (VP            (VP (VBG trying)              (S                (VP (TO to)                  (VP (VB adapt)                    (PP (IN to)                      (NP (JJ new) (NNS cultures)))))))            (, ,)            (VP (VBG including)              (SBAR                (WHADVP (WRB how))                (S                  (VP (TO to)                    (VP (VB plan)                      (S                        (VP                          (VP (VBG learning)                            (PP (IN about)                              (NP (DT the) (JJ new) (NN culture))))                          (CONJP (RB as) (RB well) (IN as))                          (VP (VBG evaluating)))))))))            (CC and)            (VP (VBG monitoring)              (NP (PRP$ their) (JJ own) (NN progress)))))))    (. .)))"

Delaying some transitions (such as having children) to complete other transitions (such as getting a college degree) benefits children (Furstenberg, Jr. 2010).

Thus, the associative sensorimotor learning account would predict that mirror neurons come from sensorimotor experience obtained through interaction with others, and thus are not only a product but also a process of social interaction (Heyes, 2010).","(ROOT  (S    (PP (VBG According)      (PP (IN to)        (S          (NP (DT this) (JJ associative) (NN sensorimotor))          (VP (VBG learning)            (NP (NN account))            (PRN (-LRB- -LRB-)              (S                (VP (VB see)                  (NP                    (NP (NNP Catmur) (, ,) (NNP Walsh))                    (, ,)                    (NP (CC &)                      (NP (NNP Heyes))                      (, ,)                      (NP (CD 2009))                      (: ;)                      (NP (NNP Heyes))))))              (, ,)              (NP (CD 2010) (, ,) (CD 2013))              (-RRB- -RRB-))))))    (NP      (ADJP (CC both)        (JJ sensory)        (CC and)        (JJ motor))      (NN information))    (VP (VBP are)      (ADJP (JJ crucial)        (SBAR (IN for)          (S            (NP              (NML (NN mirror) (NN neuron))              (NML (NN development)                (CC and)                (NN sensorimotor))              (NN experience))            (VP (MD could)              (ADVP (RB further))              (VP (VB alter)                (NP (NN mirror) (NN system) (NNS properties))))))))    (. .)))"

Not to mention, students have fewer opportunities for one-to-one teacher– child interaction (Pianta & Kraft-Sayre, 1999; Rimm-Kaufman & Pianta, 2000).","(ROOT  (S    (PP (VBG Beginning)      (PP (IN in)        (NP (JJ first) (NN grade))))    (, ,)    (NP (NNS teachers))    (VP (VBP become)      (ADJP        (ADJP (RB increasingly) (VBN focused)          (PP (IN on)            (NP              (NP (PRP$ their) (NN role))              (PP (IN as)                (NP (NNS instructors))))))        (CC and)        (ADJP (JJR less)          (SBAR            (S              (VP (VBD focused)                (PP (IN on)                  (S                    (VP (VBG providing)                      (NP (NN warmth)                        (CC and)                        (NN nurturance))                      (PP (IN for)                        (NP (NNS children))))))                (PRN (-LRB- -LRB-)                  (NP                    (NP (NNP Rimm) (HYPH -) (NNP Kaufman)                      (CC &)                      (NNP Pianta))                    (, ,)                    (NP (CD 2000)))                  (-RRB- -RRB-))))))))    (. .)))"

We can speculate that more unpredictability is problematic because it could represent that sometimes individuals engage in rumination even when in a neutral or positive mood.","(ROOT  (S    (NP (DT This))    (VP (VBZ implies)      (SBAR (IN that)        (S          (PP (IN at)            (NP              (NP (PDT both) (DT the)                (ADJP (JJ theoretical)                  (CC and)                  (JJ clinical))                (NNS levels))              (, ,)              (PP (RB instead) (IN of)                (S                  (VP (VBG focusing)                    (PP (IN on)                      (NP                        (NP (JJ mean) (NNS levels))                        (PP (IN of)                          (NP (NN rumination)                            (CC and)                            (NN mood))))))))))          (, ,)          (NP            (NP (DT a)              (ADJP (RBR more) (JJ detailed))              (NN analysis))            (PP (IN of)              (NP                (NP (DT the) (NN interaction))                (PP (IN between)                  (NP (NN mood)                    (CC and)                    (NN cognition))))))          (VP (MD could)            (VP (VB be)              (NP (DT a) (JJ promising) (NN way)                (S                  (VP (TO to)                    (VP (VB improve)                      (NP                        (NP (PRP$ our) (NN understanding))                        (PP (IN of)                          (NP (JJ cognitive) (NN vulnerability))))                      (PP (IN in)                        (NP                          (ADJP (JJ recurrent))                          (NN depression))))))))))))    (. .)))"
