However, by making the causal structure of the scenarios salient to our participants, an action–omission effect could be obtained for positive outcomes as well. Interestingly, no matter the outcome condition, the action–omission effectwas increased by explicitly reminding participants of the causal structure of the scenarios, though this increase was rather small in the negative outcome conditions compared to the positive outcome conditions.","(ROOT  (S    (S      (NP (PRP It))      (VP (VBZ appears)        (SBAR (IN that)          (S            (NP (DT the) (NN effect))            (VP (VBZ is)              (ADJP (RB largely) (JJ dependent)                (PP (IN on)                  (NP (JJ causal) (NN attribution) (NNS processes)))))))))    (, ,)    (CC and)    (S      (SBAR (IN whereas)        (S          (NP (JJ negative) (NNS outcomes))          (VP (VBP seem)            (S              (VP (TO to)                (VP (VB trigger)                  (NP (NN causality) (NNS appraisals))                  (PP (IN by)                    (NP (NN default)))))))))      (, ,)      (NP (DT this))      (VP (VBZ is) (RB not)        (NP          (NP (-LRB- -LRB-)            (QP (CC or)              (JJR less))            (-RRB- -RRB-))          (NP (DT the) (NN case))          (PP (IN for)            (NP (JJ positive) (NNS outcomes))))))    (. .)))"
10.1016/j.jesp.2015.04.001,0,"These firm beliefs should limit rightists' willingness to consider fleeing, even when experiencing fear. Additionally, the literature suggests that rightist ideology is associated with over-active fear responses and needs for certainty and security precisely because it functions to reduce fear and answer these needs (Jost et al., 2009). It follows that rightist ideology, in answering these needs, regulates the effects of fear by providing clear guidelines on how to react to ideologically-relevant threats—a notion supported by findings on ideological differences in the impact of emotions on policy support (Pliskin, Bar-Tal, Sheppes, & Halperin, 2014).","(ROOT  (S    (NP (DT These) (JJ firm) (NNS beliefs))    (VP (MD should)      (VP (VB limit)        (NP          (NP (NNS rightists) (POS '))          (NN willingness)          (S            (VP (TO to)              (VP (VB consider)                (S                  (VP (VBG fleeing)))                (, ,)                (SBAR (RB even)                  (WHADVP (WRB when))                  (S                    (VP (VBG experiencing)                      (NP (NN fear)))))))))))    (. .)))"

10.1093/jcr/ucw008,0,"2006), higher desirability, and greater temptation associations (Hofmann et al. 2010) are likely to be organized to the right of healthy items. Furthermore, we conceptualize that when food items are laterally displayed in a manner congruent (vs. incongruent) with consumers’ natural mental representation, it enhances the likelihood of choosing healthier options. To elaborate, we propose that consumers experience greater self-control when healthy/unhealthy items are displayed in a manner congruent with their natural mental representation. That is, as demonstrated by studies 2a and 2b, consumers tend to mentally represent healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items.","(ROOT  (S    (NP      (NP (CD 2006))      (-RRB- -RRB-) (, ,)      (NP (JJR higher) (NN desirability))      (, ,)      (CC and)      (NP        (NP (JJR greater) (NN temptation) (NNS associations))        (-LRB- -LRB-)        (NP          (NP (NNP Hofmann))          (ADVP (FW et) (FW al.))

10.1093/jcr/ucw044,1,"In accord with the notion that behavior is often guided by the need to maintain gender identity, particularly among male consumers, we posit that one plausible explanation for men’s avoidance of environmentally friendly behaviors is that a pervasive mental association exists between greenness and femininity, such that engaging in green behaviors could threaten men’s masculine identity. Thus we predict that due to the green- feminine association and its effect on social judgments and self-perception, men will be more likely than women to avoid green products and behaviors, particularly when their masculinity is threatened.","(ROOT  (S    (PP (IN In)      (NP        (NP (NN accord))        (PP (IN with)          (NP            (NP (DT the) (NN notion))            (SBAR (IN that)              (S                (NP (NN behavior))                (VP (VBZ is)                  (ADVP (RB often))                  (VP (VBN guided)                    (PP (IN by)                      (NP (DT the) (NN need)))                    (S                      (VP (TO to)                        (VP (VB maintain)                          (NP (NN gender) (NN identity)))))))))))))    (, ,)    (PP      (ADVP (RB particularly))      (IN among)      (NP (JJ male) (NNS consumers)))    (, ,)    (NP (PRP we))    (VP (VBP posit)      (SBAR (IN that)        (S          (NP            (NP (CD one) (JJ plausible) (NN explanation))            (PP (IN for)              (NP                (NP                  (NP (NNS men) (POS ’s))                  (NN avoidance))                (PP (IN of)                  (NP                    (ADJP (RB environmentally) (JJ friendly))                    (NNS behaviors))))))          (VP (VBZ is)            (SBAR (IN that)              (S                (NP (DT a) (JJ pervasive) (JJ mental) (NN association))                (VP (VBZ exists)                  (PP (IN between)                    (NP (NN greenness)                      (CC and)                      (NN femininity)))                  (, ,)                  (SBAR (JJ such) (IN that)                    (S                      (S                        (VP (VBG engaging)                          (PP (IN in)                            (NP (JJ green) (NNS behaviors)))))                      (VP (MD could)                        (VP (VB threaten)                          (NP                            (NP (NNS men) (POS ’s))                            (JJ masculine) (NN identity)))))))))))))    (. .)))"

Overall, slack is acknowledged to have costs, but its benefits are thought to outweigh these costs (Tan & Peng, 2003). Conversely, according to agency theorists slack has negative effects on firm outcomes because managers are self-serving and wasteful (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Following this line of reasoning, managers may not have the incentive to act in the best interest of the firm and thefirm's ownersmay lack the information needed to monitor managerial behavior.","(ROOT  (S    (PP (IN In)      (NP (DT this) (NN sense)))    (NP (NN slack))    (VP (MD can)      (ADVP (RB also))      (VP (VB serve)        (S          (VP (TO to)            (VP (VB facilitate)              (NP                (NP (JJ strategic) (NN behavior))                (SBAR                  (WHNP (WDT which))                  (S                    (VP (VBZ allows)                      (NP (NNS firms))                      (S                        (VP (TO to)                          (VP (VB create)                            (NP                              (NP (JJ new) (NNS strategies))                              (CC and)                              (NP (JJ new) (NNS products)                                (PRN (-LRB- -LRB-)                                  (NP (JJ Bourgeois))                                  (, ,)                                  (NP (CD 1981))                                  (: ;)                                  (NP (NNP Thompson))                                  (, ,)                                  (NP (CD 1967))                                  (-RRB- -RRB-))))))))))))))))    (. .)))"

If qB > qA, then B running is a dominant strategy whenever A and C would enter the race (i.e., r5 0) regardless of the equilibrium in this subgame, as discussed below. Given the equilibria in the subgames at stage 2, the unique equilibrium can be found by backward induction. When r5 0, running is a dominant strategy for A, B, and C, since the probability of winning in any subgame they enter is positive (by assumption).","(ROOT  (S    (SBAR (IN If)      (S        (NP (NN qA))        (VP (SYM >)          (NP (NN qB)))))    (, ,)    (NP (RB then) (DT A))    (VP (VBZ dominates)      (NP        (NP (NN C))        (-LRB- -LRB-)        (PP (IN by)          (NP (NN assumption)))        (-RRB- -RRB-))      (PP (IN for)        (NP          (NP (NNS types) (CD 1)            (CC and)            (CD 2))          (PP (IN in)            (NP (DT this) (NN subgame)))))      (, ,)      (S        (VP (VBG defining)          (NP (DT the) (NN equilibrium)))))    (. .)))"
