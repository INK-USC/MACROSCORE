Given people's desire to satisfy short-term desires over long-term goals (e.g., Baumeister, 2002) and that people punish for retributive reasons (Carlsmith et al., 2002), they may end up extracting suffering from a series of CEOs at the expense of dedicating the limited amount of resources to fixing the underlying problem.",0,4

Prior to the experiment it was confirmed that participants did not know each other in any way. Participants arrived at the lab at the same time and were given instructions before any social chatting could take place. Participants were given information forms describing the experiment and then asked to complete a consent form. As the minimal group paradigm, participants were told the cover story that the experiment was designed to study the link between cognitive style and social interaction.",0,8

In economic games similar to this (e.g., Dictator Game, Prisoner's Dilemma, Ultimatum Game; Balliet et al., 2014; Kramer & Brewer, 1984; Yamagishi &Mifune, 2008), individuals tend to demonstrate an ingroup bias whereby they allocate more resources to members of their own group than to the outgroup.",0,8
10.1016/j.jesp.2017.07.008,"In the case of political conspiracies, they also provide a means for engaging in protest against perceived abuses of governmental power. This protest allows a greater sense of personal empowerment against larger political-social forces (Bost & Prunier, 2013). For these reasons, conspiratorial thinking taps into a natural protection mechanism against potential threats. However, what constitutes a threat will also vary based on ideological motivations, which tend to be reinforced by, but not necessarily beholden to, one's racial, social, or political group identification (Abalakina Paap, Stephan, Craig, & Gregory, 1999; Kramer & Gavrieli, 2005).",1,5
10.1016/j.jesp.2015.11.005,"It appears that the effect is largely dependent on causal attribution processes, and whereas negative outcomes seem to trigger causality appraisals by default, this is not (or less) the case for positive outcomes. However, by making the causal structure of the scenarios salient to our participants, an action–omission effect could be obtained for positive outcomes as well. Interestingly, no matter the outcome condition, the action–omission effectwas increased by explicitly reminding participants of the causal structure of the scenarios, though this increase was rather small in the negative outcome conditions compared to the positive outcome conditions.",0,6
10.1016/j.jesp.2016.01.014,"For example, people tend to make more global dispositional attributions to explain positive outcomes of their actions, but more situational and context-specific attributions for negative outcomes. This bias is largely based on one's motivation to view the self in a more positive light (for reviews, see Campbell & Sedikides, 1999; Mezulis, Abramson, Hyde, & Hankin, 2004). Similar to this self-serving bias, people may be motivated to generalize favorable aspects of their ingroups and negative aspects of their outgroups (Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, & Semin, 1989).",0,10

10.1016/j.jesp.2014.09.010,"We examined whether self-esteem was reliably influenced by multiple nonverbal cues encountered across different faces over time. We focused here on the well-studied combination of eye-gaze and facialemotion (cf. Adams, Franklin, Nelson, & Stevenson, 2010). In each of two studies, participants completed self-esteemmeasures after viewing a series of faces that varied—on a between-subjects basis—with respect to emotion expression and eye gaze. We expected exposure to negative (versus positive) facial emotion to reduce perceivers' self-esteem but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze (i.e., were “looking at” perceivers).",0,10

Additionally, the literature suggests that rightist ideology is associated with over-active fear responses and needs for certainty and security precisely because it functions to reduce fear and answer these needs (Jost et al., 2009). It follows that rightist ideology, in answering these needs, regulates the effects of fear by providing clear guidelines on how to react to ideologically-relevant threats—a notion supported by findings on ideological differences in the impact of emotions on policy support (Pliskin, Bar-Tal, Sheppes, & Halperin, 2014).",0,1

Whereas unexpected stimuli might affect participants' blame judgments to an equal degree, on a process level these cues should not be associated with schematic biases such as hypervigilance or ease of processing. Consequently, we assume that schematic processing is highly dependent on participants' expectations.",0,1
10.1016/j.jesp.2012.02.002,"Similarly, mental contrasting should not produce cognitive dissonance that is reduced by effort justification (i.e., facing obstacles is effortful and this effort needs to be justified by increasing one's commitment to realize the desired future). In line with this argument, mental contrasting is observed to foster goal pursuit when minor obstacles are considered (i.e., expectations of success are high), but to lower goal pursuit when major obstacles are considered (i.e., when expectations of success are low).",0,9

10.1016/j.jesp.2010.11.006,"Finally, Förster (2009; Experiments 8, 9) demonstrated that both power and regulatory focus map onto the differentiation processes induced by processing styles: low-power and prevention focus participants generated more dissimilarities than similarities, whereas high-power or promotion focus participants generated more similarities. Taken together, these findings suggest that prevention focus and low power narrow conceptual and perceptual scope, leading to a detailed and concrete processing. Empathic concern requires selfother differentiation and consists of ‘zooming in’ on concrete otheroriented feelings of warmth and compassion (i.e., feelings different from those of the other).",0,5

In short, social perception is at its root person perception, and person perception appears to place special weight on moral traits.

10.1016/j.jesp.2009.12.016,"Perhaps the most striking finding of the current work is that such a subtle cue—irises shifted only millimeters to the left or right—was enough to eliminate the otherwise robust and highly replicable CRE in memory. It is plausible that early categorization of a face gates the perceptual processes devoted to it, thereby resulting in direct-gaze facilitating an exclusive process of individuation for own-race faces. This finding is consistent with recent work on race perception (e.g., MacLin & MacLin, in press) suggesting that early racial categorization of faces influences not just the level of processing but the type of processing engaged.",0,10
10.1016/j.jesp.2010.02.004,"Because norm-violations without a salient explanation create negative affect (McGraw, 1987), people in an explanatory vacuum should be highly motivated to interpret and justify their behavior (Stone & Cooper, 2001). Stapel and Koomen have found that when people are extramotivated to explain an ambiguous behavior, they will apply accessible information ‘‘more readily and more extensively” (2001, p. 916). We hypothesize that individuals in an explanatory vacuum are extramotivated to interpret their behavior, and will therefore use accessible goal information readily and extensively, settling for explanations that will merely suffice.",0,9
10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.006,"The third aspect which is crucial in studying the process of negotiations is behavior itself. Decisions of appropriateness (or schemas) drive norms and behavior (Messick, 1999). Different behaviors in the same situation might result because of different judgments about what is appropriate behavior. However, the existence of norms does not always mean that people also behave in accord with these norms (e.g. Harms & Skyrms, 2008). Allocators might only care about norms because of self-presentation effects, wanting others to think they have obeyed the norm in order to maximize their own outcome.",0,6

Therefore, attractiveness judgments of split-faces should rely more on features, which represent sexually-dimorphic information, thereby enhancing sexual face preference judgments. Thus, from a dual-route framework, we hypothesized that split-half faces should change the pattern of processing for mate-relevant stimuli by disrupting holistic processing that is critical to aesthetic preference while enhancing sexual preference derived from masculine features.",0,10

In the case of nondurable goods, the consumption of an aesthetically appealing product involves damaging its product design, and by extension, destroying the effort originally invested in making the product beautiful.

Furthermore, we conceptualize that when food items are laterally displayed in a manner congruent (vs. incongruent) with consumers’ natural mental representation, it enhances the likelihood of choosing healthier options. To elaborate, we propose that consumers experience greater self-control when healthy/unhealthy items are displayed in a manner congruent with their natural mental representation.

Thus we predict that due to the green- feminine association and its effect on social judgments and self-perception, men will be more likely than women to avoid green products and behaviors, particularly when their masculinity is threatened.",1,4

Indeed, relational events are expressions of the underlying tendencies governing communication (Poole, 2012) and should thus recursively shape and be shaped by individuals' psychological states. In the case of a centralized tendency, a person will increasingly display a propensity to communicate with one individual.",1,2

First, trust can be transferred through indirect communication (i.e., hearing or overhearing third-party gossip; Burt & Knez, 1996). For example, a client team member may learn about boundary spanners’ competent, helpful work or their discretion with sensitive matters, and this reputation may enhance their trust in those boundary spanners (Ferrin et al., 2006).

10.1037/a0036036,"Free recall may be subject to list-strength and output order effects (e.g., Shiffrin, Ratcliff, & Clark, 1990), which confounds poor memory for more weakly remembered items with output order effects. For example, recall of P2 may suffer because P1s are remembered better and are output first. P2s are recalled after learners output P1s and this artificially increases the retention interval for P2s, which may mask the mnemonic benefits that P2s receive from remindings. Further, recall of one item may cause learners to strategically recall associates of that item (Howard & Kahana, 2002).",1,10

Second, for social exchange relationships to be sustained, parties always reciprocate to their partners with resources “in kind” (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005); that is, recipients of i-deals should reciprocate to employers with resources of equivalent value or similar nature (Zhang & Epley, 2009). By giving employees i-deals, organizations hope to “unfreeze” rigid behavior patterns so that employees will contribute more fully to their firms.",0,6
10.1177/0149206312453738,"Perceptions of complementary fit reflect a cognitive assessment about whether the team possesses the appropriate KSAs to complete the task. The underlying psychological mechanism is one of need-fulfillment (Kristof-Brown & Guay, 2011; Murray, 1951), in which the team views itself as possessing the requisite skills and expertise. When this occurs, transactive memory systems (TMS) are likely to emerge. Transactive memory, a construct first proposed by Wegner (1987), refers to “memory that is influenced by knowledge about the memory system of another person” through which “two or more people cooperatively store, retrieve, and communicate information” (Lewis, 2003: 588).",1,4
10.1177/0149206311424318,"Third, managerial racial diversity should also positively relate to competitive intensity because it helps organizations from falling into competence traps. A potential pitfall for managerial teams is that they are subject to an overreliance on the distinctive capabilities that led to their initial success. They become specialized in a narrow market or technology domain and less able to recognize information outside their specific competences (Levinthal & March, 1993). These consistent patterns of behavior may allow competitors to more easily emulate their success and may also result in missed opportunities for competitive actions.",0,2

It is through the combination and application of this knowledge that the managerial unit can effectively deploy individual human capital resources. Applying the appropriate knowledge at the appropriate time is a function of experience (Shamsie & Mannor, 2013), and prior research has shown that manager ability to deploy resources within the appropriate context can relate positively to performance outcomes (Sirmon, Gove, & Hitt, 2008).",0,2

Alternatively, he or she may not report harassment in order to prevent damaging social relationships or hurting the company’s image. Obviously, an individual can have multiple goals that conflict.
