4,"forgetting is as important a function as recollecting” (p. 679). Memories become irrelevant and outdated, and without some means of forgetting or setting aside such memories, learning and accessing new and relevant memories would become steadily more difficult. One way in which it appears that this form of goal-directed forgetting is accomplished is through retrieval inhibition (e.g., E. L. Bjork, Bjork, & Anderson, 1998; R. A. Bjork, 1989) or the executive control processes of inhibition (Anderson, 2003). As proposed by these researchers, in searching for a particular item in memory, other items that are related, but incorrect, can vie for",1.0,6.0
8,"(e.g., Spaniol & Bayen, 2002). Specifically, when participants fail to recollect source-identifying information about a test item, they guess a source by responding in a way that matches their sense of the likelihood or probability that the test item is associated with a particular source (e.g., “I can’t remember who presented this item, but I know that Jane’s a doctor. Therefore, she likely presented this doctor-like sentence”), thus producing stereotype-biased performance (Spaniol & Bayen, 2002; see Dodson & Johnson, 1996, for a related view). Researchers within social psychology have reached similar conclusions about the influence of stereotypes and expectations on",1.0,8.0
11,"validated featurebased semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.

28,"word increases as the levels of activation of nontarget words increase. The primary source of empirical evidence cited in support of lexical selection by competition is the semantic interfer- ence effect (e.g., Lupker, 1979; Rosinski, 1977): Naming a picture of an object (e.g., CAR) is slower in the context of a semantic category coordinate distractor word (e.g., truck) compared to an unrelated distractor word (e.g., table). The explanation of the semantic interference effect in terms of lexical selection by competition assumes that semantic category coordinate distractors lead to more highly activated lexical representations than do unrelated distractors.1 Recently, the assumption",0.0,4.0

Unfortunately, this belief is not a feature of all close relationships. Instead, in some relationships, people chronically doubt that their partners value, accept, and care for them. This is the case even when these doubts are not reflected in the partner’s actual thoughts and affections; many people seem to underestimate a close partner’s acceptance of and regard for the self (Murray, Holmes, Griffin, Bellavia, &",0.0,1.0

84,"resolve these contradictory findings on information search after decision making. In short, we propose that differences due to available information quantity as well as associated different selection criteria as underlying psychological processes moderate whether decision makers prefer decisionconsistent or decision-inconsistent information. Selective-Exposure Research A great deal of empirical research on selective exposure to information has been conducted in the context of dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957, 1964; Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001; see also D’Alessio & Allen, 2002).

If one estimate represents the best information available to the person, as common intuition suggests, then a second guess will simply add noise, and averaging the two will only decrease accuracy. Researchers have previously assumed this view and focused on improving the best estimate (Hirt & Markman, 1995; Mussweiler, Strack, & Pfeiffer, 2000; Stewart, 2001). Alternatively, initial estimates may represent samples drawn from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministic best guesses. According to this account, the average of two estimates from one person will be more accurate than a single estimate, so long as the noise contained in",1.0,6.0
122,"focus of attention was far removed from the distractors. We found that selective processing of the targets improved in Experiments 2 and 3 relative to Experiment 1, to the extent that in Experiments 2 and 3, participants performed at chance level when asked to localize a single missing distractor. In contrast, we found in all experiments that participants could accurately localize the distractor centroid, even when individual distractors were localized at chance levels. This finding suggests that the cost of withdrawing attention from distractors can be compensated for by pooling together noisy local signals and computing summary statistics.",1.0,5.0

In addition, there are reports of superior detection of modern threatening stimuli (e.g., syringes, guns, and knives; Blanchette, 2006; Brosch & Sharma, 2005). Furthermore, in some of these studies, results varied with the number of distractors, contrary to the analysis offered by Öhman et al. All of these visual search results and claims are based on adult participants, who presumably have extensive knowledge about snakes and various kinds and degrees of experience with them (Rachman, 2002).

For instance, branches and clouds are typically overhead, whereas roots and puddles are typically underfoot. Indeed, object words are judged faster when presented on a computer screen in the objects’ canonical locations (Zwaan & Yaxley, 2003). For instance, eagle is judged faster when presented at the top rather than the bottom of a display, whereas snake is judged faster at the bottom (Šetić & Domijan, 2007).
