2,"as words appears to be straightforward, the results have been mixed, largely because much of the evidence to date has been obtained by using the lexical decision task—a task influenced by lexicality and familiarity (Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Bodner & Masson, 1997; Bowers, 1994; Feustel, Shiffrin, & Salasoo, 1983; Forster, 1998). Similarly, demonstrations of reliable masked repetition priming for nonwords in the naming task (Masson & Isaak, 1999) may simply reflect facilitation of articulatory processes (Forster, 1998). Repetition blindness paradigms (RB; Kanwisher, 1987) offer another opportunity to investigate the role of lexical and sublexical representations in short-term repetition effects. When",1.0,10.0

Equivalent directed forgetting was observed for strong and weak items when strengthening operations increased item strength without affecting the context strength (Experiments 1 and 2). These results supported the context hypothesis of directed forgetting (L. Sahakyan & C. M. Kelley, 2002).

This kind of divergence is especially common for tests of racial attitudes and stereotypes. But what exactly does it mean when a person reports one attitude yet scores differently on an implicit test of race bias? The answer to that question is controversial, but it is important. It will shape not only theories of attitudes and stereotypes, but also the way that men and women taking the tests understand",1.0,5.0

Thus, Kahneman’s (2000; see also Kahneman & Frederick, 2002) conjecture that these less transparent designs would reduce the observed relationships between cognitive ability and the judgmental biases mentioned above remains virtually untested. In the present experiments, we examined a variety of effects from the heuristics and biases literature to see if cognitive ability was associated with these biases as they are displayed in betweensubjects paradigms. In the first experiment, we examined some biases and effects that are among the oldest in the literature (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972, 1973; Tversky",1.0,2.0

Similarly, electoral success is based on voters’ impressions of candidates, which are also responsible for which candidates are elected. In the current study, we examined the relation between a subjective predictor and an objective performance outcome: Are impressions of chief executive officers (CEOs) related to the performance of their companies?

Sherman and McConnell (1995) noted that, by deliberately creating obstacles to success, the selfhandicapping strategy appears to increase the likelihood that upward counterfactuals will be generated. Self-handicaps are likely to be the focus of counterfactual explanations for a poor performance because they represent an “abnormal” condition (Kahneman & Miller, 1986).

We asked whether language can play a role in forming or maintaining such conjunctions in young children, who have underdeveloped control of attention and for whom language may therefore play an especially crucial role. Evidence suggests that in adults, attention is required to form and maintain feature conjunctions.

Our results suggest that a decision process is not necessarily completed in the brain’s cognitive subsystems before it is shared with other subsystems, as has been traditionally assumed. Rather, simultaneous ‘‘pull’’ frommultiple response alternatives seems to influence the execution of movement itself. This finding suggests that a dynamic approach to mental processing—an approach that has already provided descriptions of perception, attention, and categorization (e.g., Abrams &Balota, 1991; Gold & Shadlen, 2000; Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Eriksen, &Donchin, 1988; Hovland & Sears, 1938; McClelland & Rogers, 2003; Spivey, 2007; Tipper, Howard, & Houghton, 1999)—may",1.0,10.0

In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the ERN may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors. We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors. Thus, response errors prime defensive motivation—and the ERN predicts individual differences in the aversive response to errors. Research on error processing has grown over the past 15",1.0,9.0

However wise the maxim sounds, it may not even be clear what it means for people to want what they have as opposed to have what they want. Fortunately, probability theory clarifies what it means for people to want what they have and have what they want, and it provides a framework for measuring these variables. Let us first quantify the extent to which people want what they have. LetHave represent the set of material items that an individual has (e.g., bed, stereo, car; see the shaded area in Fig.",1.0,8.0

Brainerd and Reyna’s fuzzy-trace theory, for example, distinguishes between gist memory (memory for the general meaning of informational inputs) and verbatim memory (more exact representation of the specific content of informational inputs; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995). According to this theory, verbatim memory is forgotten and becomes inaccessible quickly, leaving people to rely on gist memory (Clark & Clark,",1.0,7.0

The inclusion of the horizontal trials was not theoretically motivated, but rather allowed us to systematically control for individual differences in speed, which are quite pronounced on nearly any choice reaction time task (Jensen, 1998; Robinson & Oishi, 2006). In our second study, we also administered a spatial attention task in which the location of the spatial probes was perfectly predictable because they alternated between an upper position and a lower position (in",0.0,2.0
