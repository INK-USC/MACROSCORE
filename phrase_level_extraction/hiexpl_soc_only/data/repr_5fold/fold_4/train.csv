161,"found for non-threat-relevant animals (e.g., bears, dogs, and kittens; Tipples et al., 2002). In addition, there are reports of superior detection of modern threatening stimuli (e.g., syringes, guns, and knives; Blanchette, 2006; Brosch & Sharma, 2005). Furthermore, in some of these studies, results varied with the number of distractors, contrary to the analysis offered by Öhman et al. All of these visual search results and claims are based on adult participants, who presumably have extensive knowledge about snakes and various kinds and degrees of experience with them (Rachman, 2002). However, if humans have an evolved ability to detect threat-relevant stimuli",1.0,3.0
167,"and hence have no particular spatial connotation. Other objects, however, typically occur in particular locations. For instance, branches and clouds are typically overhead, whereas roots and puddles are typically underfoot. Indeed, object words are judged faster when presented on a computer screen in the objects’ canonical locations (Zwaan & Yaxley, 2003). For instance, eagle is judged faster when presented at the top rather than the bottom of a display, whereas snake is judged faster at the bottom (Šetić & Domijan, 2007). Given that many object words encode spatial associations, we hypothesized that an object word directs attention toward the location",1.0,3.0
