On the basis of these results, it has been argued that both ordinal and temporal information are encoded, with these different sources of information being differentially weighted when retrieving items (Lewandowsky et al., in press). What is clear is that temporal information does not solely drive the sequencing of information in short-term order memory",1.0,6.0

Accuracy to report the presence or absence of a change at different memory loads is used to estimate VWM capacity (Pashler, 1988; Phillips, 1974). There are reasons why the whole-report procedure has been standard practice in VWM studies. First, revising the procedure into a partial-report procedure has not revealed a consistent advantage. For example, if a single test probe is shown, accuracy can sometimes be worse",1.0,3.0

Integrating TMT and attachment theory, Mikulincer and colleagues (2003, 2004) have argued that people pursue close relationships because they provide protection against existential concerns through a basic emotional attachment mechanism (Bowlby, 1982), as well as by providing self-esteem and validation of one’s cultural beliefs. A considerable body of evidence supports this analysis. For example, reminders of death lead people to initiate interactions with other people (Taubman-Ben-Ari, Findler, & Mikulincer, 2002), heighten feelings",0.0,10.0

According to self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), behaviors motivated by purely extrinsic reasons are implemented only under external pressures. Thus, extrinsic behaviors are not internalized and tend to be inconsistent across situations. As an individual begins to adopt an intrinsic motivation for the same behavior, their behavior becomes motivated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic motives. This dual-motive state is charac- terized by having a behavioral intention that is held consciously and implemented in highly deliberative",0.0,6.0

For example, Jackman (1994) has suggested that ascribing favorable and flattering, but clearly stereotypical, traits to women reduces resistance to gender-based role divisions (also see Hoffman & Hurst, 1990) by subtly implying that women are well suited to the roles they have traditionally occupied, and that stereotypically feminine traits are valued by society (also see Jost & Kay, 2005). Elaborating on this idea, Glick and Fiske (1996) developed a measure of such stereotypes and demonstrated, across 19 countries, that the tendency to engage in this form of ‘‘benevolent sexism’’",0.0,1.0

The sense of motion must be inferred from prior knowledge; there is, of course, no physical motion in the photograph. Such stimuli would appear to have little in common with the drifting dots and gratings commonly used to study neural mechanisms of motion processing, other than the fact that the observer knows that both types of stimuli depict motion in some sense. In the study reported here, we investigated how the sense of motion",1.0,2.0

Subsequently, participants were given a computer-based mental-arithmetic task (von Hippel, Lakin, & Shakarchi, 2005) in which they were asked to calculate the answers to 20 problems (e.g., 11 81 18 121 19 71 17 21 8 45 ?), presented individually.

In this study, participants either pointed to or grasped a target defined by a conjunction of its orientation and color. Saccades to distractors having the same orientation as the target were more likely when a grasping response was made than when a pointing response was made. This suggests that contrasting actions can differentially weight visual information, with orientation being weighted more strongly for selection when a grasping rather than a pointing response is required (see also Hannus, Cornelissen, Lindemann, & Bekkering, 2005).
