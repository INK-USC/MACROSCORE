1,"effects were obtained when both pictures were named. When pictures with superimposed distractor words were named or the words were read in Experiment 3, the words influenced the latencies of gaze shifting and picture naming, but the pictures yielded no such latency effects in word reading. The picture–word asymmetry was obtained even with equivalent reading and naming latencies. The picture–picture effects suggest that activation spreads continuously from concepts to phonological forms, whereas the picture–word asymmetry indicates that the amount of activation is limited and task dependent.

6,"The authors’ simulations suggest, contrary to previous interpretations, that these results are consistent with a single-system account. Keywords: fluency, repetition priming, recognition, computational model The question of whether repetition priming and recognition are mediated by independent or related memory processes has received much attention and has played a key role in the development of theories of the organization of memory. Repetition priming is the term used to refer to a change in identification, detection, or production of an item (e.g., a word) as a result of prior exposure to the same or a similar item, whereas recognition memory typically refers",1.0,9.0

These patterns appear within the model without the need to assume a change in encoding or rehearsal strategy or the deployment of a different storage buffer. The implications of these results and the wider applicability of the distributionmodeling approach are discussed.

15,"a reanalysis of data from Jacoby, Lindsay, and Hessels (2003). We then report new experiments from our own laboratory whose results are consistent with the contingency hypothesis of Schmidt et al. but are very problematic for the long-standing modulation hypothesis. Possible mechanisms by which participants use contingency information to control responding are considered, and one of them is tested. Both the response time and error data are consistent with this proposed mechanism. We suggest that the modulation account of the proportion congruency effect, dominant for over 20 years, has run its course. Instead, we argue that the data are better",1.0,4.0

Then, we report results from two relational priming experiments in which pairs of word primes that were semantically aligned and misaligned with addition modulated automatic activation of addition facts. In the General Discussion section, we suggest that the semantic and the arithmetic memory networks do not just share analogous representations of interrelated concepts but are actually coordinated with each other via analogous semantic and arithmetic relations.

29,"correlations in multidimensional sequences (possibly another form of VSL) may in turn help define what counts as an object. Keywords: statistical learning, feature binding, objects, feature dimensions Visual perception is remarkable in at least two ways. First, it serves to make us aware of a highly coherent and structured world, despite noisy fragmented input. Second, it provides such experiences without any hint of the underlying computational complexity involved in their construction. In fact, recent work has demonstrated that perception is supported by surprisingly subtle types of visual associative learning. One type of learning—visual statistical learning—may be particularly important in this",1.0,8.0

Furthermore, there is some evidence that older adults experience more complex emotional experiences. For example, among the young–old, written descriptions of emotion are more complex (Labouvie-Vief, DeVoe, & Bulka, 1989), and positive and negative emotions co-occur more frequently (Carstensen et al., 2000; Ong & Bergeman, 2004).

68,"as well as the role of society and culture in shaping this magical belief are discussed. Keywords: tempt fate, magical thinking, accessibility, negativity It is an irony of the post-Enlightenment world that so many people who don’t believe in fate refuse to tempt it. Why are people afraid to comment on a streak of success if they reject the notion that the universe punishes such modest acts of hubris (Ferm, 1989; Will, 2002)? Why do people feel that if they exchange a lottery ticket it will become more likely to win, even when they cannot cite any conceivable mechanism by",0.0,8.0

They also overlook or excuse their partner’s transgressions, risking the chance of similar misdeeds and hurts in the future (Rusbult, Verette, Whitney, Slovik, & Lipkus, 1991). To effectively negotiate interpersonal life, people need a regulatory system in place to balance the tension between connectedness and self-protection goals (Murray et al., 2006). This article presents one correlational and eight experimental studies illustrating how this risk regulation system operates in romantic relationships for people who are differentially sensitive to rejection— specifically, people relatively low versus high in self-esteem (Leary",0.0,10.0
107,"Hayes & Broadbent, 1988). Therefore, researchers assumed it was not influenced by an individual’s goals (cf. Lewicki, Hill, & Czyzewska, 1992). Recent evidence, however, suggests that selective attentionmay play a role in implicit learning (Jiang&Chun, 2003; Jiménez & Méndez, 1999; Turk-Browne, Junge, & Scholl, 2005). These findings, together with the conjecture that attention is influenced by goal-driven prioritization of information processing (e.g., Eriksen & Hoffman, 1972; Posner, 1980), suggest to us that implicit learning could be affected by the organism’s NCGPs. We hypothesized that NCGP can enhance implicit learning and conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. In both, we",1.0,5.0

For instance, D’Argembeau and van der Linden (2004) and Szpunar and McDermott (in press) demonstrated that temporally close events in either the past or the future had more detailed representations than temporally distant events. Moreover, Szpunar and McDermott found that increased familiarity of the event context increased the amount of detail in representations of past and future events. It has also been shown that individual differences in imagery ability and emotion regulation influence the",1.0,4.0
146,"Consider in this context the two noun-phrase examples given earlier. If word order constrains phonological activation, then the canonical word order will initially lead to greater activation of adjective than noun phonology in English, and the opposite pattern in French. Navarrete and Costa (2006) extended the evidence in support of a cascading flow of activation to the situation in which an adjective and a noun are active concurrently. In their study, Spanish participants named the color of colored objects faster when the phonological onsets of the color and object names were congruent (e.g., vela verde, ‘‘green candle’’) than when they",1.0,4.0

Haidt and colleagues (e.g., Haidt & Joseph, 2008) have proposed that the notion of purity constitutes a basic moral intuition that developed from the need to safeguard oneself from potentially harmful substances. According to this approach, disgust evolved as an emotion to protect the body from germs, parasites, and spoilt food, but it was then extended to social and moral domains (Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000). As a consequence, people often report finding immoral acts disgusting. Indeed, similar neural structures appear to be involved in",0.0,3.0

Such conflict-adaptation effects suggest that response conflicts induce enhanced target processing, distractor suppression, or both on the following trial (but see Mayr, Awh, & Laurey, 2003). According to the conflict-monitoring theory proposed by Botvinick et al. (2001), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the medial frontal lobe monitors response conflicts and signals the demand for increased control to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is thought to support active maintenance of goal representations and top-down modulation of lower-level processing modules (Miller & Cohen, 2001; Ridderinkhof, Ullsperger, Crone, & Nieuwenhuis, 2004).
