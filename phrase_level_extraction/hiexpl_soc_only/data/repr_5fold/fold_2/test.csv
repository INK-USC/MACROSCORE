Participants had to indicate whether the 2 digits were physically the same. The results again showed evidence for the automatic processing of numerical magnitude for pairs in different notations. Findings of both experiments suggest that numbers in different notations are automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in line with M. McCloskey’s (1992) abstract representation model.

The pathway control hypothesis makes a number of straightforward predictions in the context of DRC. Namely, the nonlexical pathway will be emphasized when nonwords are read aloud because it is required to generate a correct pronunciation for items not represented in the orthographic and phonological lexicons. Similarly, the lexical pathway will be emphasized when exception words are read aloud because it is required to generate a correct pronunciation for words that do not follow the model’s grapheme– phoneme conversion rules.",1.0,4.0
36,"to be debated is, What is the nature of these constraints? More specifically, can these constraints be encompassed within a general theory of associative learning, or are they specific enough to suggest that learning adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies constitutes radically different forms of learning? An Overview of Earlier Studies In an initial attempt to address the questions outlined above, Gómez (2002) showed that, in a situation where the successive AXC units were perceptually distinct, the degree to which the A_C relationships were learned depended on the variability of the middle element (X). More precisely, participants were presented with 2, 6,",1.0,10.0

Thus, elaboration may have been an important part of the effectiveness of value anchoring in creating strong beliefs. An elaboration component also seems plausible in accounting for the Ostrom and Brock (1969) attitude resistance effects. Although they discussed involvement as resulting from direct cognitive links between values and attitudes per se, they randomly assigned various values to be linked to passages from the persuasive message. Thus, the messages were not at all framed as the attitude supporting, expressing, or even relying on the",1.0,4.0

In line with this reasoning, Carlsmith and Gross (1969) reported that participants who delivered an electric shock to a confederate tended to offer more help to the confederate following the experiment than those who did not deliver the shock. This behavior may be interpreted as a reaction by perpetrators aimed at balancing the impairment to their resource of love (Foa & Foa, 1980).

Men consistently rate female targets as intending to convey a greater degree of sexual interest than do women who rate the same targets—a finding that has been remarkably consistent across studies ranging from those using still photographs and video vignettes to those using live, unscripted interactions (e.g., Abbey, 1982; Abbey & Melby, 1986; Shotland & Craig, 1988). This gender difference in ratings of sexual intent is stable, is readily replicable, and has a medium effect size (Farris et al., 2008). The effect is not confined to",1.0,8.0

Agents who received an information packet that included a higher list price estimated a higher appraisal value. Northcraft and Neale proposed that the agents started the judgment process by rejecting the list price as an accurate estimate and then adjusted downward until they reached a plausible estimate. Adjustments tend to be insufficient, so the final appraisal values were biased in the direction of the initial anchor value. Two fundamental questions concerning numerical",1.0,1.0

The aim of the current study was not to compare the adaptive value of the two reasoning systems, but to examine a potential asymmetry in the demands that they exert.

Drawing on this research, the present work employed a common test of attentional bias known as the dot-probe detection paradigm (MacLeod et al., 1986) to examine attentional biases to Black, relative to White, faces (see also Eberhardt, Goff, Purdie, & Davies, 2004). In this paradigm, the participant’s task is to detect the location of a probe, such as a small dot, that is initially hidden from view behind one of two stimuli",0.0,5.0

The purpose of the present research was to test the true mettle of survival-based processing by pitting the survival scenario against a set of encoding procedures that are universally accepted as producing excellent retention. Memory theorists generally dismiss the notion that one kind of encoding task is inherently better than another, because the nature of the retrieval environment needs",1.0,5.0
