In the experiment, a research group in the local Department of Education randomly assigned students’ seats with input from the authors. The assignment procedure involved first nonrandomly assigning a small number of students and then randomly assigning the remaining students to the remaining seats. The data for this study consist of three rounds of test scores and two rounds of surveys for students of grade 7 in fall 2009. The baseline test and baseline survey were administrated during the first week of the semester before random seat assignment. Given the within-block randomization of seats, the authors estimate the main effects of peers by regressing the mean standardized midterm and final scores for a student in a given block and class on the gender of the desk mate and surrounding neighbors, as well as all of the focal student's baseline characteristics (gender, baseline test score, height, age, birth order, mother’s and father’s education, and interest in Chinese, math, and English), an indicator for whether the focal student's desk mate is a favored student, and the share of favored students among the focal student's neighboring peers, along with block fixed effects. Statistical inference is performed using exact permutation tests. In the model selected as evidence for the SCORE program (Table 5, Panel B, Column 1), the model is estimated on the sample of female students and the effect of the desk mate and neighbor 4 students are combined.",0,4
