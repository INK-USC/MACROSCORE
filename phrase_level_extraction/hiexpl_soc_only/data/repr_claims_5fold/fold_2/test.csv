10.1086/671137,"...To allow more explicitly for potential forgetting, the authors estimate a specification that allows for knowledge depreciation over time. Specifically, they assume that experience is accumulated according to a perpetual-inventory process: E_t = delta(E_t-1 + q_t-1). Experience at the beginning of period t is a fraction 'delta' of the sum of two components: the experience at the start of the prior period and production in the prior period, q_t-1 . Thus delta parameterizes forgetting or, more precisely, retention. Nonlinear least squares estimates of the forgetting model are in column 3 of both panels. The weekly data is selected.",1,8

The coefficient for the interaction between managerial racial diversity and munificence in predicting competitive intensity (Table 2, Models 3) is positive and statistically significant (b = .49, se = 0.21, p < .05), providing support for Hypothesis 3. The form of the interaction is shown in Figure 2. ",0,2
