Past research suggests that weighting bias influences initial evaluative appraisals, which only affect downstream judgments and behaviors when people lack the opportunity or motivation to override those initial appraisals and engage instead in more extensive deliberation (Rocklage & Fazio, 2014).",0,4
10.1016/j.jesp.2016.01.014,"For example, people tend to make more global dispositional attributions to explain positive outcomes of their actions, but more situational and context-specific attributions for negative outcomes. This bias is largely based on one's motivation to view the self in a more positive light (for reviews, see Campbell & Sedikides, 1999; Mezulis, Abramson, Hyde, & Hankin, 2004). Similar to this self-serving bias, people may be motivated to generalize favorable aspects of their ingroups and negative aspects of their outgroups (Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, & Semin, 1989).",0,10

10.1016/j.jesp.2009.12.016,"Perhaps the most striking finding of the current work is that such a subtle cue—irises shifted only millimeters to the left or right—was enough to eliminate the otherwise robust and highly replicable CRE in memory. It is plausible that early categorization of a face gates the perceptual processes devoted to it, thereby resulting in direct-gaze facilitating an exclusive process of individuation for own-race faces. This finding is consistent with recent work on race perception (e.g., MacLin & MacLin, in press) suggesting that early racial categorization of faces influences not just the level of processing but the type of processing engaged.",0,10

Participants were given one of two experiences of going against the flow before they received the product preference task used in experiment 4a.

In this case, regardless of the quantity of units/servings present within a package, the total supply—across all packages—will be incorporated into subsequent product judgments because it is called to attention. Here, all of the unconsumed units/servings are now top of mind, likely diminishing the experience of consumption closure for those consuming from a single-serve package.",0,10

Under these circumstances, the added capacity of the larger dinnerware is immaterial. The increased size, however, does help induce a serving bias that unknowingly stimulates people to serve more than they otherwise would have. Just as nutrition gatekeepers (Wansink 2003) can use the size of dinnerware to help manage how much those in their care eat, dieters can use a similar strategy on themselves.",0,8

At the agency level, policies may place offenders with mental disorder on intensive supervision caseloads. When not paired with additional services, high levels of supervision are associated with high rates of rearrest and technical violations because officers discover minor illegal activity they would not have under normal supervision (Petersilia & Turner, 1993). However, it is ultimately the officer who determines how to respond to infractions (Eno Louden, Skeem, Camp, & Christensen, 2008).",1,7

Overall, evaluators (usually three per case) agreed unanimously about defendants’ legal sanity in only 55% of cases. Evaluators clearly disagreed in at least 35% of cases. The remaining cases involved one evaluator disagreeing about whether an opinion could be offered when the other two agreed (6%), or multiple evaluators disagreeing about whether an opinion could be offered (4%).",0,2

10.1037/apl0000260,"Organizations may try to stimulate the sense of power of lower-ranked organization members (as long as fair procedures can be ensured at the same time). One way to do this is suggested by research showing that individuals who focus more on the positive, rewarding aspects of themselves and their relationships have—regardless of their structural power—a higher sense of power than those who attend to more negative aspects of their relationships (Anderson et al., 2012). Hence, managers may focus on such individual differences in the recruitment and selection stages.",0,4

Specifically, if a team was constantly aware of the fact that its members’ jobs were tenuous at best (i.e., high job insecurity), jokes in that context would likely take on a different meaning. Instead of facilitating team unity and performance, they may heighten awareness of organizational concerns relative to the economy, thus further distracting team members from task performance.",0,7

As the intangibility of service makes it difficult to control the customer experience, service orientation constitutes an internal control mechanism that enables customer contact employees to respond to this uncertainty.",0,2
10.1037/a0024844,"A growing line of research has demonstrated a predominantly negative association between process conflict and both proximal and distal group outcomes (e.g., Behfar, Mannix, Peterson, & Trochim, 2002; Greer & Jehn, 2007; Jehn et al., 2008; Matsuo, 2006; Passos & Caetano, 2005; Vodosek, 2007). The negative effects of process conflict on group outcomes are thought to occur because the issues at the heart of process conflicts, such as task delegation or role assignment, often carry personal connotations in terms of implied capabilities or respect within the group (cf. Jehn & Bendersky, 2003).",1,4

Over time, consumers gain a shared sense of belonging to the collective of brand admirers and how it differs from other collectives (Thompson et al. 2016).

Thus, Team Member A has to be confident about Team Member B's ability (i.e., he has the necessary skills) and benevolence (i.e., he would not intentionally do anything that would compromise A). Without trust, task completion would become very inefficient, because Member A would be inclined to closely monitor B (e.g., Langfred, 2004) and second‐guess his decisions (e.g., choice of fire hydrant).",0,9
10.1002/job.625,"Top-down interventions are typically tied to the introduction of new jobs, technology, or structural changes. They derive from the questionable belief that employers have substantial information and insight into worker needs (Hackman & Oldham, 1980; Roberts & Glick, 1981). Individual job crafting in turn is constrained by both limited worker discretion over job duties and incomplete knowledge of how jobs changes impact others (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001).

Recently reemployed individuals may discover that their new organizations are not what they perceived or expected and thus find themselves unsettled. A discrepancy in expectations (e.g., pay, job responsibility, and challenge) may preclude reemployed individuals from becoming attached and committed to their organizations, thereby diminishing their level of affective commitment (Feldman et al., 2002; Maynard et al., 2006).",0,5

10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.03.012,"Compared to traditional criminology theory that mainly focuses on promoting safety through legal penalties, the broken windows theory (Wilson & Kelling, 1982) emphasizes promoting safety by repairing “broken windows,” a metaphor for disorder or incivility (Skogan, 2012). The “broken windows,” or disorder, in a space decrease the stability of urban neighborhoods, indicate a lack of social control, deter investment in the neighborhood, and induce fear of crime (Skogan, 2012). Disorder can be both physical and social. Physical disorder includes “overt signs of negligence or unchecked decay as well as the visible consequences of malevolent misconduct” (Skogan, 2012, p. 175).",0,2

Though firms are not seen as deserving of sympathy like individuals, they are subjected to heavier scrutiny for excessive self-interest and harm toward others (Critcher & Dunning, 2011; Rai & Diermeier, 2015).

10.1037/xge0000388,"Despite all this evidence that activating experiential traces indeed activates related concepts, there is a remaining possibility that language use might account for concept-space mappings, such that conceptual cueing effects are driven by the frequent use of spatial terms with target concepts (e.g., God above; Goodhew, McGaw, & Kidd, 2014; Louwerse, 2008). Thus, participants may shift their attention upward upon processing God because they have frequently and systematically been exposed to the term in conjunction with above and up, such that this spatial information has become associated with the concept itself.",0,2

In this sense of option-based compatibility, a more (less) attractive option is more compatible with the selection (rejection) task. Thus, compatibility at the option level predicts that the more attractive options are preferred more and the less attractive options less in the selection than rejection task, regardless of whether that option is enriched or not.",0,2

Chieffinancial officer experience involves overseeing afirm’s treasury, tax, auditing, financial reporting, and investor relations (e.g., Favaro 2001).

It refers to a parental shift in scaffolding following the rule of providing less specific instructions and higher cognitive demand after a child's success and more specific instructions and lower cognitive demand after a child's failure (Wood & Middleton, 1975). For instance, a parent who is able to provide contingent scaffolding will use a more challenging question to promote his or her child's thinking when the child demonstrates a good understanding and provides a more manageable instruction when the child shows a poor understanding of the task.",1,4

In the first session, after completing a demographic questionnaire, participants were seated in front of the knot-board. A notebook computer was placed behind the knot-board (see Fig. 2). At the beginning of the experiment, participants were told (1) to learn the alias name of the knot, (2) to learn the exact wording of the pre-verbalization (in the verbalization-conditions), (3) to watch the video demonstration, and (4) to practice tying the knots until they were able to do it perfectly.",0,6

When one of the banks that the firm is borrowing from receives a negative liquidity shock, it cuts back lending by, say, $10 (the lending channel in the KM paper). However, the lending channel has no net effect on the firm because it can go to another, more liquid bank and borrow the loss of $10 (the firm substitution channel in the KM paper) since that bank willingly increases its credit limit.",1,4

According to this view, innovative activity can be conceptualized as a search process, by means of which organizations seek to introduce variation into their knowledge bases and internal routines. As such, innovative activity fuels the continuous renewal and reconfi guration of organizational resources. Innovative activity contributes to maintaining organizational fi tness in rapidly evolving environ ments, which increasingly characterize numerous public sectors (Walker 2008).",0,2

They become specialized in a narrow market or technology domain and less able to recognize information outside their specific competences (Levinthal & March, 1993). These consistent patterns of behavior may allow competitors to more easily emulate their success and may also result in missed opportunities for competitive actions.",0,2
