10.1016/j.jesp.2018.06.002,"This may explain why the government, the news media, and the public relish in seeing CEOs lambasted in court (e.g., The New York Times Editorial Board, 2016) and are often unwilling to let corporations off the hook until senior executives leave in disgrace (Thompson & 6 7 Liakos, 2015). Given people's desire to satisfy short-term desires over long-term goals (e.g., Baumeister, 2002) and that people punish for retributive reasons (Carlsmith et al., 2002), they may end up extracting suffering from a series of CEOs at the expense of dedicating the limited amount of resources to fixing the underlying problem.",0,4
10.1016/j.jesp.2017.11.013,"The experiment was conducted in the Social Immersion Lab in the Psychology Department at the University of St Andrews. Prior to the experiment it was confirmed that participants did not know each other in any way. Participants arrived at the lab at the same time and were given instructions before any social chatting could take place. Participants were given information forms describing the experiment and then asked to complete a consent form. As the minimal group paradigm, participants were told the cover story that the experiment was designed to study the link between cognitive style and social interaction.",0,8

In economic games similar to this (e.g., Dictator Game, Prisoner's Dilemma, Ultimatum Game; Balliet et al., 2014; Kramer & Brewer, 1984; Yamagishi &Mifune, 2008), individuals tend to demonstrate an ingroup bias whereby they allocate more resources to members of their own group than to the outgroup.",0,8
10.1016/j.jesp.2017.07.008,"In the case of political conspiracies, they also provide a means for engaging in protest against perceived abuses of governmental power. This protest allows a greater sense of personal empowerment against larger political-social forces (Bost & Prunier, 2013). For these reasons, conspiratorial thinking taps into a natural protection mechanism against potential threats. However, what constitutes a threat will also vary based on ideological motivations, which tend to be reinforced by, but not necessarily beholden to, one's racial, social, or political group identification (Abalakina Paap, Stephan, Craig, & Gregory, 1999; Kramer & Gavrieli, 2005).",1,5
10.1016/j.jesp.2015.11.005,"It appears that the effect is largely dependent on causal attribution processes, and whereas negative outcomes seem to trigger causality appraisals by default, this is not (or less) the case for positive outcomes. However, by making the causal structure of the scenarios salient to our participants, an action–omission effect could be obtained for positive outcomes as well. Interestingly, no matter the outcome condition, the action–omission effectwas increased by explicitly reminding participants of the causal structure of the scenarios, though this increase was rather small in the negative outcome conditions compared to the positive outcome conditions.",0,6
10.1016/j.jesp.2015.11.008,"Greater attitude certainty should increase the consistency between whichever reactions come to mind in a given instance (which as we mentioned, could happen for many reasons, independent of a person's degree of attitude certainty) and the overall evaluation of the target at that moment because those reactions seem especially valid (Briñol & Petty, 2009; Petty et al., 2007a).",0,8
10.1016/j.jesp.2014.09.010,"We examined whether self-esteem was reliably influenced by multiple nonverbal cues encountered across different faces over time. We focused here on the well-studied combination of eye-gaze and facialemotion (cf. Adams, Franklin, Nelson, & Stevenson, 2010). In each of two studies, participants completed self-esteemmeasures after viewing a series of faces that varied—on a between-subjects basis—with respect to emotion expression and eye gaze. We expected exposure to negative (versus positive) facial emotion to reduce perceivers' self-esteem but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze (i.e., were “looking at” perceivers).",0,10
10.1016/j.jesp.2015.04.001,"These firm beliefs should limit rightists' willingness to consider fleeing, even when experiencing fear. Additionally, the literature suggests that rightist ideology is associated with over-active fear responses and needs for certainty and security precisely because it functions to reduce fear and answer these needs (Jost et al., 2009). It follows that rightist ideology, in answering these needs, regulates the effects of fear by providing clear guidelines on how to react to ideologically-relevant threats—a notion supported by findings on ideological differences in the impact of emotions on policy support (Pliskin, Bar-Tal, Sheppes, & Halperin, 2014).",0,1
10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.013,"Businessmen are also told to control their emotions during negotiations, and one of the keys to successful business leadership is believed to be the ability to exercise this control (Williams, 2007). If thoughts about money dispose individuals to view their interactions with others as business-like relationships, and if the expression of emotion is considered inappropriate in these relationships, it seems likely that activating concepts ofmoneywill influencenot only people's own expressions of emotion but their expectations for others also.",0,8
10.1016/j.jesp.2011.12.005,"Schematic processing of such visual stimuli is, in our opinion, rather unlikely when participants are confronted with the visual stimuli prior to reading the case-related information or when the visual stimuli do not fit the narrative of the case, and could therefore not be expected. Whereas unexpected stimuli might affect participants' blame judgments to an equal degree, on a process level these cues should not be associated with schematic biases such as hypervigilance or ease of processing. Consequently, we assume that schematic processing is highly dependent on participants' expectations.",0,1
10.1016/j.jesp.2012.02.002,"Similarly, mental contrasting should not produce cognitive dissonance that is reduced by effort justification (i.e., facing obstacles is effortful and this effort needs to be justified by increasing one's commitment to realize the desired future). In line with this argument, mental contrasting is observed to foster goal pursuit when minor obstacles are considered (i.e., expectations of success are high), but to lower goal pursuit when major obstacles are considered (i.e., when expectations of success are low).",0,9

10.1016/j.jesp.2010.11.006,"Finally, Förster (2009; Experiments 8, 9) demonstrated that both power and regulatory focus map onto the differentiation processes induced by processing styles: low-power and prevention focus participants generated more dissimilarities than similarities, whereas high-power or promotion focus participants generated more similarities. Taken together, these findings suggest that prevention focus and low power narrow conceptual and perceptual scope, leading to a detailed and concrete processing. Empathic concern requires selfother differentiation and consists of ‘zooming in’ on concrete otheroriented feelings of warmth and compassion (i.e., feelings different from those of the other).",0,5
10.1016/j.jesp.2011.05.010,"Moreover, studies examining the component parts of warmth judgments find that traits related to the morality component (e.g., honesty, sincerity, and trustworthiness) are dominant in forming global impressions of others relative to other components of warmth (such as sociability; Brambilla, Rusconi, Sacchi, & Cherubini, 2011). In short, social perception is at its root person perception, and person perception appears to place special weight on moral traits. From a functional perspective, it makes sense that people would show a concern for moral character.",1,5
10.1016/j.jesp.2010.02.004,"Because norm-violations without a salient explanation create negative affect (McGraw, 1987), people in an explanatory vacuum should be highly motivated to interpret and justify their behavior (Stone & Cooper, 2001). Stapel and Koomen have found that when people are extramotivated to explain an ambiguous behavior, they will apply accessible information ‘‘more readily and more extensively” (2001, p. 916). We hypothesize that individuals in an explanatory vacuum are extramotivated to interpret their behavior, and will therefore use accessible goal information readily and extensively, settling for explanations that will merely suffice.",0,9
10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.006,"The third aspect which is crucial in studying the process of negotiations is behavior itself. Decisions of appropriateness (or schemas) drive norms and behavior (Messick, 1999). Different behaviors in the same situation might result because of different judgments about what is appropriate behavior. However, the existence of norms does not always mean that people also behave in accord with these norms (e.g. Harms & Skyrms, 2008). Allocators might only care about norms because of self-presentation effects, wanting others to think they have obeyed the norm in order to maximize their own outcome.",0,6
10.1016/j.jesp.2009.06.014,"The split-face paradigm disrupts holistic-based processing while enhancing feature-based processing in identity judgments (Le Grand et al., 2004). Therefore, attractiveness judgments of split-faces should rely more on features, which represent sexually-dimorphic information, thereby enhancing sexual face preference judgments. Thus, from a dual-route framework, we hypothesized that split-half faces should change the pattern of processing for mate-relevant stimuli by disrupting holistic processing that is critical to aesthetic preference while enhancing sexual preference derived from masculine features.",0,10
10.1016/j.jesp.2009.07.003,"For instance, although affect certainly plays a part in dissolution decisions, relationship researchers have argued that the final decision to end a romantic relationship is largely determined by a carefully reasoned decision process that considers the cost and rewards of staying versus leaving in terms of alternatives and barriers to the relationship (Edwards & Saunders, 1981; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959). However, affect associated with one’s partner (i.e., IPA) may influence the interpretation of ambiguous partner behaviors, which then influences relationship behaviors, and in turn relationship quality.",0,8

In the case of nondurable goods, the consumption of an aesthetically appealing product involves damaging its product design, and by extension, destroying the effort originally invested in making the product beautiful. Based on this perspective, we posit that people refrain from using products imbued with effort, as this indirectly entails destroying something they reward and appreciate.",0,4

Furthermore, we conceptualize that when food items are laterally displayed in a manner congruent (vs. incongruent) with consumers’ natural mental representation, it enhances the likelihood of choosing healthier options. To elaborate, we propose that consumers experience greater self-control when healthy/unhealthy items are displayed in a manner congruent with their natural mental representation. That is, as demonstrated by studies 2a and 2b, consumers tend to mentally represent healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items.",0,2
10.1093/jcr/ucw044,"In accord with the notion that behavior is often guided by the need to maintain gender identity, particularly among male consumers, we posit that one plausible explanation for men’s avoidance of environmentally friendly behaviors is that a pervasive mental association exists between greenness and femininity, such that engaging in green behaviors could threaten men’s masculine identity. Thus we predict that due to the green- feminine association and its effect on social judgments and self-perception, men will be more likely than women to avoid green products and behaviors, particularly when their masculinity is threatened.",1,4

What do you think about companies that donate for selfish reasons?” The goal of this manipulation was to raise the prominence in consumers’ minds of benevolence and self-interest as alternative motives for engaging in corporate social responsibility. Following the motive manipulation task, all respondents participated in a different study in which they were told that a pharmaceutical company was conducting clinical trials for a new hair loss treatment.",0,6

Alternatively, if this distance is minimal and thereby promotes clear visibility and a welldefined representation of the product, people’s bodily sensations are apt to be used primarily as a comparison standard for formally judging the target product. This latter process should foster a contrast effect on viewers’ product assessments.

In other words, high-CNFU consumers are unlikely to introject. However, this outcome is not expected for lowCNFU consumers, since they do not view conformity as a threat to self-esteem (Snyder and Fromkin 1977).

Such collective action subsequently spurs defensive countermovements of the opposing ideology. The second force results from the desire of adherents of specific ideologies to become dominant.

The small occurring knowledge acquisition during this phase might be due to the fact that during the collaborative phase participants wrote former unshared knowledge into the joint handout. In this way, the learning partner got information which was new to him. However, this does not mean that coconstruction of knowledge took place (c.f. Summers & Volet, 2010) because only the pure information could be enough to promote knowledge acquisition.",0,10

The burden of achieving despite these obstacles, and the self-regulation needed to be successful in the college environment, may take its toll internally.",0,4
10.1177/2167702615578129,"This implies that at both the theoretical and clinical levels, instead of focusing on mean levels of rumination and mood, a more detailed analysis of the interaction between mood and cognition could be a promising way to improve our understanding of cognitive vulnerability in recurrent depression. Here, a key theoretical question is why higher levels of entropy are maladaptive and predict brooding across both groups and new depressive symptoms in the RMD group. We can speculate that more unpredictability is problematic because it could represent that sometimes individuals engage in rumination even when in a neutral or positive mood.",0,6

This discount is hypothesized to originate from the producer side. Hannan et al. (2007) and Hsu et al.

Thus, a PTSD patient with reduced executive functions may experience difficulties intentionally accessing concrete episodic details of any past events, including (but not limited to) the traumatic experience, while at the same time experiencing involuntary recollections of such details.",1,9
