However, by making the causal structure of the scenarios salient to our participants, an action–omission effect could be obtained for positive outcomes as well. Interestingly, no matter the outcome condition, the action–omission effectwas increased by explicitly reminding participants of the causal structure of the scenarios, though this increase was rather small in the negative outcome conditions compared to the positive outcome conditions.",0,6

Additionally, the literature suggests that rightist ideology is associated with over-active fear responses and needs for certainty and security precisely because it functions to reduce fear and answer these needs (Jost et al., 2009). It follows that rightist ideology, in answering these needs, regulates the effects of fear by providing clear guidelines on how to react to ideologically-relevant threats—a notion supported by findings on ideological differences in the impact of emotions on policy support (Pliskin, Bar-Tal, Sheppes, & Halperin, 2014).",0,1

In the case of nondurable goods, the consumption of an aesthetically appealing product involves damaging its product design, and by extension, destroying the effort originally invested in making the product beautiful. Based on this perspective, we posit that people refrain from using products imbued with effort, as this indirectly entails destroying something they reward and appreciate.",0,4

Furthermore, we conceptualize that when food items are laterally displayed in a manner congruent (vs. incongruent) with consumers’ natural mental representation, it enhances the likelihood of choosing healthier options. To elaborate, we propose that consumers experience greater self-control when healthy/unhealthy items are displayed in a manner congruent with their natural mental representation. That is, as demonstrated by studies 2a and 2b, consumers tend to mentally represent healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items.",0,2
10.1093/jcr/ucw044,"In accord with the notion that behavior is often guided by the need to maintain gender identity, particularly among male consumers, we posit that one plausible explanation for men’s avoidance of environmentally friendly behaviors is that a pervasive mental association exists between greenness and femininity, such that engaging in green behaviors could threaten men’s masculine identity. Thus we predict that due to the green- feminine association and its effect on social judgments and self-perception, men will be more likely than women to avoid green products and behaviors, particularly when their masculinity is threatened.",1,4

The manner in which participants described the cartoons primed different mentalizing goals. In the engage-inmentalizing condition, participants were instructed to focus on understanding and describing the thoughts and emotions, rather than the physical actions, of the person doing the chores.",0,4

Similarly, behavioral genetic research suggests that as people age, they have increasing control over selecting or creating experiences that foster the development of their genetically influenced dispositions. Because such self-selected or self-created experiences partially reflect genetic dispositions, the enhanced control over environments can amplify genetic influences over time (Bouchard, 1997; McGue, Bouchard, Iacono, & Lykken, 1993; Plomin & Spinath, 2004; Scarr & McCartney, 1983).",1,9

Supporting this perspective, victims’ traits and provocative tendencies have been shown to relate to experienced mistreatment from peers (Aquino & Bradfield, 2000; Milam, Spitzmueller, & Penney, 2009). From a victimization view, subordinates who enact organizational deviance may represent provocative victims, whereas supervisors represent perpetrators engaging in corrective abusive behaviors.",0,4

With the benefit of hindsight, optimal distinctiveness theory (Brewer, 1991) provides a framework for understanding the benefits of including both unifying and diversifying elements in teams. According to Brewer (1991), team members actively endeavor to obtain an optimal balance of assimilation and differentiation within teams and will take corrective action to avoid being too similar (through reasserting distinctiveness) or too unique (through reasserting inclusion; Pickett & Brewer, 2001).",0,8

Engaging in workplace deviance represents a failure to behave according to organizational standards. As such, for individuals whose self-esteem is contingent upon workplace competence, deviant behaviors would generate extreme feelings of shame and directly threaten the core of one’s self-worth (Deci & Ryan, 1995), which one would be motivated to avoid at all costs (Crocker & Wolfe, 2001).",0,4

For example, a distinctive feature of many commercial exchanges is the possibility of tailoring a product or service to a consumer's exact specifications.

It would seem logical that this consumer would be motivated to grab the future opportunity enthusiastically. Regret is defined as “a negative emotion predicated on a self-relevant counterfactual inference” (Roese 2000).

These negative actions and reactions may spread throughout the group, leading to the emergence of a shared belief that the team is unsafe for risk taking and/or incapable of shared learning and information processing. In this way, negative affective biases hinder the development of TMS by increasing risk perceptions and subsequent reluctance to engage in the actions necessary to support transactive processing.",0,4
10.1002/job.1978,"Deep acting occurs when a desired emotional expression is achieved by changing one’s underlying felt emotion. For instance, a worker in an amusement park might “psych himself up” to interact with customers (Van Maanen & Kunda, 1989). In this case, the employee actually becomes more enthusiastic than would otherwise be the case. In contrast, surface acting refers to producing a desired outward emotional expression without modifying the underlying felt emotion (Gosserand & Diefendorff, 2005; Scott & Barnes, 2011).",0,3

If attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes are negative, even those who report that they want to engage in environmentally friendly behaviors (e.g., recycling) may acquiesce to difficult circumstances. By contrast, if attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes are very positive, a person may recycle even if it is difficult, shielding them from the negative effects of difficulty.",1,1

Moreover, a scent that activates neatness can evoke an expectation of a well-organized environment. In line with the expectation disconfirmation theory (Oliver, 1980), we can assume that when the environment doesn't meet that expectation, feelings and evaluations will be the same orworse thanwhen no scent is present (Bitner,1992).

However, there is no a priori reason why the average effect size should vary across studies as a function of precision. In contrast, if a set of studies is strongly biased by the decision to select only significant results, then their effect sizes will necessarily be related to measurement precision (Nosek, Spies, & Motyl, 2012; Rosenthal, 1979).",1,10

These findings raise important questions about the nature of these expectations, about the role they play in infants’ own social interactions, and about the factors that affect them.

Further, the game differed from real world settings where librarians use both oral and visual means for communication.",0,9

If qB > qA, then B running is a dominant strategy whenever A and C would enter the race (i.e., r5 0) regardless of the equilibrium in this subgame, as discussed below. Given the equilibria in the subgames at stage 2, the unique equilibrium can be found by backward induction. When r5 0, running is a dominant strategy for A, B, and C, since the probability of winning in any subgame they enter is positive (by assumption).",1,6

We assume that the financing constraints are only binding when demand is high. The firm always has enough cash to undertake the first-best investment with low demand α, but not enough cash to undertake the first-best investment with high demand α without some equity issuance. The firm can issue n1 shares in period 1 (at price P1) and n2 shares in period 2 (at price P2).",0,6

10.1177/0149206312453738,"Perceptions of complementary fit reflect a cognitive assessment about whether the team possesses the appropriate KSAs to complete the task. The underlying psychological mechanism is one of need-fulfillment (Kristof-Brown & Guay, 2011; Murray, 1951), in which the team views itself as possessing the requisite skills and expertise. When this occurs, transactive memory systems (TMS) are likely to emerge. Transactive memory, a construct first proposed by Wegner (1987), refers to “memory that is influenced by knowledge about the memory system of another person” through which “two or more people cooperatively store, retrieve, and communicate information” (Lewis, 2003: 588).",1,4

Firms that are part of a larger group may draw on group financial and technological resources and reputation to make them more attractive as cooperation partners and to support collaborative efforts (e.g., Ahuja, 2000a). At the same time, such firms may have fewer incentives to cooperate with outside partners, as they are likely to have intragroup R&D collaboration opportunities.",1,10
10.1257/app.4.2.168,"In this subsection we devise yet another test for the human capital versus the spillovers story which is robust to the possibility that workers’ skills may not be fully reflected in the salary. This possibility may arise, for instance, when more productive firms screen high-quality workers better. We look at the effects of the positive gap defined for moving workers with different length of tenure at their sending firms. Suppose that tenure at the sending firm along with education and skill level (recall subsection IIIB) facilitates spillovers by improving a worker’s ability to accumulate knowledge.",1,4

As in other public service organizations (Agranoff and McGuire 2003; Box 1998; Chisholm 1989; Provan and Milward 2001), a police department, as a single agency, cannot respond to all of the problems related to crime, as they encompass a variety of causes, factors, and correlates that it cannot control.",0,2

This discount is hypothesized to originate from the producer side. Hannan et al. (2007) and Hsu et al. (2009) argued that producers have limited attention, time, and material resources to devote to maintaining their fitness with a particular niche—what they term engagement. These producers, or candidates, have to choose how to allocate their limited engagement across multiple categorical niches.",0,4
