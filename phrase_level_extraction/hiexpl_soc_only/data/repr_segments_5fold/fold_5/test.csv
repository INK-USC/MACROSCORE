Prior to the experiment it was confirmed that participants did not know each other in any way. Participants arrived at the lab at the same time and were given instructions before any social chatting could take place. Participants were given information forms describing the experiment and then asked to complete a consent form. As the minimal group paradigm, participants were told the cover story that the experiment was designed to study the link between cognitive style and social interaction.",0,8

This protest allows a greater sense of personal empowerment against larger political-social forces (Bost & Prunier, 2013). For these reasons, conspiratorial thinking taps into a natural protection mechanism against potential threats. However, what constitutes a threat will also vary based on ideological motivations, which tend to be reinforced by, but not necessarily beholden to, one's racial, social, or political group identification (Abalakina Paap, Stephan, Craig, & Gregory, 1999; Kramer & Gavrieli, 2005).",1,5

Whereas unexpected stimuli might affect participants' blame judgments to an equal degree, on a process level these cues should not be associated with schematic biases such as hypervigilance or ease of processing. Consequently, we assume that schematic processing is highly dependent on participants' expectations.",0,1

In line with this argument, mental contrasting is observed to foster goal pursuit when minor obstacles are considered (i.e., expectations of success are high), but to lower goal pursuit when major obstacles are considered (i.e., when expectations of success are low).",0,9
10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.006,"The third aspect which is crucial in studying the process of negotiations is behavior itself. Decisions of appropriateness (or schemas) drive norms and behavior (Messick, 1999). Different behaviors in the same situation might result because of different judgments about what is appropriate behavior. However, the existence of norms does not always mean that people also behave in accord with these norms (e.g. Harms & Skyrms, 2008). Allocators might only care about norms because of self-presentation effects, wanting others to think they have obeyed the norm in order to maximize their own outcome.",0,6

Therefore, attractiveness judgments of split-faces should rely more on features, which represent sexually-dimorphic information, thereby enhancing sexual face preference judgments. Thus, from a dual-route framework, we hypothesized that split-half faces should change the pattern of processing for mate-relevant stimuli by disrupting holistic processing that is critical to aesthetic preference while enhancing sexual preference derived from masculine features.",0,10

Participants perceived the product to be of worse value for money in the heteroscedastic condition (M p 2.72) than in the homoscedastic condition (M p 3.29; F(1, 55) p 5.20, p ! .05) .",0,6

Constructs related to a completed intention often become irrelevant and potentially interfere with the next task. If multiple actions need to be performed consecutively, postfulfillment inhibition may occur to facilitate the completion of the next intention.

As a result, employees who perceive their workplace as unjust overall will cope poorly with new threats because they are already in a state of resource depletion.

Moderating effects of product characteristics In the following, we argue that specific product characteristics influence a customer’s expectations regarding the salesperson’s appropriate role and consequently the effectiveness of functional and relational customer orientation.

10.1007/s11747-009-0153-1,"The rationale underlying this expectation is that consumer perceptions of brand superiority can be driven by the distinction between global brands (or those internationally recognized brand names) and local brands (or those largely recognized by domestic consumers) (Steenkamp et al. 2003). The many roles that global brand names play in consumer perceptions of brand value are found to materialize through multiple mechanisms, such as perceived product quality, brand prestige, cultural capital, social responsibility, and a sense of belongingness to the global consumer segment (Özsomer and Altaras 2008; Steenkamp et al. 2003).",0,8

In such a case, expressions of gratitude become simply a way to further obligate the benefactor. Instead, some other mechanism must link the beneficiary and benefactor and induce a continuance and deepening of the relationship. We suggest affective commitment as just such a mechanism. Consistent with Gruen et al. (2000), we consider affective commitment an enduring bond, a sense of current and continued belonging or emotional attachment to the state and its people.",1,1

People may also consciously adopt the common behaviour because they assume that these behaviours are likely to be rewarded by their friendship group (Brown et al., 2008) or, drawing on social categorisation theory, because the common behaviourmay become part of their identity as group members (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987).",1,1

Two types of emotions have been linked consistently to distinct stages of openness to change. Emotions such as interest and curiosity motivate exploration and seeking of novel stimuli (for a review, see Silvia, 2008).

Scherpereel’s more optimistic view suggests that a key characteristic of transitional bureaucracies is the “willingness to implement administrative reform” (2004, 559), suggesting that among the fi rst and most important distinguishable characteristics of transitionera public administrators is the emergence of a reformer’s spirit—a willingness to use newfound discretion in support of administrative change.",1,9

More specifically, we assume that informed traders mistakenly believe the precision of their private signal to be γ+ k, where k > 0.

In either case, it now seems unwise to expect “direct” suppression from a ruminator, as any competent therapist already knows. Instead of demanding self-control, practicing competing responses to cues for rumination might be efficacious in changing ruminative habits—by replacing an old habitual thought with a new one.",0,8

Time-banking practices reward people who offer their services to others in the form of time credits.

However, when firms lack such knowledge about potential partners’ technological endowments, they may find it difficult to accurately assess the quality of partners’ technological resources (e.g., Gulati 1999, Nicholson et al. 2005), and would benefit from the information mediated by a common VC investor on a firm’s research progress, plans, market prospects, and the like.",1,5
