Given people's desire to satisfy short-term desires over long-term goals (e.g., Baumeister, 2002) and that people punish for retributive reasons (Carlsmith et al., 2002), they may end up extracting suffering from a series of CEOs at the expense of dedicating the limited amount of resources to fixing the underlying problem.",0,4

We focused here on the well-studied combination of eye-gaze and facialemotion (cf. Adams, Franklin, Nelson, & Stevenson, 2010). In each of two studies, participants completed self-esteemmeasures after viewing a series of faces that varied—on a between-subjects basis—with respect to emotion expression and eye gaze. We expected exposure to negative (versus positive) facial emotion to reduce perceivers' self-esteem but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze (i.e., were “looking at” perceivers).",0,10

Stapel and Koomen have found that when people are extramotivated to explain an ambiguous behavior, they will apply accessible information ‘‘more readily and more extensively” (2001, p. 916).

In other words, high-CNFU consumers are unlikely to introject. However, this outcome is not expected for lowCNFU consumers, since they do not view conformity as a threat to self-esteem (Snyder and Fromkin 1977).

Perfect detection performance would involve choosing from all culprit-present lineups (regardless of whether the culprit or a foil is selected) and rejecting all culprit-absent lineups.

Psychological withdrawal reflects employee acts that provide a mental escape from work (Hulin, 1991).

First, trust can be transferred through indirect communication (i.e., hearing or overhearing third-party gossip; Burt & Knez, 1996).

As noted, building on the norm of reciprocity, social exchange theory suggests that employees will reciprocate favorable treatment from their superiors or coworkers (e.g., Bowler & Brass, 2006).

Employees who manifest identifi cation with their organization or with an individual (e.g., a respected supervisor) and those who have an aff ective attachment to the work organization are more likely to share the values of the organization and to internalize its mission and vision as a personal sense of importance (Romzek 1990).",1,7

Aggregate profits, however, stagnated in 2000 and 2001. In manufacturing, which contains most of the high-tech industries, profits collapsed in 2001, falling 87% according to the Census Bureau Quarterly Financial Reports. This experience mirrors the behavior of the aggregated cash flow data for the industries in our study. For young high-tech firms, it is apparent from Figure 2b that there was a dramatic boom in cash flow beginning in 1994.",1,4
10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.02.005,Measuring bank-level loan portfolio liquidity (Sit) In this paper I propose a new index of liquidity of a bank’s loan portfolio. The individual bank portfolio structure and economy-wide securitization are crucial factors to be considered in constructing the index. Consider two banks: Bank A and Bank B. Assume that Bank A holds 80% of its loan portfolio in home mortgages and 20% in C&I loans and that Bank B holds 20% of its loans in home mortgages and 80% in C&I loans.,1,9
10.1177/0149206309356326,"Task interdependence reflects interrelated roles, technology requirements, and work constraints (Van der Vegt & Van de Vliert, 2005). Citizenship is “more important in jobs where people work in groups, need to coordinate their activities, or are interdependent with each other than in jobs where people work independently or as individual contributors” (Organ et al., 2006: 193). When group members rely on one another to complete their tasks, OCBs become integrated into work processes (Organ, 1988). Instead of detracting from task work, employees who perform OCBs in task-interdependent groups may improve their groups’ processes.",0,4

It is straightforward to generalize this expression to allow for (partial) coordinated behavior. Suppose that firms put a weight ϕ ∈ (0, 1) on the profits of their competitors and modify the objective function (8) accordingly.",1,7
10.1257/app.2.1.211,"One important question is the channel through which the peer effects operate. Broadly speaking, these troubled children could affect the learning and behavior of their classmates either through their own disruptive behavior or through their own (poor) academic performance. For example, students’ achievement may suffer because they are distracted by the behavior of the troubled peers. Alternatively, achievement might suffer because there are fewer students from whom to learn or because students from troubled homes learn more slowly and slow down the learning of their peers.",0,8
10.1016/j.learninstruc.2010.11.002,"A more specific no effect explanation would be that in our scenario there was no real collaboration and no real knowledge acquisition during the collaborative learning phase. The small occurring knowledge acquisition during this phase might be due to the fact that during the collaborative phase participants wrote former unshared knowledge into the joint handout. In this way, the learning partner got information which was new to him. However, this does not mean that coconstruction of knowledge took place (c.f. Summers & Volet, 2010) because only the pure information could be enough to promote knowledge acquisition.",0,10

Thus, a PTSD patient with reduced executive functions may experience difficulties intentionally accessing concrete episodic details of any past events, including (but not limited to) the traumatic experience, while at the same time experiencing involuntary recollections of such details.",1,9
