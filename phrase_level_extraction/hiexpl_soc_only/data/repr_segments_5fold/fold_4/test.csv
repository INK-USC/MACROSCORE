Taken together, these findings suggest that prevention focus and low power narrow conceptual and perceptual scope, leading to a detailed and concrete processing. Empathic concern requires selfother differentiation and consists of ‘zooming in’ on concrete otheroriented feelings of warmth and compassion (i.e., feelings different from those of the other).",0,5

In short, social perception is at its root person perception, and person perception appears to place special weight on moral traits.

One type of exogenous influence is the set of interactions initiated and received by the focal individual.

Such detachment is the feeling employees have of unwinding or switching off from work (Sonnentag & Bayer, 2005; Sonnentag & Kruel, 2006).

Political systems ranging from authoritarian regimes to advanced industrial democracies create very different opportunities for collective action, which means that different types of personal qualities may predict political participation in different contexts (Norris, 2002; Tarrow, 1994).

Previous research has found a positive relationship between customers’ private label share and their attitude toward private labels (Burton et al. 1998). Furthermore, positive attitudes toward individual products can result in attitude transfers toward the parent company (Chapman and Aylesworth 1999), which, in the current context, is the retailer. Stronger attitudes toward the retailer then lead to stronger store loyalty. Thus, the private label share– store loyalty link is strengthened when private label attitudes are more positive.

For example, Mogg and Bradley (1998) proposed a cognitive-motivational analysis of anxiety, in which the Valence Evaluation System (VES) is responsible for assessing the threat value of a stimulus. A stimulus with a high threat value will cause the Goal Engagement System (GES) to switch to the “danger mode,” which interrupts ongoing activities and allocates processing resources (such as attention) to the threat.",0,8

Specifically, the effect should be particularly pronounced for those stocks for which the article tone matches the formation period return. For instance, an overconfident investor might consider its initial, media-based signal regarding a winner stock as being particularly (less) favorable if the tone of the article appears particularly positive (negative).",1,8

As Moulton and Sandfort ( 2016 ) suggest, rather than being sanctioned by external actors and sources, legitimate authority is endogenous to the implementation system and context. Individuals interpret policy in unintended ways, and shared beliefs can act as a source of authority, legitimizing street-level divergence from intended policy.",0,3

Because reflection did not strongly correlate phenotypically with the depression composite, we limited our analyses to two models: (a) brooding and the depression composite and (b) distraction and the depression composite (see Fig. 1). Fitting the bivariate Cholesky model revealed substantial additive genetic influences (h2 = .62) and nonshared environmental influences (e2 = .38) on the relationship between brooding and the depression composite, as well as unique genetic and nonshared environmental influences on each (–2LL = 3,306.50, Akaike information criterion = 314).",1,4

Patterson’s (1982, 1986) social coercive model gives further support of a transactional view by pointing out the escalating nature of this interplay, suggesting that parents’ aversive reactions to children’s antisocial behavior provoke increasing levels of antisocial behavior. Social coercive theory posits that parental use of harsh discipline causes children to respond by becoming more belligerent and disobedient.",1,6

Additionally, classrooms are structured differently, as children often change teachers for different subjects. They also experience larger class sizes and child-to-teacher ratios that impose new demands on children in terms of self-regulation and socialization. Not to mention, students have fewer opportunities for one-to-one teacher– child interaction (Pianta & Kraft-Sayre, 1999; Rimm-Kaufman & Pianta, 2000).",1,7

However, it might be the case that tax evasion involves costs other than agency costs between management and shareholders. One possibility is that tax evaders might face difficulty in accessing capital markets. If companies can hide income from the government, then they can do the same in relation to debt holders.",1,8

This could be the case for one (or both) of two reasons. First, because at least some parties in a country with comparatively high levels of crossdistrict diversity will be unwilling to tailor their platforms and, thus, will opt not to contest more districts. In this case, voters are presented with systematically fewer ballot options.",0,2

Such exchanges, in turn, create differing quality relationships ranging from lower quality relationships with some followers to higher quality relationships with others.

The perceived link between performance and pay may be deemed to be stronger when the pay component is deemed to be more compelling. Similarly, the logic of the endowment effect, in which a good increases in perceived value as a result of ownership of the good (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1990), is consistent with greater valence (and thus greater motivation) associated with bonuses. Typically, bonuses are fully allocated to the employee shortly after the year in which the bonus-earning performance was assessed.",1,1

Alternatively, he or she may not report harassment in order to prevent damaging social relationships or hurting the company’s image. Obviously, an individual can have multiple goals that conflict. When this occurs, individuals will seek the course of action that maximizes the achievement of multiple goals rather than accomplishing a single one (O’Leary-Kelly et al., 2000).",0,5

We can speculate that more unpredictability is problematic because it could represent that sometimes individuals engage in rumination even when in a neutral or positive mood.",0,6
