THE PRAGMATIC AMERICAN: EMPIRICAL REALITY OR METHODOLOGICAL ARTIFACT?∗ JUSTIN T. PICKETT1 and THOMAS BAKER2 1School of Criminal Justice, University at Albany, SUNY 2L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, Virginia Commonwealth University KEYWORDS: public opinion, response acquiescence, crime attributions, punitiveness, rehabilitation Scholars widely agree that the public is pragmatic about criminal justice. The empir- ical basis for this conclusion is the failure in several previous studies to find a sizable negative relationship between dispositional and situational crime attributions, or be- tween support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies. We suggest, however, that public pragmatism may be an artifact of the use of unidirectional question batteries in prior research to measure attribution styles and policy support. When such questions are used, acquiescent responding can introduce systematic error that is positively cor- related across items and scales. Drawing on data from an experiment with a national sample (N = 826) of Internet panelists, we examine how this methodological approach impacts the bivariate correlations and multivariate relationships between attribution styles and between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies. The findings reveal that using unidirectional sets of questions to measure these concepts likely re- sults in 1) inflated alpha reliability coefficients, 2) an underestimation of the magnitude of the negative relationships between attribution styles and between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation, and 3) an underestimation of the extent to which punitive- ness and support for rehabilitation are driven by the same factors, working in opposite directions. A substantial and growing body of research has investigated public opinion about the causes of crime and the appropriate criminal justice response to offending (Ap- plegate, Cullen, and Fisher, 1997; Applegate et al., 2000; Cochran, Boots, and Heide, 2003; Gabbidon and Boisvert, 2012; Grasmick and McGill, 1994; Pickett and Chiri- cos, 2012; Ramirez, 2013; Thompson and Bobo, 2011; Tyler and Boeckmann, 1997; Unnever and Cullen, 2010). This line of inquiry has been particularly salient be- cause of the documented influence of popular attitudes on criminal justice policy and court decisions (Baumer and Martin, 2013; Brace and Boyea, 2008; Enns, in press; ∗ Additional supporting information can be found in the listing for this article in the Wiley Online Library at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/crim.2011.52.issue-2/issuetoc.

C© 2014 American Society of Criminology doi: 10.1111/1745-9125.12035 CRIMINOLOGY Volume 52 Number 2 195–222 2014 195 196 PICKETT & BAKER Nicholson-Crotty, Peterson, and Ramirez, 2009). An important finding has been that members of the public “are profoundly pragmatic when they consider the issue of crime and its control” (Unnever et al., 2010: 453); they attribute crime to both individual failings (dispositional attributions) and environmental influences (situational attributions) and, as a result, simultaneously support punishment and rehabilitation (McCorkle, 1993; Pickett, Chiricos, and Gertz, 2014). Thus, in their seminal review of the research, Cullen, Fisher, and Applegate (2002: 60) concluded that “the central tendency in public opinion is to be punitive and progressive.” Likewise, Mascini and Houtman (2006: 832) have argued that “the habit of conceiving of support for repression and for rehabilitation as diametrically opposed options should have been abandoned long ago.” The existence of public pragmatism has strong policy implications. Political respon- siveness to the interests of a pragmatic public would involve bipartisan efforts to develop a multifaceted and balanced approach to crime control that ensures tough punishments for offenders and provides them with rehabilitative programming. The theoretical impli- cations of public pragmatism are also significant. Evidence of pragmatism suggests that in the popular view, punitiveness and support for rehabilitation are distinct attitudinal phenomena, rather than opposing sides of a single construct (Unnever et al., 2010). If this is accurate, and punitiveness and support for rehabilitation are not opposites, then they should not simply be related in opposite ways to the same key factors (Mascini and Houtman, 2006; McCorkle, 1993). A central tenet of the pragmatism thesis, then, is that the two types of policy support are best explained by separate theoretical models (Mascini and Houtman, 2006; Pickett, Mancini, and Mears, 2013). The concern raised in this article, however, is that the pragmatism identified in prior studies may be an artifact of the methodology typically employed in public opinion re- search in the field of criminology and criminal justice. Despite the overwhelming ev- idence of acquiescence in survey responding (Krosnick, 1999; Saris et al., 2010; Schu- man and Presser, 1981), researchers often have constructed measures of key concepts— crime attributions, punitiveness, and support for rehabilitation—from batteries of ques- tions that are unilaterally positive, where a response of “agree,” “support,” or “yes” in- dicates the presence of the concept of interest.1 In these instances, acquiescence—“the tendency to answer items in a positive way regardless of their content” (Billiet and Davidov, 2008: 543)—can result in systematic measurement error that biases observed scores and relationships by introducing nonsubstantive variation in observations that is positively correlated across items and scales (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001). This finding is important because the strongest evidence of pragmatism has been the absence of a hydraulic relation—a sizeable negative correlation—between either dispositional and situational attributions, or punitiveness and support for rehabilitation (Mascini and Hout- man, 2006; Unnever et al., 2010). Indeed, the absence of this hypothesized negative cor- relation is the criterion for pragmatism that Unnever et al. (2010: 433) identified at the outset of their analysis: “[T]he failure to detect a hydraulic relation would suggest that Americans are more centrist and pragmatic in their views on crime and its control.” In the current study, we evaluate how acquiescence bias may have influenced both the quality of the measures used in prior research and the resultant findings about public 1. The problems associated with response acquiescence are not limited to agree/disagree items; they emerge across many different types of questions when unidirectional sets of statements are used (Blamey, Bennet, and Morrison, 1999; Krosnick, 1999; Schuman and Presser, 1981). PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 197 pragmatism. Our analyses draw on data from a recent experiment, in which respondents were randomly assigned to receive questionnaires that either did or did not include con- trols for acquiescence. Before describing our methodology and findings, we first delve more deeply into the potential problems created by response acquiescence, and we discuss how such stylistic responding may have contributed to the finding of public pragmatism in previous studies. ACQUIESCENCE AND SURVEY RESPONSE There is now compelling evidence from “more than one hundred studies using a wide variety of methods” (Saris et al., 2010: 63) that survey respondents often adopt an acquies- cence response style in which they “endorse any assertion made . . . regardless of its con- tent” (Krosnick, 1999: 552). One of the best examples of acquiescent responding is a 1986 Time/Yankelovich poll in which 80 percent and 65 percent of respondents, respectively, agreed with the following two contradictory statements: “people should have the right to purchase a sexually explicit book, magazine, or movie, if that’s what they want to do”; and “community authorities should be able to prohibit the selling of magazines or movies they consider to be pornographic” (cited in Erikson and Tedin, 2005: 38). Schuman and Presser (1981) presented similar findings for crime attributions. They reported that in multiple surveys, two contradictory statements about the causes of crime—“individuals are more to blame than social conditions for crime and lawlessness in this country” and “social conditions are more to blame than individuals for crime and lawlessness in this country”—were endorsed by the majority of respondents (1981: 207–9). Theoretically, acquiescent responding is believed to constitute a type of survey sat- isficing (Krosnick, 1999)—a low-effort response strategy where “instead of generat- ing an optimal answer, respondents settle for generating merely satisfactory answers” (Krosnick, 1991: 215). Here, respondents simply report the first acceptable answer that comes to mind. As Kahneman (2011: 81) has explained, the intuitive and thus easiest ap- proach to answering questions entails “a deliberate search for confirming evidence” and an inclination toward an “uncritical acceptance of suggestions.” For this reason, when responding to surveys, it takes less mental effort to identify reasons to endorse affirma- tive response options (e.g., “agree,” “support,” or “yes,”) than disaffirming ones (e.g., “disagree,” “oppose,” or “no”) (Krosnick, 1999). Adoption of the acquiescence response style among respondents is therefore commonly a function of a low motivation to partici- pate and/or limited cognitive abilities (Krosnick, 1991, 1999). It also can be a consequence of personality traits or social situations that dispose respondents to be especially receptive to suggestion (see, e.g., Carr, 1971; Goldberg, 1990). Regardless of its etiology, however, when unaccounted for in empirical studies that ana- lyze survey data, acquiescent responding can have substantial effects on research findings. Response acquiescence, by introducing systematic measurement error, can influence ob- served scores, measures of internal consistency and reliability, and correlations between scales (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001; Billiet and Davidov, 2008; Russell, 1979). In these cases, “even strong underlying associations may turn up weak or incorrectly signed” (Green and Citrin, 1994: 261). Krosnick (1999: 552) described the effects of acquiescence bias. He noted that although there should be strong negative correlations between re- sponses to “statements stating mutually exclusive views (e.g., ‘I enjoy socializing’ versus ‘I don’t enjoy socializing’), . . . across more than 40 studies, the average correlation was 198 PICKETT & BAKER only –.22.” In multiple-item scales, such as those used to measure crime attributions and views about criminal sanctions, one of the strongest predictors of acquiescence bias is the directional composition of the component items. Baumgartner and Steenkamp (2001: 146) put it as follows: “[T]he higher the proportion of positively or negatively worded items, the stronger the effect of acquiescent responding on scale scores should be. If the scale is balanced, . . . adverse effects of acquiescence should be minimized.” PRIOR RESEARCH ON PUBLIC PRAGMATISM Prior studies that assess whether the public is pragmatic in its views about crime and justice have approached the issue in one of two ways. The first is to examine whether a hy- draulic relation exists between dispositional and situational crime attributions (Unnever et al., 2010). According to attribution theory, dispositional attributions—attributing crime to individual failings—should increase perceived offender blameworthiness and incorrigi- bility and, in turn, foster punitiveness, whereas situational attributions—attributing crime to social or environmental causes—should reduce perceived offender blameworthiness and incorrigibility and, in turn, increase support for rehabilitation (Carroll et al., 1987; Cochran, Boots, and Heide, 2003; Grasmick and McGill, 1994). Theoretically, individ- uals should tend to endorse either a dispositional or a situational attribution style—the hydraulic relation hypothesis (Unnever et al., 2010). In this way, “the punishment-versus- rehabilitation debate is a manifestation of the distinction between dispositional and situ- ational attributions of crime” (Grasmick and McGill, 1994: 40–1). To our knowledge, five previous investigations have provided tests of the hydraulic relation hypothesis as it relates to crime attributions. Consistent with the hypothesis, two studies found negative correlations between attribution styles, although the corre- lations are not large (r = –.09 and –.26) (Ortet-Fabregat and Pérez, 1992; Templeton and Hartnagel, 2012). One study yielded mixed results across two samples (Carroll et al., 1987). Two studies showed that the two attribution styles are actually positively correlated (Mascini and Houtman, 2006; Unnever et al., 2010). Four of these five investigations, how- ever, operationalized attribution styles with scales constructed from agree/disagree items that are all positively worded, so that agreeing with the item indicates endorsement of the attribution style. The exception, the study by Ortet-Fabregat and Perez (1992), was the one that provided the strongest support for the hydraulic relation hypothesis. Those authors reversed one item that should likely be in a dispositional attribution scale—“If a person commits a crime it is because he/she wants to”—and included it with 8 positively worded items in a situational attribution scale. The dispositional attribution scale in that study, however, was created from 11 items that are all positively worded. Thus, not a single study to date has assessed the relationship between attribution styles after taking sufficient steps to minimize the influence of acquiescence bias on resultant findings. The second approach to assessing public pragmatism is to evaluate whether there is a hydraulic relation between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies (Mascini and Houtman, 2006). This evaluation is most commonly done indirectly by simply comparing the survey marginals—the percent of the sample saying “agree,” “support,” or “yes”—for items measuring views about punishment and rehabilitation (see, e.g., Cullen, Fisher, and Applegate, 2002; McCorkle, 1993). For example, Unnever et al. (2010) showed that 69 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of General Social Survey respondents favor the death penalty and support increasing spending on “drug PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 199 rehabilitation,” broadly defined. This approach to testing the pragmatism thesis is not ideal for two reasons. First, survey marginals can be influenced heavily by acquies- cent responding, question wording, and question order (Applegate and Sanborn, 2011; Krosnick, 1999; Stimson, 1999). Second, finding that a majority, or slight majority, of the public generally has at least somewhat favorable attitudes toward punitive and rehabil- itative policies does not provide clear evidence of pragmatism. Pragmatism implies that strong support for punitive policies also does not tend to preclude strong support for reha- bilitative policies—that is, that there is not a hydraulic relation between such policy views. A more direct test of the hydraulic relation hypothesis is achieved by examining the correlation between separate scales measuring support for punitive and rehabilitative policies. Mascini and Houtman’s (2006) well-known study attempted to do this and has commonly been cited as providing definitive evidence of public pragmatism (see, e.g., Pickett, Mancini, and Mears, 2013; Unnever et al., 2010). In that investigation, punitive- ness was measured with a 6-item scale, and support for rehabilitation was measured with a 12-item scale. The findings reveal that a very weak and nonsignificant negative correlation (r = –.06) exists between the two types of public views. An earlier study by Mascini and Houtman (2002) actually found a positive correlation (r = .34) between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation. Accordingly, in the conclusion of their second study, Mascini and Houtman (2006) argued that they had “established that . . . support for repression and support for rehabilitation are not the opposites they are typically held to be.” And they asserted that “our findings cannot simply be done away with as measurement constructs” (2006: 833). However, the measures of policy support in both of Mascini and Houtman’s studies were constructed from agree/disagree items that are all positively worded. Contrasting Mascini and Houtman’s (2002, 2006) findings, studies that have measured support for punishment and rehabilitation with scales that include both positively and negatively worded items often have found larger negative correlations between the con- structs: r = –.28 and –.39 (Tam, Au, and Leung, 2008) and r = –.44 and –.48 (Cullen et al., 1985). However, an important limitation of these studies, and of both investigations by Mascini and Houtman, is that they did not actually analyze policy support, which in- volves support for specific means to achieve social goals (Stimson, 1999). Focusing specif- ically on policy support is important because, in the aggregate (as policy mood), it is the form of public opinion that shapes policy making (Enns, in press; Erikson, Mackuen, and Stimson, 2002; Stimson, 2004). Policy support also may be more polarized than other types of policy views because supporting a specific policy necessarily entails making an attitu- dinal commitment, implicitly or explicitly, to allocate finite public resources toward that policy. The previously mentioned studies, however, used measures of support for punish- ment and rehabilitation that are based in part on respondents’ level of agreement with “utility statements” and “goal statements” and, thus, that conflate policy support with other types of policy views. Utility statements gauge respondents’ judgments about the effectiveness of differ- ent policies for reducing crime: “Severe penalties deter potential felons” (Mascini and Houtman, 2006: 827); “[p]unishing criminals is the only way to stop them from engag- ing in more crimes in the future” (Cullen et al., 1985: 316); and “[c]apital punishment reduces crime in the long run” (Tam, Au, and Leung, 2008: 1076). Utility judgments are not synonymous with policy support, however, because beliefs about whether a policy will prevent recidivism or deter offending are neither the only, nor even necessarily the primary, concerns that drive policy support (Cullen, Fisher, and Applegate, 2000; Payne 200 PICKETT & BAKER et al., 2004; see also Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson, 2002). That is, even if individu- als judge a policy to have no crime-prevention value, they may still support it for other reasons, such as a desire for just deserts. For example, recent national polls reveal that although only 32–35 percent of Americans believe the death penalty deters crime, 60– 70 percent of citizens nonetheless support the policy (Gallup Report, 2013). Likewise, Applegate, David, and Cullen (2009: 64–5) found that judgments about whether trying juveniles as adults would lead them to “become productive law-abiding citizens” or to “commit more crime in the future” are only moderately correlated (r ≤ |.21|) with actual support for transfers (see also Garland, Melton, and Hass, 2012). Goal statements deal with abstract sanctioning philosophies: “Criminals deserve to be punished because they have harmed society” (Cullen et al., 1985: 316); “[t]he ju- diciary should convince criminals that they are drifting astray” (Mascini and Hout- man, 2006: 828); “[w]e should try to rehabilitate men who have broken the law” (Applegate et al., 2000: 752); and “[c]riminals should be punished to make the criminals pay for their crimes” (Tam, Au, and Leung, 2008: 1076). Using such statements to mea- sure policy support is problematic for two reasons. First, punishment philosophies are weak predictors of policy support (Applegate, Davis, and Cullen, 2009; Garland, Melton, and Hass, 2012; Warr and Stafford, 1984). Second, abstract beliefs in punishment and rehabilitation are largely irrelevant to practical policy debates. As Stimson (1999: 7) ex- plained, “a defining characteristic of the political issue . . . is that we must be able to imagine reasonable people advocating either side. Thus education spending is an issue; reasonable people want more or less of it. ‘Education,’ though, is not an issue; virtually no one opposes it.” Likewise, the key issues are not “punishment” and “rehabilitation” per se, but whether to increase or decrease the harshness of punishments and whether to expand or reduce rehabilitative programming. Two recent studies by Pickett and colleagues (2013, 2014) measured punitiveness and support for rehabilitation with scales derived exclusively from questions asking about pol- icy support. However, the policy support questions used in both studies were all positively worded, and neither study took any steps to control for acquiescence bias. Nonetheless, both studies revealed a significant negative correlation (r = –.23, and r = –.24, respec- tively) between the scales. In short, then, there is no existing research that has exclusively measured policy support and also done so using both positively and negatively worded questions. The findings from prior studies that have adopted at least one of these two methodological approaches tend to be supportive of the hydraulic relation hypothesis. On the other hand, the investigations that have adopted neither approach generally pro- vide no support for the hypothesis. CURRENT STUDY In the remainder of this study, we focus on empirically testing the argument that using agree/disagree or support/oppose scales to test the hydraulic relation hypothesis, either in relation to crime attributions or views about punitive and rehabilitative policies, with- out first controlling for acquiescent responding is problematic. Importantly, our analy- ses include measures of punitiveness and support for rehabilitation that focus specifically on policy support rather than on policy goals or utility judgments. To test the preced- ing argument, we evaluate three specific hypotheses. In developing these hypotheses, we build on prior theoretical and empirical work on survey response that suggests that when PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 201 unilaterally positive items are used to measure constructs, acquiescent responding may introduce systematic measurement error that is positively correlated across items and scales.2 Hypothesis 1: The use of unilaterally positive items to measure crime attributions and policy support will lead to an overestimation of the reliability of the result- ing scales. Testing this hypothesis is important because the quality of measures used to operationalize theoretical constructs constrains the meaningfulness of re- sults and the validity of associated theoretical conclusions. Billiet and Davidov (2008: 545) explained that the positively correlated bias introduced by acquies- cent responding may “artificially inflate the alpha reliability coefficients.” This observation is notable because even with the use of unilaterally positive items, prior studies have commonly reported relatively low alpha coefficients for crime attribution scales—.34, .57, and .62 (Carroll et al., 1987); .58 and .63 (Cochran, Boots, and Heide, 2003; Unnever et al., 2010); .42 and .65 (Grasmick and McGill, 1994); and .66 and .71 (Templeton and Hartnagel, 2012).3 It is probable, then, that these scales would have had lower internal consistencies if acquiescence bias were controlled. Hypothesis 2: The use of unilaterally positive items to measure crime attributions and policy support will lead to an underestimation of the size of the hydraulic relation be- tween dispositional and situational attribution styles, and between support for punitive and rehabilitative policies. Specifically, when such items are used, even if the nega- tive relationships that are predicted by the hydraulic relation hypothesis are present, they may be smaller in magnitude or even positive in sign due to acquiescence bias, which should be positively correlated across scales (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001; Russell, 1979). Hypothesis 3: Once acquiescence bias is minimized, the effects of attribution styles on both punitiveness and support for rehabilitation will be similar, although in the opposite directions. Examining the correlates of policy support provides for a more complete test of the pragmatism thesis. Recall that the pragmatism thesis suggests that punitiveness and support for rehabilitation are not opposites and, thus, should not simply be related in opposite ways to the same factors (Mascini and Houtman, 2006). However, if policy support is ideological rather than pragmatic, then the two types of policy support should largely be opposite sides of the same coin, and the same factors, working in opposite directions, should drive both. For example, sup- porting the pragmatism thesis, previous studies often have found that whereas situa- tional attributions are positively related to support for rehabilitation, they are either not correlated with, or are positively correlated with, punitiveness (Carroll et al., 1987; Mascini and Houtman, 2006; Unnever et al., 2010). This finding runs counter 2. It bears emphasizing that the use of unilaterally negative items would pose similar problems. 3. Indeed, to our knowledge, the only crime attribution scales that have achieved relatively high al- phas (e.g., alpha = .76 to .80) have been those constructed from a large number (e.g., 7 to 11) of survey items (see, e.g., Mascini and Houtman, 2006; Ortet-Fabregat and Perez, 1992). This obser- vation is noteworthy because, as Cortina (1993: 102) has explained, the “number of items [in a scale] has a profound effect on alpha, especially at low levels of average item intercorrelation.” 202 PICKETT & BAKER to the predictions of attribution theory. We believe that it reflects the contaminating influence of acquiescence bias on findings. METHODS To test our hypotheses, we conducted an experiment in the summer of 2013 with a national sample of 826 adults (18 years of age and older) who were randomly selected from SurveyMonkey’s online Audience panel. At the time of the experiment, more than 400,000 individuals, including residents of all 50 U.S. states, were members of the Audi- ence panel. Membership in the panel simply entails volunteering to complete surveys on a periodic basis in exchange for a small donation to charity and the potential to win $100 in weekly drawings. SurveyMonkey recruits most members of the panel from a pool of more than 30 million persons who participate in surveys every month on the website at the request of individual SurveyMonkey customers. For our experiment, 2,770 randomly selected panelists were invited to participate in the project, of which 867 began the sur- vey and 826 completed the questionnaire. This yielded an overall participation rate of 30 percent and a completion rate of 95 percent. To be clear, the purpose of this study is not to produce precise estimates of population values. Rather, we focus on testing the effects of alternative methodological approaches experimentally. Such research does not require an analysis of data from a probability sam- ple of all Americans. As the American Association of Public Opinion Research’s (AA- POR) recent report on online panels emphasized, “there are times when a nonprobability online panel is an appropriate choice” (Baker et al., 2010: 758). In particular, the report explained that “nonprobability online panels . . . have proven to be a valuable resource for methodological research of all kinds” (2010: 759). Mounting evidence also suggests that studies using data from volunteer Internet surveys yield experimental findings (see, e.g., Yeager and Krosnick, 2012) and relational inferences (Ansolabehere and Schaffner, in press; Berrens et al., 2003; Bhutta, 2012; Sanders et al., 2007) that parallel those ob- tained from representative samples of the general population. In the experiment, one randomly selected group of respondents received unidirectional batteries of questions—all positively worded—about crime attributions and policy sup- port. This method creates the greatest potential for acquiescence bias to affect any resul- tant findings, but it is nonetheless the typical approach used in studies of public opinion on crime and justice. To examine the consequences of using this method, we had a second randomly selected group of respondents complete bidirectional sets of questions, in which several items were positively worded and several were negatively worded. Varying the di- rection of questions is a common method for controlling for acquiescence bias that has been implemented in other fields for decades (Block, 1965; Cloud and Vaughan, 1970). Although the method has limits (see Krosnick, 1999), which we discuss in the conclusion, its benefit is that it prevents respondents from obtaining high scores on resultant scales simply by engaging in acquiescent responding (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001). Al- though ideally the bidirectional sets of questions used to construct scales would be per- fectly balanced, including an equal number of positively and negatively worded items, any degree of balancing will help to reduce the contaminating influence of acquiescence bias (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001). Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics for the two randomized groups of respondents. It is clear that both of these groups differ demographically from the U.S. population.

For our purposes, however, what is most important is that when compared with each other, the demographic and attitudinal characteristics of the respondents in the two groups do not differ beyond what would be expected on the basis of random sampling error. This result indicates that randomization was successful. MEASURES OF ATTRIBUTION STYLES AND POLICY SUPPORT Following previous studies, we measured respondents’ attribution styles using a series of agree/disagree items (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree) that gauged endorse- ment of dispositional and situational attributions for criminal offending. Five survey items tapped dispositional attributions, and six items assessed situational attributions. Table 2 displays these items. The included items, in their positively worded form, closely parallel those used in previous studies (e.g., Cullen et al., 1985; Templeton and Hartnagel, 2012; Unnever et al., 2010). To generate bidirectional sets of questions, we reversed the direc- tion of two of the dispositional items and four of the situational items. Several consider- ations needed to be taken into account in developing the reversals of the positive items (see Schuman and Presser, 1981). Most importantly, the new negative items could not be created by simply inserting the word “not” into the positive statements, and they had to be as extreme as the original items (Krosnick and Presser, 2010: 277). We accomplished this by changing a single word in the attribution items; whereas the positive items began with the word “most,” the negative items instead began with the word “few” (see table 2). In the case of respondents who received unidirectional questions, we created the Dis- positional attributions scale by averaging across responses to the five dispositional items, 204 PICKETT & BAKER Table 2.

NOTES: The specific question stem was as follows: “Now thinking about the CAUSES OF CRIME in this country, how much do you disagree or agree with each of the following statements?” and we created the Situational attributions scale by averaging responses to the six situa- tional items. We used the same approach for the respondents who received bidirectional questions, but before doing so, we reverse coded the responses to the negative items. Because our first hypothesis pertains to the effect of acquiescence on alpha coefficients, we wait to discuss the reliability of all of the scales used in this study in the Findings section. We used 13 questions to measure respondents’ support for specific crime policies. Six items gauged support for punitive policies, such as the death penalty, mandatory min- imum sentences, and juvenile transfers. Seven items tapped support for rehabilitative policies, such as expanding educational and vocational programs in prison.4 To increase comparability, the punishment items generally focused on serious offenders and the reha- bilitation items pertained to incarcerated offenders. Our focus on serious crime, however, should have no influence on the experimental effect of manipulating the direction of the items. The response options ranged from 1 = strongly oppose to 6 = strongly support. 4. We included prison visitation as a rehabilitative policy because research has shown that inmates who are visited frequently are less likely to reoffend after they are released (Bales and Mears, 2008).

NOTES: The specific question stem was as follows: “How much do you oppose or support each of these pro- posed crime policies?” All of the items are shown in table 3. Similar to our approach with the attribution ques- tions, we generated a bidirectional set of policy support items by changing a single word in roughly half of the punitive and rehabilitation items. In two punitive items, we changed the word “increasing” to “reducing,” and in a third punitive item, we replaced the word “more” with “fewer.” In three rehabilitation items, we simply switched the word “expand- ing” to “reducing.” This approach reversed the direction of the statements from positive to negative but kept them as extreme as the originals. For the unidirectional group, we av- eraged the responses to the punitive items to create a Punitiveness scale, and we averaged responses to the rehabilitation items to create a Rehabilitation scale. For the bidirectional group, we first reverse coded the negative items and then averaged responses to create the respective scales. RACIAL RESENTMENT In the analyses, we include a measure of racial resentment as a potential mediator be- tween attribution styles and policy support. Racial resentment, or symbolic racism, is a modern form of racism centered on a denial of the contemporary existence and effects of racial discrimination (Kinder and Sanders, 1996; Sears and Henry, 2003). It is among the strongest predictors of public views about crime policies (Pickett and Chiricos, 2012; Unnever, Cullen, and Jones, 2008; Unnever et al., 2010). Extant theory and research has 206 PICKETT & BAKER suggested that crime attributions should influence levels of racial resentment, which in turn should impact support for crime policies (Tam, Au, and Leung, 2008). Specifically, in the public mind, criminal offenders often are typified as being Black, and crime is under- stood to be a racial issue (Pickett et al., 2014; Unnever and Cullen, 2010).5 It is therefore likely that for many Americans, causal attributions for crime largely amount to causal at- tributions for Black crime and, thus, constitute a form of what Sears and Henry (2003: 272) termed “racialized individualism,” which involves the “concern that Blacks do not live up to conventional individualistic values.” Sears and Henry (2003) theorized and empirically demonstrated that racialized individualism is a strong predictor of racial resentment, and its effect on policy support is largely mediated by racial resentment (see also Brandt and Reyna, 2012). In the current study, Racial resentment is measured with responses (1 = strongly dis- agree, 6 = strongly agree) to five items from Henry and Sears’s (2002) Symbolic Racism 2000 scale. In the questionnaire, these items were placed several pages after the ques- tions asking about policy support and crime attributions. The exact wording of the items is provided in appendix A. All items have been used in previous studies to measure racial resentment (see, e.g., Pickett and Chiricos, 2012; Unnever and Cullen, 2010). The battery of racial resentment questions was bidirectional in both groups. Thus, before averaging across the items, we recoded responses so that higher values indicated greater racism. CONTROL VARIABLES In the multivariate models, we include several controls to account for the slight de- mographic differences across the two groups and to minimize omitted variable bias. All controls are measured identically in both the unidirectional and bidirectional groups. The control variables are described in detail in appendix A. Here, we note simply that we in- clude controls for the key factors known to influence views about crime and justice (see Applegate et al., 2000; Unnever and Cullen, 2010), such as Perceived risk of victimiza- tion, Perceived crime trend, News consumption, Conservatism, and Religiosity. We also control for respondents’ experience with prior Family victimization, Education, gender (female = 1), race (White = 1), and Age in years. ANALYTIC STRATEGY Our analyses unfold in several stages. In the initial stages, we evaluate differences in alpha coefficients and bivariate correlations across the two groups of respondents. In the later stages, we estimate a series of multivariate models predicting attribution styles and policy support. These outcome variables are continuous measures. For this reason, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to estimate the models. Cases with missing values are dropped from the analyses using listwise deletion. Multicollinearity is not an issue in the models—the variance inflation factors do not exceed 2.00. For each model, we conducted White’s general test for heteroskedasticity. In several cases, the test was significant. Accordingly, we estimate all models using robust standard errors. When comparing the multivariate effects of different variables within the same group of respondents, we examine the standardized coefficients. However, to compare the 5. As Unnever, Cullen, and Jones (2008: 25) have explained, when many Americans think about crime, “the mental image that they have . . . is that of a menacing African American male.” PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 207 multivariate results between the groups, we evaluate differences in the unstandardized coefficients. This is the most appropriate approach for two reasons. First, all variables are measured on the same numerical scales in both groups. Second, the standardized coeffi- cients for the two groups are not comparable (Kim and Ferree, 1981). As Allison (1999: 191) has explained, “the well-known problem of comparing standardized coefficients for linear models across groups . . . [is] that such comparisons are potentially invalidated by differences in the standard deviations across groups.”6 It bears noting, however, that de- spite this issue, identical conclusions are reached in our experiment regardless of whether one compares the standardized or unstandardized coefficients. FINDINGS We open our analyses by investigating whether using unilaterally positive items to mea- sure crime attributions and policy support may artificially inflate the alpha reliability coef- ficients of resultant scales. Table 1 displays the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for all scales in this study. Observe first that the alpha coefficients for the Racial resentment and Per- ceived risk scales, which are measured identically for both groups of respondents, do not vary in a consistent or substantial way. By contrast, and consistent with our first hypoth- esis, the alpha coefficients for the scales measuring attribution styles and policy support are consistently lower in the bidirectional group, where steps were taken to minimize the effects of acquiescence bias. Indeed, in the bidirectional group, the alpha coefficients for attribution scales are so low (alpha = .52 and .44) as to raise questions about whether these scales have acceptable internal consistencies for use in research. It bears emphasiz- ing that these lower alphas were obtained simply by reversing the direction of a subset of the attribution items, so that respondents had to agree with one item and disagree with an- other to endorse a particular attribution style. The results conform exactly to what should be observed if the high alphas in the unidirectional group were a function of acquiescence bias. The next portion of the analyses explores how acquiescence bias may influence con- clusions about the hydraulic relation hypothesis. We first examine the bivariate correla- tions (not shown) between attribution styles and between Punitiveness and support for Rehabilitation. In the unidirectional group, the correlation between dispositional and sit- uational attributions is –.17, and the correlation between the two types of policy support is –.38. The magnitude of these negative correlations may be deflated by the presence of positively-correlated measurement error introduced by acquiescent responding. Even still, these negative correlations provide some support for the hydraulic relation hypoth- esis. In the bidirectional group, however, where the effects of acquiescence bias are min- imized, support for the hypothesis is considerably stronger. Among the respondents in this group, the respective correlations are –.33 and –.52. In the case of both attribution styles and policy support, the correlations are significantly different across the two groups of respondents (z = 2.267, p = .023; and z = 2.502, p = .012, respectively). Thus, opera- tionalizing these constructs with bidirectional rather than unidirectional sets of questions substantially and significantly increases the size of the hydraulic relation between the re- spective attitudinal phenomena. 6. Williams (2009: 534) put it simply: “In OLS . . . if variances differ across groups, the standardization will also differ across groups, which makes [standardized] coefficients noncomparable.” 208 PICKETT & BAKER Table 4.

To supplement the bivariate analysis, we assess the multivariate relationships between the two attribution styles and between the two types of policy support. Table 4 displays the results of regressing Situational attributions on Dispositional attributions and the con- trols. Table 5 presents the results of regressing Punitiveness on Rehabilitation and the controls.7 An inspection of table 4 reveals that the two attribution styles are not sig- nificantly related in the unidirectional group. In the bidirectional group, however, the effect of Dispositional attributions on Situational attributions is highly significant (p = .001), and the coefficient is nearly twice as large as that for the unidirectional group (b = –.171 vs. –.087, respectively). Similar results emerge for the relationship between the two types of policy support (table 5). To be clear, a significant hydraulic relation exists between Rehabilitation and Punitiveness in both groups, which likely reflects the fact that our measures focus specifically on policy support rather than on policy goals or utility judgments. However, the magnitude of the relationship is more than 50 percent larger in the bidirectional group than in the unidirectional group (b = –.405 vs. –.268, respectively). It should be noted that when the Paternoster et al. (1998) test is used to eval- uate the differences across the experimental groups in the regression coefficients for attribution styles and for policy support, these differences do not reach the 7. For the models shown in tables 4 and 5, it was an arbitrary decision as to which of the attribution scales and which of the policy support scales to treat as the outcome variables. Importantly, the results are unchanged if the Dispositional attributions and Rehabilitation scales are instead taken as the outcome variables. PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 209 Table 5.

Nonetheless, as noted above, the respective bivariate correlations differ significantly across the groups. In addition, the differences in the regression coefficients are both in the hypothesized direction and sizable, and the multivariate hydraulic relation between attribution styles is significant only in the bidirectional group. Taken together, then, we believe the results provide clear support for our second hypothesis. The evidence presented thus far tells a consistent story. It suggests that when unidi- rectional batteries of questions are used to measure crime attributions and policy sup- port, acquiescence bias artificially inflates alpha coefficients and artificially deflates the hydraulic relations between attribution styles and between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation. Attention now turns to an important unanswered question: Does the use of such questions also distort conclusions about the theoretical correlates of policy sup- port? The findings presented in tables 6 and 7 suggest that the answer to this question is likely “yes.” Table 6 displays the results of regressing Punitiveness on attribution styles, racial resentment, and the controls. Table 7 shows the comparable results for support for Rehabilitation. We focus initially on the effects of attributions styles on policy support, net of the con- trols, and then subsequently we evaluate whether these effects are mediated by Racial resentment. Looking first at the results for Punitiveness (table 6), an inspection of mod- els 1 and 3 reveals that for both groups of respondents, a large positive relationship ex- ists between Dispositional attributions and Punitiveness. Notice, however, that among respondents in the unidirectional sample, there is not a significant negative relation- ship between Situational attributions and Punitiveness. This finding runs counter to the 210 PICKETT & BAKER T ab le 6.

In the bidirectional sample, the effect of Situational attri- butions on Punitiveness is highly significant (p = .001) and is more than twice as large as that for the unidirectional sample (b = –.234 vs. –.085, respectively). In addition, the bivariate correlations (not shown) between these two variables differ significantly across the groups (r = –.411 vs. –.203, respectively, z = 3.20, p = .001). Thus, the results ob- tained after taking steps to control acquiescence bias are more supportive of attribution theory. The differences between the two groups in the effects of attribution styles on support for Rehabilitation are less pronounced (models 1 and 3 in table 7). Among both groups, the endorsement of Dispositional attributions is negatively associated with support for Re- habilitation, and the endorsement of Situational attributions is positively associated with support for Rehabilitation. The negative relationship between Dispositional attributions and Rehabilitation is slightly larger for the bidirectional group than for the unidirectional group. This finding is consistent with the idea that uncontrolled acquiescence bias may ar- tificially reduce the magnitude of negative relationships. However, there is another more notable difference between the two groups. In the unidirectional group, only three of the seven factors that predict support for Rehabilitation—Dispositional attributions, Con- servatism, and Education—also are associated with Punitiveness (see model 1 in tables 6 and 7). By contrast, for the bidirectional group, the same four variables—Dispositional attributions, Situational attributions, Perceived crime trend, and Conservatism—are asso- ciated, in opposite directions, with support for Rehabilitation and Punitiveness (see model 3 in tables 6 and 7). Stated differently, when bidirectional questions are used to con- struct the scales, the two types of policy support have similar, but reversed, relational properties. The final portion of the analyses evaluates the question of whether acquiescence bias influences the extent to which Racial resentment mediates the effects of attribution styles on policy support. As an initial step, we estimate preliminary models (not shown) that ex- amine whether crime attributions are correlated with racial resentment. For both groups of respondents, the two attribution scales strongly predict Racial resentment; indeed, their standardized effects are larger than that of any other variable examined except Conser- vatism.9 The endorsement of Dispositional attributions is associated with increased Racial Resentment, whereas the endorsement of Situational attributions is associated with lower levels of Racial resentment. Having determined that crime attributions are associated with Racial resentment, we now investigate whether the effects of the former on policy support are mediated by the 8. Unnever et al. (2010: 446) found a significant positive relationship between situational attributions and punitiveness. 9. Our reliance on cross-sectional data prevents us from empirically establishing the causal order of the relationship between crime attributions and racial resentment. We thus draw on extant theory to make causal-order assumptions. PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 213 latter. Models 2 and 4 in tables 6 and 7 display the relevant regression results. The find- ings are summarized easily. In the bidirectional group, Racial resentment is the strongest predictor of both Punitiveness and support for Rehabilitation, and it mediates a sizeable proportion of the effects of both attribution styles on both outcome variables. Specif- ically, in the bidirectional group, Racial resentment mediates 24 percent (Sobel test: b = .142, z = 4.956, p < .001) of the total effect of Dispositional attributions on Puni- tiveness and 35 percent (Sobel test: b = –.082, z = –2.992, p = .003) of the effect of Sit- uational attributions on this outcome variable. Additionally, among respondents in this group, Racial resentment mediates 48 percent (Sobel test: b = –.113, z = –4.521, p < .001) of the total effect of Dispositional attributions on support for Rehabilitation and 24 per- cent (Sobel test: b = .065, z = 2.888, p = .004) of the effect of Situational attributions on this outcome variable.10,11 This is not the case for the unidirectional group. Indeed, the findings for the respon- dents in this group are dramatically different than those for the bidirectional group. In this group, Racial resentment is positively associated with Punitiveness and mediates roughly 17 percent (Sobel test: b = .089, z = 3.961, p < .001) of the effect of Dispositional at- tributions on this outcome variable, but the Dispositional attributions scale remains the strongest predictor of punitive attitudes. As before, the Situational attributions variable is not associated with Punitiveness. What is most striking, however, is that in this group, Racial resentment is not related significantly to support for Rehabilitation, net of attribu- tion styles and the controls. In the unidirectional group, then, neither Situational attri- butions nor Racial resentment is associated in a similar way with both Punitiveness and support for Rehabilitation. Additionally, the coefficients for the effect of Racial resent- ment on support for Rehabilitation differ significantly (z = 2.280, p = .023) across the experimental groups. In short, measuring crime attributions and policy support with bidirectional rather than with unidirectional batteries of questions yields a pattern of multivariate relationships that is less supportive of the pragmatism thesis. Specifically, the pragmatism thesis ar- gues that rather than constituting converses of each other, punitiveness and support for rehabilitation are independent attitudinal phenomena with distinct relational properties (Mascini and Houtman, 2006). Contrasting this argument, the results show that in the bidirectional group, racial animus, stemming in part from crime attributions, is the prin- cipal determinant of views about both punitive policies and rehabilitative programs. It is not in the unidirectional group. Taken together, the multivariate findings provide strong support for our third hypothesis.12 10. In supplementary analyses (available in the online supporting information; see footnote 11), we used structural equation models to confirm that attribution styles have significant indirect effects on policy support through racial resentment. 11. Additional supporting information can be found in the listing for this article in the Wiley Online Library at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/crim.2011.52.issue-2/issuetoc. 12. The effects of several of the control variables, including Conservatism and Education, on Punitive- ness in table 6, and on support for Rehabilitation in table 7, differ in magnitude and significance across the experimental groups. It is possible that these differences reflect either the effect of a given variable on the tendency to respond acquiescently to questions about crime and justice or the influence of acquiescence bias on patterns of mediation. However, none of these differences are significant, nor were they hypothesized a priori; thus, we suggest caution when interpreting them. 214 PICKETT & BAKER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Several previous studies have failed to find a hydraulic relation—a sizable negative correlation—between dispositional and situational attributions, or between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation. On the basis of those studies, scholars have largely dis- missed the hydraulic relation hypothesis (Cullen et al., 2000; Mascini and Houtman, 2002, 2006; McCorkle, 1993; Pickett, Mancini, and Mears, 2013) and have concluded that “most Americans . . . are pragmatic in their approach to crime control” (Unnever et al., 2010: 449)—to them, “the idea of punishment versus rehabilitation is a false dichotomy” (Bishop, 2006: 657). Our results suggest that it is premature to draw this conclusion. Specifically, the findings indicate that the failure in prior studies to account for acquies- cent responding makes it difficult to determine whether extant research findings present an accurate picture of popular sentiments. To reiterate, most previous studies have used sets of Likert questions that are all pos- itively worded to measure crime attributions and policy support. This measurement ap- proach, however, allows respondents to obtain high values on survey items and resulting scales simply by adopting an acquiescence response style, in which they answer ques- tions affirmatively regardless of content (Krosnick, 1999). Our findings suggest that using this measurement approach results in 1) consistently inflated alpha coefficients for scales measuring crime attributions and policy support; 2) consistently deflated hydraulic rela- tions between attribution styles, and between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation; and 3) inconsistent correlations among attribution styles, racial resentment, and policy support. Our findings have important theoretical and empirical implications. First, the results show that when scales are measured with bidirectional sets of questions, which is an ap- proach that reduces the influence of acquiescence bias on findings, the hydraulic relation hypothesis is consistently supported, and thus, there is little evidence of pragmatism. This is not the case in the unidirectional group. Among these respondents, we find no rela- tionship between attribution styles, net of the controls, and a weaker hydraulic relation between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation than in the bidirectional group. In contrast to the pragmatism thesis, the results also show that when bidirectional question batteries are used, punitiveness and support for rehabilitation have similar, but reversed, relational properties. For example, in the bidirectional group, there is consis- tent support for attribution theory across both types of policy support—dispositional attributions are positively related to punitiveness and negatively related to support for rehabilitation, whereas situational attributions are negatively related to punitiveness and positively related to support for rehabilitation. This does not occur in the unidirectional group, where situational attributions do not have the hypothesized effect on punitiveness. Likewise, in the bidirectional group, we find consistent support for Sears and Henry’s (2003) theory of racialized individualism. Those authors theorized that the effects of racialized individualism on policy views should be mediated in part by racial resentment. Assuming, as we do, that crime attributions tap a dimension of racialized individualism, this is exactly what occurs in the bidirectional group for both types of policy support. Specifically, among these respondents, crime attributions strongly predict racial resent- ment, and racial resentment, in turn, partially mediates the effects of attribution styles on both punitiveness and support for rehabilitation. The results are much different in the PRAGMATISM OR ACQUIESCENCE? 215 unidirectional group, where racial resentment is not significantly related to support for rehabilitation, net of attribution styles and the controls. Note that in the bidirectional group, but not in the unidirectional group, we find that racial resentment is the strongest predictor of both punitiveness and support for rehabilitation. This finding is consistent with those emerging in prior studies that use forced-choice questions, which reduce acquiescent responding, to gauge policy support (Unnever and Cullen, 2010; Unnever, Cullen, and Jones, 2008). This increases our con- fidence that in our experiment, we obtained more valid findings when using bidirectional rather than unidirectional batteries of questions to measure attribution styles and policy support. A key empirical implication flowing from our findings is that researchers examin- ing attribution styles and policy support should take steps to minimize the effects of acquiescence bias on results. Recall that the strongest predictor of the effect of ac- quiescent responding on scale scores is the degree to which scales are unbalanced (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001). Thus, a simple way to reduce acquiescence bias is to use bidirectional sets of questions to construct scales, as we do in the current study. One limitation of the method, however, is that it does not remove acquiescent responses; rather, it merely moves them to the middle of scales, where they have less influence on findings (Krosnick and Presser, 2010).13 An alternative approach can be used when surveys contain several batteries of questions measuring unrelated constructs. Here, re- searchers can construct an indicator of the extent to which respondents answer affirma- tively across heterogeneous items. This measure can then be used to remove (through residualization) the variance in substantive scales that results from acquiescent respond- ing (Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001). Also, it is possible, when several balanced sets of questions are available, to use structural equation modeling to identify the la- tent acquiescence factor underlying responses to survey items (Billiet and McClendon, 2000). Perhaps the best approach for reducing acquiescence bias, however, is to develop bet- ter survey questions for measuring crime attributions and policy support (see Krosnick and Presser, 2010; Saris et al., 2010). This is particularly important in the case of crime attributions because it is not clear that the types of questions that are typically used to measure attribution styles—statements about why “most offenders commit crimes”—are ideal. In previous investigations, the use of such questions has generally resulted in scales with alpha coefficients below the conventional threshold (.70) for acceptable reliability (see, e.g., Carroll et al., 1987; Cochran et al., 2003; Grasmick and McGill, 1994). And our experiment shows that when bidirectional sets of these questions are used, the reliability of the resulting scales is even lower. A fruitful way forward might be to use sets of “item-specific” survey questions (Krosnick and Presser, 2010; Saris et al., 2010) to measure crime attributions and pol- icy support. Item-specific questions are those that include response options that relate directly to the specific question stem. The evidence suggests that such questions reduce ac- quiescent responding and increase the overall quality of responses (Saris et al., 2010). For 13. Another potential limitation of using this method is that even when bidirectional question batter- ies are used, acquiescent responding can deflate the negative correlations between positively and negatively worded items (Green and Citrin, 1994). For this reason, our results likely provide a conservative estimate of the influence of acquiescence bias on findings. 216 PICKETT & BAKER instance, to measure crime attributions with item-specific questions, researchers could re- place items asking respondents how much they disagree/agree with statements like “most offenders commit crimes as a way of coping with poor living conditions,” with questions such as follows: 1. Thinking about the criminals in this country, how many would you say commit their crimes as a way to cope with poor living conditions: none, a few, a good bit, or most? 2. How often are poor living conditions the primary reason that someone commits a crime in this country: very often, often, sometimes, rarely, or never? One limitation of our study is that we analyze data from members of an opt-in online panel. Thus, our findings should not be interpreted as demonstrating an absence of prag- matism about criminal justice among the American public. Rather, they only illustrate the problems with the methodology used in previous studies to test the pragmatism the- sis. It is the case, however, that we found little evidence of pragmatism among the Internet panelists in our experiment once steps were taken to minimize acquiescence bias. If this finding replicates with a representative sample of Americans, then the implication would be that at the individual level, views about criminal justice generally fall on a continuum from punitiveness to nonpunitiveness, where nonpunitiveness entails support for expand- ing rehabilitative programming. This would suggest that at any given point in time, most individual citizens have a directional preference—involving either a desire to expand puni- tive policies or a desire to expand rehabilitative policies—for how they would like policy makers to deal with the crime problem (see, e.g., Bernard and Kurlychek, 2010). Inter- estingly, prior research has shown that at the macro level, public mood about criminal justice does fall on a continuum from punitiveness to nonpunitiveness (Nicholson-Crotty, Peterson, and Ramirez, 2009; Stimson, 1999, 2004) and has become less punitive in recent years (Ramirez, 2013). Also, it is important to note that because the respondents in our experiment were volunteer panelists who had agreed to participate regularly in surveys, they may have been more motivated to respond accurately to survey questions, and they may have had more experience at doing so, than members of the general public (see Chang and Krosnick, 2009). Relative to most types of respondents, then, the participants in our ex- periment may have been less likely to adopt an acquiescent response style. Thus, our results may underestimate the extent to which such stylistic responding biases findings when unidirectional batteries of questions are used to measure views about crime and justice. We close by emphasizing that whereas our focus has been restricted to examining the influence of different measurement approaches on conclusions about public pragmatism and the theoretical correlates of policy support, the effects of acquiescence bias are of broader concern. The practice of using unidirectional sets of Likert questions to con- struct scales is widespread in the criminological literature. For example, this is the typical method used to operationalize concepts such as low self-control (Grasmick et al., 1993), legal cynicism (Kirk and Matsuda, 2011; Sampson and Bartusch, 1998), endorsement of the code of the street (Mears et al., 2013; Stewart and Simons, 2010), and procedural jus- tice (Baker et al., 2014; Mazerolle et al., 2013; Tankebe, 2013). However, researchers us- ing such measures have rarely considered how acquiescent responding may bias findings.

Appendix A: QUESTION WORDING FOR RACIAL RESENTMENT AND CONTROLS Racial resentment is measured with the following five items: 1. “There is a lot of discrimination against Blacks in the U.S. today, limiting their chances to get ahead.” 2. “It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if Blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as Whites.” 3. “Irish, Italians, Jewish, and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors.” 4. “Over the past few years, Blacks have gotten less than they deserve.” 222 PICKETT & BAKER 5. “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class.” Perceived risk of victimization is measured as the average of responses to the five items in the following question: On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means “not at all likely” and 7 means “very likely,” how likely is it that someone will try to commit the following crimes against you or a member of your family in the next five years: 1) Break into your house? 2) Beat you up on the street? 3) Rob or mug you? 4) Rape or sexually assault you? 5) Murder you? The variable Perceived crime trend is measured with responses (1 = decreased greatly, 5 = increased greatly) to the following question: “In your best judgment, how much has the crime rate in the U.S. decreased or increased in the past five years?” The News con- sumption variable gauges the number of days each week the respondent is exposed to national evening news. The specific question was as follows: “In a typical WEEK, on how many days do you do each of the following . . . watch national evening news like CNN?” Conservatism is a measure of respondents’ political ideology. It is measured with the ques- tion: “How would you describe yourself politically?” The response options were 1 = very liberal, 2 = liberal, 3 = middle of the road, 4 = conservative, and 5 = very conservative.
