The GeoGraphic conTexT of poliTical aTTiTudes amonG miGranT-oriGin individuals in europe By rahsaan maxwell* poliTical trust and government satisfaction are valuable re-sources. when citizens have high levels of trust and satisfaction they are more likely to support and cooperate with their elected rep- resentatives. in comparison, when citizens are distrustful and unsatis- fied, they are more likely to protest and disrupt the basic functions of government.1 admittedly some cynicism and skepticism can be useful (when combined with patriotism and a commitment to the national community) for stimulating citizens to monitor their elected represen- tatives and participate actively in politics.2 Yet governments all over the world fear citizens who are so unhappy with the political status quo that they might turn to violent revolution. in contemporary europe, migrants and their descendants are the focus of such fears about dissatisfied citizens and the potential for revolt. for example, high-profile terrorist activity committed by mi- grant-origin individuals has led some natives to view some migrants as security threats.3 riots among migrant-origin communities across * The research for this article was partially funded by the Transatlantic academy. previous ver- sions were presented at the racism, immigration, and citizenship in contemporary plural societies conference at Johns hopkins university (2009); the comparative approaches to immigration and religious and ethnic diversity workshop at princeton university (2011); and the 2011 council for european studies annual conference. i would like to thank randall hansen, lingxin hao, ray la raja, Gary marks, efrén pérez, Brian schaffner, lester spence, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback on earlier drafts. 1 hetherington 1998. 2 citrin 1974. 3 prominent examples include the bombing of trains in madrid in 2004 and in the london trans- port system in 2005, but the fear of attacks from extremist sleeper cells has spread across europe.

The research provides a new perspective for understanding the broad contours of migrant integration and shifts the debate away from whether or not migrants have positive attitudes about European society. The fact that migrant- and native-origin individuals have similar levels of trust and satisfaction is suggestive of successful attitudinal integration, irrespective of whether those attitudes are positive or negative. ABSTRACT This article examines political trust and government satisfaction among migrant-origin individuals in Europe. While much of the current literature on migrant political attitudes focuses on the positive or negative ramifications of individual-level integration outcomes, the author takes a different approach. He claims that the best way to understand political trust and government satisfaction among migrant-origin individuals is through the strong positive correlation with trust and satisfaction among native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. One implication of this argument is that migrant-origin individuals' trust and satisfaction are closer to native-origin individuals geographic context of political at titudes 117 4 Garton ash 2005; Joly 2007; Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 2009b. 5 Buruma 2006; caldwell 2009; Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 2009a. 6 existing literature has numerous definitions of migrant integration. for the purposes of this ar- ticle, the term is used very broadly to refer to the general and complex economic, cultural, social, and political process of becoming part of the host society. the continent have contributed to tense atmospheres in many urban areas.4 furthermore, there have been numerous conflicts over whether muslim religious practices and values are compatible with contempo- rary european secularism.5 underlying all of these issues are concerns that migrant-origin individuals are segregated from native-origin eu- ropeans and are not committed to mainstream politics. i address these concerns in this article by analyzing political attitudes among migrant- origin individuals in contemporary europe. The two attitudes i examine are political trust and government satis- faction. These allow me to explore whether migrant-origin individuals approve of european political systems, which is especially relevant be- cause migrant-origin individuals are often considered out of sync with mainstream politics. To obtain a general overview of political attitudes i use data from across eight years and four rounds of the european social survey (ess). These data allow me to examine political attitudes among a wide range of migrant-origin individuals in twenty-two eu- ropean countries. This research design is well-suited to a general over- view of how integration is proceeding in europe.6 The argument presented here focuses on subnational geographic contexts. i claim that the best way of understanding political trust and government satisfaction among migrant-origin individuals in europe is through the strong positive correlation with trust and satisfaction among native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. This proposition breaks away from the conventional debate about how in- dividual-level integration outcomes like assimilation or socioeconomic status shape political attitudes. my argument builds on the literature about how contexts of reception shape migrant integration. Yet to the extent the existing literature analyzes natives’ attitudes, it primarily fo- cuses on variation in levels of xenophobia to explain why some contexts of reception are more hospitable than others. my focus on the strong positive correlation between native- and migrant-origin individuals’ at- titudes offers a new way of understanding the role native-origin indi- viduals’ attitudes play in migrant integration. it is important to note that i do not claim migrant- and native-origin individuals have the exact same levels of trust and satisfaction in every subnational region. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This shifts the integration debate away from whether or not migrants have positive attitudes about european society. The fact that migrant- and native-origin individuals have similar levels of trust and satisfaction suggests successful attitudinal integration—irrespective of whether those attitudes are positive or negative. The next section reviews the existing literature on migrant integra- tion and the formation of political attitudes. i then present my argu- ment about how attitudes of migrant-origin individuals reflect those of native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. The third section discusses the data and measures used in the rest of the article. i present results on political attitudes among migrant-origin individuals in europe, compare the significance of numerous independent vari- ables, and demonstrate the importance of correlations between mi- grant- and native-origin individuals in the same geographic context in the fourth section. The fifth section discusses a series of robustness checks and the sixth examines potential mechanisms behind the dy- namic of subnational attitudinal correlations. i present my conclusions in the final section. existing literature: the positive and negative ramifica- tions of individual-level integration much of the existing literature on migrant political attitudes debates the ramifications of individual-level integration indicators. The two most relevant types of individual-level indicators are assimilation (lan- guage use, country of birth, cultural distance, or citizenship, for ex- ample) and socioeconomic status (education and occupation). one traditional perspective has been that positive assimilation and socioeconomic outcomes are associated with more positive political at- titudes while negative outcomes are associated with more negative atti- tudes.7 The logic is that migrants who are better assimilated have spent more time in the host society and share more cultural practices with na- tives so they will be more comfortable and more likely to express posi- tive sentiments about the society. migrants with better socioeconomic outcomes should be proud of their material success and be more ca- pable of effectively interacting with the host country’s political system, 7 dahl 1961; Gordon 1964; moynihan and Glazer 1963; Tribalat 1995; Triblat 1996. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This research primarily focuses on how assimilation shapes attitudes among first-generation migrants and across generations. ac- cording to this literature, newly arrived migrants are more likely than natives to be optimistic because they left home to improve their lives and have incentives to view the host society as a positive environment. in addition, many migrants left societies with significant economic problems and weak democratic institutions. These migrants are more likely to look favorably upon the relative economic prosperity and democratic stability in europe (or north america) than natives who are more sensitive to the shortcomings of their societies. over time and across generations these dynamics are likely to fade and migrants who have spent more time in the host country and are more assimilated will be less likely to have such positive political attitudes.9 while this litera- ture predicts less positive political attitudes among second-generation, as opposed to first-generation, migrant-origin individuals, it does not generate specific hypotheses about the relationship between attitudes among second-generation and native-origin individuals. an alternate perspective: the importance of subnational contexts The argument in this article largely sidesteps the debate about how individual-level integration outcomes shape migrant political attitudes. my results provide some support for each perspective in the existing literature. i find that better socioeconomic outcomes for the first and second generations and better assimilation outcomes among the second 8 caldwell 2009; huntington 2004. in recent years these arguments have been particularly focused on muslim migrants as one of the most unassimilated and anti-mainstream groups in europe.

To account for this dynamic i highlight two mechanisms. The first is structural. i claim that migrants and natives in the same subnational region will be exposed to similar political stimuli, events, and issues and that these should differ from those experienced by residents (mi- grant or native origin) of other regions. The second mechanism is in- terpersonal. i claim that political attitudes are formed through social interactions and migrant-origin individuals are most likely to interact with fellow residents of the same subnational region. my claim about the structural mechanism builds on two strands of existing research. The first examines the ways in which political, economic, cultural, and demographic aspects of local environments shape attitudes.10 The logic is that individuals develop political atti- tudes based on the political issues and dynamics that are most relevant to their lives, which is partially a function of their local environment. however, to the extent that this literature compares groups, it often focuses on the ways in which majority and minority groups have differ- ent attitude-formation dynamics, even in the same local environment.11 my argument departs from this literature because although i acknowl- edge some differences between migrant- and native-origin individuals, i claim that attitudinal variation between migrant- and native-origin individuals is smaller than the attitudinal variation within each group across subnational regions.12 The second strand of research about structural mechanisms that in- fluences my argument is more directly focused on migrant integration. This literature explicitly analyzes contextual factors—citizenship laws, 10 Blalock 1967; Gay 2004; hopkins 2011; hopkins 2010; hopkins 2009; huckfeldt 1986; welch et al. 2001. 11 sigelman and niemi 2001; welch et al. 2001; wong 2007. 12 The notion that two groups can have some unique attitudinal dynamics yet primarily be shaped by similar learning processes builds on research from the united states about parallel publics. see page and shapiro 1992. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The second mechanism focuses on interpersonal dynamics and builds on a range of research that examines the ways in which people are influenced by those with whom they regularly interact.14 for exam- ple, people may be persuaded by the particular political perspectives of others in their daily lives, they may choose to become more like certain individuals in their environments, or they may converge with others in their environment as they share attitudes and behaviors. one of the contributions of my argument is the suggestion that these dynamics may exist between migrant- and native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. To the extent that the existing literature deals with interactions between diverse racial, ethnic, or national-origin groups in the same geographic context, it often frames the debate as whether interpersonal contact will lead to cooperation or conflict among groups that are fundamentally different.15 my argument is agnostic about the extent to which interpersonal contact leads migrant-origin individuals to like or dislike native-origin individuals. i focus instead on the extent to which migrant- and native-origin individuals share fundamental similarities in political attitude formation. another approach from the existing literature on segmented as- similation is more flexible and conceptualizes multiple ways in which migrant-origin individuals may adopt natives’ attitudes. however, the core of this literature connects those attitudinal adoption pathways to assimilation and socioeconomic outcomes.16 my argument is that 13 Banting and Kymlicka 2006; Brubaker 1992; Garbaye 2005; ireland 2008; ireland 1994; Koop- mans et al. 2005; portes and rumbaut 2006; portes and rumbaut 2001; safran 1997; soysal 1994; waters 1999. 14 Blalock 1967; christakis and fowler 2009; huckfeldt 1986; welch et al. 2001. 15 mcclain et al. 2006; rudolph and popp 2010. 16 portes and rumbaut 2001; portes and rumbaut 2006. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The specific countries in the ess changed across rounds, however, so i selected the twenty-two countries that were in- cluded in at least three of the four rounds.17 one of the main advantages of the ess is the combination of detailed questions on political attitudes and large samples of foreign-born re- spondents across a wide range of european countries. To identify first- generation migrants, i selected respondents who were born abroad and whose parents were also both born abroad. By selecting foreign-born respondents with parents born abroad i omit european respondents who were born abroad in european colonies, european respondents who were born abroad during travel or short-term relocation by their parents, as well as “ethnic natives” who were born abroad due to wars, forced population movements, and border realignments. To identify second-generation migrant-origin individuals, i selected respondents who were born in the country of residence with at least one parent born abroad. natives are identified as respondents born in the country of residence with both parents born in the country as well. These defi- nitions produce pooled samples of 10,042 first-generation migrants, 11,636 second-generation migrants, and 134,271 native-origin indi- viduals. despite these large migrant-origin sample sizes, one of the draw- backs of using the ess to study migrant integration is its practice of conducting interviews only in the official language of the host country. doing so creates two potential sources of sample bias relevant to this study. one, it is possible that the sample overrepresents native-origin individuals and underrepresents migrant-origin individuals. Two, it is possible that among migrant-origin individuals the sample overrepre- sents migrants who are well-integrated (that is, those who are comfort- able using the host country language). 17 The twenty-two countries are austria, Belgium, czech republic, denmark, estonia, finland, france, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, hungary, ireland, the netherlands, norway, poland, portu- gal, slovakia, slovenia, spain, sweden, switzerland, and the ukraine. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The only exceptions to this are austria (where the ess sample is 7.8 percent and the actual number is 14 per- cent) and Germany (where the ess sample is 8 percent and the actual number is 12.9 percent). nonetheless, the substantive results are the same whether austria and Germany are excluded from or included in the analysis. The second source of potential bias is more difficult to address as there is reason to believe that the ess includes a sample of migrants that is less well-integrated than the actual migrant population in eu- rope. for example, the percentage of migrants with host-country citi- zenship in the ess sample is higher than in the actual population.18 in addition, the ess sample undercounts certain national-origin groups that are often considered particularly difficult to integrate.19 This ob- servation is especially relevant for my argument because it suggests that the positive attitudinal correlation among migrant- and native-origin individuals may be stronger in the ess sample than in the actual popu- lation where there are more poorly integrated migrants. as such, my results should be interpreted with caution and not extended to the en- tire migrant-origin population in europe, especially to hard-to-reach and undocumented migrants. nonetheless, there is a wide range of migrants in the ess sample with different socioeconomic outcomes, cultural practices, and national backgrounds, which increases the reli- ability of my results. moreover, one of the key points in my argument is that subnational correlations between natives and migrants are strong irrespective of the individual-level integration outcomes. finally, to en- sure that my results in the overall sample are not driven by an overrep- resentation of respondents from national-origin groups that face fewer integration difficulties, i analyze the data among different subsamples: western-origin versus non-western-origin respondents or european- 18 aleksynska 2008. 19 for example, the 2004 french census finds that first-generation Turkish migrants are approxi- mately 0.3 percent of the overall french population and approximately 5 percent of the first-genera- tion immigrant population. in the pooled ess sample, first-generation Turkish respondents are 0.1 per- cent of the overall french sample and 1.6 percent of the first-generation immigrant sample in france. similarly, the 2009 dutch census finds that first- and second-generation Turkish-origin individuals are approximately 2.3 percent of the netherlands’ population. in the pooled ess sample, first- and second-generation Turkish-origin respondents are 1 percent of the overall dutch sample. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The ess includes eight items that measure political trust and gov- ernment satisfaction. factor analysis suggests that there are three un- derlying dimensions to these items, which i use to generate three latent variables. Table 1 presents the scoring coefficients and lists the items used for each latent variable. political trust is constructed from items about trust in the national parliament, trust in the legal system, and trust in the police. macro government satisfaction gauges broad opin- ions about the host society and is constructed from items about satis- faction with the national government, the way democracy works in the country, and the economy. satisfaction with government services mea- sures attitudes about specific programs and is derived from questions about satisfaction with the state of education and the state of health services. each latent variable is scaled from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive). To test the correlation between political attitudes of migrant- and native-origin individuals living in the same subnational region, i con- struct a measure of the mean political attitude score among native- origin individuals in each subnational region for each of the three latent variables. subnational coding in the ess uses the nomenclature of the statistical Territorial units (nuts), but unfortunately not all countries are coded at the same level of specificity. To retain the maximum amount of information i use the most fine-grained classification available for each country. additional analysis in which each country was coded up to the most general level (nuts-1) produced similar results, although the effects were weaker because the regions were much larger. full details on the subnational regions are shown in appendix Table a2. To evaluate the literature on individual-level assimilation, i include variables on length of time in the host country, whether or not re- spondents have host-country citizenship, whether or not respondents primarily speak the host country language at home, and whether re- spondents are of western or non-western origin.20 To evaluate the literature on individual-level socioeconomic status, i include dummy variables for educational and occupational outcomes. more details on coding can be found in the appendix. 20 The measure of western/non-western origins is intended as a crude proxy for cultural distance. respondents are coded as having non-western origins if they were born in or have at least one parent who was born in africa, asia, or central or south america. The terminology ‘western’ is admittedly loose, as migrants from Jamaica are coded as non-western while migrants from australia are coded as western. The intention is to identify non-western respondents as people less likely to have european origins. i also conduct supplementary analysis with more precise countries of origin. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This supports literature claim- ing that assimilation across generations leads to more negative political attitudes. however, although the attitudinal gaps between each of the groups is statistically significant at p<.001, the substantive differences are rather small: 0.01 to 0.03 points on a scale of 0 to 1. This suggests that generational issues alone are a limited explanation of political at- titudes among migrant-origin individuals To explore the determinants of political trust and government satisfaction more closely, Tables 2 and 3 present results from a series of multilevel mixed-effects maximum likelihood models with respondents clustered by country and region.21 The models in Table 2 are for the full sample of first- and second- generation migrant-origin individuals. The results support my argu- ment as they suggest that migrant-origin individuals who live in sub- national regions where natives have more positive political attitudes are more likely to have positive political attitudes themselves. The results also support the literature that claims assimilation leads to more nega- tive political attitudes, as being born in the host country, having west- ern origins, primarily speaking the host-country language at home, and 21 all controls were estimated as fixed effects with country and regional intercepts set as random effects using the xtmixed command in stata 11. dummy variables for survey waves are included to control for time and survey-specific effects. table 1 summary of latent variable construction Scoring Survey Item Coefficient Latent Variable Trust in country’s parliament .214 political trust Trust in the legal system .483 Trust in country’s police .321 satisfied with democracy .239 macro government satisfaction satisfied with national Government .417 satisfied with economy .265 satisfied with state of education .368 government services satisfaction satisfied with state of health services .353 ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The results in Tables 2 and 3 support both perspectives from the literature referred to above on individual-level integration and migrant political attitudes. The results also support my argument about the im- portance of subnational attitudinal correlations between migrant- and native-origin individuals. To get a better sense of which arguments have larger substantive implications, figure 2 presents the effects of independent variables moving from their minimum to their maximum values on predicted political attitude scores. The results in figure 2 are calculated from the models in Table 3. They plot the change in the predicted political attitude score across dif- ferent values of the assimilation variables, the socioeconomic variables, and the mean score for natives’ political attitudes at the subnational level, while all other variables are held constant at their means (or set to zero for dummy variables).22 The plots suggest that natives’ politi- cal attitudes have a stronger relationship with migrant-origin politi- cal attitudes among both generations and across each dependent vari- able than assimilation or socioeconomic status. for example, different socioeconomic outcomes are associated with changes of 0.01 to 0.05 points in political attitudes among migrant-origin individuals. moving across the assimilation values is associated with changes of 0.08 to 0.09 points in political attitude scores among fi rst-generation migration- origin individuals and of 0.01 points or less among second-generation individuals. in comparison, in subnational regions with the most posi- tive native-origin individuals, migrant-origin individuals have pre- dicted political attitude scores 0.15 to 0.20 points higher than those in subnational regions with the most negative native-origin individuals. These results suggest that spatial variation in migrant political atti- tudes is greater than attitudinal variation across assimilation and socio- economic outcomes, but it is important to note that this does not nec- essarily mean that spatial variation is greater than all individual-level variation. a series of models with respondents clustered by country and by region and with no covariates yields intraclass correlations (iccs) of roughly 0.20 for each dependent variable and each generation.23 22 for dummy variables, minimum is calculated as zero and maximum is calculated as one. for the mean political attitude score among natives and time spent in the host country, minimum is calculated for the bottom 15th percentile and maximum is calculated for the top 15th percentile. 23 among fi rst-generation migrants, the icc for political trust is 0.21 and the iccs for macro satis- faction and services satisfaction are both 0.20. for second-generation migrant-origin individuals, the iccs for political trust and services satisfaction are both 0.20 and for macro satisfaction the icc is 0.17. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This is a substantial but not overwhelming percentage. however, when a control variable is added for native-origin individuals’ mean political attitudes at the subnational level, the iccs mostly drop to below 0.05.24 This suggests that the positive at- titudinal correlation between migrants and natives living in the same sub- national region accounts for most of the spatial variation in attitudes.25 24 among fi rst-generation migrants, the icc for political trust is 0.03, for macro satisfaction it is 0.06, and for services satisfaction it is 0.05. for second-generation migrant-origin individuals, the iccs are all 0.01 with the inclusion of a control variable for natives’ mean attitude score. 25 it is worth noting that most of the spatial variation in migrant attitudes is at the national, as opposed to the subnational, level. This article focuses on subnational variation because it allows for a fi ner grain of detail and is the level at which migrant and native attitudes are more strongly correlated. however, one can imagine that if even more fi ne-grained data were available (at the city or neighbor- hood level, for example) the spatial variation in subnational attitudes would be greater. future work should explore migrant political attitudes across multiple levels of spatial variation in more detail. .7 .6 .5 .4 .3 pr ed ic te d po lit ic al a tt itu de s co re s 1st Gen 2nd Gen macro satisfaction 1st Gen 2nd Gen political Trust 1st Gen 2nd Gen services satisfaction n at iv e a ss im se s n at iv e a ss im se s n at iv e a ss im se s n at iv e a ss im se s n at iv e a ss im se s n at iv e a ss im se s figure 2 effects of independent variables moving from minimum to maximum values on predicted political attitude scoresa a results are calculated from models in Table 3.

Yet as seen in figure 1, this does not mean that mi- grant- and native-origin individuals have the same levels of political trust and satisfaction. in fact, the results also support the existing lit- erature claiming that migration-specifi c dynamics lead to particularly high trust and satisfaction among the fi rst generation. nonetheless, i claim that migrant-origin individuals’ trust and satisfaction scores are closer to those of native-origin individuals in the same subnational re- gion than they are to migrant-origin individuals elsewhere in europe. To depict the close relationship between migrant- and native-origin attitudes across the range of values, figure 3 plots native-origin in- dividuals’ mean political attitude scores on the x-axis with the corre- sponding score of migrant-origin individuals in the same subnational region on the y-axis. The thin black reference lines in each graph in- dicate the points where migrant and native-origin political attitude scores are exactly the same and most of the plots are extremely close to that line.26 This is further evidence of the strong positive correla- tion between migrant- and native-origin political attitudes at the sub- national level.27 in addition, evidence suggests that the statistical dis- persion for migrant-origin individuals’ mean political attitude scores across subnational regions is greater than it is for the subnational gap between migrant and native-origin individuals’ attitudes.28 in summary, this section presented evidence that the political attitudes of native-origin individuals in the same subnational region provide more leverage than individual-level assimilation or socioeconomic outcomes for predicting migrant political trust and government satisfaction. 26 The mean gap at the subnational level between political trust among native-origin individuals and the fi rst generation is 0.004 points, for native-origin individuals and the second generation it is -0.007 points. The mean gap at the subnational level between macro government satisfaction among native-origin individuals and the fi rst generation is 0.03 points, for native-origin individuals and the second generation it is -0.005 points. finally, the mean gap at the subnational level between govern- ment services satisfaction among native-origin individuals and the fi rst generation is 0.03 points, for native-origin individuals and the second generation it is -0.001 points. 27 for native-origin and fi rst-generation respondents the pearson’s correlation coeffi cient for politi- cal trust is 0.78, for macro government satisfaction it is 0.72, and for government services satisfaction it is 0.77. for native-origin and second-generation respondents the pearson’s correlation coeffi cient for political trust is 0.91, for macro government satisfaction it is 0.91, and for government services satisfaction it is 0.90. 28 among fi rst-generation respondents, the standard deviation for the mean political trust scores is 0.09 compared to 0.05 for the mean subnational gap with native-origin individuals. for macro govern- ment satisfaction the standard deviations are 0.08 and 0.06. for government services satisfaction the standard deviations are 0.07 and 0.05. among second-generation respondents, the standard deviation for the mean political trust scores is 0.08, compared to 0.03 for the mean subnational gap with native- origin individuals. for macro government satisfaction the standard deviations are 0.07 and 0.03. for government services satisfaction the standard deviations are 0.07 and 0.03. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The fi rst potential issue is that i have analyzed a heterogeneous group of migrant-origin individuals. it is possible that the strong positive sub- national correlation with native-origin individuals’ political attitudes is stronger for certain migrant-origin individuals and weaker for others. for example, much of the debate around migrant integration in europe is focused on migrants with non-western origins because they are as- sumed to have fewer cultural similarities and more diffi culty relating to natives than migrants from neighboring european countries. most mi- grants in europe have western origins (in the ess sample 65 percent of fi rst-generation migrants and 82 percent of second-generation migrants m ig ra nt s at is fa ct io n m ig ra nt s at is fa ct io n 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1 native-origin Government services satisfaction 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1 native-origin macro Government satisfaction 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1 native-origin political Trust m ig ra nt s at is fa ct io n m ig ra nt s at is fa ct io n m ig ra nt T ru st 1 .8 .6 .4 .2 0 1 .8 .6 .4 .2 0 1 .8 .6 .4 .2 0 1st generation 1st generation1st generation 2nd generation 2nd generation2nd generation figure 3 predicted political attitude scores among migrant-origin individuals according to subnational variation in native-origin political attitudesa a results are calculated from models in Table 3. lines for fi rst- and second-generation migrants are surrounded by 95 percent confi dence intervals. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This suggests that the strong relationship with native-ori- gin individuals’ political attitudes operates similarly for western- and non-western-origin migrants. Given the concerns mentioned above about the ess under sampling hard-to-integrate migrants, i conducted a more fine-grained analysis for specific countries of origin. i estimated the models in Table 2 with dummy variables for european, maghre- bian, sub-saharan african, and Turkish origins.30 figure 5 then pres- ents predicted attitude scores for the specific national-origin groups ac- cording to the same procedures used in figure 4. for maghrebians, the difference in predicted scores between the most positive 15th percen- tile and the most negative 15th percentile of native-origin subnational attitude scores was equal to or slightly larger than the difference in the scores among european-origin migrant individuals. among sub- saharan africans, the differences across all attitude scores were slightly smaller than those of european-origin migrants, and among Turkish- origin respondents, while the differences were also slightly smaller than those of european migrants regarding political trust, they were slightly larger than those of the europeans regarding the two government sat- isfaction variables.31 in short, these additional calculations provided no 29 These numbers are calculated using the same criteria as in figure 2: by subtracting the predicted migrant political attitude score in the bottom 15th percentile of subnational regions according to na- tives’ attitudes from the predicted migrant attitude score in the top 15th percentile of regions. These calculations are limited to ess rounds 2, 3, and 4 because ess round 1 only asks about the continent and not the country of birth of respondents’ parents. 30 maghrebian, sub-saharan african, and Turkish-origin migrants are three of the main national- origin groups considered difficult to integrate in europe. more detailed country-specific calculations within the maghreb and sub-saharan africa were less reliable because of small sample sizes. euro- pean-origin migrants are included as a comparison group for the migrants considered easiest to in- tegrate. i used the models from Table 2 as opposed to Table 3 as a baseline because sample sizes for calculating predicted scores among specific national-origin groups were too small to separate the first and second generations. 31 The change in the predicted political trust score between the most positive 15th percentile and the most negative 15th percentile of native-origin subnational attitude scores was 0.21 points for european- ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

To test this possibility, i estimated the models in Table 3 with additional controls for muslim and chris- tian religious affiliation. i then compared predicted political attitude scores for first- and second-generation muslims, christians, and re- spondents who were neither muslim nor christian, across the most origin migrants, 0.21 for maghrebians, 0.17 for sub-saharan africans, and 0.13 for Turks. The change in macro government satisfaction was 0.17 points for european-origin migrants, 0.18 for maghre- bians, 0.15 for sub-saharan africans, and 0.19 for Turks. finally, the change in government services satisfaction was 0.19 points for europeans and maghrebians, 0.18 for africans, and 0.20 for Turks. 32 caldwell 2009; sniderman and hagendoorn 2007. 1st Gen 1st Gen 2nd Gen 2nd Gen 1st Gen 1st Gen 2nd Gen 2nd Gen 1st Gen 1st Gen 2nd Gen 2nd Gen west non- west non- west non- west non- west non- west non- west west west west west west pr ed ic te d po lit ic al a tt itu de s co re s 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 figure 4 predicted political attitude scores among western- and non-western-origin migrant individuals for the most positive 15th percentile as opposed to the most negative 15th percentile of native-origin subnational attitude scores a a results are calculated from models in Table 3. for all results, the higher predicted political attitude score corresponds to the most positive 15th percentile of subnational regions and the lower predicted attitude score corresponds to the most negative 15th percentile. political Trust macro Government satisfaction satisfaction Government services ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The ess sample combines west european countries that have lon- ger migration experiences with central and east european countries that have only recently begun to receive large numbers of international migrants. Given these historical differences, it is possible that the dy- namic of subnational positive attitudinal correlations among migrant- and native-origin individuals is stronger in western europe. in ad- dition, since the data are primarily composed of western european countries (74 percent of respondents), it is possible that the correlation between the attitudes of migrants and natives presented above is driven by western european respondents and that there is no correlation be- tween migrant and native attitudes in central and eastern europe. moreover, assimilation and socioeconomic status may also have dif- ferent effects on migrant political attitudes in the two regions. fig- ures 6 and 7 explore these possibilities by presenting the difference in predicted political attitude scores across different values of the inde- pendent variables among migrant-origin individuals in western and central/eastern europe.34 The results indicate similar relationships between the political attitudes of migrant and native-origin individu- als at the subnational level in western and central/eastern europe. in addition, there are larger changes in migrant-origin individuals’ predicted attitude scores associated with native-origin attitudes as op- posed to scores associated with assimilation or socioeconomic status. The biggest difference across regions is that among fi rst-generation respondents, assimilation is associated with larger predicted attitude score changes in eastern europe than in western europe. nonethe- less, data in f igures 6 and 7 suggest that my argument is applicable in western and central/eastern europe. To further check the robustness of the results, i included a range of additional controls that have been shown to affect political trust and government satisfaction. one is that lower levels of democracy in the home country may be associated with more positive political trust and satisfaction in the host country.35 in addition, general political behavior 34 These calculations are based on the most positive and negative 15th percentiles of natives’ at- titudes within western and central/eastern europe respectively. separate calculations were made for the different regions because central and east europeans tend to have less political trust and govern- ment satisfaction than western europeans due to legacies of the communist period. see mishler and rose 2001. 35 level of democracy in the home country was measured two ways. one used the freedom house score at the time of migration and the other used the freedom house score at the time of the survey. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The previous models assume that the relationship between migrant- origin and native-origin individuals’ attitudes is fixed across subna- tional regions, but it is possible that this relationship changes from region to region. in particular, given the existing literature on the role of natives in shaping contexts of reception, one might imagine that migrant-origin attitudes are less closely aligned with those of native- origin individuals in subnational regions where there are high levels of anti-immigrant sentiment among natives. a common strategy for relaxing the assumption that an independent variable has fixed effects across clustered units is to model it as a random effect and examine how the slope of the independent variable changes across units. such an approach would be inappropriate here because my key independent variable of interest (political attitudes among native-origin individuals) is calculated at the subnational level and does not vary within sub- national units. instead, descriptive statistics suggest that the range of the subnational gaps between migrant- and native-origin individuals is fairly small.38 moreover, these gaps are consistent irrespective of sub- national variation in anti-immigrant sentiment among natives.39 This finding may seem surprising given the likely salience of anti-immigrant sentiments for migrant-origin individuals’ experiences in the host soci- ety. however trust and satisfaction with the government can be similar among respondents who disagree on more specific issues (immigration policy, for example) because these general attitudes tap into broader evaluations of society. i estimated the models from Tables 2 and 3 with alternate speci- fications for assimilation and socioeconomic status but there was no difference in the substantive results.40 The substantive results are also similar when the eight items used to construct the three latent depen- dent variables are analyzed separately. finally, results are similar to the models in Tables 2 and 3 when weighted data are used to estimate 38 These statistics are cited in the last paragraph of the previous section. 39 i used two measures of anti-immigrant sentiment among native-origin individuals. one is an index of three questions that ask whether respondents would support increased immigration. The second is an index of three questions that ask whether immigrants help or harm the host country. for both measures, the difference in the gap with native-origin political attitude scores in the most and least anti-immigrant regions is less than 0.04 points for the first generation and less than 0.008 points for the second generation. 40 as alternate indicators of assimilation i used self-reported measures of being an ethnic minority and being subject to discrimination in the country of residence. for socioeconomic status i included measures of financial comfort and of employment status when restricting the sample to economically active respondents. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The first claim is based on the logic that individuals form political attitudes and opinions based on events and issues that vary across geo- graphic contexts. one way of evaluating this is to examine the effects of media consumption on political attitudes. if my argument is correct, migrants who consume more media should be more aware of political affairs in the host country, more likely to form political attitudes based on the same information as natives, and more likely to have political attitudes close to those of native-origin individuals in the same subna- tional region.42 figure 8 presents data to explore this claim. The x-axis is a latent variable measuring media consumption derived from three measures of time spent consuming news, politics, or current affairs me- dia (television, radio, and newspaper) during the average weekday.43 The y-axis plots the gap between migrant attitudes and the mean na- tive-origin attitude score at the subnational level. positive scores indi- cate that migrants are more positive than natives in the same subna- tional region, and zero indicates that migrants’ political attitudes are the same as those of the mean native-origin score for the same subna- tional region. 41 The advantage to ordinary least squares is that it allows weighted data whereas, at the time of writing, stata did not support weighted data with the multilevel mixed-effects models presented in this article. The disadvantage to ordinary least squares is that it cannot capture multiple levels of clus- tering (for example, ess respondents are nested within countries and regions). 42 a more precise evaluation of my claim would be to track exposure to salient political events among migrant and native-origin individuals across subnational contexts and measure the attitudinal correlations across different levels of exposure. unfortunately the ess does not offer such detailed data. 43 as an alternate measure i constructed an index that added up the time spent consuming these three forms of media on an average weekday. The results were almost exactly the same as those pre- sented in figure 8. it is important to note that the ess does not specify which newspaper or television or radio program the respondent consumes. it is likely that some media consumed by migrants are focused on home-country as opposed to host-country affairs. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This dynamic is most evident for macro government satisfaction, as migrants with the highest levels of media consumption have slightly more negative satisfaction-in-government- services scores than native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. figure 8b presents results for the three individual indicators of political trust. These items are presented separately because they func- tion somewhat differently. “Trust in parliament” and “trust in the legal system” support my claim because when migrants consume more me- dia, their gaps with native-origin individuals’ attitudes approach zero. for “trust in the police,” the gaps increase and migrant-origin indi- viduals become more negative as they consume more media. This may reflect migrants being socialized into the tense relationships that exist between many migrant-origin communities and the police. 44 This finding may be because migrants with less media exposure are less socialized into host- society norms and more likely to retain their home-country frame of reference. it supports existing literature that accounts for positive political attitudes among the first generation by emphasizing their low expectations for institutional performance as a result of weak political institutions at home. dine- sen forthcoming; röder and mühlau 2012. low high media consumption low high media consumption m ig ra nt -n at iv e G ap m ig ra nt -n at iv e G ap .1 0 .1 .1 0 .1 macro satisfaction services satisfaction Trust police Trust parliament Trust legal figure 8 first-generation media consumption and attitude gaps with native-origin individuals a source: ess rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4. a The x-axis measures migrant media consumption (television, radio, newspaper).

This result is most likely because second-generation and native-origin individuals are both raised in similar host country environments. in comparison, the results in figure 8 suggest that as first-generation migrants consume more media (and theoretically be- come more aware of local events) they are more likely to have the same levels of political trust and satisfaction as the native-origin individuals in their subnational region. The second mechanism focuses on socialization patterns and ap- plies to both first- and second-generation migrant-origin individuals. The logic is that individuals primarily socialize with fellow residents of their subnational region and people who socialize together are likely to shape each other’s political attitudes. an ideal test of this claim would include data on migrant-origin individuals’ friends’ national origins, place of residence, and levels of political trust and government satisfac- tion. unfortunately, these data are not available in the ess. Therefore, in figure 9, i examine the gaps in political attitudes between native- origin individuals and migrant-origin individuals who have no immi- grant friends and those who have several immigrant friends.45 These data address my claims because migrant-origin individuals who have more immigrant social contacts may be less likely to have native-origin social contacts and less likely to have strong political attitude corre- lations with natives. admittedly, this does not directly measure the extent to which migrant-origin individuals have native-origin friends but unfortunately the ess only provides information about immigrant friends.46 To address this concern and the fact that migrant-origin in- dividuals with many immigrant friends may just be very social indi- viduals and also have many native-origin friends, the data in figure 9 are based on regressions that include a control variable for overall level of socializing. The results in figure 9 generally support my claim about the impor- tance of friendship patterns for migrant-origin individuals’ political atti- tudes. The gaps with native-origin individuals among those with no im- 45 Questions about immigrant friends were only posed in a special module of the ess round 1. as a result, the data in figure 9 are presented for first- and second-generation migrants together in order to maximize sample size. 46 in addition, cross-sectional ess data cannot address the direction of any influence among social networks. it is not possible to determine the extent to which the strong positive subnational attitudi- nal correlations are the result of migrant-origin individuals being influenced by natives, natives being influenced by migrants, or some combination of the two trends. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Yet for trust in parliament and in the legal system, migrant-origin individuals with several immigrant friends are more positive than native-origin indi- viduals, while for trust in the police they are more negative than native- origin individuals. This too may reflect tensions between migrant-ori- gin communities and the police, which are stronger among those more deeply embedded in migrant-origin communities. my overall argument is that subnational variation in geographic context is more important than individual-level assimilation or socio- economic status for migrant-origin individuals’ political trust and gov- ernment satisfaction. Yet to a certain extent, friendship patterns are an indicator of individual-level assimilation. in the ess data, migrant-or- igin individuals with non-western origins who are not citizens and do not primarily speak the host-country language are more likely to have several immigrant friends than migrant-origin individuals with west- ern origins who are citizens and who primarily speak the host-country language. existing literature, however, highlights individual-level as- similation as a predictor of more positive attitudes. my argument takes a different approach as the data in figure 9 suggest that the less-segre- gated friendship pattern is associated with smaller attitudinal gaps with native-origin individuals and that the attitudes could be more positive or negative depending on the subnational context. in fact, when the variable for the amount of immigrant friends is added to the models in Table 2, it is not a statistically significant (at p<.05) predictor of politi- cal trust or satisfaction in government services and has only a modest positive relationship with macro government satisfaction.47 another mechanism that could account for the subnational attitudi- nal correlations between migrants and natives is selection effects. it is possible that migrants choose the regions in which they want to live be- cause they are attracted to the local cultural and political climate. if this were true it would lead to very different conclusions than my argument 47 The predicted macro government satisfaction score for migrant-origin individuals with no im- migrant friends is 0.46, compared to 0.50 among those with several immigrant friends. These models do not include dummy variables for ess rounds as all analyses of friendship patterns are restricted to the first ess round. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The best way of identifying selection ef- fects is longitudinal data that track individual migrants’ political at- titudes over time to determine whether environmental factors change those attitudes. unfortunately the ess only offers cross-sectional data, but examining whether time spent in the host country has an effect on fi rst-generation migrants’ attitudinal correlations with natives is an indication of whether selection effects may be present. figure 10 plots these relationships and shows that for each political attitude the mi- grants who have been in the host country for a longer period of time have smaller gaps with the native-origin individuals living in the same subnational region. one possible concern with the data presented in figure 10 is that migrants who have been in the host country for a longer period of time are also more likely to be older and therefore that their smaller gaps with native-origin individuals refl ect an age- related pattern. however, although not presented here in the interest of parsimony, when the plots in figure 10 are calculated separately for migrants 30 years old or younger, between 30 and 60 years old, and 60 years or older, the results are similar to those presented in figure 10. admittedly the cross-sectional ess data cannot address whether migrants who have been in the host country for longer periods of time are different in ways not related to age but that shape their political attitudes (for example, those who have been in the host country for longer may have had more or less control over where they settled due to variation over time in immigration policies, visa availability, or mac- roeconomic dynamics). nonetheless, the results in figure 10 do not suggest strong selection effects. conclusion in this article i have argued that political trust and government satis- faction among migrant-origin individuals are best understood through strong positive correlations with the attitudes of native-origin individ- uals living in the same subnational region. i highlighted two mecha- nisms to account for this similarity at the subnational level: exposure to similar structural stimuli and interpersonal contact. within the migrant integration literature, my main intervention is to offer a way out of the debate over whether individual-level integration outcomes have posi- tive or negative ramifi cations for political attitude formation. my ar- gument suggests that individual-level integration is less important for understanding whether migrants will feel trust and satisfaction than ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This argument builds on re- search about how integration varies across local contexts but, unlike the existing literature, i claim that migrant- and native-origin attitudes are similar across those contexts. To develop my argument i traced the broad contours of migrant-na- tive political attitude dynamics across twenty-two european countries and over 230 subnational regions. future research should look more closely at how these mechanisms operate, particularly with more detail on the geographic specifi cation. The regions examined in this article are fairly large and there is likely to be considerable political variation within them. in particular, one might imagine that migrant-origin individuals m ig ra nt -n at iv e po lit ic al a tt itu de G ap .1 .05 0 –.05 <1 year 20+ Time spent in host country macro satisfaction services satisfaction figure 10 first-generation time in host country and attitude gaps with native-origin individualsa source: ess rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4. a The x-axis measures time spent in the host country (ranging from less than 1 year to more than 20 years).

This builds on the broader tradition of examining how integration improves over time as native and migrant-origin individuals converge in mul- tiple ways as a result of shared experiences.50 Therefore, if governments want to promote positive political attitudes, it might be more useful to concentrate on effective governance and better outcomes for the entire population instead of worrying about the durability of minority lin- guistic and religious practices. 48 see hochschild and mollenkopf 2009; Joppke 2007a; Joppke 2007b; Koopmans et al. 2005. 49 The one question that could address maintenance of homeland cultural practices is whether or not respondents primarily speak the host-country language at home. among the first and second generation, individuals who primarily speak the host-country language have smaller attitude gaps with natives in the same subnational region than individuals who do not primarily speak the host-country language. for the first generation, those who do not primarily speak the host-country language are more positive than native-origin individuals while for the second generation those who do not primar- ily speak the host-country language are more negative than native-origin individuals. This is further evidence that assimilation is associated with smaller attitudinal gaps with native-origin individuals but that its effects on whether political attitudes are positive or negative depend on the subnational context. 50 see alba and nee 2003; Bloemraad 2011; Gordon 1964; vigdor 2011. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 12 00 02 63 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.
