Signaling Alliance Commitments: Hand-Tying and Sunk Costs in Extended Nuclear Deterrence Matthew Fuhrmann Texas A&M University Todd S. Sechser University of Virginia How can states signal their alliance commitments? Although scholars have developed sophisticated theoretical models of costly signaling in international relations, we know little about which specific policies leaders can implement to signal their commitments. This article addresses this question with respect to the extended deterrent effects of nuclear weapons. Can nuclear states deter attacks against their friends by simply announcing their defense commitments? Or must they deploy nuclear weapons on a protégé’s territory before an alliance is seen as credible? Using a new dataset on foreign nuclear deployments from 1950 to 2000, our analysis reveals two main findings. First, formal alliances with nuclear states appear to carry significant deterrence benefits. Second, however, stationing nuclear weapons on a protégé’s territory does not bolster these effects. The analysis yields new insights about the dynamics of “hand-tying” and “sunk cost” signals in international politics. How can states credibly signal their commit-ments in competitive international environ-ments? When leaders commit to future courses of action in international politics, they generally would prefer those commitments to be believed. Their true pref- erences and intentions, however, are not directly observ- able by others. Leaders therefore are compelled to employ signals to indirectly communicate their preferences and intentions (Fearon 1994; Jervis 1970; Schelling 1960). While signaling one’s interests is always difficult, demonstrating resolve in an alliance context is thought to be especially challenging (e.g., Huth 1988; Morrow 1994; Schelling 1966). States usually can be trusted to defend their own possessions, but demonstrating one’s willing- ness to pay military costs on behalf of another state is Matthew Fuhrmann is Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science, Texas A&M University, 4348 TAMU, College Station, TX 77843 (mfuhrmann@pols.tamu.edu).

See also Leeds (2003a), Leeds and Savun (2007), and Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel (2009). Siverson and King (1980) are even more pessimistic, suggesting that states fail to defend their allies about 75% of the time. typically more problematic. For a defensive alliance to be effective, would-be adversaries must believe that an ally will provide military support to its protégé in time of war. However, throughout history, states have some- times reneged on alliance commitments when they were challenged.1 Thus, for leaders who are indeed willing to defend their allies with military force, the central chal- lenge is to convince others of this fact without actually having to fight. How can this be done? To signal their alliance commitments, states have two basic tools: words and deeds. On one hand, a state might simply issue a public, perhaps written declaration of its intention to defend another state. Alternatively (or in ad- dition), the ally could take actions calculated to demon- strate its commitment, such as deploying military forces American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 58, No. 4, October 2014, Pp. 919–935 C©2014, Midwest Political Science Association DOI: 10.1111/ajps.12082 919 920 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S. SECHSER on a protégé’s territory during peacetime. In both cases, the objective is to persuade potential adversaries that the ally will indeed protect its protégé in time of war. Yet we know little about the comparative effectiveness of these two approaches. While costly signaling has been a central topic of scholarly inquiry for some time (e.g., Fearon 1994, 1997; Morrow 1992, 1994), scholars have not systematically investigated which specific military and diplomatic activities can credibly signal a state’s alliance commitments. This article evaluates the effectiveness of signaling in an alliance context using new data on one specific type of alliance: namely, defense pacts with nuclear-armed states. Can nuclear states achieve successful extended deterrence by announcing defensive alliances with protégé states? Or must they deploy nuclear weapons on an ally’s territory before their commitment is seen as believable? During the Cold War, several nuclear states used extraterritorial nu- clear deployments to signal their alliance commitments and deter aggression against allies. Yet it remains unclear whether these deployments achieved their intended aim. Did the foreign deployment of nuclear weapons bolster the deterrent effect of existing alliances, or were alliance promises alone sufficient to deter? Until recently, scholars have not had access to data that would provide answers to these questions. Since the end of the Cold War, how- ever, this information has become publicly available. This study draws on these declassified data and an array of other sources to evaluate the extended deterrent effects of foreign-deployed nuclear forces. Our analysis yields two principal findings. First, it demonstrates that formal defense pacts with nuclear states have significant deterrence benefits. Having a nuclear- armed ally is strongly associated with a lower likelihood of being targeted in a violent militarized dispute during the period we study. Second, foreign-deployed nuclear weapons appear to add little to the deterrent effect of these alliances. Deploying nuclear weapons on a protégé’s territory does not reduce the likelihood that the protégé will be targeted in a militarized dispute, once we account for the effect of the alliance itself. Thus, while having a nuclear ally carries important security benefits, those benefits do not appear to be enhanced by hosting the ally’s nuclear weapons. These results are robust across a variety of empirical models that account for nonnuclear alliances, conventional troop deployments, and other confounding variables. Our findings also hold when we account for possible endogeneity in the relationship between signals of alliance commitment and conflict. The deterrent effects of alliance commitments have been the subject of much scholarly research. Several stud- ies have explored the theoretical mechanics of alliance signaling (Fearon 1997; Morrow 1994; Smith 1995), and others have investigated the empirical effects of alliance commitments (Benson 2011; Gibler and Vasquez 1998; Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000). For instance, Leeds (2003b) and Johnson and Leeds (2011) show that al- liances exert strong deterrent effects, on average, when they are constructed for that purpose. However, we do not yet fully understand why alliances strengthen deterrence. Is the existence of a defense pact sufficient to achieve general deterrence? Or do alliances promote peace only when states signal their resolve by taking costly actions, such as stationing armaments on allied territory? Answer- ing these questions is central to our understanding of the relationship between alliances and war, but because exist- ing studies do not distinguish between words and deeds in alliance signaling, they have been unable to answer this question. This study is one of the first to disaggregate al- liance commitment strategies in order to compare their effectiveness. Most existing literature on extended nuclear deter- rence focuses almost exclusively on “immediate” deter- rence situations—that is, crises that occur after an ad- versary has already issued a challenge against a protégé (e.g., Huth 1988, 1990). Comparatively few studies, by contrast, have explored the relationship between nu- clear weapons and extended general deterrence—in other words, whether nuclear weapons can prevent challenges against protégés in the first place. In addition, while a growing number of quantitative studies address whether nuclear weapons benefit their possessors, they rarely con- sider how nuclear arsenals influence alliance dynamics. This study is one of the first to explore the conditions under which nuclear weapons can deter the initiation of crises against allies. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of Fearon (1994), Huth (1990), and others who have argued that nuclear weapons are better at pre- venting challenges than at dissuading challengers from following through on threats they have already made. More broadly, this study contributes to a growing scholarly literature on the political effects of nuclear weapons in international relations. Nearly 70 years into the nuclear age, we still lack a complete understanding of the ways in which nuclear weapons have impacted world politics. What forms of political leverage, if any, do nuclear weapons provide? Under what conditions are nu- clear weapons useful instruments of political influence? Scholars have begun to explore these questions from a va- riety of perspectives, emphasizing the importance of bar- gaining dynamics (Beardsley and Asal 2009; Gartzke and Jo 2009), nuclear posture (Narang 2009, 2013, 2014), pre- ventive war motives (Debs and Monteiro 2014; Fuhrmann and Kreps 2010), and learning (Horowitz 2009) for SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 921 understanding the consequences of nuclear proliferation. The results of this study help advance this research agenda, lending support to the view that nuclear weapons are use- ful as tools of deterrence, not as instruments of coercion (e.g., Sechser and Fuhrmann 2013). We proceed in four parts. First, we discuss compet- ing perspectives on the effectiveness of words and deeds as signals of alliance commitments. Second, we describe our new dataset of extraterritorial nuclear deployments and the sources used to generate it. Third, we evaluate the deterrent effects of alliance agreements and foreign nuclear deployments by assessing their impact on the likelihood of militarized interstate disputes. Conclusions and implications follow. Nuclear Alliances, Signals, and Deterrence Even when states are willing to use military force to de- fend their allies, they would rather avoid having to do so. Violent conflicts are costly even for the victors, so states would prefer to achieve their foreign policy ob- jectives without war. The purpose of making a deterrent threat—whether a general strategic commitment to an ally or a specific threat during a crisis—is to avoid having to execute it. The most effective alliance commitment, therefore, is not one that yields a war-winning coalition, but rather one that is never tested. How can allies ensure that their defense commitments are not challenged? An ally’s failure to establish credibility can be costly for all sides. For example, ambiguity about Britain’s will- ingness to defend Belgium and France in July 1914 em- boldened the German invasion that marked the outbreak of World War I (Sagan 1986). Had the British been more successful in convincing German diplomats of their readi- ness to intervene in a conflict in Western Europe, the war might have been avoided. Likewise, weak signals of com- mitment can damage alliance cohesion. Allies who do not trust one another’s assurances may abrogate their own al- liance commitments, defect to other alliances, or take ac- tions that undermine collective alliance goals. During the 1960s, for instance, Charles de Gaulle publicly doubted American willingness to protect France from Soviet ag- gression, leading to France’s eventual withdrawal from NATO’s operational military command and the removal of allied troops from French soil. Nuclear states have often attempted to protect their allies by raising the possibility of nuclear retaliation against would-be adversaries. The United States, for ex- ample, relied heavily on its nuclear arsenal to deter at- tacks against its NATO allies during the Cold War: a 1953 National Security Council report declared that “the ma- jor deterrent to aggression against Western Europe is the manifest determination of the United States to use its atomic and massive retaliatory striking power if the area is attacked” (Lay 1953).2 Ideally, the enormous costs of a nuclear war—even a victorious war—would deter poten- tial aggressors from threatening or attacking a protégé, so long as the threat of allied retaliation was sufficiently credible. To achieve extended deterrence, a nuclear patron must, at a minimum, convince potential attackers that it will defend its protégé in war. Nuclear states have two basic tools for achieving this objective. First, a nuclear state might simply declare its intention to protect an ally, perhaps by signing a formal defense pact with the protégé in question. While in practice an ally’s nuclear umbrella is rarely evoked explicitly in defensive alliance agreements, it is often implied. Second, nuclear states might forward- deploy nuclear forces on the protégé’s territory in hopes of persuading potential attackers that aggression will be met with nuclear retaliation. Below we discuss the theoretical merits and limitations of these two forms of signaling and derive observable implications to be tested in the follow- ing section. Nuclear Alliance Commitments Nuclear weapons are believed to provide their possessors with strategic benefits because they substantially raise the costs of war for potential aggressors. Indeed, many schol- ars have argued that nuclear powers are less likely to be attacked (e.g., Jervis 1989; Waltz 1990).3 Can nuclear pow- ers extend the deterrent benefits of their nuclear arsenals to other states? Since the beginning of the nuclear age, nuclear pow- ers have attempted to achieve extended nuclear deter- rence by signing alliance pacts with states they wished to protect. The Warsaw Pact and NATO are the two most well-known alliance systems forged by nuclear powers to defend friendly nations. But they are by no means the only defensive alliances created by nuclear states. 2Even today, nuclear weapons are a central component of NATO’s deterrence strategy: the 2013 NATO Handbook emphasizes that “NATO’s nuclear strategy and force posture are inseparable ele- ments of the Alliance’s overall strategy of war prevention....They make the risks of aggression against NATO incalculable and unac- ceptable in a way that conventional forces alone cannot” (65). 3The compellent effects of nuclear weapons, however, are more controversial. See, for instance, Sechser (2011) and Sechser and Fuhrmann (2013). 922 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S. SECHSER The United States, for example, made multilateral de- fense commitments during the Cold War through the Rio Pact—which includes most of Latin America—and the Australia, New Zealand, United States (ANZUS) Secu- rity Treaty. The United States also signed bilateral defense treaties with countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan. China, France, Russia, and Britain likewise for- mally pledged to defend a number of other states through multilateral or bilateral agreements. Britain, for instance, joined the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) in the 1950s along with Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey. Nu- clear states forged these formal alliances, in part, to signal to potential aggressors that they were willing to defend their protégés with military force. It was hoped that these alliances would introduce the possibility of nuclear re- taliation in a conflict, thus sending an especially strong message to third parties.4 One striking feature of many of these alliances is that they entailed few signals of commitment beyond ver- bal promises. While some alliances entail expensive mil- itary cooperation and foreign policy coordination (e.g., Morrow 1994), it is important to recognize that they need not do so. The United States, for example, stationed fewer than 100 military officers in most Rio Pact states during the Cold War, despite being the alliance’s primary secu- rity guarantor. U.S. leaders apparently viewed their ver- bal commitment as sufficient to protect these states from attack, and they saw little need for costly policy coordi- nation or military deployments. Other examples of al- liance commitments that relied almost entirely on verbal commitments rather than actions such as foreign troop deployments include defense pacts between the Soviet Union and Finland (1948–91): the members of the Arab League (1950–present), China and Cambodia (1960–70), and Russia and several former Soviet republics (1992– present).5 How might verbal alliance commitments constitute credible signals? A common view in international rela- tions argues that in an anarchic international system, verbal promises from allies are worthless since there is no higher authority to compel states to fulfill them (Mearsheimer 1994). However, recent theoretical liter- ature suggests that a verbal alliance promise could, in fact, constitute a credible signal of commitment if it is made publicly. Alliances, in this view, engage the credi- bility and reputation of the patron state when they are publicly announced.6 By declaring one’s intention to de- 4See, for example, Mearsheimer (1984) and Freedman (2003). 5See Gibler (2008) for descriptions of these alliances and their terms. 6Our research design excludes secret alliances, as we discuss below. fend a protégé, the patron stands to incur damage to its reputation if it does not fulfill its obligations (Fearon 1997; Jervis 1970; Schelling 1966). Alliances therefore are not purely epiphenomenal: their existence alters the strategic calculations of patron states by creating potential costs for abrogating them. If the signal is effective, a patron will be more willing to defend its ally after signing a public defense pact than it otherwise would have been if a formal commitment had not been made.7 Several recent studies demonstrate that states indeed pay reputation costs when they fail to uphold their al- liance obligations. For instance, Gibler (2008), Crescenzi et al. (2012), and Narang and LeVeck (2012) present ev- idence that states that have reneged on alliance pledges in the past have difficulty finding allies in the future. Moreover, these studies also show that states that have developed a reputation for being unreliable allies are less likely to deter challenges against their protégés. Reneg- ing on alliance commitments therefore appears to carry significant costs.8 Engaging one’s reputation in order to demonstrate credibility has the flavor of a classic “hand-tying” com- mitment device (Fearon 1997). Broadly, the objective of a hand-tying signal is to manipulate the sender’s future payoffs in order to make a desired course of action more attractive. The signal is not itself costly to send; rather, the sender pays a cost only if the commitment is not upheld.9 A public alliance commitment seems to fit this descrip- tion, since the act of announcing the alliance places the patron’s credibility on the line and makes reneging con- siderably less attractive than it would have been otherwise. While the verbal commitment itself is not costly to make, the patron stands to suffer significant reputation costs down the line if it fails to meet its alliance obligations. For nuclear states, this logic implies that the construc- tion of public alliances may be sufficient to accrue the extended deterrence benefits of nuclear weapons. Con- sider a nuclear patron state with a potential interest in protecting two identical states, Ally and Acquaintance. If the patron has a formal alliance with Ally but not Ac- quaintance, the theory described above would anticipate that the extended deterrent effects of the patron’s nuclear 7Mattes and Vonnahme (2010) offer a similar argument with re- spect to formal nonaggression pacts. 8There remains a contentious debate, however, about whether states pay reputation costs for breaking commitments in other security contexts. See, for example, Sartori (2005), Press (2005), and Sechser (2010). 9Fearon (1997) contrasts hand-tying signals with “sunk-cost” sig- nals: actions that are costly to undertake in the near term but do not impact the payoffs associated with future courses of action. See also Lektzian and Sprecher (2007). SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 923 arsenal would be more potent in the case of Ally, other things being equal. The reputation costs associated with reneging on its commitment to Ally would enhance the likelihood that the patron would fight in Ally’s defense, thereby raising the probability of nuclear escalation in any war involving Ally. By contrast, since the patron has not made a commitment to defend Acquaintance, it would suffer fewer reputation costs from not defending it. This fact, in turn, could harm the patron’s ability to deter an attack against Acquaintance. We can summarize this pre- diction as follows: Hypothesis 1. Having a public defense pact with a nuclear state reduces the likelihood of being targeted in a militarized interstate dispute. Foreign Nuclear Deployments A different perspective on alliance credibility suggests that extended deterrence requires more than mere promises. In an anarchic system with no centralized enforcement of contracts, verbal or written declarations may lack credi- bility since they are not binding. Even more importantly, leaders face strong temptations to exaggerate which in- terests they would fight to defend: even if a state would not, in fact, be willing to defend an ally, it would like potential attackers to believe otherwise. Consequently, “sincere” allies must distinguish themselves from “insin- cere” types by taking costly actions that an insincere ally would not. According to this logic, paying significant costs during peacetime bolsters the credibility of alliance com- mitments because “states that are less committed to the alliance and the interests it advances should be less likely to suffer these costs in order to form the alliance” (Mor- row 2000, 70).10 Nuclear states have often paid such “peacetime costs” by stationing nuclear forces on an ally’s homeland. In- deed, our research reveals that states deployed nuclear forces on the territory of their allies on nearly two dozen occasions from 1950 to 2000. In many of these cases, the primary objective was to demonstrate the credibil- ity of the patron’s nuclear umbrella and thus strengthen extended deterrence. For example, the United States in- troduced tactical nuclear forces in certain NATO coun- tries (Britain, Italy, Turkey, and West Germany) during the 1950s mainly to reduce the risk of Soviet aggression (Freedman 2003; United States Department of Defense 10Fuhrmann (2009, 2012), for example, argues that distributing foreign nuclear aid to protégé states can reduce the risk of third- party aggression since an uncommitted ally would be unwilling to pay such costs. 1978). An implicit assumption underlying these deploy- ments was that a less resolved ally would be reluctant to station nuclear weapons on a protégé’s territory; thus, by deploying nuclear weapons abroad, these states hoped to identify themselves as staunch allies and distinguish themselves from less resolute types. The shadow of allied intervention and nuclear escalation, in turn, would dis- suade potential aggressors from attacking protégé states.11 Stationing nuclear forces on allied territory could increase the credibility of an alliance commitment in at least three ways. First, foreign nuclear deployments might shift the local balance of power in favor of the protégé. Tactical nuclear weapons in particular might im- prove the protégé’s ability to fend off an attack (or im- pose costs on the adversary), which in turn would make war a less attractive option for the adversary. During the Cold War, for example, it was commonly argued that U.S. tactical nuclear forces in Western Europe strengthened deterrence by improving NATO’s ability to thwart a So- viet attack. Analysts argued that forward-deployed tac- tical nuclear weapons could respond more rapidly to a Soviet assault, allowing the United States to destroy in- vading troops before they achieved their objectives (Bid- dle and Feaver 1989). Further, many policy makers be- lieved that forward-deployed nuclear weapons posed a more credible threat of nuclear retaliation, since local commanders in the heat of battle might be more will- ing than political leaders to order the use of nuclear weapons (Bracken 1983). Weapons stationed on a pa- tron’s homeland, by contrast, would not carry this advan- tage. Forward-deployed nuclear weapons therefore might strengthen deterrence simply by virtue of their proximity to the adversary. Second, foreign nuclear deployments could serve as “tripwire” forces whose central purpose in wartime is not to defeat the enemy but rather to be destroyed, thereby creating domestic political pressure for the patron to enter the war wholeheartedly. Indeed, once the United States developed long-range nuclear delivery capabilities, ob- servers began to argue that U.S. tactical nuclear deploy- ments in Europe were militarily superfluous, and that they would have a relatively small effect on a war’s out- come (e.g., Schelling 1966, 111–16; Record 1974, 68). In- stead, they argued, the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe was valuable because it ensured that American forces would be killed in a Soviet invasion—an event likely to trigger large-scale U.S. intervention (Freedman 2003, 353). In this way, forward-deployed nuclear weapons might bolster deterrence not because of their intrinsic 11For a good review of the various arguments that have been made for deploying U.S. nuclear weapons abroad, see Dyer (1977). 924 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S. SECHSER military utility, but because their destruction would in- voke the full commitment of the patron to the protégé’s defense. Third, the sheer expense of foreign nuclear deploy- ments could signal a patron’s resolve, since a less com- mitted ally might be unwilling to endure the economic and political costs associated with forward-deployed units (Morrow 1994, 2000). While the marginal cost of a nu- clear warhead may be low compared to an equivalent quantity of conventional explosives, nuclear weapons re- quire a considerable amount of supporting infrastruc- ture, including: specialized transportation and storage systems, defense systems (early-warning radar, air de- fenses, and satellite, aerial, and naval reconnaissance), specially trained personnel, command and control infras- tructure, delivery vehicles (bomber aircraft, submarines, and missiles), bases to support those vehicles (missile launch sites, airfields, and naval bases), safety and secu- rity systems, and logistics platforms.12 Moreover, foreign- deployed nuclear weapons often require special delivery vehicles, which are expensive to develop and deploy. For example, the United States spent more than $9 billion to develop and deploy intermediate-range nuclear mis- siles, which were placed in Europe during the 1980s and later withdrawn under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.13 A less resolved patron might not be will- ing to incur the cost of these deployments, thus rendering them credible signals of commitment when they are un- dertaken. O’Neill (1990), for example, has argued that intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe were ef- fective signals of the U.S. alliance commitment precisely because they were wastefully expensive. He characterizes these deployments as the equivalent of burning money: their main effect, in his view, was to inflict self-damage that a more cost-sensitive— and therefore less resolved— ally would have found intolerable. Foreign nuclear deployments also incur costs in the form of safety and security risks. Nuclear weapons are thought by some to be destabilizing, in part, because they may be prone to accidental or unauthorized use (Sagan 1994). Placing nuclear weapons abroad may in- crease this danger, particularly when foreign governments are granted some degree of control over the weapons.14 During the 1950s, for example, West German fighter pi- lots virtually commanded U.S. nuclear bombs when on alert, raising the possibility—however unlikely—that the 12See Schwartz (1998) for detailed discussions. 13See Cushman (1987). 14The notion that forward-deployed tactical nuclear weapons may be vulnerable to theft or accidental use is widely discussed in the policy community. See, for example, Potter and Sokov (2000). weapons might be used without U.S. approval (Norris, Arkin, and Burr 1999, 30).15 Forward-deployed nuclear weapons might also be vulnerable to theft or sabotage in the event of political instability. For instance, during the 1967 military coup in Greece, U.S. officials worried about the vulnerability of its nuclear forces following “politi- cal tension in the vicinity of some of our nuclear storage facilities.”16 Similar concerns ensued during the Turk- ish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, when custodians of U.S. nuclear weapons reportedly “held our breath” as local troops stormed a Turkish Air Force base where U.S. nu- clear weapons were stored (Reed 2004, 173). Deploying nuclear forces abroad has never led to a serious nuclear incident, in part because nuclear states typically take a multitude of measures to avoid them.17 Yet, because states are unlikely to accept the risk of such an incident unless they are firmly committed to the defense of the protégé, foreign nuclear deployments may constitute a credible signal of a patron’s resolve. To sum up, this logic suggests that costly actions such as extraterritorial nuclear deployments can bolster the credibility of alliance commitments and deter potential aggressors: Hypothesis 2. Hosting another state’s nuclear weapons on one’s territory reduces the likelihood of being targeted in a militarized interstate dispute. Dataset and Operationalization of Variables We test these hypotheses on signaling and extended nu- clear deterrence using a dataset that contains informa- tion about states in the international system from 1950 to 2000.18 The unit of analysis is the directed dyad-year. This data structure allows us to distinguish between ini- tiators and targets in militarized disputes: in our data, for example, a dispute instigated by Japan against North Korea is treated as distinct from a dispute initiated by North Korea against Japan. In principle, each dyad-year represents one “opportunity” for the challenger to initiate a militarized dispute. However, analyzing all conceivable 15The United States later tightened security measures by introduc- ing locking mechanisms known as permissive action links (PALs). 16“Symington Finds Flaws in NATO’s Warhead Security; Greek Incident Hinted,” New York Times, July 24, 1975. 17The effectiveness of these measures, however, has been ques- tioned: for instance, Sagan (1993) identifies several serious vulner- abilities in the safety procedures employed by nuclear states. 18We begin our analysis in 1950 because this is the first year for which we have data on all of the independent variables. SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 925 country pairs would artificially inflate the sample size be- cause many dyads (e.g., Burkina Faso–Guyana) cannot plausibly be said to have a realistic opportunity to fight. Consistent with standard practice in the literature, we therefore include in our sample only dyads that contain either neighboring countries or at least one major power (Lemke and Reed 2001).19 For information about our dependent variable (MIL- ITARY CONFLICT), we employ Version 3.1 of the Corre- lates of War (COW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) dataset (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004). The MID dataset includes information about historical disputes be- tween countries, including but not limited to threats to use force, alerts, military mobilizations, seizures, border clashes, and attacks. Because we are interested in the con- nection between extended deterrence and violent conflict, we limit our analysis to cases that resulted in fatalities.20 VIOLENT CONFLICT is a dichotomous variable that is coded 1 if the challenger initiates a militarized dispute against the target that results in at least one fatality in year t and 0 otherwise.21 To measure military alliances, we consult two sources. Our primary models use Version 3.03 of the COW For- mal Alliance dataset (Gibler and Sarkees 2004). The di- chotomous variable DEFENSE PACT WITH NUCLEAR POWER is coded 1 if a potential target of a dispute has a public de- fense pact22 with a nuclear-armed state and 0 otherwise.23 Forty-four percent of the directed dyad-year observations in the sample are coded as having nuclear protection.24 19We define neighbors as countries that are located within 400 miles of one another. Note that the findings are substantively similar when we include all directed dyad-years in our estimation sample (see the online appendix for this article). 20Many of the nonviolent MIDs involve fishing trawler incidents and other trivial events where we would not expect nuclear weapons to play a role (e.g., Downes and Sechser 2012). We coded an alter- nate dependent variable that included MIDs where countries used military force and excluded cases where states merely “threatened” or “displayed” force, according to the dataset. As we show in the online appendix, the findings are largely unaltered. 21There are 239 militarized disputes involving fatalities in our sam- ple. We code the dependent variable missing if information on the number of fatalities in a dispute is unavailable in the MID dataset. 22This dataset allows us to exclude secret alliances; see Gibler (2009, 451, note 6). 23We classify nuclear powers as follows: the United States (1950– 2000), Russia (1950–2000), Britain (1952–2000), France (1960– 2000), China (1964–2000), Israel (1967–2000), South Africa (1979– 90), Pakistan (1987–2000), and India (1988–2000). These codings are adapted from Singh and Way (2004). While North Korea may currently possess a nuclear capability, it was probably not acquired until after 2000. 24Both the nuclear alliance and nuclear deployment variables are coded 0 in cases where the potential challenger in the dyad shares To confirm the robustness of our results, we recode the nuclear alliance variable using the Alliance Treaty Obliga- tions and Provisions (ATOP) dataset (Leeds et al. 2002). The ATOP and COW datasets are largely consistent in their coding of defense pacts, but there are some differ- ences. For example, ATOP classifies the U.S.-South Korea partnership as a defense pact, whereas COW does not.25 The second independent variable—NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT—is not available in existing datasets. Indeed, comprehensive data on foreign nuclear deploy- ments were typically classified during the Cold War.26 However, governments have declassified documents that divulge previously unavailable details about when and where their nuclear weapons were stationed abroad (see, e.g., United States Department of Defense 1978). Drawing on these documents and relevant historical literature, we constructed a new dataset of extraterritorial nuclear deployments.27 These data allow us to evaluate, for the first time, the comparative deterrent effects of formal alliances and foreign nuclear deployments. Our research reveals that the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union together stationed nu- clear weapons in more than 20 countries between 1950 and 2000 (see Table 1). Some states (such as Cuba and Denmark) housed nuclear weapons for just a few years, whereas others (such as Germany and Greece) had weapons on their soil for decades. The variable NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT is coded 1 if a state had foreign-deployed nuclear weapons on its territory in a given year and 0 otherwise. Extraterritorial nuclear deployments occur in about 13% of the directed dyad-year observations in our estimation sample. We exclude three possible types of foreign nu- clear deployments from our analysis. First, we exclude the “accidental” nuclear deployments of Soviet nuclear a nuclear defense pact with the target, since it is implausible that a state might be deterred by its own nuclear umbrella. For example, Japan is not coded as having nuclear protection in U.S.-Japan dyads. 25The ATOP and COW nuclear alliance variables are highly corre- lated (r = 0.86) in our estimation sample. 26While governments that deployed nuclear weapons abroad often kept the locations of their warheads concealed from the public, this information typically was known to other states. Likely adversaries in particular used their intelligence services to identify the location of other states’ forward-deployed nuclear bombs. For example, satellite images allowed the United States to identify the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in October 1962, shortly after the weapons were introduced. Moreover, recognizing that nuclear weapons could only deter conflict if their presence was known to ag- gressors, allied defenders may have revealed the presence of nuclear weapons on allied territory through diplomatic back channels. 27A list of sources we consulted to produce this dataset is available in the online appendix. 926 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S.

While these three states technically hosted Russian weapons on their soil during this period, this is because they inherited the weapons when the Soviet Union col- lapsed; Moscow did not intentionally deploy them on the territory of independent states. Second, we exclude three cases in which the United States deployed nuclear weapons without their fissile cores, thereby rendering the weapons nonnuclear. These cases involve U.S. deploy- ments in Cuba, France, and Japan. Third, while Wash- ington deployed nuclear weapons on the Japanese islands of Chichi Jima, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, we also exclude these cases since these territories were entirely under U.S. control during the period of deployment.28 To properly evaluate the effects of nuclear weapons on extended deterrence, we must also account for mea- sures taken by states to signal their alliance commitments using conventional military power. We code two indica- 28Note, however, that including these three types of cases in our cod- ing of NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT produces substantively similar findings (see the online appendix). tors of conventional protection that mirror the previously discussed nuclear variables. First, DEFENSE PACT WITH NON- NUCLEAR POWER is coded 1 if a state shares a defense pact with a country that does not possess nuclear weapons and 0 otherwise.29 We also account for troop deployments, which can be employed to signal a commitment to the defense of a protégé without invoking nuclear weapons.30 Such deployments often occur in peacetime, as in Eu- rope during the Cold War. However, foreign troops may also arrive during a crisis: after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, for instance, the United States deployed thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia to signal its com- mitment to the defense of that country. Unfortunately, comprehensive time-series data on global troop deploy- ments during the period we study are not readily available, making it difficult to measure the efforts of all states to extend deterrence by deploying military forces. However, 29Fifty-two percent of the dyad-year observations in the estimation sample include defense commitments from nonnuclear states. 30Conventional troop deployments may also serve a “tripwire” function, as discussed in the previous section. SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 927 we were able to obtain annualized, country-specific data about U.S. foreign troop deployments from 1950 to 2000 (Kane 2004). We therefore create the variable U.S. TROOPS, which measures the total number of American soldiers stationed in the target country in a given year.31 We also control for several other factors that are be- lieved to influence conflict initiation. First, since a state’s own nuclear arsenal is likely to influence international conflict behavior, we include dichotomous indicators of nuclear status for the challenger (NUCLEAR CHALLENGER) and target (NUCLEAR TARGET) in each dyad.32 Second, CON- TIGUITY is coded 1 if the states in the dyad are contiguous by land and 0 otherwise, since neighbors are significantly more likely to engage in militarized conflicts than non- neighbors (Bremer 1992). Third, ALLIANCE WITH CHAL- LENGER is coded 1 if the challenger and target share a de- fense pact and 0 in all other cases.33 Dyadic alliances are widely believed to impact conflict propensities, although scholars disagree about whether allies are more or less likely to engage in conflicts with one another (Bueno de Mesquita 1981; Morrow 2000). As a fourth control, we include a variable captur- ing the congruence of foreign policy interests of dyad partners, based on voting at the United Nations (Voeten and Merdzanovic 2009). This variable, FOREIGN POLICY SIMILARITY, ranges from −1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating more congruent voting patterns.34 Fifth, we account for the conventional material capabilities of the challenger and the target using COW Composite Indica- tors of National Capabilities (CINC) data (Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972). Consistent with standard practice in the literature, POWER RATIO measures the ratio of the chal- lenger’s material capabilities to the sum of both states’ capabilities in the dyad (Leeds 2003b). Finally, we ac- count for the possibility that democracies are unlikely to 31This variable is coded 0 if the United States experienced a dis- pute with the target that resulted in at least 25 fatalities, based on the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset (Themnér and Wallen- steen 2013). In these cases, U.S. troops were deployed to a country primarily to initiate combat operations against it (e.g., Serbia in 1999). We divide the total number of troops by 1,000 for ease of interpretation. 32These variables are coded 1 if the relevant country possesses nuclear weapons in a given year and 0 otherwise. 33This variable is based on the COW Formal Alliance dataset (Gibler and Sarkees 2004). 34One drawback of this variable is that some key states in the inter- national system did not cast votes at the United Nations (e.g., China prior to 1971). Including FOREIGN POLICY SIMILARITY in our model therefore reduces our sample size by 13%. However, as we show in the online appendix to this article, the findings are similar when we estimate our model in a larger sample that excludes FOREIGN POLICY SIMILARITY from the analysis. initiate disputes against other democratic states (Russett and Oneal 2001). Following Gartzke and Jo (2009), we in- clude three variables using the widely employed 21-point Polity IV composite indicator (Marshall, Gurr, and Jag- gers 2009): CHALLENGER POLITY, TARGET POLITY, and CHAL- LENGER POLITY × TARGET POLITY.35 Lastly, our analysis accounts for possible temporal de- pendence in the data. The likelihood of a dispute between the United States and North Korea in year t, for example, might be influenced by the frequency of recent disputes between the two states. Following Carter and Signorino (2010), we address this issue by including a variable that counts the number of years that have passed without con- flict within each dyad (TIME), its square (TIME2), and its cube (TIME3). Empirical Analysis Because the dependent variable in our analysis (MILITA- RIZED DISPUTE INITIATION) is dichotomous, we employ a probit estimator, clustering the standard errors by di- rected dyad to address heteroskedastic error variance.36 Table 2 presents the results of these regressions. The baseline model (Model 1) shows that targets’ nu- clear defense pacts are negatively associated with dispute initiation at conventional levels of statistical significance (p < 0.001). On average, the probability that a state will be targeted in a violent conflict decreases from 0.0034 to 0.0009 when DEFENSE PACT WITH NUCLEAR POWER is changed from 0 to 1 and all other factors are held constant.37 In other words, states lacking defense commitments from nuclear powers are more than three times as likely to be targeted in violent disputes than states with nuclear- armed allies. While the absolute probability of dispute initiation remains small even in the absence of nuclear protection, it is important to recall that violent conflict occurs infrequently, and the likelihood that a state will experience a fatal dispute in any given year is very small.38 35Polity scores range from –10 to +10. Before constructing the interaction term, we rescale CHALLENGER POLITY and TARGET POLITY so that they range from 0 to 20. 36Since violent disputes occur relatively infrequently in the dataset, we also estimate the models using rare events logit (King and Zeng 2001). The findings, which are reported in the online appendix, are unchanged with respect to statistical significance. 37All other variables are set at their means (for continuous vari- ables) or modes (for dichotomous variables); the controls for time dependence are held constant at 0. 38Violent disputes occur in 0.28% of the directed dyad-year obser- vations in our sample. 928 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S.

These probabilities rise considerably if we base our cal- culations on longer periods of time. For example, our results indicate that the probability that a state without nuclear protection will be targeted by a particular chal- lenger sometime during a 50-year period (rather than a one-year period) is 0.156, compared to 0.047 for coun- tries that share a defense pact with a nuclear power.39 This evidence suggests that nuclear alliances indeed deter vio- lent conflict initiation—a conclusion that holds when we 39We made these calculations by applying the binomial probabil- ity theorem, assuming that all factors remain constant during the 50-year period. SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 929 code alliances using the ATOP dataset (Model 2). Foreign nuclear deployments, on the other hand, are statistically unrelated to conflict: in all four models in Table 2, the coefficient for NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT is statistically indis- tinguishable from zero.40 The null finding with respect to foreign nuclear de- ployments might be an artifact of nuclear powers’ var- ied motivations for stationing forces abroad. Although countries generally forward-deploy nuclear forces to strengthen extended deterrence, this is not their only rea- son for doing so. Historically, three additional factors have also influenced nuclear deployments (Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014).41 First, patrons sometimes station weapons abroad to defend states other than the host. Britain, for instance, deployed nuclear bombs in Singa- pore during the 1960s so that it could hit targets in East Asia in the event of war between China and the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).42 Second, states sometimes station nuclear forces abroad to prevent host nations from developing an indigenous nuclear capabil- ity (Reiter 2014). For example, the United States kept nuclear weapons in South Korea during the late 1970s and 1980s—despite Jimmy Carter’s pledge to withdraw them during the 1976 presidential campaign—in large part to reduce Seoul’s desire for an independent nuclear deterrent (Hersman and Peters 2006). Third, foreign nu- clear deployments are sometimes designed to reassure anxious allies rather than to deter attacks against them. Indeed, some U.S. nuclear deployments in Europe during the Cold War appear to have been intended primarily for a European audience rather than a Soviet one (United States Department of Defense 1978). It is therefore possible that nuclear deployments enhance extended deterrence only when they are explicitly undertaken for that purpose, but not otherwise. The findings reported above, however, are similar when we recode the deployment variable to ex- clude cases that, in our judgment, were not intended to protect the protégé from attack.43 40Nuclear deployments are statistically related to violent conflict in a simple cross-tabulation analysis (see the online appendix), but Table 2 shows that this relationship washes away once we control for confounding factors such as alliances. 41Note, however, that nuclear weapons might still deter attacks against a host state even if they are not deployed principally for that purpose. 42The goal of these deployments was not to deter attacks against Sin- gapore itself; instead, British planners aimed to exploit Singapore’s geographic location to protect nearby states. Britain’s Valiant, Vul- can, and Victor aircraft (the “V-bombers”) did not have the range to reach China if they launched from bases in Europe (Moore 2001, 61). 43Deployments that, in our view, were not intended to deter in- clude the U.S. deployments to Canada, Morocco, and Spain, and FIGURE 1 The Marginal Effect of Hosting Nuclear Weapons on the Probability of Being Targeted in a Violent Dispute –0.005 –0.0025 0 0.0025 0.005 Targets without Nuclear Allies Targets with Nuclear Allies M ar gi na l E ff ec t o f N uc le ar D ep lo ym en t o n Pr ob ab ili ty o f V io le nt C on fl ic t Note: Model 3 estimates. The 90% confidence intervals are shown. Another possibility is that the deterrent effect of nu- clear deployments is conditional on the presence of a formal nuclear alliance. Indeed, defense pacts are nei- ther necessary nor sufficient conditions for deployments. Countries sometimes have stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of states with which they do not have de- fense commitments (see Table 1); conversely, numerous countries have enjoyed a patron’s nuclear protection with- out having nuclear weapons deployed on their soil (e.g., Japan, North Korea, and Norway). It is possible that sta- tioning nuclear weapons on the territory of a protégé bolsters deterrence in the presence of an alliance guaran- tee but has no effect on conflict in the absence of such a defense commitment. Model 3 tests this conditional argument by including an interaction term between the two signaling variables. The findings, which are illustrated in Figure 1, confirm the limited utility of nuclear deployments for extended de- terrence. The marginal effect of nuclear deployments— the change in predicted probability of conflict that re- sults from shifting the deployment variable from 0 to 1 while holding all other factors constant—is statistically the British deployments to Cyprus and Malaysia/Singapore. These results are contained in the online appendix. The findings are sim- ilar if we include only U.S. deployments to NATO members, South Korea, and Taiwan—the cases that, in our view, represent the clear- est attempts to bolster extended deterrence. 930 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S. SECHSER insignificant regardless of whether nuclear alliances are present or absent: the 90% confidence interval includes zero in both scenarios. Deploying nuclear weapons does not, on average, provide reliable deterrence benefits re- gardless of whether a nuclear power has signaled its com- mitment to a protégé by forming an alliance. In terms of the control variables, DEFENSE PACT WITH NONNUCLEAR POWER and U.S. TROOPS are statistically in- significant, suggesting that conventional signals of al- liance commitment are less effective than alliance pacts with nuclear states in deterring violent conflict.44 Yet, it could be the case that the conventional capabilities of nuclear powers play a role in deterring militarized dis- putes, even if defense commitments made by nonnuclear weapons states are not, on average, associated with peace. For example, the deterrent effects of NATO could stem from the overwhelming conventional superiority of the United States rather than its nuclear arsenal. Model 4 shows, however, that DEFENSE PACT WITH NUCLEAR POWER remains statistically significant and negative when we re- calculate POWER RATIO to include the conventional capabil- ities of a target’s allies using CINC data (Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 2011).45 Thus, nuclear weapons appear to provide unique benefits for extended deterrence. Results for the remaining variables are largely consis- tent with those reported in other studies. Both NUCLEAR CHALLENGER and NUCLEAR TARGET appear to be unrelated to dispute initiation. Contiguous countries are much more likely to experience violent disputes than noncontiguous states. Foreign policy similarity is likewise associated with a lower risk of conflict. The presence of an alliance be- tween a challenger and target is generally unrelated to conflict initiation, and so is the balance of conventional capabilities—even when we account for the aggregate ca- pabilities of a state’s patrons (Model 4). Additionally, the findings show that democratic challengers are more likely to initiate disputes in general but less likely to attack democratic targets. 44The insignificance of DEFENSE PACT WITH NONNUCLEAR POWER is particularly notable because many nonnuclear regional powers form defense commitments to protect their friends. For example, Ethiopia—which is generally regarded as one of the most conven- tionally powerful states in Africa—forged defensive alliances with Libya and Yemen during the 1980s. Our analysis indicates that defense pacts such as these are generally ineffective at promoting peace through extended deterrence. 45We aggregated CINC scores for all of the states with which the target shares a defense pact and recalculated POWER RATIO based on the following formula: (challenger’s CINC + challenger’s allies’ CINC)/(challenger’s CINC + challenger’s allies’ CINC + target’s CINC + target’s allies’ CINC). Model 4 is a replication of Model 1 using this modified power ratio variable. Selection Effects and Foreign Nuclear Deployments The evidence presented above indicates that defense pacts with nuclear-armed states appear to bolster extended de- terrence, but foreign nuclear deployments do not. How- ever, it could be the case that these findings reflect a selec- tion effect because our “treatment” and “control” groups are not randomly assigned. As noted above, nuclear states may be more likely to make defense commitments and de- ploy weapons abroad for allies that are seen to be at risk of attack. If this is the case, then we might observe a positive correlation between signals of alliance commitment and conflict not because these signals are ineffectual, but be- cause they are likely to be sent only when the propensity for conflict is already high. If this sort of selection effect indeed operates in the cases we evaluate, it would make one of our findings—the deterrent effect of nuclear alliances—all the more notable. The logic of selection effects asserts that nuclear states are more likely to form alliances with protégés that are already likely to be attacked. As a result, we might observe a posi- tive (or null) correlation between alliance formation and militarized disputes—even if alliances exert a deterrent effect—simply because of the unfavorable conditions un- der which alliances are likely to form. However, our results demonstrate a negative relationship between militarized conflict and alliances with nuclear states. This suggests two possibilities: either the selection effects logic is in- correct, or nuclear alliances have even stronger deterrent effects than the results suggest. In other words, if the logic of selection effects is correct, then our results demon- strate that a nuclear alliance can transform a dyad from being relatively more conflict-prone than other dyads to one that is reliably less conflict-prone. This would consti- tute strong support for the deterrent properties of alliance commitments. A selection effect might, however, account for the null relationship we find between foreign nuclear deploy- ments and conflict. If nuclear weapons are more likely to be deployed to high-conflict areas, unadjusted corre- lations between deployments and conflict may obscure the deterrent effect of these deployments. The evidence, however, does not appear to support this claim. Figure 2 shows that the rate of fatal MIDs among targets that never hosted foreign nuclear weapons (0.30%) is nearly identi- cal to the conflict rate of eventual host states during their non-deployment years (0.28%).46 Thus, nuclear powers are not, on average, more likely to introduce forces into 46Among states that never hosted nuclear weapons, 267 of 89,852 observations in our dataset experienced violent conflict. Seventeen of 6,140 pre-deployment observations included fatal disputes. SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 931 FIGURE 2 Nuclear Deployments and Fatal Dispute Rates 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 Non-Deployment Years Deployment Years Targets That Never Hosted Foreign Nuclear Weapons Targets That Hosted Foreign Nuclear Weapons Fa ta l D is pu te R at e (p er 1 00 O pp or tu ni tie s) high-conflict zones, contradicting the selection effects ar- gument.47 The figure also shows that the rate of fatal MID initiation declines slightly when states host foreign nu- clear forces, but the difference between their deployment and non-deployment periods is statistically insignificant (p = 0.229). To further rule out the possibility that the statistically insignificant effects of NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT reported in Table 2 are due to strategic selection, we employ a bivariate probit model that is designed to estimate two equations with dichotomous outcomes (Maddala 1983).48 The first 47Indeed, nuclear states have often declined to deploy weapons to conflict-prone allies and instead chosen to provide forces to protégés that were unlikely to be attacked. For example, many of the states that hosted U.S. nuclear forces (e.g., Canada, Morocco, and Spain) were not targeted in any violent disputes during the 10 year period that preceded the deployments. Conversely, the United States never deployed nuclear weapons to conflict-prone Pakistan, a SEATO ally. 48This sort of model is frequently employed when the dependent variable and the endogenous regressor are both dichotomous (e.g., Beardsley 2008; Sondheimer and Green 2010). equation accounts for whether a state has foreign nuclear weapons on its territory, based on an existing model of the causes of foreign nuclear deployments (Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014). In the second equation, we estimate the probability of conflict initiation while accounting for the possible correlation of error terms between the two models (). The model that we employ is recursive; unlike some strategic selection models, the outcome in the first equation is not a precondition for being included in the second equation.49 The findings from the bivariate probit analysis, which are reported and discussed in the online appendix, reaf- firm that our initial findings are not driven by a strate- gic selection effect. Foreign nuclear deployments fail to achieve statistical significance, and nuclear alliances continue to be statistically associated with successful deterrence. 49This is important because countries can be attacked with or with- out having nuclear weapons deployed on their soil. 932 MATTHEW FUHRMANN AND TODD S. SECHSER Conclusion Costly signaling has been the subject of much theoretical research in international relations, but we have little em- pirical data about the relative effectiveness of specific mili- tary and diplomatic signals. The analysis above compared the efficacy of two types of signals in the context of ex- tended nuclear deterrence: public alliance commitments and extraterritorial nuclear deployments. Two main find- ings emerged. First, alliance commitments from nuclear states reduce the risk of being targeted in a militarized dispute. In other words, alliances with nuclear states ap- pear to deter violent conflict. Second, however, hosting an ally’s nuclear weapons does not have the same effect. States that host nuclear weapons do not enjoy a diminished risk of militarized disputes.50 Thus, while nuclear weapons appear to carry substantial extended deterrent benefits, those benefits do not require that nuclear weapons be stationed directly on allied territory.51 These results bear on an important and ongoing debate about signaling strategies in international poli- tics. They suggest that, in a general deterrence context, hand-tying signals may be more effective than previously believed. The efficacy of hand-tying alliance commit- ments has been doubted by some scholars, who argue that such signals are not very useful for preventing challenges against protégés. Instead, they argue, hand-tying works mainly to prevent escalation once a crisis has already been initiated (e.g., Fearon 1997, 71). Our analysis, however, suggests that this view may be too pessimistic. We find that hand-tying proclamations of alliance commitments by nuclear states significantly strengthen general deterrence and prevent challenges against protégés—even without other costly signals such as conventional military deploy- ments. It may indeed be the case, as Fearon (1997) sug- gests, that hand-tying is more commonly used as a com- mitment strategy during international crises rather than beforehand, but our analysis suggests that tying hands by engaging one’s reputation can prevent crises as well. 50Indeed, in some cases, foreign-deployed nuclear weapons may even raise the risk of militarized disputes: the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, for example, was triggered by the Soviet Union’s attempt to deploy nuclear weapons in Cuba. 51The finding that nuclear deployments do not promote peace in the absence of defense pacts is significant because, in practice, states often consider stationing military forces on the territory of friendly states that are not formal allies. As discussed earlier, the United States deployed nuclear weapons in a handful of states to which it did not formally offer nuclear protection. The United States also maintains a conventional military presence in several countries (e.g., Israel, Kyrgyzstan, and Saudi Arabia) with which it has not signed a defense pact. In addition, the analysis sheds new light on the de- terrent effects of military alliances. It lends support to the view that alliances—despite being “scraps of paper”—can be credible signals of commitment under some condi- tions. In this respect, our results are consistent with those of Leeds (2003b), Johnson and Leeds (2011), and oth- ers who find alliance protection to be an effective deter- rent. Alliances appear to carry important signaling value, at least in a nuclear context, even when patrons do not take other costly actions to support their commitments. Achieving credibility in extended nuclear deterrence re- mains one of the most difficult problems in foreign policy, and successful deterrence is never guaranteed. But our findings suggest that public alliance commitments can improve the effectiveness of deterrence, even if they do not ensure success every time. At the same time, however, our results suggest that not all alliance commitments are created equal. Specifi- cally, alliance commitments appear to bolster deterrence mainly when they are made by nuclear states. Alliance commitments by nonnuclear states, however, do not de- ter militarized disputes to the same extent. The ability to signal one’s alliance commitments through public pro- nouncements therefore may be a luxury available only to nuclear states. Nonnuclear states may need to under- take conventional troop deployments or other measures to effectively signal their commitments. Although sev- eral studies have found that verbal alliance commitments strengthen deterrence generally, our findings suggest that these results may have been driven largely by nuclear pa- trons. The benefits of alliances with nonnuclear states, by contrast, are much more limited. From a practical standpoint, our findings question the use of future nuclear deployments to bolster the pro- tection of U.S. allies in troublesome regions. For example, the United States has reportedly considered placing some of its Middle East allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella in the event that Iran acquires nuclear weapons (Landler and Sanger 2009). Our analysis suggests that nuclear weapons deployments need not accompany such guarantees in or- der to maintain deterrence. Indeed, if U.S. policy makers expect nuclear deployments to reduce the frequency with which our allies engage in militarized conflicts, they may be disappointed. If history is any guide, defense pacts that rely on the existing posture of the U.S. nuclear arsenal will be just as effective. Yet these results do not necessarily imply that U.S. nuclear weapons could be precipitously withdrawn from their current locations in Europe without serious political consequences. Indeed, this study highlights an important gap in our understanding of signaling in international politics: what are the effects of signals that are rescinded SIGNALING ALLIANCE COMMITMENTS 933 or reversed? While the results here suggest that new for- eign nuclear deployments would likely have few extended deterrent benefits, the outright termination of existing deployments could undermine deterrence if an adversary inferred from such an event that the alliance was weak. As one observer has noted, “nuclear weapons [in Europe] are kind of like the wedding ring of the marriage . . . once you start wearing one, it means something entirely different to be seen without it than it does for someone who never wore one” (Murdock and Yeats 2009, 31). Future research might evaluate the validity of this simile. These results are also subject to an additional caveat: although foreign nuclear deployments do not appear to strengthen deterrence, they may have other positive po- litical effects. Reiter (2014), for example, demonstrates that states hosting U.S. nuclear weapons during the Cold War were significantly less likely to proliferate. Others argue that foreign military deployments strengthen al- liance cohesion in observable ways. Indeed, the pres- ence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe and elsewhere traditionally has been justified on the grounds that the weapons reassure allies and improve intra-alliance coop- eration. Even today, official NATO policy holds that U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe provide an “essential polit- ical and military link between the European and North American members of the Alliance” (NATO 2006, 66). Further research is needed to investigate whether these reassurances have entailed tangible—rather than merely psychological—benefits for the United States and its allies.
