Kristin Turney University of California, Irvine Yader R. Lanuza University of Miami∗ Parental Incarceration and the Transition to Adulthood The growing literature on the intergenera- tional consequences of incarceration generally neglects to consider how paternal and maternal incarceration structures offspring’s transition to adulthood, a fundamental life course stage that has become increasingly unequal. In this article, the authors use data from the National Lon- gitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to explore the relationship between parental incarceration and both subjective (e.g., respon- dent feels older compared to others his or her age) and behavioral (e.g., respondent is a par- ent) indicators of adulthood transitions among respondents younger than age 24 (N= 10,937). The results suggest that both paternal and maternal incarceration is positively associated with the number of subjective and behavioral adulthood transitions. The results also suggest that parental incarceration is associated with some individual indicators, especially subjective indicators, of adulthood. Taken together, these findings highlight that the high incarceration rate in the United States has transformative intergenerational consequences.

Key Words: family stress or crisis, incarcerated parents, life course theory, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, transition to adulthood. The transition from adolescence to adulthood has undergone dramatic changes in the second half of the 20th century in the United States. This transition was once a standardized process that most individuals experienced within a fairly narrow age range (Furstenberg, 2010). Today, in part because of demographic changes in family life and the increased importance of higher edu- cation, the transition to adulthood has become longer and progressively variegated (Shanahan, 2000). The transition to adulthood is a fun- damental life course stage, characterized by a constellation of subjective indicators (e.g., feel- ing older compared to others one’s age) and behavioral indicators (e.g., becoming a parent), that together shape future life course trajectories (Furstenberg, 2010). One phenomenon that may structure transi- tions into adulthood is mass incarceration, the historically and comparatively high imprison- ment rates in the United States (Garland, 2001). More than 2.6 million children currently have a parent incarcerated in jail or prison, most of them for nonviolent offenses, and many more will experience parental incarceration at some point during childhood or adolescence (Sykes & Pet- tit, 2014). Incarceration is considered a stressor that proliferates from the incarcerated to his or her offspring (Turney, 2014b). Although a grow- ing literature documents the consequences of parental incarceration, little research considers the relationship between parental incarceration and behavioral and subjective indicators of adulthood (although see Foster & Hagan, 2013; Mears & Siennick, 2015). Incarceration reduces 1314 Journal of Marriage and Family 79 (October 2017): 1314–1330 DOI:10.1111/jomf.12429 Parental Incarceration and Adulthood Transitions 1315 family income (e.g., Western, 2006), disrupts parental relationships (e.g., Turney & Wilde- man, 2013), and impairs the mental health of both offspring and romantic partners (Foster & Hagan, 2013; Wildeman, Schnittker, & Turney, 2012), all of which may accelerate adulthood transitions among offspring of the incarcerated. Alternatively, insofar as parental incarceration increases offspring delinquency (e.g., Roettger & Swisher, 2011), which is associated with fewer behavioral and subjective adult transitions (Massoglia & Uggen, 2010), parental incarcer- ation may delay the transition to adulthood. It is also possible the relationship between parental incarceration and the transition to adulthood results from individual or family characteristics associated with experiencing parental incar- ceration such as household poverty or physical abuse (Johnson & Easterling, 2012). In this article, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health; http://www.cpc.unc.edu/ projects/addhealth) to provide the first system- atic examination of the relationship between parental incarceration—distinguishing between paternal and maternal incarceration—and sub- jective and behavioral markers of the transition to adulthood (Shanahan, 2000). Increased vari- ability in the transition to adulthood means that the social construction of adulthood relies less on traditional demographic markers (Silva, 2012), and, accordingly, it is critical to consider both subjective and behavioral indicators of adulthood (Galambos, Turner, & Tilton-Weaver, 2005; Massoglia & Uggen, 2010; Shanahan, 2000). Importantly, understanding the life course consequences of parental incarceration may shed light on how inequality is created and maintained. Adolescents from disadvantaged social backgrounds, who often lack family and institutional supports that allow for lengthened transitions to adulthood, are more likely than their advantaged peers to experience constrained and accelerated transitions to adulthood (Bur- ton, 2007; Osgood, Foster, Flanagan, & Ruth, 2005; also see Benson & Elder, 2011). Linking Parental Incarceration and the Transition to Adulthood Parental Incarceration and the Increased Likelihood of Adulthood Transitions Family stress process theory provides guidance for understanding how parental incarceration may structure the transition to adulthood by accelerating behavioral and subjective adulthood transitions (Conger et al., 1990). This theory, mostly used to explain how economic insecurity generates stress within families, can be extended to document how incarceration, and the stress associated with it, affects family life (Turney, 2014a). Nearly all accounts of incarceration describe it as a stressful life event accompanied by substantial trauma and stigma. Incarceration affects not only affects the incarcerated but also proliferates to family members of the incarcer- ated (Pearlin, Aneshensel, & Leblanc, 1997; Turney, 2014b), consistent with principles of the life course perspective that underscore the inter-connectedness of individuals’ lives (Elder, Johnson, & Crosnoe, 2003). To begin with, children of incarcerated par- ents are a particularly vulnerable group who experience a number of stressors (Osgood et al., 2005), all of which may be associated with behavioral and subjective adulthood transi- tions. For one, given that individuals have few opportunities to earn income while incarcerated and, upon release, have difficulty garnering employment, parental incarceration—especially paternal incarceration—increases economic hardship among families (Western, 2006). Incarceration also increases the likelihood parents divorce or separate, as maintaining contact and a high-quality relationship with an incarcerated partner is difficult (Western, 2006). Incarceration also affects other domains of family life; for example, children exposed to parental incarceration are more likely than their counterparts to experience maternal neglect (Turney, 2014a). Finally, time spent in jail or prison increases mental and physical health problems of the incarcerated, their children, and their other family members (e.g., Foster & Hagan, 2013; Wildeman et al., 2012). Given the stress associated with incarcer- ation, parental incarceration may accelerate the life course and, specifically, subjective and behavioral indicators of adulthood (Osgood et al., 2005; Shanahan, 2000). First, consider how paternal or maternal incarceration may be associated with subjective indicators of adult- hood. Subjective indicators include dimensions such as how old individuals perceive them- selves to be and are increasingly decoupled from behavioral indicators of adulthood (Silva, 2012). Paternal or maternal incarceration, either directly or indirectly (e.g., via placement in 1316 Journal of Marriage and Family foster care), can prompt children to take on adult responsibilities earlier than their peers (Burton, 2007). These children may have to care for younger siblings, provide instrumental support to the family (e.g., grocery shopping, housework, transportation for younger siblings), and offer emotional support to household mem- bers. Indeed, a recent study documented that hardship in childhood—measured by family structure, poverty, feeling unsafe, and being a victim of or witness to violence—is associated with older subjective ages, and parental incar- ceration may be another hardship that leads to older subjective ages (Johnson & Mollborn, 2009). This is consistent with other research documenting how household and financial responsibilities are associated with older sub- jective ages. For example, in her conceptual model of adultification—the idea that some children are forced to grow up faster than their peers and shoulder large and premature adult roles—Burton (2007) noted that parental incar- ceration may facilitate adultification (also see Foster, Hagan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2008). In addition to the proposed link between parental incarceration and subjective indica- tors of adulthood, parental incarceration may be simultaneously associated with behavioral indicators of adulthood (e.g., full-time employ- ment). When family resources are scarce, as they often are during and after parental incarceration, children may take on adult roles. Family finances may not allow these children to pursue post- secondary education (e.g., Crosnoe, Mistry, & Elder, 2002), and, instead, children may secure full-time employment and contribute to house- hold finances (e.g., Bozick & DeLuca, 2011). Economic hardship is also associated with early nonmarital childbearing, cohabitation, and marriage (e.g., Harknett & Kuperberg, 2011). Moving beyond economic hardship, other famil- ial consequences of incarceration may accelerate the transition to adulthood. For example, recent research finds that family instability is associated with a lower likelihood of college completion, early entry into the labor market, leaving home early, and nonmarital childbearing (Aquilino, 1996; Fomby, 2013; Fomby & Bosick, 2013). Parental Incarceration and the Decreased Likelihood of Adulthood Transitions It is also possible that parental incarceration is negatively associated with subjective and behav- ioral indicators of adulthood transitions. For one, it is well known that parental incarcera- tion increases delinquency and criminal involve- ment (Roettger & Swisher, 2011; although see Porter & King, 2015), at least partly because of intergenerational labeling, which may delay behavioral and subjective adulthood transitions (Hagan, 1991). For example, research by Mas- soglia and Uggen (2010) found that individuals who are arrested or self-report criminal activity are less likely than their counterparts to make adulthood transitions. Heterogeneity in the Relationship Between Parental Incarceration and Adulthood Transitions There are several possibilities for heterogeneous relationships between parental incarceration and adulthood transitions. For one, paternal and maternal incarceration may have different impli- cations for behavioral and subjective adulthood transitions. It could be that both paternal and maternal incarceration may impose strains on family life that similarly alter the life course of offspring. It could also be that maternal incar- ceration is more consequential than paternal incarceration given that children more com- monly live with their mothers than fathers and, correspondingly, the removal of a residential mother may be more consequential (Howard, Martin, Berlin, & Brooks-Gunn, 2011). A final possibility, given that incarcerated mothers are likely a more select group than incarcerated fathers (given that paternal incarceration is normative for some population groups), is that the relationship between maternal incarcera- tion and adulthood transitions results not from maternal incarceration but from demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors that select mothers into incarceration (Wildeman & Turney, 2014). In addition, consistent with the life course perspective that posits the consequences of life events vary by when they occur, the timing of parental incarceration may differentially influ- ence children’s transitions to adulthood (Elder, 1998). Early childhood is a critical life course period, and, therefore, parental incarceration occurring early in a child’s life may ignite an array of cascading and reverberating conse- quences that families have difficulty escaping (Entwisle & Alexander, 1989). Alternatively, parental incarceration during adolescence may render children especially vulnerable, as these Parental Incarceration and Adulthood Transitions 1317 children are likely chronologically old enough to assume adult responsibilities (such as providing instrumental support to family members). Finally, the life course perspective also sug- gests that the consequences of life events are context dependent and that the accumulation of disadvantage is especially deleterious (Elder, 1998; also see Sampson & Laub, 1993). In accordance with this perspective, children expe- riencing more than one episode of parental incarceration, compared to those experiencing only one episode, may be especially likely to experience accelerated transitions to adult- hood. The churning of parents into and out of households, which accompanies multiple incarcerations, may be especially stressful (Sobolewski & Amato, 2007). Furthermore, children exposed to chronic parental incar- ceration may also be exposed to persistent economic hardship, recurrent conflict between parents, continual impaired parenting, and severe parental mental health problems, all of which may accelerate the interconnected behav- ioral and subjective indicators of adulthood. Spurious Relationship Between Parental Incarceration and Adulthood Transitions A serious consideration is the idea that the relationship between parental incarceration and adulthood transitions is spurious. The unequal distribution of incarceration across the popula- tion means that, by and large, children of incar- cerated parents are quite different than chil- dren without incarcerated parents, even prior to experiencing parental incarceration (Wakefield & Uggen, 2010). Therefore, although it is quite possible that parental incarceration accelerates or delays adulthood transitions, it is also possi- ble that offspring of incarcerated parents would experience similar adulthood transitions regard- less of parental incarceration. The multivariate analyses account for char- acteristics associated with parental incarceration and adulthood transitions. For example, expo- sure to incarceration is concentrated among race and ethnic minorities, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, the unmarried, and those with substance abuse problems (Wakefield & Uggen, 2010). Additional characteristics that may struc- ture the transition to adulthood include delin- quency (Massoglia & Uggen, 2010), closeness to parents (Aquilino, 1997), and number of sib- lings (Conger & Little, 2010). The Current Study In response to the large number of children exposed to parental incarceration, a rapidly expanding literature documents the intergener- ational consequences of parental incarceration, especially paternal incarceration (for a recent review, see Foster & Hagan, 2015). This research demonstrates that paternal incarcera- tion is deleterious for the well-being of children and adolescents. The less extensive research on the consequences of maternal incarceration is more inconclusive, with some research suggest- ing harmful effects (e.g., Huebner & Gustafson, 2007), other research suggesting inconsequen- tial effects (e.g., Wildeman & Turney, 2014), and still other research suggesting heteroge- neous effects (e.g., Turanovic, Rodriguez, & Pratt, 2012). This study contributes to the existing liter- ature by (a) simultaneously considering pater- nal and maternal incarceration and (b) providing the first examination of the relationship between parental incarceration and a constellation of subjective and behavioral factors comprising the transition to adulthood (Shanahan, 2000). The focus on subjective indicators is especially important given the increased variability in tra- ditional behavioral markers of the transition to adulthood (Silva, 2012). Considering subjective indicators is also important because behavioral indicators have different meanings and implica- tions depending on their context (e.g., if they occur early or off-time; Bachman & Schulen- berg, 1993). For example, becoming a parent, a traditional marker of the transition to adult- hood, is not necessarily a negative or positive outcome but has different implications depend- ing on the context in which one becomes a parent (e.g., if one has stable employment, if one has a romantic partner). Relatedly, securing full-time employment is usually not considered a deleteri- ous outcome unless it takes the place of attending school. Therefore, the goal of this article is to understand the life course patterns of children who experience parental incarceration. Method Data To investigate the relationship between parental incarceration and the transition to adulthood, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a 1318 Journal of Marriage and Family nationally representative sample of adolescents in 7th through 12th grade during the 1994–1995 school year. Respondents were interviewed four times: in 1994–1995 (Wave 1, when respondents were in Grades 7 through 12), in 1996 (Wave 2), in 2001–2002 (Wave 3), and in 2008 (Wave 4). Parents were also interviewed at Wave 1. About 79% of the sampled adolescents partic- ipated in Wave 1; of these adolescents, 88%, 77%, and 80% participated in Waves 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The Add Health data, although limited in some ways, are the only nationally represen- tative data appropriately situated to address our research questions. First, the sample is large enough that it includes a relatively large number of respondents who experienced pater- nal or maternal incarceration. In addition, the study includes a number of subjective and behavioral measures of adulthood transitions. These data also include myriad information that allows us to adjust for observed characteris- tics that might alter the relationship between parental incarceration and adulthood transi- tions. Furthermore, these data are commonly used to estimate the intergenerational conse- quences of parental incarceration (e.g., Foster & Hagan, 2013). The analytic sample comprises 10,937 respondents. Of the original 20,745 respon- dents, we exclude the 5,575 observations that did not complete an interview at Wave 3 and the additional 848 observations not part of the prob- ability sample. Of those 14,322 observations, we then exclude 75 cases with missing values on any of our dependent variables and 3,310 obser- vations who are aged 24 years and older at Wave 3, as age 24 has been used in other research as a cutpoint for understanding the transition to adulthood (see, especially, Fomby & Bosick, 2013), and our indicators of the transition to adulthood are more normative for these older respondents (e.g., Manning, Brown, & Payne, 2014). Given Add Health’s complex sampling design (Harris et al., 2009), we weight all anal- yses with the Wave 3 cross-sectional weight (see Chen & Chantala, 2014) and also adjust for the appropriate primary stratification unit and strata. Importantly, the weight accounts for attrition and nonresponse, making the estimates nationally representative. Relatively few covariates are missing val- ues. On average, control variables are missing data for 3% of observations (ranging from 0%–20% [household income]). We preserve these missing values with multiple imputation, averaging results across 20 data sets (Allison, 2001). Measures Transition to adulthood. We examine seven sub- jective and behavioral indicators of adulthood (Shanahan, 2000). Subjective indicators of the transition to adulthood are the following two binary variables ascertained at Wave 3: (a) the respondent feels older than others his or her age (compared to feeling younger and feeling neither older nor younger) and (b) the respondent feels like an adult all of the time (compared to most of the time, sometimes, seldom, and never). Behav- ioral indicators of the transition to adulthood are the following five binary variables, all ascer- tained at Wave 3: (a) the respondent has his/her own residence (and does not live with parents, in another person’s home, etc.), (b) the respon- dent is not enrolled in school, (c) the respondent is employed full-time (working at least 35 hours per week), (d) the respondent has ever been mar- ried, and (e) the respondent has at least one child (measured by affirmative responses that the respondent ever had a live birth [for women] or that the respondent’s partner ever had a live birth in the context of their relationship [for men]). Figure 1 describes the respondents who have made each transition by age. We construct a summary variable that indi- cates the number of affirmative responses to these subjective and behavioral indicators (range 0–7). Higher values of this measure indicate that the respondent has made a greater number of adulthood transitions, although we remain agnostic as to whether a greater number of adulthood transitions indicates a positive or negative outcome. Indeed, a given value on the summary indicator may have qualitatively dif- ferent meanings for different respondents, and it is likely that the combination of specific types of adulthood transitions are particularly con- sequential (an important point but outside the scope of this article). Given the great variability both across and within these measures (e.g., perceived adulthood may be experienced as a positive experience for some respondents and a negative experience for other respondents), we also consider the seven specific indicators (also see online Appendix Table A for a cor- relation matrix of these individual indicators, Parental Incarceration and Adulthood Transitions 1319 Figure 1. Proportion of Respondents Reporting Each Transition, by Age. 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 18 19 20 21 22 23 Perceived age old Feels like adult all the time Not enrolled in school Full-time employment Lives on own Ever married Had a child which shows a moderate correlation between subjective and behavioral indicators). Parental incarceration. We consider the inde- pendent influences of paternal and maternal incarceration. To construct our indicators of paternal incarceration, we use information from the following three questions ascertained at Wave 4 (for an extended discussion of the reli- ability of these measures, see Foster & Hagan, 2013): (a) “Has/did your biological father ever (spend/spent) time in jail or prison?” (b) “How old were you when your biological father went to jail or prison for the first time?” (c) “How old were you when your biological father was released from jail or prison most recently?” Mutually exclusive dummy variables indicate paternal incarceration: never incarcerated (ref- erence group), first-time paternal incarceration between ages 0 and 17, and first-time pater- nal incarceration occurring prior to birth or after age 17. This last category allows us to separate out paternal incarceration that did not occur during the respondent’s childhood or adolescence and ensures appropriate time ordering between the independent and depen- dent variables (all of which were measured when respondents were at least 18 years old). Although we include respondents in this last category in the multivariate models, the analy- ses focus on comparisons between respondents experiencing paternal incarceration between ages 0 and 17 and respondents never experi- encing paternal incarceration. The measures of maternal incarceration parallel those of paternal incarceration. Control variables. The multivariate analyses adjust for two sets of control variables, all mea- sured at Wave 1 unless otherwise noted. The first set of control variables includes basic demo- graphic characteristics that are almost certainly set prior to parental incarceration: respondent’s race or ethnicity, respondent’s age (measured at Wave 3), respondent’s gender, respondent’s nativity status (a binary variable indicating he or she was born in the United States), mother’s age, and parent’s educational attainment (the education of the most highly educated parent). Furthermore, a binary variable indicates the parent respondent participated in Wave 1. The second set of control variables includes an extended set of individual and family char- acteristics, at least some of which may be endogenous to parental incarceration. A contin- uous variable indicates the respondent’s number of siblings. Binary variables indicate the follow- ing: the respondent reported verbal, physical, or sexual abuse prior to age 12 (measured at Wave 4); the respondent is extremely close to his or her biological father; the respondent is extremely close to his or her biological mother; 1320 Journal of Marriage and Family and the respondent reports drugs are available at home. Respondent’s delinquency is mea- sured by averaging responses to 15 questions about the frequency (0= never to 3= 5 or more times) of engagement in delinquent activities such as theft, fighting, or vandalism (𝛼 = .84). Respondent’s exposure to violence averages responses to five questions (e.g., respondent saw someone shoot or stab another person measured as 0= never to 2=more than once; 𝛼 = .66). We adjust for parent-reported household income (logged), and binary variables include the fol- lowing: the parent has enough money to pay bills, either parent receives public assistance, the parent is married, the parent drinks at least 3 days per week, and the parent reports drugs are a big problem in the neighborhood. Analytic Strategy The analyses estimate the association between paternal and maternal incarceration between ages 0 and 17 and the transition to adulthood. We use ordinary least squares regression models to estimate our summary indicator of the transi- tion to adulthood, as this indicator is normally distributed, and logistic regression models to estimate our seven individual indicators of subjective and behavioral transitions. Model 1 presents the unadjusted association, Model 2 adjusts for basic demographic controls, and Model 3 extends this model to also adjust for the extended control variables. These extended control variables (e.g., household income) may predict paternal or maternal incarceration or may result from paternal or maternal incarcer- ation (and, consequently, be pathways linking parental incarceration to adulthood transitions), although the data do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. Because both processes likely occur simultaneously, we con- sider Model 2 to be a lower bound estimate and Model 3 to be an upper bound estimate, a point we return to in the discussion. Sample Description Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables. Respondents report, on average, affir- mative answers to 2.8 indicators of the transi- tion to adulthood. Nearly three fifths (58.9%) of respondents report their perceived age is older than their objective age, and nearly two fifths (38.9%) report feeling like an adult all the time. Transitions that do not involve family forma- tion are relatively common among respondents, with 44.9% living on their own, 59.0% not being enrolled in school, and 45.2% having full-time employment at Wave 3. Family formation tran- sitions, including having married (14.8%) and having had a child (17.2%), are less common. About 8%, 17%, 20%, 21%, 17%, 11%, 5%, and 2% of the sample report making zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven transitions to adult- hood, respectively (descriptives not shown). In terms of parental incarceration, about one tenth (10.4%) of the respondents experienced pater- nal incarceration and 2.3% experienced maternal incarceration between ages 0 and 17. Results Subjective and Behavioral Transition to Adulthood Measures, by Parental Incarceration Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of the seven subjective and behavioral transitions to adulthood indicators, by paternal and maternal incarceration. We compared respondents who experienced paternal or maternal incarceration between ages 0 and 17 to those who never experienced paternal or maternal incarceration, respectively. By and large, children who expe- rienced paternal incarceration were more likely than their counterparts to report both subjec- tive and behavioral indicators of the transition to adulthood. For example, the mean number of adulthood transitions was 3.3 for respondents who experienced paternal incarceration and 2.7 for those who did not (p< .001). Respondents who experienced paternal incarceration were more likely to report perceived ages that are older than their objective age (69.8% compared to 57.0%, p< .001) and feel like an adult all of the time (59.1% compared to 37.3%, p< .001). They were also more likely to be living on their own (49.9% compared to 44.2%, p= .013), not be enrolled in school (73.3% compared to 56.7%, p< .001), have married (19.4% com- pared to 14.1%, p= .002), and have had a child (28.4% compared to 15.8%, p< .001). There were also statistically significant descriptive differences by maternal incarcera- tion. The mean number of adulthood transitions was 3.5 for respondents who experienced mater- nal incarceration and 2.8 for respondents who did not (p< .001).

They were also more likely to not be enrolled in school (78.8% compared to 58.3%, p< .001) and have had a child (29.0% compared to 16.7%, p= .001). Estimating Adulthood Transitions as a Function of Parental Incarceration Estimating summary measure of adulthood transitions. Table 3 presents ordinary least squares regression models estimating the sum- mary indicator of adulthood transitions. Again we focus our discussion on differences between those who experienced parental incarceration between ages 0 and 17 and those who never experienced parental incarceration. Model 1, the unadjusted association, showed that respondents who experienced paternal incarceration, when compared with their counterparts, reported a greater number of transitions (b= 0.574, p< .001). Maternal incarceration was also associated with a greater number of transitions (b= 0.551, p= .001). Model 2, which adjusted for basic demographic controls, showed that both paternal incarceration (b= 0.368, p< .001) and maternal incarceration (b= 0.457, p= .003) were associated with a greater number of transitions. In Model 3, which adjusted for an extended set of covariates, the coeffi- cients for paternal incarceration (b= 0.218, p= .006) and maternal incarceration (b= 0.261, p= .074) were reduced in magnitude but remained statistically or marginally statistically significant. Supplemental analyses. We conducted two sets of supplemental analyses. First, we considered the possibility there may be age variation in the association between parental incarcera- tion and adulthood transitions among 18- to 23-year-olds. In supplemental analyses (not pre- sented), we included interaction terms between parental incarceration and respondents’ age at Wave 3. Interaction terms were not statistically significant across any of the outcome vari- ables (e.g., for the summary measure, Paternal Incarceration Between Ages 0 and 17×Age: b= 0.003, p= .787; Maternal Incarceration Between Ages 0 and 17×Age: b= 0.017, p= .699). Second, we considered the possibility that the timing and chronicity of parental incarcera- tion may be differentially associated with adult- hood transitions.

About 47% of chil- dren who experienced any paternal incarceration experienced it only once, and 53% experienced it two or more times. Among respondents exposed to maternal incarceration, about 33%, 40%, and 28% experienced it in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and 48% and 52% experienced it once and more than once, respec- tively. Results showed the timing of parental incarceration was not differentially associated with the summary indicator of adulthood transi- tions. Results also showed that paternal incarcer- ation chronicity was not differentially associated with adulthood transitions but that, relative to children exposed to one maternal incarceration spell, children exposed to more than one mater- nal incarceration spell experienced more adult- hood transitions (p= .083 after adjusting for all covariates). Estimating individual measures of adulthood transitions. These analyses are limited because they did not consider the individual (subjective and behavioral) measures of the transition to adulthood, all of which may have different implications for well-being. We consider these individual indicators in Table 4. With respect to the first subjective indicator, perceived age, Model 1 showed that paternal incarceration was associated with a greater likelihood of having a perceived age that is older than one’s objective age (b= 0.528, odds ratio [OR]= 1.70, p< .001). These associations persisted when adjusting for a limited set of controls (b= 0.443, OR= 1.56, p< .001) and an extended set of controls (b= 0.292, OR= 1.34, p= .006). With respect to the second subjective indi- cator of the transition to adulthood, Model 1 showed that paternal incarceration was asso- ciated with a greater likelihood of feeling like an adult all the time (b= 0.403, OR= 1.50, p< .001). This association remained statistically significant in Model 2 (b= 0.222, OR= 1.25, p= .044) but not in Model 3 (b= 0.151, OR= 1.16, p= .176). Maternal incarceration was associated with a greater likelihood of feeling like an adult all the time in Models 1 and 2 and remained marginally significant in Model 3 (b= 0.365, OR= 1.44, p= .074). In supplementary analyses, which further adjusted for the behavioral indicators of the transition to adulthood, we found paternal incarceration was associated with perceived age (b= 0.260, OR= 1.30, p= .014), and maternal incarcera- tion was associated with feeling like an adult (b= 0.340, OR= 1.41, p= .088), suggesting that parental incarceration was associated with per- ceived adulthood above and beyond behavioral transitions made.

The most conservative model, Model 3, suggested that paternal and maternal incarceration were associ- ated with not being enrolled in school (b= 0.238, OR= 1.27, p= .055 and b= 0.486, OR= 1.63, p= .082, respectively) and paternal incarcera- tion was associated with a greater likelihood of having had a child (b= 0.281, OR= 1.32, p= .032). Discussion The transition to adulthood is an increasingly important life course period and, because of both demographic changes in family life and the increasing number of individuals obtaining higher education, this life course period has become longer and less standardized. In this arti- cle, we use data from Add Health—a nation- ally representative study designed to, among other things, understand the correlates and con- sequences of the transition to adulthood—to examine how parental incarceration structures adulthood transitions. This article contributes to existing literature by providing the first compre- hensive examination of the relationship between parental incarceration and both subjective and behavioral adulthood transitions, extending our knowledge about the intergenerational conse- quences of parental incarceration. The results suggest three main conclusions. First, we found that both paternal and maternal incarceration in childhood and adolescence (between ages 0 and 17) was associated with a greater number of adulthood transitions, measured as a constellation of subjective and behavioral indicators between ages 18 and 23. This suggests that parental incarceration may accelerate the life course of offspring. Relatedly, we found that the timing of parental incarcer- ation matters little in predicting the number of adulthood transitions and that maternal incarcer- ation chronicity, but not paternal incarceration chronicity, was associated with a greater number of adulthood transitions. We caution putting too much weight on the differences in the conse- quences of maternal and paternal incarceration chronicity, as the paternal incarceration and maternal incarceration coefficients are not statistically different from one another. By and large, both paternal incarceration and mater- nal incarceration are similarly associated with adulthood transitions. Second, as examining the summary measure of adulthood transitions potentially obscures qualitatively different types of transitions, we examined individual transitions and found that the consequences of parental incarceration depend on the outcome. We found that parental incarceration is associated with subjective tran- sitions (in particular, paternal incarceration was associated with having a perceived age older than one’s objective age and maternal incarcera- tion was associated with feeling like an adult all the time), suggesting that parental incarceration has implications for offspring’s identity and self-concept, as it does for their incarcerated parents (Arditti, 2012). These results provide additional evidence that transitions to adulthood in contemporary American society have a strong subjective dimension, corroborating recent research that the transition to adulthood is more complicated than when only considering behav- ioral transitions (Silva, 2012). Future research should examine the decoupling of objective and subjective transitions and its consequences for generating family inequalities. Third, we found limited evidence that parental incarceration is associated with behavioral out- comes. We find that both paternal and maternal incarceration was positively associated with not being enrolled in school and that paternal incarceration was positively associated with having had a child, a finding that indicates parental incarceration curtails one of the few avenues for upward mobility in contemporary America. Nevertheless, we found that parental incarceration, above and beyond characteristics that lead to parental incarceration, was not associated with full-time employment, living on one’s own, or marriage. A possible link between parental incarceration and school enrollment results from children leaving school to take on adult responsibilities, but it may also result from the fact that children of incarcerated parents experience lower grades and test scores than their counterparts (Foster & Hagan, 2007), the latter of which is especially likely given the predominantly null results for the other behavioral indicators of adulthood. These null results, in conjunction with the statistically significant unadjusted differences, suggest that characteristics associated with parental incarceration—such as race or ethnicity and parental educational attainment—render the relationship parental incarceration and behav- ioral transitions spurious. It is also possible Parental Incarceration and Adulthood Transitions 1327 that these null average results mask significant heterogeneity in associations across subgroups, an important direction for future research. Taken together, these findings are consis- tent with family stress process theory (Conger et al., 1990). Parental incarceration is a stressor that reverberates from the incarcerated to the family members of the incarcerated, which then accelerates adulthood transitions (Turney, 2014b). The findings suggest that the life course consequences of parental incarceration, similar to other types of hardship (e.g., Johnson & Mollborn, 2009), extend beyond adolescence and persist as youth transition to adulthood (for other research on postadolescent outcomes, see, e.g., Foster & Hagan, 2013; Mears & Siennick, 2015; Roettger & Swisher, 2011). These accel- erated adulthood transitions are consistent with Burton’s (2007, p. 329) notion of adultification, which suggests that children can “assume exten- sive adult roles and responsibilities within their family networks.” Parental incarceration, and the corresponding loss of economic and social resources, may push children into adult roles more quickly than their counterparts (Burton, 2007). Limitations The Add Health study—with its nationally rep- resentative sample, longitudinal design, and rich measures of the transition to adulthood—is the most appropriate data source for pursuing our research questions, but limitations exist. First, these analyses preclude documenting a causal relationship between parental incarceration and adulthood transitions. In addition, as described earlier, we cannot always establish proper time ordering between the independent and con- trol variables. Many of the control variables, measured at Wave 1, are likely endogenous to parental incarceration. This means that our final model may be an upper bound estimate of this association and that we cannot pre- cisely estimate the mechanisms linking parental incarceration to accelerated transitions to adulthood, an important direction for research using different data. There are limitations to the measurement of both parental incarceration and the transition to adulthood. For example, incarceration his- tories are unavailable. Relatedly, the transition to adulthood is certainly more complex than simply considering subjective and behavioral indicators individually or by summing together these indicators. The combination of these mea- sures is likely a more important predictor of future life course outcomes than any one individ- ual measure. Future research should also exam- ine how parental incarceration is associated with the clustering of transitions, the timing of transi- tions, the sequencing of transitions, and lengthy transitions, as well as examine transitions that occur after age 24 (as transitions such as mar- riage and childbearing become more normative in the late 20s) and how caregiver stability or instability during and after parental incarcera- tion mediates or moderates the link between parental incarceration and adulthood transitions. Finally, there are limitations regarding the sampling design. Add Health is a representative school-based sample of American children, which excludes individuals who have dropped out before data collection began (and, there- fore, older respondents may be more selective than younger respondents). Because it is likely that high school dropouts are most likely to experience both parental incarceration and adulthood transitions, their absence is note- worthy, although the direction of potential bias is unclear. The inclusion of high school dropouts may strengthen the relationship between parental incarceration and transitions to adulthood, as they have already experienced one transition (leaving school). Conversely, the inclusion of high school dropouts, who are likely disadvantaged across a host of characteristics, may show the relationship between parental incarceration and adulthood transitions results from social selection (or the idea that unmea- sured variables may render the relationship between parental incarceration and adulthood transitions spurious). Conclusion How youth transition to adulthood in the United States has become increasingly unequal, with advantaged youth experiencing lengthened transitions to adulthood and disadvantaged youth experiencing increasingly accelerated pathways to adulthood. However, the correlates of adulthood transitions, which are consequen- tial for later life course trajectories, are not completely understood, and this study suggests that parental incarceration is linked to adulthood transitions. Because there are a disproportionate number of poor and minority children who 1328 Journal of Marriage and Family experience parental incarceration, many of whom are transitioning to adulthood without a safety net (Osgood et al., 2005), this has implications for increasing race, ethnic, and social class disparities in the transition to adult- hood (Furstenberg, 2010). Indeed, young adults with a history of parental incarceration may benefit from supports to ease the transition to adulthood. Attention to young adults’ subjective feelings of adulthood, potentially via supports in high school, may be especially important in setting the stage for a successful transition to adulthood. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the historically and comparatively high imprisonment rates in the United States have transformative consequences for adulthood transitions and, more generally, highlights an important way in which the prison boom has intergenerational consequences.
