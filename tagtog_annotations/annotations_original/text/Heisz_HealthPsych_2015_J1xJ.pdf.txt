BRIEF REPORT Age Differences in the Association of Physical Activity, Sociocognitive Engagement, and TV Viewing on Face Memory Jennifer J. Heisz McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Susan Vandermorris Baycrest Health Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Johnny Wu Rotman Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Anthony R. McIntosh and Jennifer D. Ryan Rotman Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Baycrest Health Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Objective: Physical and sociocognitive lifestyle activities promote aspects of cognitive function in older adults. Very little is known about the relation between these lifestyle activities and cognitive function in young adults. One aspect of cognitive function that is critical for everyday function is episodic memory. The present study examined the relationship between lifestyle activities and episodic memory in younger and older adults. Method: Participants were 62 younger (mean age  24 years) and older adults (mean age  74 years). The augmented Victoria Longitudinal Study Activities Questionnaire was used to quantify level of engagement in physical activity, sociocognitive activity, and TV viewing. Episodic memory was assessed using the old–new face recognition paradigm in which memory for younger and older faces was tested. Results: Compared to younger adults, older adults reported being less physically and sociocognitively active while engaging in more passive behaviors such as TV viewing. A positive association was observed between physical activity and episodic memory for young adults but not for older adults. Interestingly, TV viewing was negatively associated with episodic memory in older adults but not younger adults. No relationship was found between sociocognitive activity and episodic memory for either younger or older adults. Although the own-age effect was observed for older adults, face age did not interact with lifestyle activities. Conclusion: The positive cognitive benefits of physical activity extend to younger adults; however, the interplay between physical activity and cognition may differ across the life span. Furthermore, TV viewing may be particularly detrimental to cognitive performance later in life. Keywords: cognitive function, memory, aging, exercise, lifestyle Older adults can maintain aspects of their cognitive function for longer into their life span by being physically active (Hertzog, Kramer, Wilson, & Lindenberger, 2008), engaging in socially and cognitively stimulating activities (Brown et al., 2012; Ghisletta, Bickel, & Lövdén, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2012; Small, Dixon, McArdle, & Grimm, 2011) and watching less TV (Lindstrom et al., 2005). Very few studies have examined the effects of these lifestyle activities on cognition in young adults. An assumption is that young adults are performing at peak physical and cognitive levels with little room for improvement; however, a sedentary lifestyle may put young adults at risk because of evidence for the positive effects of physical activity on cognition. For young adults, little is known about the effects of sociocog- nitive activities (e.g., socializing with friends, volunteering) or TV viewing on cognition, and the benefits of cognitive training on a specific task do not necessarily transfer to other cognitive domains (Owen et al., 2010). In contrast, there is some evidence linking exercise and general cognitive function: Adolescents enrolled in three or more physical education classes per week have better academic performance (Kim & So, 2012) and young adults with better physical fitness have higher IQs (Åberg et al., 2009). How- ever, few studies have examined specific aspects of cognition, although there is evidence that exercise improves episodic memory in young adults (Pereira et al., 2007). For older adults, the rich literature linking lifestyle activities and cognitive function is mixed. Engagement in sociocognitive activ- ities does not necessarily protect older adults against typical age- This article was published Online First January 27, 2014. Jennifer J.

Health Psychology © 2014 American Psychological Association 2015, Vol. 34, No. 1, 83–88 0278-6133/15/$12.00 http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0000046 83 related decline in cognitive function (Brown et al., 2012) yet less time watching TV in midlife may reduce risk of Alzheimer’s disease later in life (Lindstrom et al., 2005). Physical exercise improves processing speed, spatial processing, and executive con- trol (i.e., the selection, planning, and coordination of complex cognitive events) for older adults (Hertzog et al., 2008); however, little is known about the impact of physical activity and episodic memory in older adults, although the typical age-related atrophy in brain regions that mediate episodic memory (i.e., the hippocam- pus) is reduced, and in some cases reversed, following an aerobic exercise intervention (Erickson et al., 2009). A critical step in understanding the interplay between age, cognition, and lifestyle is to evaluate these effects simultaneously in young and older adults. Few studies have used such an ap- proach, although at least one study failed to find exercise-related improvements in executive control for younger adults (Hillman et al., 2006). Episodic memory represents a logical cognitive target for this purpose given evidence that physical and cognitive activ- ities promote hippocampal neurogenesis in nonhuman animals (van Praag, Kempermann, & Gage, 2000). Interestingly, both baseline and lifestyle-related neurogenesis decline dramatically with age (Van Praag, Shubert, Zhao, & Gage, 2005), suggesting that the positive effects of an active lifestyle on episodic memory may be less potent in older than younger adults. The ability to recognize faces is an important aspect of episodic memory function that is both dependent on hippocampal integrity and declines with age (Anastasi & Rhodes, 2006; Burgess, Magu- ire, & O’Keefe, 2002; Heisz & Ryan, 2011). However, older adults have better recognition memory for faces of people that belong to the same age cohort, that is, the own-age effect (Anastasi & Rhodes, 2006). It is unclear whether younger and older adults experience similar lifestyle-related benefits for face recognition or whether the benefits extend to recognition of all face types. The aims of the present study were to examine whether face memory is related to an individual’s engagement in lifestyle ac- tivities (physical activity, sociocognitive activity, TV viewing) and to determine whether any observed relations are age-dependent. The typical own-age effect in face memory was expected. Face memory was expected to improve with level of engagement in physical and sociocognitive activities but decline with amount of TV viewing. Given the age-related reduction in hippocampal neu- rogenesis, a key question was whether different relationships be- tween lifestyle and memory would be observed for younger versus older adults. Method Participants Sixty-two healthy adults (31 younger) participated in this study. One older adult did not complete the experiment and was excluded from the analyses. Table 1 provides a description of the participants. Vision of all the participants was normal or corrected to normal. Procedure The experiment took place during a 1.5-hr session. Episodic memory was tested using a face recognition paradigm. Stimuli consisted of 120 gray-scale faces (60 young, 60 old). During the study phase, faces were presented individually for 5 s each and presented one, three, or five times to obtain a range of memory performance at test. The testing phase consisted of a random selection of the studied faces plus new faces for a total of 60 faces. The participants determined, in a self-paced manner, if the current face was studied or new. After the experiment, participants com- pleted benchmark measures of general cognitive status: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nasreddine et al., 2005) and American National Adult Reading Test (Blair & Spreen, 1989). Participants also completed the augmented Victoria Longitudinal Study Activ- ities Questionnaire rating their frequency of engagement in spe- cific lifestyle activities during the past 2 years, with the response options: 0 (never), 1 (less than once a year), 2 (about once a year), 3 (2 or 3 times a year), 4 (about once a month), 5 (2 or 3 times a month), 6 (about once a week), 7 (2 or 3 times a week), and 8 (daily) (Jopp & Hertzog, 2010). Physical activity was computed as the sum of six exercise-related questions (max score  48), in- cluding aerobics, resistance training, stretching, sport, and outdoor-activities. Sociocognitive activity was computed as the sum of 47 questions about social and cognitive activities (max score  376), including games, crafts, social private/public, reli- gious, developmental, experiential activities, and technology use. Separate correlation analyses on the relation between social versus cognitive activities and face memory were similar to the relation between sociocognitive activities (i.e., the sum of social and cog- Table 1 Mean (and Standard Deviation) Demographic Information for Younger and Older Adults Variable Younger adults (n  31) Older adults (n  30) t(59) Sig.M (SD) M (SD) Age (years) 24 (4.3) 74 (6.9) Age range (years) 19–33 65–85 Gender (female/male) 16/15 15/15 Education (years) 17.0 (3.1) 16.6 (3.4) 0.49 Physical activity 26.3 (7.2) 22.1 (11.1) 1.77 .08 Sociocognitive activity 156.9 (25.3) 138.3 (28.0) 3.10 .009 TV viewing 16.7 (6.7) 21.9 (6.4) 2.72 .003 Note.

TV viewing was computed as the sum of four questions (max score  32), includ- ing news, documentary, educational, comedy/adventure, and game shows. Statistical Analyses To obtain an index of face memory, responses to all faces regardless of exposure amount (one, three, or five) were aver- aged together and face memory was computed as the mean number of hits minus false alarms (i.e., correctly identified studied faces minus incorrectly identified new faces) separately for younger and older faces. Age differences in face memory were analyzed using a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) with one between-subjects variable of participant age (younger, older) and one within-subjects variable of face age (younger, older). Age-differences in lifestyle activities were assessed by independent samples t-tests contrasting physical activity, sociocognitive activity, and TV viewing for younger versus older adults. Pearson correlation tests examined the relationship between these activities. Associations between face memory and lifestyle activities were assessed using Pearson Table 2 Mean (and Standard Error) Face Memory Performance (Hits– False Alarms) for Younger and Older Adults Viewing Young and Older Faces Younger adults M (SE) Older adults M (SE) Young faces .76 (.03) .56 (.04) Older faces .74 (.03) .74 (.03) 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.0 0 10 20 30 25 15 5 TV V ie w in g Episodic memory performance 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.0 40 30 20 10 0 P hy si ca l A ct iv ity Episodic memory performance TV V ie w in g Younger adults 0 10 20 30 25 15 5 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.0 Episodic memory performance 40 30 20 10 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.0 P hy si ca l A ct iv ity Episodic memory performance Older adults Figure 1.

Results Age Differences in Face Memory Table 2 presents mean face memory for younger and older adults. The ANOVA on face memory revealed a main effect of participant age, F(1, 59)  5.035, p  .05, p2  .08, with younger adults outperforming older adults. The main effect of face age was significant, F(1, 59)  11.39, p  .001, p2  .16, as was the interaction of face age with participant age, F(1, 59)  17.33, p  .001, p2  .23. To explain this interaction, post hoc paired-samples t-tests contrasting memory for younger versus older faces revealed an own-age effect for older adults, with superior memory for older faces compared to younger faces, t(29)  4.95, p  .001, d  .98; in contrast, an own-age effect was not observed for younger adults, t(30)  0.61, ns. Age Differences in Lifestyle Activities Compared to younger adults, older adults reported being mar- ginally less physically active, significantly less sociocognitively active, and watched significantly more TV (see Table 1). Engage- ment in physical and sociocognitive activities were positively correlated with each other—younger: r(29)  .48, p  .01, older adults: r(28)  .36, p .05. TV viewing did not correlate with either physical or sociocognitive activity. Associations Between Face Memory and Lifestyle For younger adults, face memory correlated with physical ac- tivity but not sociocognitive activity or TV viewing (see Figure 1 and Table 3). Physical activity was significantly related to memory for younger faces and marginally, but not significantly, related to memory for older faces. To further examine the relation between physical activity and face memory (averaged across face age) in younger adults, a post hoc hierarchical regression analysis revealed that physical activity predicted face memory over and above age, gender, sociocognitive activities and TV viewing (see Table 4). For older adults, memory for both younger and older faces negatively correlated with TV viewing but was unrelated to physical or socio- cognitive activity (see Figure 1 and Table 3). To further examine the relation between TV viewing and face memory (averaged across face age) in older adults, a post hoc hierarchical multiple regression anal- ysis revealed that TV viewing predicted face memory over and above age, gender, physical, and sociocognitive activities (see Table 5). Discussion We examined the association between lifestyle and age on episodic memory and found a positive relation between physical activity and face memory: Young adults who were more physically active had better face memory, consistent with the existing liter- ature showing a direct benefit of exercise on episodic memory in younger adult populations (Pereira et al., 2007). Critically, older adults’ face memory was not related to physical activity but was negatively related to TV viewing, suggesting that the interplay between physical activity and cognition is altered across the life span.

Despite evidence that exercise mitigates age- related hippocampal atrophy to improve spatial processing (Erick- son et al., 2011), the link between hippocampal volume and memory performance is weak and not always observed (Van Petten, 2004). Instead, some researchers have posited that this dissociation between hippocampal volume and memory function is explained by the underactivation of the hippocampus by older adults during memory tasks and the recruitment of other brains regions to compensate for diminished hippocampal function (Grady et al., 2003). Consequently, the neurogenic effects of exercise may not translate into functional gains in older adults because the hippocampus is engaged less during processing. Older adults watched more TV and were less involved in physical-sociocognitive activities than younger adults. Like some previous studies (Brown et al., 2012), we failed to find an associ- ation between sociocognitive activities and cognitive performance in either young or older adults. However, older adults who watched more TV had poorer memory, despite their engagement in other activities. Interestingly, the same negative relation between TV viewing and face memory was not observed for young adults, suggesting that TV viewing may be particularly detrimental for older adults. Indeed, TV viewing in midlife is predictive of Alz- heimer’s disease later in life (Lindstrom et al., 2005), suggesting that TV viewing may accelerate the trajectory of age-related cog- nitive decline. Young adults had better face memory than older adults; how- ever, this difference was minimized for older faces, consistent with an own-age bias for older adults (Anastasi & Rhodes, 2006). The relation between the three lifestyle factors and memory did not differ by stimulus type; for example, older adults who watched more TV had poorer face memory for all faces, suggesting a global decline. This is the first study to reveal age-dependencies in the rela- tionship between memory and lifestyle; however, some limitations include (a) self-reports were used to assess lifestyle activities, which may not perfectly estimate activity level and (b) the cross- sectional design limits conclusions regarding the causality of the relationship between lifestyle and face memory. Future studies should use interventions to directly examine the effect of lifestyle on memory across the life span. This is the first study to show a relation between physical activity and memory in younger adults that was not present in older adults. Younger adults who were more physically active had better face memory, suggesting that young sedentary adults could improve their memory through exercise. In contrast, older adults’ face memory was negatively related to TV viewing, suggesting that this form of sedentary behavior may be partic- ularly detrimental later in life. In prescribing activity interven- tion for older adults, health care professional should monitor their patients’ TV viewing. References Åberg, MaI, Pedersen, N.

Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process. As a reviewer, you would gain valuable experience in publishing. The P&C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process. If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write APA Journals at Reviewers@apa.org. Please note the following important points: • To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review. • To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research. • To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, “social psychology” is not sufficient—you would need to specify “social cognition” or “attitude change” as well. • Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1–4 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly. APA now has an online video course that provides guidance in reviewing manuscripts.
