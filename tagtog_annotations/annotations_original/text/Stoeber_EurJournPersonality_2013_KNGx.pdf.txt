Perfectionism and Self-conscious Emotions in British and Japanese Students: Predicting Pride and Embarrassment after Success and Failure JOACHIM STOEBER1*, OSAMU KOBORI2 and YOSHIHIKO TANNO3 1University of Kent, Canterbury, UK 2Chiba University, Chiba, Japan 3University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan Abstract: Regarding self-conscious emotions, studies have shown that different forms of perfectionism show different relationships with pride, shame, and embarrassment depending on success and failure. What is unknown is whether these relationships also show cultural variations. Therefore, we conducted a study investigating how self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism predicted pride and embarrassment after success and failure by comparing 363 British and 352 Japanese students. Students were asked to respond to a set of scenarios where they imagined achiev- ing either perfect (success) or flawed (failure) results. In both British and Japanese students, self-oriented perfection- ism positively predicted pride after success and embarrassment after failure, whereas socially prescribed perfectionism predicted embarrassment after success and failure. Moreover, in Japanese students, socially prescribed perfectionism positively predicted pride after success and self-oriented perfectionism negatively predicted pride after failure. The findings have implications for our understanding of perfectionism, indicating that the perfectionism–pride relationship not only varies between perfectionism dimensions but may also show cultural variations.

Key words: perfectionism; self-conscious emotions; achievement; success; failure; pride; embarrassment; cross-cultural comparisons Individuals with high levels of perfectionism are character- ized by striving for flawlessness and setting exceedingly high standards for performance accompanied by tendencies for overly critical evaluations of their behaviour (Flett & Hewitt, 2002; Frost, Marten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990). Conse- quently, it has been argued that such individuals regard all their achievements as underachievements and therefore are prone to experience shame and embarrassment and are unable to experience pride (e.g. Hewitt & Flett, 1991; Sorotzkin, 1985; see Tangney, 2002 for a comprehensive review). This argument, however, ignores that perfectionism has many faces (Benson, 2003) and is best conceptualized as a multidimensional personality characteristic (Frost et al., 1990; Hewitt & Flett, 1991; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, & Ashby, 2001; see Enns & Cox, 2002 for a review). More- over, it ignores findings that some forms of perfectionism show positive correlations with pride, particularly pride after success (Fedewa, Burns, & Gomez, 2005; Stoeber, Harris, & Moon, 2007; Stoeber, Kempe, & Keogh, 2008). Finally, the argument ignores that there may be cultural variations in the relationships of perfectionism and pride. Research has shown that people from Western cultures show marked differences compared with people from Asian cultures regarding self- conscious emotions like pride, shame, and embarrassment (e.g. Markus & Kitayama, 1994). Consequently, it may be important to take cultural differences into account when ex- amining how different forms of perfectionism are related to self-conscious emotions following success and failure. Perfectionism Regarding multidimensional conceptualizations of perfection- ism, one of the most prevalent and widely researched models is Hewitt and Flett’s (1991) model of perfectionism. With the recognition that perfectionism has personal and social aspects, the model differentiates two main forms of perfectionism: self- oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism.1 Self-oriented perfectionism is characterized by setting exceed- ingly high standards for oneself and comprises beliefs that striving for perfection and being perfect are important. In contrast, socially prescribed perfectionism comprises beliefs that others have high standards for oneself and that acceptance by others is conditional on fulfilling these standards (Hewitt & Flett, 1991, 2004). Regarding the literature on self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism, the findings are in agreement that socially prescribed perfectionism is a mal- adaptive form of perfectionism showing strong and *Correspondence to: Joachim Stoeber, School of Psychology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NP, UK.

Because other-oriented perfectionism is not regarded a core dimen- sion of multidimensional perfectionism (e.g. Enns & Cox, 2002; Stoeber & Otto, 2006), it was not included in the present study.

Self-oriented perfection- ism, in comparison, appears to be a more adaptive form of perfectionism (Enns & Cox, 2002). Whereas some studies found that self-oriented perfectionism showed positive correlations with indicators of psychological maladjustment such as general negative affect (e.g. Dunkley, Zuroff, & Blankstein, 2006; Kobori & Tanno, 2005), other studies found significant positive correlations with indicators of subjective well-being such as self-esteem and general posi- tive affect (e.g. Frost, Heimberg, Holt, Mattia, & Neubauer, 1993; Molnar, Reker, Culp, Sadava, & DeCourville, 2006; Trumpeter, Watson, & O’Leary, 2006). Moreover, in factor analyses of multidimensional perfectionism measures, self- oriented perfectionism always loaded on the factor represent- ing more adaptive forms of perfectionism whereas socially prescribed perfectionism always loaded on the factor represent- ing maladaptive forms (e.g. Bieling, Israeli, & Antony, 2004; Frost et al., 1993; see Stoeber & Otto, 2006, for a comprehen- sive review). Therefore, the differentiation between self- oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism is important when regarding relationships between perfectionism and how people feel about themselves. In particular, self-oriented per- fectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism can be expected to show different relationships with self-conscious emotions such as pride, shame, and embarrassment. Perfectionism and self-conscious emotions Self-conscious emotions are emotions that fundamentally involve an evaluation of the self (Tangney, 2002; Tangney & Dearing, 2002). Pride is a positive self-conscious emotion associated with feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction. Moreover, pride is associated with positive self-evaluations that contribute to a person’s self-esteem and subjective well- being. In contrast, shame and embarrassment are negative self-conscious emotions. Shame involves a painful negative scrutiny of the entire self and feelings of worthlessness, powerlessness, and incompetence. Embarrassment is closely related to shame. However, embarrassment is a less intense emotion felt in response to more minor errors and transgres- sions. Compared with shame, embarrassment is usually experienced as less serious and less deeply painful (Edelstein & Shaver, 2007; Tangney, 2002; Tangney & Dearing, 2002). A number of studies have investigated how self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism relate to proneness to experience pride and shame (e.g. Fee & Tangney, 2000; Hewitt & Flett, 1991; Klibert, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, & Saito, 2005; Lutwak & Ferrari, 1996; Tangney, 2002; see Stoeber et al., 2007 for a comprehensive review). Across these studies, only socially prescribed perfectionism consis- tently showed positive correlations with proneness to shame. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism showed positive correlations with proneness to shame only in some studies, but not in others. Moreover, Tangney (2002) found that only socially prescribed perfectionism showed a positive correla- tion with proneness to embarrassment, but not self-oriented perfectionism. None of these studies found that self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism showed significant negative correlations with proneness to pride, calling into question the notion that perfectionists are generally unable to experience pride (e.g. Hewitt & Flett, 1991; Sorotzkin, 1985). On the contrary, people high in self-oriented perfection- ism may experience more pride than people low in self- oriented perfectionism—but only if they achieve perfect results. The first evidence for this was found in a study that investigated how self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism predicted emotional reactions to success and failure (Stoeber et al., 2008). Students were presented with the task of finding errors in a series of cartoons. Half of the students were assigned to the success condition: They were told that each cartoon contained five errors, and all cartoons in the series did contain five errors. The other half of the students were assigned to the failure condition: They too were told that each cartoon contained five errors, but the last cartoon in the series contained only four errors. After the task, students completed measures of state pride and shame. Results showed that self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism showed positive correlations with shame after failure: Students with high levels of either form of perfectionism who failed to achieve a perfect result (finding all errors in all cartoons except the last one) experi- enced more shame than students with low levels of perfec- tionism who failed to achieve a perfect result. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism showed a positive correlation with pride after achieving a perfect result (finding all errors in all cartoons): Students high in self-oriented perfectionism experienced more pride than students low in self-oriented perfectionism. Cultural variations in self-conscious emotions It is important to note that there are cultural variations in how people experience self-conscious emotions. Because of cultural norms, people from some cultures display certain emotions more frequently than people from other cultures (Eid & Diener, 2001). Moreover, the self is viewed differ- ently depending on the predominant cultural norms, and this affects the experience and the evaluation of self-conscious emotions (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). In cultures in which individualism has a strong tradition, such as Western cultures (particularly European–American cultures), people tend to have an independent conception of the self: the self is construed in terms of the psychological qualities that are distinct from others. In cultures in which collectivism has a strong tradition, such as Asian cultures (particularly East-Asian cultures), people tend to have an interdependent conception of the self: the self is construed in terms of people’s roles within their family and social relationships. Consequently, people in traditionally collectivistic cultures tend to view themselves primarily in terms of their connections with others (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1995, 1997). The different views of the self have consequences for the evaluation of pride and shame. According to Markus and Kitayama (1991), shame is a negative but interpersonally en- gaged emotion. Shame is painful, but in highlighting 60 J. Stoeber et al. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per acceptance of the social norms, it makes people feel engaged with others. Consequently, shame is an emotion that is valued more positively and is more desirable and more openly displayed in collectivistic cultures than in individual- istic cultures (Kitayama &Markus, 2000; Kitayama, Markus, & Matsumoto, 1995; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Wong & Tsai, 2007). In contrast, pride is a positive but interpersonally disen- gaged emotion (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). Pride is enjoy- able, but in highlighting individual achievement, it makes people distinct from others. Pride often results from accom- plishing one’s goals or affirming some internal attributes (e.g. ‘I am special’), which reinforces the separateness of the self from others (Kitayama et al., 1995). Because pride is self-focusing and separates the individual from the group, it is often seen as inappropriate in collectivistic cultures compared with individualistic cultures. Consequently, pride is valued less positively, is less desirable, and is less openly displayed in collectivistic cultures (Eid & Diener, 2001). Pride is a truly positive emotion only in individualistic cultures. In collectivis- tic cultures, pride is an ambivalent emotion. This was illustrated by Scollon, Diener, Oishi, and Biswas-Diener (2005) who conducted a large-scale study using factor analysis to examine emotion frequency and intensity in samples from different cultures. They found two factors: a pleasant emotions factor and an unpleasant emotions factor. Whereas pride loaded on the pleasant emotions factor in the Western samples, it loaded on both factors—the pleasant emotions factor and the unpleas- ant emotions factor—in the Asian samples. The findings have consequences for research on perfection- ism and self-conscious emotions. If pride (because it is positive, but interpersonally disengaged) is regarded as an ambivalent emotion in collectivistic cultures compared with individualistic cultures, the experience of pride may be less positive in collectivistic cultures than in individualistic cultures. Consequently, pride may show cultural variations in how it is related to positive/adaptive versus negative/ maladaptive forms of perfectionism. In the same vein, if shame (because it is negative, but interpersonally engaged) is regarded as a less negative emotion in collectivistic cultures compared with individualistic cultures, shame may show cultural varia- tions in how it is related to the different forms of perfectionism. A number of studies have investigated cultural differ- ences in the experience of self-conscious emotions. Many of the studies focused on pride and shame, comparing students from the USA (a society with a traditionally individ- ualistic culture) with students from Japan (a society with a traditionally collectivistic culture). Across studies, Japanese students indicated less pride and more shame than US students (e.g. Bear, Uribe-Zarain, Manning, & Shiomi, 2009; Imahori & Cupach, 1994; Lewis, Takai-Kawakami, Kawakami, & Sullivan, 2010; Scollon, Diener, Oishi, & Biswas-Diener, 2004), corroborating the view that people in collectivistic cultures are less likely to feel and display pride and more likely to feel and display shame than people in individualistic cultures. In contrast, the case for embarrass- ment is less clear. A number of studies have examined embarrassability (the disposition to be easily embarrassed), comparing Asians and people from European descent and found that Asians report higher levels of embarrassability than Westerners of European descent (e.g. Singelis, Bond, Sharkey, & Kriss, 1999; Singelis & Sharkey, 1995). How- ever, when concrete experiences of embarrassment were examined, the findings were less clear as was demonstrated in two studies comparing Japanese and US students (Imahori & Cupach, 1994; Lewis et al., 2010). Whereas Lewis et al. (2010) found that Japanese students experienced embarrass- ment more often compared with US students, Imahori and Cupach (1994) found that US students experienced embar- rassment more often than Japanese students. The present study So far, only one study has investigated cultural differences in perfectionism, comparing US and Japanese students (Chang, Chang, & Sanna, 2012). The study examined performance perfectionism, which is a multidimensional conception of perfectionism regarding positive versus negative consequences for performance that can result from self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism (see Chang, 2006 for details). Japanese students showed lower levels of positive self-oriented performance perfectionism (self-oriented perfectionism that is perceived as having positive consequences for performance) and higher levels of negative socially prescribed performance perfectionism (socially prescribed perfectionism that is perceived as having negative consequences for performance) compared with US students. The findings indicate that Japanese students regarded self-oriented perfectionism as having fewer positive consequences and socially prescribed perfectionism as having more negative consequences, com- pared with US students. This suggests that self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism may have different conse- quences in people from traditionally collectivistic cultures compared with people from traditionally individualistic cultures. The question is if these consequences also include self-conscious emotions and reactions to success and failure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the rela- tionships between perfectionism and self-conscious emotions after success and failure, comparing people from a tradition- ally collectivistic culture (Japanese students) with people from a traditionally individualistic culture (White British students). Regarding perfectionism, we followed Hewitt and Flett’s (1991) model examining self-oriented perfection- ism and socially prescribed perfectionism. Regarding self- conscious emotions, we examined pride and embarrassment after success and failure using everyday scenarios describing perfect achievements (success) and flawed achievements (failure). The reason we examined embarrassment rather than shame was that cross-cultural semantic studies have indi- cated that—although shame and embarrassment are close neighbours in semantic space—the Japanese word for ashamed/embarrassed (hazukashii) is broader than the English term and appears to be semantically closer to the English word embarrassed than the English word ashamed (Rusch, 2004; also Crystal, Parrott, Okazaki, & Watanabe, 2001). Moreover, the failures presented in the everyday scenarios were rather minor. Therefore, embarrassment appeared to be the more appropriate emotion. Perfectionism, pride, and embarrassment 61 Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per From the literature and the previous findings reviewed in the introduction, we formulated a number of expectations. First, following the findings of Chang et al. (2012), we expected Japanese students to show lower self-oriented per- fectionism and higher socially prescribed perfectionism than British students. Second, following the literature on cross- cultural differences in the experience of pride (Eid & Diener, 2001; Kitayama et al., 1995; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Scollon et al., 2005), we expected Japanese students to show less pride than British students. Finally, following previous studies on perfectionism and pride and shame after success and failure (Stoeber et al., 2008), we expected self-oriented perfectionism to show positive relationships with pride after success (perfect achievements) and embarrassment after failure (flawed achievements). In contrast, we expected so- cially prescribed perfectionism to show positive relationships with embarrassment after success and failure. Regarding further differences, our study was more exploratory. In particular, because of the contradictory findings regarding the experience of embarrassment in Japanese versus US students (Imahori & Cupach, 1994; Lewis et al., 2010), we had no specific expectations regarding differences between Japanese and British students in the experience of embarrass- ment. Moreover, from the findings of Chang et al. (2012), we expected Japanese and British students to show differences in the relationships of perfectionism and self-conscious emotions as a consequence of success and failure. However, as the present study was the first to investigate cross-cultural differences in these relationships, we had no specific expec- tations regarding the direction of such differences. METHOD Participants Two samples of students were recruited, one at a British university and one at a Japanese university. Because Britain is a multicultural society (Home Office, 2007), we restricted our study toWhite students born and raised in the British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland, subsequently referred to as British students) and compared them with Japanese students born and raised in Japan (subsequently referred to as Japanese students) to make sure that we were comparing students from a traditionally individualistic culture (White British students born and raised in the British Isles) to students from a tradi- tionally collectivistic culture (Japanese students born and raised in Japan). At the British university, 366 students (111 men, 255 women; M age = 20.3 years, SD= 3.6) who indi- cated that they were White, born and raised in the UK or Ireland, and native English speakers were recruited. At the Japanese university, 357 students (252 men, 105 women; M age = 19.8, SD = 2.0) who indicated that they were Japanese, born and raised in Japan, and native Japanese speakers were recruited. With this, the total sample comprised 723 students (363 men, 360 women; M age = 20.1 years, SD = 2.9). The British students volunteered to participate in the study for extra course credit or a participant fee of £3 (approximately $5). The Japanese students volunteered without receiving any compensation. Measures Perfectionism To measure self-oriented and socially prescribed perfection- ism, we used the respective scales of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Hewitt & Flett, 1991, 2004). The Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale is a widely used, reliable, and valid instrument to measure self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism (Enns & Cox, 2002; Hewitt & Flett, 1991, 2004). It comprises 15 items capturing self- oriented perfectionism (e.g. ‘I demand nothing less than per- fection of myself’) and 15 items capturing socially prescribed perfectionism (e.g. ‘People expect nothing less than perfec- tion from me’) on a 7-point answer scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). British students completed the original version of the scales (Hewitt & Flett, 2004), which has demonstrated reliability and validity in numerous studies with British students (e.g. O’Connor & O’Connor, 2003; Stoeber, Feast, & Hayward, 2009; Stoeber & Stoeber, 2009). Japanese students completed the Japanese version of the scales (Ohtani & Sakurai, 1995), which has demonstrated comparable reliability and validity in studies with Japanese students (e.g. Kobori & Tanno, 2005; Kobori, Yamagata, & Kijima, 2005; Ohtani & Sakurai, 1995). With self-oriented perfectionism scores showing Cronbach’s alphas of .91 (British) and .89 (Japanese) and socially prescribed perfec- tionism scores showing alphas of .85 (British) and .80 (Japanese), all scores showed satisfactory internal consisten- cies (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Pride and embarrassment To measure pride and embarrassment after success and failure, we created 14 scenarios describing events in which the protagonist achieves either a perfect result or a flawed result. For example, the success version (perfect achieve- ment) of Scenario 1 read: ‘Birthday card. You are invited to a friend’s birthday and have bought a very nice and expen- sive birthday card to go with your present. You add a few personal lines to the birthday card in your very best hand- writing, and the card really looks perfect.’ In comparison, the failure version (flawed achievement) read: ‘Birthday card. You are invited to a friend’s birthday and have bought a very nice and expensive birthday card to go with your pres- ent. You add a few personal lines to the birthday card in your very best handwriting, but when you hand over the card you notice that you have misspelled your friend’s name.’ To ensure that all scenarios were relevant for students in both cultures, the scenarios were simultaneously developed in English and Japanese by the first and second authors using standard backtranslation procedures recommended by Brislin (1970, 1986). To cover a broad range of different situations that were relevant for British and Japanese students and so that these students could imagine themselves experiencing the situation, the scenarios comprised various personal and interpersonal situations ranging from private situations (where success/failure was evident only to the protagonist) to ambiva- lent situations (where it was unclear if success/failure was noted by others) to public situations (where success/failure was evident to the protagonist and others; see Appendix). 62 J. Stoeber et al. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per Because we wanted all participants to respond to perfect and flawed results, two versions of the scenarios were constructed. In Version 1, the even-numbered scenarios were presented with the perfect result, and the odd-numbered with the flawed result. In Version 2, it was the other way round. Participants were instructed to carefully read the description of each situation, imagine vividly that the situation was happening to them, and then indicate how much pride (Japanese: hokori) and embarrassment (Japanese: hazukashisa) they would feel if this situation happened to them on a 6-point answer scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). To obtain overall scores for pride and embarrassment, we computed average scores across the responses to the seven perfect scenarios and the seven flawed scenarios, respectively. With Cronbach’s alphas between .72 and .87, all scores showed satisfactory internal consistencies.2 Preliminary analyses Manipulation check First, we computed pairwise t-tests to examine whether the students reacted to the manipulation of the scenarios in the intended direction: that is, (i) higher pride after perfect achieve- ments compared with flawed achievements and (ii) higher embarrassment after flawed achievements compared with perfect achievements. This was confirmed: both differences were in the intended direction and were significant (Table 1). Transformations Next, we inspected the distribution of the scores. As expected, embarrassment after perfect achievements and pride after flawed achievements showed L-shaped distribu- tions. Most participants responded with a score of 0 (not at all) when asked how much embarrassment they would feel after achieving a perfect result and how much pride they would feel after a flawed result. Consequently, following recommendations by Tabachnick and Fidell (2007), we transformed these scores using the formula for L-shaped dis- tributions with zero (in SPSS syntax): NEWX=1 / (X 1). Outliers Because outliers can severely distort the results of correlation and regression analyses, we inspected the data for univariate and multivariate outliers (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Three participants showed z values larger than the critical value of z= 3.29, p< .001, indicating that they were univariate out- liers. A further five participants showed a Mahalanobis dis- tance larger than the critical value of w²(9) = 27.88, p< .001, indicating that they were multivariate outliers. The eight participants were excluded from further analyses. With this, our final sample comprised N = 715 (363 British, 352 Japanese) students. Analytic strategy Correlations When bivariate correlations between the variables were com- puted (Table 2, correlations below the diagonal), gender and version showed significant correlations with culture (British, Japanese). The reason for this was that the Japanese sample (70% men, 30% women) comprised a significantly higher percentage of men than the British sample (30% men, 70% women). Furthermore, because of a clerical error, more stu- dents in the Japanese sample received Version 2 of the sce- narios (61%) than Version 1 (41%), whereas both versions were equally distributed in the British sample (Version 1: 50%; Version 2: 50%). Consequently, we computed partial correlations controlling for gender and version (Table 2, cor- relations above the diagonal) to control for these effects and focused on these correlations in the results section. Regression analyses To examine differences between British and Japanese stu- dents in how the two forms of perfectionism predicted pride and embarrassment, we computed moderated regression analyses using effect coding for culture, gender, and version as recommended for designs with no explicit control group (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003; also Frazier, Tix, & Barron, 2004). The regression analyses comprised three steps. In Step 1, we entered gender (coded 1 =male, 1 = fe- male) and version (coded 1 =Version 1, 1 =Version 2) to control for the effects of gender and version. In Step 2, we entered culture (coded 1 =British, 1 = Japanese), self- oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism. Finally, in Step 3, we entered the interactions of culture self- oriented perfectionism and culture socially prescribed perfectionism to examine whether perfectionism showed different relationships with pride and embarrassment in Japanese compared with British students. RESULTS Correlations Regarding the partial correlations controlling for gender and version (Table 2, correlations above the diagonal), we first examined the correlations involving culture. As expected, Japanese students showed lower self-oriented perfectionism 2In addition, we analysed the responses to the individual scenarios by means of principal components analysis to examine the dimensionality of the mea- sures. For all four measures—pride after success, pride after failure, embar- rassment after success, and embarrassment after failure—inspection of the eigenvalues from the principal components analysis using scree test and par- allel analysis (Zwick & Velicer, 1986) indicated only one significant compo- nent, suggesting that each measures was unidimensional.

In addition, Japanese students showed less pride after perfect achievements (pr=.33) and after flawed achievements (pr= .13). Moreover, they showed more embarrassment after perfect achievements (pr= .10; see Table 2 for the associated significances and Table 3 for the estimated means and standard errors corresponding to these correlations). Next, we examined the correlations between perfection- ism, pride, and embarrassment. As expected, self-oriented perfectionism showed a positive correlation with pride after perfect achievements (pr= .27) and with embarrassment after flawed achievements (pr = .29): Students high in self- oriented perfectionism imagined experiencing more pride after perfect achievements and more embarrassment after flawed achievements compared with students low in self- oriented perfectionism. Furthermore as was expected, so- cially prescribed perfectionism showed a positive correlation with embarrassment after perfect achievements (pr= .17) and after flawed achievements (pr = .30): Students high in so- cially prescribed perfectionism imagined experiencing more embarrassment compared with students low in socially pre- scribed perfectionism regardless of whether they achieved perfection (success) or failed to achieve perfection (failure). Unexpectedly, socially prescribed perfectionism also showed a positive correlation with pride after perfect achievements (pr= .15). As this finding runs contrary to previous findings on socially prescribed perfectionism and pride (Stoeber et al., 2008), we turned to the regression analyses to examine whether differences between Japanese and British students were responsible for this unexpected finding. Regression analyses The results of the regression analyses confirmed that this was the case. The regression analyses showed a significant interaction of culture and socially prescribed perfectionism on pride after perfect achievements (Table 4, Step 3, pride, perfect achievements), indicating cultural variations in the relationships between socially prescribed perfectionism and pride after success. To investigate the nature of this interac- tion, regression graphs for values of 1 SD above and below the mean of socially prescribed perfectionism were plotted separately for Japanese and British students with the slopes tested for significance (Cohen et al., 2003; Frazier et al., 2004). Results showed that socially prescribed perfectionism was positively associated with pride only in Japanese students (b = 0.23, SE= 0.07, b = .19, p< .001, semipartial correlation [sr] = .11), but not in British students (b= 0.00, SE= 0.06, b = .00, p = .946, sr= .00). Differing from British students, Japanese students with higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism reported more pride than Japanese students with lower levels of socially prescribed perfection- ism when achievements were perfect (Figure 1).

Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per In addition, culture showed a significant interaction with self-oriented perfectionism on pride after flawed achieve- ments (Table 4, Step 3, pride, flawed achievements). Again, regression graphs were plotted to investigate the nature of this interaction. Self-oriented perfectionism was negatively asso- ciated with pride in Japanese students (b=0.04, SE= 0.02, b = .16, p< .05, sr=.09), but not in British students (b= 0.00, SE = 0.01, b = .01, p = .802, sr= .01). Differing from British students, Japanese students with higher levels of self-oriented perfectionism reported less pride than Japanese students with lower levels of self-oriented perfec- tionism when achievements were flawed (Figure 2). Else, the results of the regression analyses confirmed the findings from the partial correlations corroborating that the two forms of perfectionism showed differential patterns with pride and embarrassment (cf. Tables 1 and 4). In line with previous findings (Stoeber et al., 2008), self-oriented perfec- tionism was positively associated with pride after perfect achievements. In contrast, socially prescribed perfectionism was positively associated with embarrassment after perfect achievements. Moreover, both forms of perfectionism were positively associated with embarrassment after flawed achievements. The regression analyses, however, failed to confirm the cultural differences in embarrassment we found in the partial correlations. Instead, British and Japanese students showed comparable levels of embarrassment after success and failure. Moreover, they showed comparable relationships be- tween perfectionism and embarrassment. Although there was a significant positive partial correlation between culture and embarrassment after perfect achievements, suggesting that Japanese students experienced more embarrassment after Table 4.

Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per success than British students (Table 2), this correlation be- came nonsignificant once perfectionism was controlled for (Table 4, Step 2, embarrassment, perfect achievements). This pattern indicated the presence of a mediation effect (Baron & Kenny, 1986), suggesting that Japanese students’ higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism were responsible for their higher embarrassment after achieving perfect results. To test whether this was the case, we conducted a mediation analyses following the procedures provided by Preacher and Hayes (2004) with culture as the independent variable, socially prescribed perfectionism as the mediator, and embarrassment after perfect achievements as the depen- dent variable (using residual scores controlling for gender and version).3 The Sobel test of the mediation effect was significant with z= 2.28, p< .05, and the 95% confidence interval from the bootstrap test of the indirect effect did not include 0 (see Preacher & Hayes, 2004 for details). Socially prescribed perfectionism fully mediated the relationship between culture and embarrassment after success (Figure 3). DISCUSSION The present study investigated the relationships between perfectionism and self-conscious emotions, comparing people from a traditionally collectivistic culture (Japanese students) with people from a traditionally individualistic culture (White British students). Regarding perfectionism, we examined self- oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism. Regarding self-conscious emotions, we examined pride and embarrassment after success (perfect achievements) and failure (flawed achievements) using everyday scenarios the students imagined experiencing. We found evidence for cross-cultural consistency and cross-cultural variability. Regarding cross- cultural consistency, self-oriented perfectionism showed positive relationships with pride after success and embarrass- ment after failure in both Japanese and British students. In contrast, socially prescribed perfectionism showed positive relationships with embarrassment after success and failure. Regarding cross-cultural variability, Japanese students showed lower levels of self-oriented perfectionism and higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism compared with British students. Furthermore, Japanese students reported lower levels of pride after success and failure. They also reported more embarrassment after success. However, as a mediation analysis showed, the latter effect was fully explained by Japanese students’ higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. The present study also found evidence for cross-cultural variability in the relationships between perfectionism and self-conscious emotions. First, socially prescribed perfec- tionism was positively associated with pride after success in Japanese students, but not in British students. Differing from British students, Japanese students high in socially prescribed perfectionism imagined feeling more pride after success compared with Japanese students low in socially prescribed perfection. Second, self-oriented perfectionism was negatively associated with pride after failure in Japanese students, but not in British students. Differing from British students, Japanese students high in self-oriented perfection- ism imagined feeling less pride after failure compared with Japanese students low in self-oriented perfectionism. The relationships between perfectionism and pride that the Japanese students showed are noteworthy because they appear to contradict previous theory and research on perfec- tionism and self-conscious emotions (e.g. Fedewa et al., 2005; Stoeber et al., 2007, 2008) according to which mal- adaptive forms of perfectionism (such as socially prescribed perfectionism) are expected to show positive correlations with negative emotions. Therefore, socially prescribed perfectionism should not be positively associated with pride. In contrast, a more adaptive form of perfectionism (such as self-oriented perfectionism) is expected to show positive correlations with positive emotions. Therefore, self-oriented perfectionism should not be negatively associated with pride. However, note that pride is a positive emotion only in Western cultures where we can expect self-oriented perfec- tionism, but not socially prescribed perfectionism, to be positively associated with pride.

Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per an ambivalent, that is, partly negative emotion (Scollon et al., 2005). Moreover, pride is an interpersonally disengaged emotion, making people stand out from their group, which is a negative quality in collectivistic cultures (Kitayama et al., 1995; Markus & Kitayama, 1991). People from Asian cultures regard pride as more undesirable and inappropriate compared with people from Western cultures (Eid & Diener, 2001). Consequently, when taking into account the different evaluations of pride in Western and Asian cultures, the pres- ent findings with the Japanese students do not necessarily contradict expectations from theory and research that con- sider socially prescribed perfectionism a maladaptive form of perfectionism and self-oriented perfectionism as a more adaptive form (Enns & Cox, 2002; Frost et al., 1993; Stoeber & Otto, 2006). On the contrary, they may be in line with these expectations. Self-oriented perfectionism, as a more adaptive form of perfectionism, should be associated with more adaptive emotional responses. Reduced pride after fail- ure can be considered adaptive for Japanese students. If so, Japanese students high in self-oriented perfectionism showed a more adaptive emotional response (i.e. reduced pride) after failure compared with Japanese students high in self-oriented perfectionism. In contrast, socially prescribed perfectionism should be associated with more maladaptive emotional responses. Increased pride after success can be considered maladaptive for Japanese students, particularly for Japanese students high in socially prescribed perfectionism who are concerned about others’ expectations. If so, Japanese stu- dents high in socially prescribed perfectionism showed a more maladaptive emotional response (i.e. increased pride) after success. The present study is the first to find cultural differences in the relationships between perfectionism and self-conscious emotions. Consequently, our interpretation of the perfection- ism–pride relationships we found in the Japanese students is rather speculative. Other interpretations are possible. For example, because many scenarios contained a social element, Japanese students high in socially prescribed perfectionism may have felt more pride than Japanese students low in so- cially prescribed perfectionism because they perceived they fulfilled others’ high expectations of them. Still, pride is an ambivalent emotion in Asian cultures, often regarded as undesirable and inappropriate because it sets the self apart from others and is interpersonally disengaged. Therefore, it can be argued that—even though Japanese students high in socially prescribed perfectionism were right to feel more pride from a Western perspective—from an Asian perspec- tive, increased pride would not be experienced as positive, but rather as ambivalent or even negative. However, many of the everyday scenarios we used were unclear as to whether they represented public situations (where the protagonist felt that others were aware of what was happening) or private situations (where this was not the case). This may also explain why we did not find any cross-cultural differences in embar- rassment. Comparing feelings of shame in public and private situations in Japanese and US students, Crystal et al. (2001) found that Japanese students felt more shame than US students only in public situations. In private situations, US students felt more shame. Consequently, future studies using scenarios to elicit emotions should use scenarios that are clear as to whether the situation is private or public. The present study has further limitations. First, the interaction effects indicating cross-cultural differences in the relationships of perfectionism and pride were compara- tively small. However, note that effect sizes of interaction effects are generally smaller than main effects because they represent second-order effects over and above the main effects (e.g. Frazier et al., 2004). Still, future studies need to replicate the present findings before firmer conclusions about cross-cultural differences in the perfectionism–pride relationships can be drawn. Second, we examined only achievement-oriented pride. Research on self-conscious emo- tions, however, differentiates between two forms of pride: achievement-oriented (or authentic) pride and hubristic pride (Tracy & Robins, 2007a, 2007b). Consequently, future studies may profit from investigating if the present findings also apply to hubristic pride. Third, the emotional reactions we examined were imagined emotional reactions to scenarios describing hy- pothetical situations. Although eliciting affective responses to scenarios is an established method in cross-cultural research on self-conscious affect (e.g. Crystal et al., 2001; Tang, Wang, Qian, Gao, & Zhang, 2008) and has been demonstrated to be a valid method of indicating affective responses in real life, showing convergence of real and imagined reactions to emo- tional stimuli (Robinson & Clore, 2001), future studies need to show that the present findings can be replicated when affective reactions to real-life experiences of achieving perfect versus flawed results are examined. Finally, the present study only included White students born and raised in the British Isles. Consequently, the findings’ generalizability may be limited to students from this specific ethnic background. Future studies may consider additionally including British students with a different ethnic background to examine if the present findings generalize to non-White British students. In particu- lar, it would be interesting to include British students of Asian origin, born and raised in the British Isles, to examine acculturation effects in the relationships of perfectionism, pride, and embarrassment. Despite these limitations, the present study makes a sig- nificant contribution to our understanding of perfectionism Socially prescribed perfectionism Culture (-1 = British, 1 = Japanese) Embarrassment after perfect achievements .11** .17*** .07 (.09*) Figure 3.

Perfectionism, pride, and embarrassment 67 Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Pers. 27: 59–70 (2013) DOI: 10.1002/per and self-conscious emotions. First, the study provides further evidence that, although perfectionism is often associated with shame and embarrassment, perfectionists are able to ex- perience pride (Fedewa et al., 2005; Stoeber et al., 2007, 2008). Furthermore, some perfectionists may experience more pride than nonperfectionists—particularly when they achieve perfect results (Stoeber et al., 2008). Second, the present findings provide further evidence for cross-cultural differences in the experience of pride, comparing people from Western with people from Asian cultures (e.g. Eid & Diener, 2001; Kitayama et al., 1995; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Scollon et al., 2005). In addition, the findings of lower self-oriented and higher socially prescribed perfectionism in Japanese students compared with British students expands on previous findings of differences in performance perfec- tionism comparing Japanese and US students (Chang et al., 2012). Finally, and most importantly, the study provides first evidence that the relationships between perfectionism and pride may show cultural variations. Whereas the study cor- roborated previous findings that self-oriented perfectionism was positively associated with pride after success, it showed that socially prescribed perfectionism too may be positively associated with pride after success, but only in people from cultural contexts where pride is an ambivalent and often in- appropriate and undesirable emotion. With this, the study encourages perfectionism researchers to pay closer attention to possible cultural variations in the relationships that differ- ent forms of perfectionism show in different cultures and to variations in the meaning that these relationships may have in different cultural contexts.

Birthday card. You are invited to a friend’s birthday and have bought a very nice and expensive birthday card to go with your present. You add a few personal lines to the birthday card in your very best handwriting, [Perfect] and the card really looks perfect/[Flawed] but when you hand over the card you notice that you have misspelled your friend’s name. 2. Project report. You are supposed to hand in a project report that you have written the day before, and now you only have to check for any spelling errors. So you go over the report several times checking for any errors. When you hand in the report, [Perfect] it looks perfect/ [Flawed] you notice that there is a typo on the title page. 3. Cleaning glasses. You have a part-time job at an expen- sive restaurant. For a banquet of important guests, you have to polish the wine glasses. After the guests arrive and sit down at the table, [Perfect] you look around, and all glasses are crystal clear with perfect shine/ [Flawed] you notice that one of the glasses shows some fingerprints. 4. Deadline. You have an important deadline to meet, so you carefully plan when you are going to work on every- thing and get it in on time. Everything goes according to plan, [Perfect] and you hand in your piece of work without any rush/[Flawed] but then you notice that the deadline is one day earlier than you had realized, so you have to press hard to get your piece of work handed in on time. 5. Weekend picnic. You are planning a weekend excur- sion with friends including a picnic. When you arrive at the picnic area and set up the goods, [Perfect] every- thing is there—just as planned/[Flawed] you realize that you forgot to bring the plates for everybody as you were supposed to. 6. Take your pills. You fall ill with a bad infection. The doctor prescribes you some pills that you need to take three times a day for a whole week: one in the morning, one at noon, and one before you go to bed. It is impor- tant to follow this schedule for the medicine to have any effect, so you follow this schedule meticulously [Perfect] and never forget to take a pill in time during the whole week/[Flawed] but on the third day, you real- ize that you forgot to take a pill the previous day before you went to bed. 7. Holiday trip. You are preparing for a holiday trip abroad and have made a list of all items that you want to take. When packing your suitcase, you check and double-check the list and the contents that you have packed. [Perfect] During your trip, you find that nothing is missing: everything you wanted to pack is there/ [Flawed] But during your trip, you realize that you for- got to pack your address book with all the addresses of friends and family whom you promised to send a card to, even though it was on your list. 8. Movie night. You and your friends are planning a movie night at home watching a movie together that all of you like a lot. Because it is an older movie that you could not find at the usual DVD rental, you mail-or- dered it. The DVD arrives in the mail in plenty of time, [Perfect] so when you meet at your friends house, you put in the DVD and it is a perfect home movie night for everybody/[Flawed] but when you meet at your friends house, you open the DVD case and realize that you took the wrong DVD case and left the DVD you mail-ordered at home. 9. Returning a book. You borrow a book from a friend who really does not like lending people her things and you promise you will definitely get it back to her by the end of the week. You finish the book during the week [Perfect] and as promised return the book by the end of the week/[Flawed] but forget to return the book by the end of the week and instead return it one day late. 10. Organizing a dinner. You are asked to organize a dinner for the members of a university society that you belong to in a restaurant in town. As the place is very popular, you phone a week in advance to make a reser- vation and again the day before the dinner to make sure everything is alright. When you and the other members arrive at the set time, [Perfect] the seating hostess leads you immediately to your table and everything is perfect/ [Flawed] the seating hostess tells you that you have to wait for 1 h as you accidentally booked the table for 1 h later than you thought you did. 11. Spending. You are short on money, so you plan a care- ful budget so that you will have enough for the month until your next pay day. You stick to your budget, [Per- fect] and at the end of the month you have spent no more than you intended and are exactly within your budget/ [Flawed] but at the end of the month, you realize that you miscalculated your budget and are a small sum of money short. 12. List of tasks. You work part time in a shop. The man- ager has left you in charge for the afternoon and given you a list of tasks to complete. The afternoon goes with- out a hitch [Perfect] and you manage to get everything done perfectly/[Flawed] and you think that you managed to get everything done perfectly but realize later that you have forgotten to make an important phone call, which was one of your tasks. 13. Grandmother’s 10 pills. While your parents are away, you have taken over the task of caring for your grand- mother who has been very ill for a long time. Your grandmother has to take 10 different pills every day according to a certain schedule. You observe the sched- ule meticulously [Perfect] and you give your grand- mother each and every pill every day exactly as prescribed/[Flawed] but on one day you mix up one of the evening pills with one of the morning pills. 14. Revision. You have an exam and spend much time re- vising a selection of topics that you expect to come up in the paper. When you sit the exam, [Perfect] all the topics you expected come up and so you are perfectly prepared/[Flawed] one topic comes up that you did not revise even though you now remember that it was some- thing you should have expected. 70 J.
