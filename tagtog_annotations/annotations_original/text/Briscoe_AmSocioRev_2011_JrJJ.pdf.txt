The Initial Assignment Effect: Local Employer Practices and Positive Career Outcomes for Work-Family Program Users Forrest Briscoea and Katherine C. Kelloggb Abstract One of the great paradoxes of inequality in organizations is that even when organizations introduce new programs designed to help employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed, employees who use these programs often suffer negative career consequences. This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature by investigating how local employer practices can enable employees to successfully use the programs designed to benefit them. Using a research approach that controls for regulatory environment and program design, we analyze unique longitudinal personnel data from a large law firm to demonstrate that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes for individuals who later use a reduced-hours program. Additionally, we find that initial assign- ment to powerful supervisors is more important to positive career outcomes—that is, employee retention and performance-based pay—than are factors such as supervisor assign- ment at the time of program use. Initial assignment affects career outcomes for later program users through the mechanism of improved access to reputation-building work opportunities. These findings have implications for research on work-family programs and other employee- rights programs and for the role of social capital in careers. Keywords organizations, equal opportunity, social capital, law, work-family, work hours Across many professions, employers are modifying traditional career and promotion systems by implementing work-family pro- grams. Reduced hours with prorated pay are now widely available to employees who have family responsibilities. Virtually all (98 percent) large and medium-sized U.S. law firms have adopted such programs (National Association of Law Placement 2007). Reduced-hours programs are catching on in academia, too. State systems (notably California) are moving toward longer tenure clocks and part-time status for faculty (Mason et al. 2005). Introduction of these programs is driven by organizations’ need for legitimacy (Kelly and Dobbin 1999) and by their attempts to address the formidable challenges of attracting and retaining women aThe Pennsylvania State University bMassachusetts Institute of Technology Corresponding Author: Forrest Briscoe, Smeal College of Business, The Pennsylvania State University, 450 Business Building, University Park, PA 16802 E-mail: fbriscoe@psu.edu American Sociological Review 76(2) 291–319  American Sociological Association 2011 DOI: 10.1177/0003122411401250 http://asr.sagepub.com (Gorman 1999). However, employees often choose not to use work-family programs because they suspect such programs actually hinder rather than advance their careers (Bai- lyn [1993] 2006; Blair-Loy and Wharton 2002, 2004). At leading law firms, for instance, employees state that reduced-hours programs are perceived as ‘‘mommy track’’ options, and they are concerned their superiors will think them uncommitted or even incom- petent if they take advantage of the programs. These employees are right to be concerned. Although programs designed to assist tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups do sometimes help vulnerable employees succeed (Kalev and Dobbin 2006; Kalev, Dobbin, and Kelly 2006), across sectors, employees who use these programs are at risk of fewer promotions (Kalleberg and Reskin 1995), lower wages (Kalleberg 1996), and lower wage growth (Glass 2004) than other employees. To our knowledge, no prior studies have identified employer practices associated with positive career outcomes for work-family pro- gram users. This is due, in part, to the diffi- culty of obtaining longitudinal data tracking how employees fare over time when they use the programs (Kelly et al. 2009). Our unique, time-varying career data allow us to follow a sample of employees over a number of years to determine the impact of exposure to particular employer practices on the career outcomes of program users and non-users. While the current literature on work- family programs gives us little sense of the levers that might be used to mitigate negative career outcomes for program users, two related bodies of research contribute to our understanding of this issue. The first explains the conditions under which employees are likely to use work-family programs (but not the conditions under which they can success- fully use them). This research suggests that the support of proximate supervisors is criti- cal to employees’ use of work-family pro- grams (Blair-Loy and Wharton 2002). The second body of research explains conditions that lead to effective implementation of such programs for the organization overall (but not the conditions that mitigate negative career outcomes for individual program users). This research suggests that a support- ive regulatory environment and particular program designs are critical to these programs’ organization-level effectiveness (Kalev and Dobbin 2006; Kalev et al. 2006). Both bodies of research point to the importance of protecting employees from negative evaluation at the time of program use. In contrast, we propose that such protec- tion can begin much earlier. Without denying that conditions at the time of program use can protect career outcomes, we suggest that conditions at the time of employees’ entry into an organization can be no less decisive and can exert an enduring influence on how their careers evolve (Sørensen 2004). In particular, we expect employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups who are assigned to powerful supervisors when they enter the organization—and who later become program users—will have better career outcomes than similar later users who are not initially assigned to powerful supervisors. There are three possible reasons for this. First, early exposure to powerful supervisors can provide later program users with better skill development and relevant knowledge (Cross and Cummings 2004). Second, such exposure can allow for dissem- ination of positive opinions about employees for use in performance evaluation (Lin 2001). Third, such exposure can provide employees with access to subsequent reputation-building project assignments, because powerful supervisors may have con- nections to other powerful supervisors and influence others involved in the assignment process (Epstein 1981). In these three ways, initial assignment to powerful supervisors can protect future users of work-family pro- grams from supervisors’ potential negative evaluations at the time of program use. In this article, we analyze unique longitudi- nal data on associates from a large U.S. law firm to test whether assignment to powerful 292 American Sociological Review 76(2) supervisors upon entry has a positive effect on the career outcomes of later users of a work- family program that allows employees to work reduced hours for reduced pay while remaining on the track to partnership. We also assess which of the three postulated mechanisms can best explain this effect. We control for regulatory environment, program design, selection into program use, power of proximate supervisors at the time of program use, and co-worker relationships at time of program use. We demonstrate that initial assignment to powerful supervisors predicts positive career outcomes among later program users, and we find that access to reputation- building projects underlies this effect. Our findings contribute to the work-family and social capital literatures and build on key ideas from the literature on inequality remedi- ation in organizations. Many organizations have adopted work-family programs and other equal opportunity initiatives such as disability, sexual harassment, diversity, and dispute reso- lution programs designed to promote equal treatment for women, minorities, and employ- ees with disabilities (Dobbin 2009; Dobbin et al. 1988; Dobbin and Sutton 1998; Edelman 1990; Kalev et al. 2006). While such pro- grams are designed to help traditionally disad- vantaged employees, the employees whom these programs are intended to benefit often choose not to use them because they are con- cerned about potential negative career conse- quences. We end the article by discussing the implications of the practice of initial assignment for enabling successful career out- comes for users of work-family and other employee-rights programs. WORK-FAMILY PROGRAM USERS Overall Negative Career Outcomes for Work-Family Program Users In response to changing labor force and fam- ily demographics, many organizations have adopted work-family programs to improve employee recruitment, commitment, and retention and to comply with coercive or nor- mative institutional pressure (Davis and Kalleberg 2006; Glass and Fujimoto 1995; Kelly and Dobbin 1999; Osterman 1995). Employees, however, often choose not to use these programs because they fear retaliation (Bailyn [1993] 2006; Blair-Loy and Wharton 2002, 2004; Eaton 2003; Hochschild 1997; Perlow 1997; Williams 2000). In fact, research has found that using such programs is associ- ated with negative career outcomes. Users of reduced-hours programs, for example, suffer from fewer promotions (Dau-Schmidt et al. 2009; Kalleberg and Reskin 1995), lower wages (Kalleberg 1996), and lower wage growth (Glass 2004). Similarly, users of Fam- ily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) programs suffer from future lower wages (Jacobsen and Levin 1995), fewer promotions (Hagan and Kay 1995; Judiesch and Lyness 1999), and less retention (Lyness and Judiesch 2001). The literature suggests that employees who use these programs are evaluated nega- tively. Indeed, these employees are doubly vulnerable. Even before they become pro- gram users, women, mothers, and male pri- mary caregivers are often rated as less com- petent (Biernat and Kobrynowicz 1997), seen as less capable of assuming positions of authority (Ridgeway 2001), and awarded lower wages (Correll, Benard, and Paik 2007) than other employees. This is true even after controlling for factors related to skill and productivity (Anderson, Binder, and Krause 2003; Budig and England 2001). Once these employees begin to use work-family programs, they may suffer even further; by simply using the programs, they highlight their membership in tradition- ally disadvantaged groups. This may invite supervisors to question the employees’ commitment, abilities, and marketability (Albiston 2007; Blair-Loy 2003; Epstein et al. 1999; Ridgeway and Correll 2004). Despite documented negative outcomes, these kinds of programs do sometimes help Briscoe and Kellogg 293 individuals in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed (Kalev and Dobbin 2006; Kalev et al. 2006). This variation in career outcomes raises the question: under what conditions can employees in traditionally dis- advantaged groups successfully use the work-family programs that have been estab- lished for their benefit? Traditional Approach: Conditions at the Time of Program Use Two bodies of research shed light on this issue. The first explains the conditions under which employees are likely to use such pro- grams. ‘‘Good’’ employees—no matter how that ‘‘goodness’’ is achieved—report having greater latitude when it comes to doing things outside the norm, like using reduced-hours programs (Kelly and Kalev 2006; Kelly and Moen 2007). Furthermore, proximate super- visors at the time of decisions about program use play an important role in whether employees use work-family programs (Briscoe 2006; Hochschild 1997; Kelly and Kalev 2006; Perlow 1998). Employees are more likely to use these programs if they work with powerful proximate supervisors who may buffer them from possible negative career outcomes (Blair-Loy and Wharton 2002). The second body of research explains con- ditions that lead to effective organizational implementation of employee-rights programs that are designed to assist traditionally disad- vantaged groups. A supportive regulatory environment is critical to the effectiveness of these programs because it creates disin- centives for organizations to discriminate (Kalev and Dobbin 2006; Skaggs 2008). In addition, particular program designs facili- tate programs’ effectiveness in law firms by requiring relatively low billable hours (Gor- man 2006) or allowing longer partnership tracks (Chambliss 1997). In other kinds of organizations, program designs facilitate effectiveness by assigning accountability for diversity outcomes (Kalev et al. 2006), increasing employees’ schedule control (Kelly and Moen 2007), or combining the evaluation step of performance review with the payment step (Castilla 2008). Program User Vulnerability to Negative Evaluation Both bodies of research suggest that career outcomes may be affected by the degree to which employees are protected from poten- tial negative evaluation at the time they use work-family programs. Indeed, research shows that employees who use these pro- grams are vulnerable to negative evaluation of their commitment, abilities, and market- ability to clients (Kellogg 2009). Supervisors may question the commitment of employees using reduced-hours programs, for example, by penalizing them for not acting like ‘‘ideal workers’’ who are willing to work long hours because they have no responsibilities outside of work (Acker 1990; Kanter 1977). Research also shows that supervisors ques- tion the abilities of employees who choose to use similar kinds of employee-rights pro- grams; some supervisors believe that women and minorities who use affirmative action and diversity programs achieved their posi- tions on the basis of reverse discrimination (Heilman, Block, and Stathatos 1997) or that employees who use disability programs are incompetent (Harlan and Robert 1998). Finally, supervisors may question whether such employees, especially those who use reduced-hours or FMLA programs, are mar- ketable to clients or customers; supervisors may worry that employees will not be avail- able when a client wants them (Epstein 1992; Epstein et al. 1999) or that they will not develop productive, in-depth relationships with key clients (Thornton and Bagust 2007). Supervisors who question employees’ commitment, abilities, and marketability can damage careers because they have the power to award wages and promotions, 294 American Sociological Review 76(2) provide access to workplace opportunities, fire at will, and invoke formal organizational programs to discriminate against particular groups (Bisom-Rapp 1999; Mong and Roscigno 2009; Roscigno 2007). Finding factors that protect program users from nega- tive evaluation based on program use is therefore critical. The Initial Assignment Effect: Conditions at the Time of Entry These traditional approaches highlight how conditions at the time of employee program use shape career outcomes, but we propose that the seeds of success may be planted much earlier. Evidence connects success later in one’s career with conditions in the early years of one’s organizational tenure (DiPrete and Eirich 2006; Sørensen 2004). Furthermore, research shows that individu- als’ advancement and success in organiza- tions depend on their access to powerful supervisors or mentors (Thomas and Kram 1988) who can provide positive social capital (Burt 2000). Powerful initial supervisors could protect program users from negative evaluations in three ways: by training them in superior skills, by disseminating positive opinions about them for use in performance evaluations, and by giving others in the orga- nization reasons to extend reputation- building work opportunities to the employees (i.e., because the supervisors’ own powerful resources are visibly associated with those employees). Regarding provision of superior skills, a primary route for employees to accumulate human capital is through on-the-job training (Doeringer and Piore 1971). In our research setting, most employees arrive from law school without any relevant work experience; hence, their first exposure to the practical aspects of work in their profession may be especially formative. Galanter and Palay (1991) argue that associates advance in law firms based on the lawyering skills they gain as they work on projects assigned to them by supervisors. In general, lawyers are more receptive to learning from supervisors early in their careers (Katz 1980), and initial supervisors strongly influence career sociali- zation to work routines and practices (Burton and Beckman 2007; Van Maanen and Schein 1979). Because employees with greater expo- sure to powerful supervisors may gain access to better learning opportunities, these employees may develop superior skills that can protect them from negative evaluation once they become program users. Regarding dissemination of positive opin- ions, supervisors who are positioned more centrally in the network structure of relation- ships at a workplace likely control more resources in the organization (Brass and Burkhardt 1993) and therefore have greater influence and control over information (Burt 1992). In the social capital literature, the most commonly cited benefit of a rela- tionship is the transfer of more and better information (Lin 2001). Powerful supervisors can effectively disseminate opinions and contribute to performance evaluations and promotion decisions for employees in whom they develop an interest. This can counteract negative evaluations of employ- ees’ commitment, abilities, or marketability once they become program users. Regarding the provision of access to reputation-building work opportunities, pow- erful supervisors who have ties to others who control valuable projects can generate oppor- tunities for their subordinates. In social capi- tal terms, these supervisors can lend their social capital to subordinates to facilitate their access to reputation-building projects (Burt 2000). For associate lawyers, the port- folio of projects they build up over time becomes a visible track record by which they are evaluated as potential partners (Beckman and Phillips 2005; Epstein et al. 1999). The quality of projects is thus a crucial factor for employees as they accrue the repu- tation and relationships that make them attractive candidates for senior positions in Briscoe and Kellogg 295 an organization. For members of traditionally disadvantaged groups in particular, research shows that projects that provide opportunities for exposure can reduce career disadvantage (Kalev 2009). While such career advantages may benefit all employees who are initially exposed to powerful supervisors, the process we theorize is not simply a case of the generalized rule that ‘‘the rich get richer’’—that is, early experiences set the stage for later career advances for all employees. Instead, we argue, program use leads employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups to signal their membership in these groups and to become vulnerable to negative evaluation. Thus, we expect that although later program users and non-users will both benefit from early assignment to powerful supervisors (the rich will get richer in all cases), employees who become program users will benefit more from this early assignment (because they are at risk of negative evaluation) than will those who do not become users. Provision of superior skills and dissemination of posi- tive opinions can help these employees coun- teract negative evaluations, and access to reputation-building projects can ensure that a wide range of powerful supervisors and cli- ents have had direct experience with their commitment, abilities, and marketability by the time they become program users. Finally, it is important to rule out a com- peting explanation for the relationship between initial assignment and career out- comes. If initial assignment is not random, then powerful supervisors could select supe- rior protégés from the start. This could explain positive career outcomes for program users who were initially assigned to powerful supervisors. However, our data suggest that such sorting is not the mechanism by which initial assignment affects career outcomes at this firm. We find that initial assignment is not correlated with observable characteristics in any way that could be consistent with sort- ing. We will address this competing explana- tion below. METHOD Research Site and Reduced-Hours Program Our unique longitudinal data come from a full-service law firm with offices in several U.S. cities. The firm has a long history and an established reputation with clients in a range of industries. Near the end of our study period, the firm employed approxi- mately 1,000 attorneys and reported several hundred million dollars in annual revenues.1 The firm generally recruits entry-level asso- ciates from top law schools nationally. The associate career consists of an up-or-out path to partnership. Fewer than one in four associates achieve partnership. On entry, associates are assigned to a range of projects, partners, and clients based largely on the ebb and flow of work demands. As they gain experience in their first few years, assign- ments become more substantive and the pro- cess of matching employees to projects becomes more meaningful. Throughout the study period, the firm had a policy authorizing associates to participate in a reduced-hours program. Under normal circumstances, any associate could be eligi- ble for the program after at least two years of tenure. Associates in our dataset who par- ticipated in the reduced-hours program enrolled, on average, during the beginning of their fourth year of tenure in the firm (mean = 4.12, SD = 1.62). Once associates enrolled in the program, they were assigned specific Full-Time Equiv- alent (FTE) statuses—for example, 80 per- cent FTE status or 60 percent FTE status. According to the firm’s policy guidelines, work conducted by reduced-time associates was evaluated in accordance with the firm’s review process for full-time lawyers. Com- pensation was prorated, and the year-end bonus for reduced-hours associates was sub- ject to the same considerations as were applicable to associates working on a full- time basis. Once enrolled in the program, 296 American Sociological Review 76(2) associates could remain in it for a short or long period of time, with the expectation that if they exited the program to return to full-time associate status, they would remain on the track to partnership. Data The data encompass 958 associates who entered the firm between the years 1997 and 2005. For most analyses in this study, we focus on 71 program users during those years. Personnel data include associates’ pre-hire characteristics used for recruitment and hiring purposes, as well as records of career events, life events, and pay throughout an associate’s tenure in the firm. We com- piled information on working relationships among associates, partners, and clients using annual billing records through the end of 2007. Data are complete, with the exception of compensation data, which are available only for the years 2001 to 2007. In addition to these quantitative data, we conducted 24 interviews with partners, staffing managers, and associates. We also reviewed interview transcripts conducted by an internal task force assessing the reduced-hours program. Analytic Strategy Because program use involves a self- selection process among employees, we begin our analysis by examining which asso- ciates are more likely to use the program in the first place. We then consider the possibil- ity that employees are selected upon entry, rather than randomly assigned to particular supervisors. We find that workers assigned to powerful supervisors do not differ from other workers on a wide range of pre-hire individual characteristics. Next, we turn to our primary interest— modeling the success of program users. Our analytic strategy is to include independent variables reflecting the organizational con- text for employees at the time of program enrollment, as well as variables reflecting organizational context during their first year of tenure in the firm. To model outcomes, we estimate a series of regressions predicting performance pay and attrition outcomes, adjusting for selection effects. As the final step in our analysis, we report the results of a supplemental investigation of the possible mechanisms that lie behind the initial assign- ment effect. To do this, we enter three differ- ent mechanism variables into the outcomes models and consider whether the results pro- vide evidence that the mechanism variables moderate the effect of initial assignment. Dependent Variables We use two variables for successful career outcomes: (1) performance-based pay rela- tive to cohort and (2) associate retention along the path to partnership. Performance-based pay. Associate pay has two components, a base salary and a year-end bonus. Base salary is constant across associates from the same class year and increases in lock-step by year of tenure. Bonus is assigned according to individual performance and is evaluated by the practice group leader with input from the partners who work most closely with the associate. Reduced-hours associates are awarded a bonus percentage based on their full-FTE (full-time equivalent) pay, and their entire pay is then prorated to their particular FTE level. This payment practice allows for com- parison across reduced-hours and full-time associates in terms of their relative perfor- mance and contributions. Because bonuses are assigned to reduced-hours associates prior to their total pay being prorated, in prin- ciple, a full-time associate who transitions to reduced hours and continues to perform at the same level should receive the same percentage bonus, and hence the same non- prorated total pay. The variable we use in our analyses is each associate’s annual bonus, net of his class Briscoe and Kellogg 297 cohort average that year. This variable directly reflects differences in the bonus assigned to an associate relative to what the firm considers to be his appropriate peers. This approach damp- ens any variance related to yearly fluctuation in funds allocated for the associate bonus pool; a significant amount was allocated in every year of the study period.2 Retention on the path to partnership. Fewer than one in four associates become a partner. During the study period, associates either exited after a certain number of fixed years or were awarded partnership. Toward the end of the study period, the firm devel- oped options for associates who wanted to stay in the firm without becoming partners. Only a few individuals in our analysis took advantage of this option, and we considered the moment of their transition to be equiva- lent to firm exit in terms of representing attri- tion from the path toward partnership. We have precise data on each associate’s date of hire and exit (if any), taken from the firm’s human resource databases. In analyses conducted on all associates, individuals are allowed to be at risk of attrition during their entire tenure in the organization, from date of hire until they exit the firm (or to the end of 2007, whichever comes first). In anal- yses of attrition among program users, indi- viduals are at risk from the day marking the onset of program use until they leave (or to the end of 2007, whichever comes first).3 Independent Variable: Exposure to Powerful Supervisors Our primary independent variable reflects an associate’s exposure to powerful supervisors (partners) at various points in her tenure at the firm. We took three factors into account in constructing this variable: (1) defining powerful supervisors, (2) operationalizing exposure of associates to those supervisors, and (3) capturing that exposure at different times in an associate’s tenure in the firm. Defining powerful supervisors. A law firm’s revenues are almost entirely a func- tion of hours billed to clients. Interviews suggest that the most powerful supervisors (partners) are those who have the highest client billings. Thus, we define a supervi- sor’s power as a function of the client billings for which she could claim responsi- bility in a given year, based on whether she was designated as the lawyer responsible for that client. For each partner, we added up the number of annual billable hours billed by any of the firm’s lawyers to that partner’s clients. This total number of billable hours became the partner’s supervisor-power value for that year. Partners vary widely in their power val- ues, and power changed over time. To sim- plify matters for the next step, we define power supervisors in each year as those whose power-supervisor values exceed a threshold (withheld to preserve anonymity). Different thresholds and a continuous weighting alternative yield only minor differences. Operationalizing exposure. We assume that associates are exposed to partners pri- marily by being assigned to client projects for which those partners are responsible. Rather than focusing on specific associate– partner links, our variable captures an associ- ate’s total exposure through client projects to partners with particular attributes, such as being power supervisors. To accomplish this, we calculate the portion of all billable hours an associate reported in a given year to projects led by power supervisors. The resulting variable ranges from 0 to 1.0 and varies for each associate in each year. Timing of exposure. We include expo- sure variables in our models in several differ- ent ways. The first variable captures expo- sure during the year prior to an associate’s transition to program use. The second vari- able captures exposure at the time of an asso- ciate’s entry into the firm. 298 American Sociological Review 76(2) Other Independent Variables and Controls Factors at the time of program enroll- ment. First, because prior research suggests that co-worker support may play an impor- tant role in the use of work-family programs (Blair-Loy and Wharton 2004), we control for the strength of an associate’s working relationships with proximal co-workers at the time of enrollment. To do so, we use a var- iable that measures the portion of co-workers from an associate’s projects in the year prior to enrollment that he had been working with to any degree two years earlier (e.g., 20 per- cent of co-workers worked with two years ear- lier). Second, because research suggests that employee tenure may shape program usage, we include a variable for an employee’s ten- ure in the firm at enrollment in the reduced- hours program. Finally, because larger proj- ects may make it easier for program users to share work with others (Briscoe 2007), we control for project size at the time of enroll- ment with a variable reflecting exposure to large projects—that is, client projects on which at least 20 other lawyers reported at least 100 hours in that year. Other variables capturing exposure to large projects yield only minor differences in the results. Other control variables. We control for sex, minority status, parental status (time varying), human capital in the form of law school rank and undergraduate grade-point average, department (base case is corporate), city locations, a dummy for hires entering via smaller law firm acquisition, and size of an associate’s incoming cohort (for additional details, see Part A in the online supplement [http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental]). An additional control for varying Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) levels of program users had no discernable effect on outcomes and was omitted from the final models. Mechanism Variables Superior skills development. On a four- point scale, we give each partner a point for each of the following: (1) uniformly positive upward feedback responses from subordinates; (2) high marks (at least 4 out of 5) for ‘‘train- ing and development’’ from subordinates; (3) partner chosen by firm to interview prospec- tive associate hires; and (4) all subordinates retained by the firm in the following year. Superior information provision. A supervisor social capital variable consists of a partner’s eigenvector centrality score in a network among the firm’s partners with ties defined by billings from one partner to another’s clients. Superior access to future reputation- building quality projects. We created a project-portfolio quality variable based on factors that interviewees perceived to be important for career success. We characterize projects on four dimensions: (1) billings to the firm’s major clients; (2) number of differ- ent partners with whom an associate was sub- stantially involved; (3) number of different clients with whom an associate was substan- tially involved; and (4) portion of an associ- ate’s billings to projects whose lead partners were located outside of the associate’s department or office. We then assigned each associate a time varying project- portfolio quality index for each year of tenure in the firm (for additional details, see Part A in the online supplement). RESULTS Our findings support the importance of the initial assignment effect in the career out- comes of reduced-hours program users. Ini- tial assignment to powerful supervisors is associated with positive career outcomes for program users in the form of higher perfor- mance pay and lower attrition. Initial assign- ment appears to trump factors at the time of program use, including exposure to powerful proximate supervisors. Furthermore, initial assignment effect is magnified for program users relative to non-users; as a result, upon program use, employees with high initial Briscoe and Kellogg 299 exposure do not suffer the decline in career outcomes experienced by other program users. This finding is robust to a range of modeling choices. We also find support for one particular mechanism underlying the ini- tial assignment effect: exposure to powerful initial supervisors helps employees gain access to reputation-building project oppor- tunities, which in turn allows them to build a significant track record with a wide range of supervisors and clients by the time they use the reduced-hours program. Demographics of Program Users We begin by examining program users and the initial assignment process before turning to our main focus, success among program users. Table 1 provides a summary of descrip- tive statistics for the variables used in our analyses. Table 2 presents results from a model predicting program use; corresponding hazard ratios for each covariate are provided in the right-hand column. Female employees are three times more likely to become program users ( p \ .001), and employees who become parents are more than four times as likely to become users ( p \ .001). The likelihood of program use also rises with organizational tenure ( p \ .001). Associates from better- ranked law schools are more likely to partici- pate ( p \ .001).

Because we find several significant factors in these models predicting program use, we infer that it is important to address selection into use in our main analyses of outcomes among program users. A Random Initial Assignment Process Our earlier arguments regarding initial assignment to powerful supervisors lead naturally to the question of what factors influence this initial assignment (Rivera 2008). Qualitative and quantitative evidence indicate that the assignment process at this firm is random with respect to individual characteristics. The firm’s staffing system matches partner requests for associates, based on general project requirements, to associate availability. For associates in their first two years, work experience and prefer- ence are not part of the calculation (for addi- tional details, see Part B in the online supplement). To investigate this issue further, we use pre-hire characteristics to compare employ- ees who varied in their assignment to power- ful supervisors on entry. Instead of regressing initial assignment on a panel of covariates (which could obscure associations through collinearity), we present basic mean and fre- quency comparisons for a series of these pre- hire human capital and demographic varia- bles. We compare pre-hire characteristics of employees who have no exposure to power- ful supervisors in their first year versus employees who have between 50 and 100 percent exposure in the first year (based on their total billable hours).4 We include key variables from our main analyses, as well as some additional variables that are avail- able only for subsets of employees and there- fore are not included in the main analyses. Table 3 shows the results. Overall, there are few significant differences in pre-hire characteristics between employees with no exposure to powerful supervisors and employees with high exposure. On two variables—ranking of an associate’s law school and whether an associate completed a court clerkship—employees who were assigned to powerful supervisors actually scored significantly lower than those not assigned to powerful supervisors. Associates with more exposure to powerful supervisors were also less likely to have any recorded work experience prior to starting at the firm.

Briscoe and Kellogg 301 whether an associate had been on the edito- rial board of a law review during law school (a competitive process), summer associate experience at the firm, and demographic characteristics such as being female, being of a minority race or ethnicity, or being mar- ried at the time of hire are not significantly different between the two groups. These results are consistent with the notion that associates’ initial assignment to supervi- sors is not correlated with human capital or other observable factors that could conceiv- ably influence associate success. Of course, it is possible that associates’ unobservable characteristics influence the initial assignment process. However, the quantitative evidence we have on observable characteristics, and the qualitative evidence we have from interviews, do not point to a sorting process until after the first two years of tenure, once associates gain skills, reputations, and rela- tionships that distinguish them in ways mean- ingful for the workplace. Exposure to Powerful Supervisors upon Entry and Program Users’ Career Outcomes Tables 4 and 5 present the results of analyses predicting our two main outcomes, performance pay and organizational attrition, respectively. These analyses use person-year observations with robust errors clustered on individual employees. The performance pay analyses use least-squares models, and the Table 3.

To aid in interpre- tation, the probit model results in Table 5 include a column showing the change in prob- ability for a one-unit change in each indepen- dent variable. The sequence of models is parallel in both tables. We start each series with a basic multivariate model showing how program use affects outcomes (Model 1). Then, we examine how our focal variable—the initial assignment effect—predicts outcomes among program users. We do this without adjusting (Model 2) and then after adjusting (Model 3) for selection into the program. The next model asks how the initial assignment effect differs for program users (during years of program use) relative to all other employees (including all non-use person-years), also conducted while adjusting for selection (Model 4). Finally, for the performance pay outcome, we estimate an individual fixed-effects model to see how the initial assignment effect differs during program use versus non-use (Model 5, shown in Table 4 only). Model 1 in both tables shows how pro- gram use itself affects outcomes. Changes in work assignments and relationships expe- rienced by employees after program use (summarized in Table 2) suggest that pro- gram use itself may influence outcomes. Model 1 indicates that after controls are included, program use has a negative effect on performance pay ( p \ .05) and that program use increases the probability of attri- tion, although this effect is of marginal sig- nificance ( p \ .10). Hence, program use appears to have a generally negative direct effect on outcomes, at least before taking selection into account.5 Model 2 of both tables includes the initial assignment effect, and Model 3 adds the selection adjustment. Selection into program use (the treatment group in Rubin’s [1974] causal framework) is salient in our context if individuals who choose to enroll in the program are also likely to have different career outcomes. Specifically, the selection adjustment in Model 3 of Table 4 consists of an OLS model predicting performance pay with a simultaneous probit model for the probability of program use (not shown in the table). We include an exclusion restric- tion in this and all other selection and treat- ment models discussed below.6 Model 3 in Table 5 provides parallel results from a bivar- iate probit model predicting the probability of exit for each person-year of use, while simultaneously predicting the probability of program use across all person-years. Dum- mies for each year of tenure in the exit model absorb any variance related to changes in probability over time. As a result, the attri- tion model is equivalent to a discrete-time event history analysis (using probability rather than odds; see Allison [2004] for a dis- cussion, including the appropriateness of the probit functional form for this type of dis- crete-time model). These models include additional controls for time-varying factors that could influence success among program users, derived from literature on work-family programs discussed earlier. Results indicate that exposure variables captured immediately at entry into the orga- nization are key predictors of success among program users, even though program use does not begin until several years later. As anticipated, initial assignment is significantly associated with increased performance pay and lower probability of attrition ( p \ .05). In the case of performance pay (see Table 4), the impact of the selection adjustment on the initial assignment effect is to strengthen its statistical significance. In the case of attrition (see Table 5), accounting for selection leads to an increase in the mag- nitude of the initial assignment effect while maintaining the same general level of significance.7 To assess the overall magnitude of these effects from initial entry, we can use the coefficients from Model 3 in Tables 4 and 5 to compare the difference between an Briscoe and Kellogg 305 T a b le 5 .

This difference translates into a $30,350 increase in performance-based pay relative to cohort (30.350 x 1,000 x 1.0) and an 18.1 percent reduction in the probability of attrition (we calculate the latter figure for the hypothet- ical employee described in the table notes).8 Fit improves when we add the exposure vari- ables to each model. In Model 4, after finding evidence of the initial assignment effect for program users, we turn to the question of how this effect differs for program users relative to non- users—or, more precisely, whether there is a significant difference in the initial assign- ment effect for participant person-years rela- tive to non-participant person-years. Because selection into treatment could bias our esti- mates of interest, we investigate this ques- tion using a treatment-effects model with an interaction of the initial exposure effect with the treatment of program use. Results in Model 4 (Tables 4 and 5) indicate a signif- icant increase in the initial assignment effect for program users. The interaction term is significant, and its inclusion improves model fit for both outcomes. For a given difference in initial exposure, the coefficients from Model 4 indicate a sig- nificantly magnified effect on outcomes for program users. Whereas a 1.0 versus .0 dif- ference in exposure leads to a $6,164 increase in performance pay for non-users (6.16 – .0), it leads to a $26,624 increase for program users ([6.164 1 20.425 – 20.460] – [–20.460]). This more than offsets the reduction in performance pay associated with program use. Because only a few employees have either 100 or 0 percent expo- sure to powerful partners, we also calculate the effects resulting from a difference of two standard deviations (2 SD) in initial exposure. A 2 SD increase in initial exposure corresponds to gains in performance pay of $8,771 for participants compared with $2,030 for non-participants. Turning to attri- tion, we find that the beneficial effect of ini- tial assignment on the probability of attri- tion is again stronger for program users. A 1.0 versus .0 difference in exposure leads to a 4.7 percent decline in probability of attrition for non-users (again for the hypo- thetical employee described earlier), compared with a 27.2 percent decline prob- ability for program users. A 2 SD gain in initial exposure corresponds to a 9.0 percent decline in the probability of attrition for par- ticipants versus 1.6 percent for non-partici- pants.9Overall, these magnitudes for pro- gram users are broadly consistent with results from the selection adjusted models described earlier. For performance pay, we are able to implement a fixed-effects model by interact- ing program use with initial exposure to pow- erful supervisors. The advantage of the fixed- effects model is that it implicitly controls for any unobservable (or observable) variation across employees. Only variables that vary within persons are included in the model, except for initial exposure to powerful super- visors, which is entered in the interaction term. The results, presented in Model 5 of Table 4, are consistent with our other models predicting performance pay. Specifically, the effect of powerful supervisor exposure at organization entry is significantly greater during program use, relative to non-program use.10 We find similar and generally stronger results for the initial assignment effect if we omit the selection and treatment adjustments shown in Tables 4 and 5. As a further sensi- tivity analysis, we implemented a modified Propensity Score Match based on program use and re-ran the career outcomes models using fixed effects for each matched set of program users and non-users. The results are consistent with those presented in Tables 4 and 5. In the above analyses, some control varia- bles for the social context at time of 308 American Sociological Review 76(2) enrollment are significant. In Table 4, having more project co-workers at the time of enroll- ment who were also project co-workers two years earlier increases performance-based pay (for program users and all employees, but this effect loses significance for program users after adjusting for selection). In Table 5, spending more time on projects with 20 or more co-workers at the time of enrollment increases pay and decreases attrition for all associates, but it is not significant for pro- gram users. Exposure to power supervisors at the time of enrollment is marginally significant in unadjusted models of both outcomes for program users, but this effect loses significance after adjusting for selec- tion and is not significant for all employees. In additional analyses (not shown here), we looked for effects from other time-of- enrollment variables suggested in the litera- ture, including average tenure of project workgroup members and gender composition of workgroups; we found no significant effects.11 Mechanism Investigation: Why Is There an Initial Assignment Effect? Table 6 summarizes results from additional analyses in which we added separate varia- bles designed to assess the relative impor- tance in the initial assignment effect of three different possible mechanisms. The models predict performance pay and attrition; the modeling strategy and control variables are the same as those presented in Model 3 of Tables 4 and 5. In this table, coefficients (and standard errors and significance levels) are provided for each of the three variables when they are entered separately into a base- line model. We also show the coefficients for power supervisor exposure at organiza- tion entry, and whether model fit improves after adding the mechanism variable. We are looking for evidence consistent with mediation. Evidence would include a significant coefficient on the mechanism variable while the power supervisor expo- sure at organization entry coefficient is diminished in size. The mechanisms we considered are super- visors’ provision of skills, provision of posi- tive opinions, and provision of access to future reputation-building projects. Neither supervisor developmental quality (our indi- cator for provision of skills) nor supervisor centrality (our indicator for provision of pos- itive opinions) explains the effect of initial exposure to powerful supervisors. We find no significant effects of supervisor develop- mental quality or supervisor social capital for program users on either outcome. Expo- sure to power supervisors continues to have a statistically significant and substantial influence on post-enrollment success even in the presence of these variables. And there is not a statistically significant improvement in model fit. The third mechanism we proposed is pro- vision of access to future reputation-building projects. We noted that powerful early super- visors may provide employees with access to future reputation-building projects if these supervisors have more ties, or more ties to other supervisors who control more valuable projects, than do other supervisors. One way to examine this mechanism is simply to com- pare the networks of powerful supervisors versus other supervisors in the organization. Powerful supervisors do, in fact, have links to a greater number of supervisors (13.20 versus 7.48 supervisors, t-test p \ .001), and to supervisors who control more valu- able clients on the dimensions that contrib- ute to the project-quality index ( p \ .001 on all three other variables in addition to the supervisor count, both in absolute com- parisons and when the other variables are normalized by number of alter contacts per focal supervisor). Initial assignment to powerful supervisors might also lead employees to better subsequent projects if individuals staffing the projects simply prefer employees exposed to powerful Briscoe and Kellogg 309 T a b le 6 .

Results suggest that the project quality index does mediate the initial assignment effect. When added to the models, project quality has a significant impact on performance-based pay ( p \ .05) and hazard of attrition ( p \ .05). Inclusion of project quality curtails the magnitude and eliminates the statistical significance of the powerful supervisor variable, consistent with its play- ing a mediation role in the impact of power- ful supervisors on success among program users. In addition, project-portfolio quality is itself predicted by the initial assignment effect. Results from analyses predicting proj- ect quality among program users (see Table 7) indicate that exposure to powerful supervi- sors at entry increases project-portfolio qual- ity measured prior to enrollment, as well as project quality in the year after enrollment. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the mechanism of access to reputation- building projects mediating the effect of initial exposure to powerful supervisors on program user career outcomes. DISCUSSION The Initial Assignment Effect We found that initial assignment to powerful supervisors facilitated positive career out- comes for later work-family program users, that initial assignment affected users more than non-users, and that it operated through the mechanism of improved access to reputation-building projects. Initial assign- ment to powerful supervisors upon entry, while random in this organization, was a key predictor of success among program users, even though program use did not begin until several years later. Conditions at the time of program use, such as assignment to a proximate powerful supervisor, were less important. Full initial exposure to powerful supervisors led to a $26,624 boost in annual performance pay and a 27.2 percent lower probability of exit. We observed these effects in the presence of a range of controls as well as an adjustment for the simultaneous effects of selection into program use. The initial assignment effect operated through the mechanism of providing employ- ees with access to a range of reputation- building projects over time. By the time they enrolled in the reduced-hours program, employees who had been initially assigned to powerful supervisors had gained access to a greater range of reputation-building work opportunities than had other employees. We posit that this exposure to reputation-building project opportunities was important because the very use of a work-family program signals employees’ membership in traditionally disadvantaged groups (i.e., mothers and male primary caregivers) and leads supervisors to negatively evaluate employees’ abilities, com- mitment, and marketability to clients. Project opportunities that provide employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups with exposure to a wide range of supervisors and clients allow these employees to solidify their stand- ing as able, committed, and marketable pro- fessionals in the eyes of this large invisible college before becoming program users. This large invisible college directly experiences vulnerable employees’ abilities, commitment, and marketability prior to program use, and this experience helps protect vulnerable employees from negative evaluation at the point of later program use. Although all employees who were ini- tially exposed to powerful supervisors benefited from reputation-building projects, the initial assignment effect was greater for those who eventually used the reduced- hours program. Whereas program users with full initial exposure to supervisors saw a $26,624 boost in annual performance pay, non-users saw a $6,164 boost. Similarly, whereas program users saw a 27.2 percent lower probability of exit, non-users saw a 4.7 percent lower probability of exit. Pro- gram users and non-users both benefited from the exposure to reputation-building Briscoe and Kellogg 311 opportunities that early assignment affords; why did program users benefit more than non-users from these opportunities? We posit that, because program users were vulnerable to negative evaluation due to their very use of the programs, they were more positively affected than non-users by having a large invisible college of supervisors and clients directly experience their abilities, commit- ment, and marketability. High exposure to reputation-building projects buffered against the negative effects of program use on eval- uation, so that highly exposed users suffered minor or no declines in career outcomes.

(two-tailed tests). 312 American Sociological Review 76(2) Low exposure did not buffer against negative effects, so poorly exposed users suffered average or worse declines in outcomes.12 Contributions to Our Understanding of Work-Family Programs and Social Capital Although many organizations adopt work- family programs to attract and retain employ- ees or to comply with institutional pressure (Davis and Kalleberg 2006; Glass and Fujimoto 1995; Kelly and Dobbin 1999; Osterman 1995), employees often choose not to use these programs because they are concerned about potential retaliation (Bailyn [1993] 2006; Blair-Loy and Wharton 2002, 2004; Eaton 2003; Hochschild 1997; Perlow 1997; Williams 2000). Indeed, such pro- grams often have a negative effect on pro- gram users’ career outcomes (Glass 2004; Judiesch and Lyness 1999). Our findings contribute to this understanding of work-family programs in several ways. First, prior studies highlight either the conditions under which employees are likely to use work-family programs (e.g., Blair-Loy and Wharton 2002, 2004) or the conditions that lead to effective implementation of employee- rights programs at the organizational level (e.g., Kalev et al. 2006). By contrast, we iden- tify conditions that allow individual employees to successfully use work-family programs. Second, while prior studies have not spe- cifically investigated the conditions associated with positive career outcomes for program users, they do suggest that positive outcomes are likely facilitated by organizational condi- tions at the time of program use, such as the power of employees’ proximate supervisors and the design of the program. In contrast, we demonstrate that the seeds of success can actually be planted much earlier: initial assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes of later program users, even when organiza- tional conditions at the time of program use are held constant. Our findings provide only limited support for the notion that powerful proximate supervisors can protect employees from negative career outcomes; instead, we find that once we include powerful initial supervisors in the analysis, the effect of pow- erful proximate supervisors loses significance. Third, we identify the key mechanism through which the initial assignment effect operates—initial assignment to powerful supervisors matters because it helps employ- ees gain access to reputation-building project opportunities over time. This finding is consistent with Kalev’s (2009) finding that collaborative work relations can weaken ster- eotypes and lead to promotion opportunities. But our finding differs from Kalev’s in a sub- stantive way: her study points to the levers of self-directed teams and cross-training, while ours points to the lever of initial assignment to powerful supervisors. These findings also add to our understand- ing of how relationships matter for career success. In many ways, our findings are con- sistent with the broad prediction of social capital theory—relationships are important to careers because they serve as valuable sources of information, influence, social credentials, and identity reinforcements (Blair-Loy 2001; Burt 1992; Fernandez and Fernandez-Mateo 2006; Ibarra 1993; Lin 2001; Podolny and Baron 1997). For these reasons, mentors in organizations are impor- tant because they provide protégés with access to new opportunities (Kay and Wal- lace 2009; Thomas and Kram 1988). We make two contributions to this research. First, we help to unpack the mechanism through which initial access to social capital shapes subsequent outcomes. We find that weak ties to powerful supervisors—ties that are formal, random, and relatively short- lived—can set off a virtuous spiral of repu- tation-building project opportunities. Second, past studies find that women in male-dominated organizations suffer social capital deficits (Kay and Hagan 1998), yet little research directly connects the effect of Briscoe and Kellogg 313 social capital with actors’ vulnerability. We demonstrate that the value from prior rela- tionships is heightened when employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups become doubly vulnerable through participation in a controversial workplace program. Implications for Our Understanding of Inequality Remediation in Organizations To what extent are these findings generaliz- able to other kinds of employee-rights pro- grams designed to remediate inequality in organizations? To help employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups succeed, organizations adopt not only work-family programs but also diversity, disability, dis- pute resolution, and sexual harassment pro- grams (Dobbin 2009; Dobbin et al. 1988; Dobbin and Sutton 1998; Edelman 1990; Kalev et al. 2006). Individuals eligible for employee-rights programs often suffer the same vulnerabilities as those who are eligible for work-family programs—women, minorities, and disabled employees are often perceived as less competent than other employees. Using these programs highlights employees’ membership in traditionally dis- advantaged groups and thus may invite supervisors to question their commitment, abilities, and marketability (Albiston 2007; Edelman, Erlanger, and Lande 1993; Harlan and Robert 1998; Heimer and Staffen 1998; Morrill 1995; Silbey, Huising, and Coslov- sky 2009). Our findings suggest that initial assignment to a powerful supervisor would likely promote positive career outcomes for users of these other kinds of employee- rights programs as well. However, the tim- ing of program use may be important. Vul- nerable employees need to solidify their standing as professionals in the eyes of supervisors and clients before becoming program users; if they use disability or sex- ual harassment programs, for example, shortly after entering an organization, they may not benefit greatly from initial assignment to powerful supervisors for two reasons. First, the initial powerful supervi- sors may negatively evaluate them if they are already program users and choose not to provide them with a stream of reputation-building projects. Second, even if initial supervisors do provide these employees with such projects, the employees will have exposure to supervisors and clients under circumstances in which their ability, commitment, and marketability is already in doubt because of their choice to use the pro- grams. Thus, the invisible college may nega- tively rather than positively evaluate them. To what extent is the employer practice of initial assignment generalizable to other organizations? We expect this practice to be most important to program users in organiza- tions where powerful initial supervisors can provide employees with access to a stream of future project opportunities that would allow them to solidify their standing as able, committed, and marketable profession- als and where a large invisible college of prior supervisors or clients participates in the evaluation of employees at the time of later program use. In short, we expect to find similar results in investment banks, con- sulting firms, and accounting firms, but not necessarily in traditional manufacturing firms, where employees work with fewer supervisors and supervisors are typically not involved in later evaluation of their prior employees. Future research can help deter- mine whether and how the initial assignment effect applies to other employee-rights pro- grams and other kinds of organizations. Practical Implications For individuals, the practical implications of the findings presented here are clear, if not encouraging: individuals who did not happen to be assigned to a powerful supervisor at the outset probably should not choose to use a reduced-hours program. For organizations, the practical implications are more compli- cated. On the one hand, initial assignment 314 American Sociological Review 76(2) of female employees to powerful supervisors may be a way for employers to help these vulnerable employees succeed. On the other hand, if initial assignment became a program in its own right, it might develop the same stigmatizing effect associated with other employee-rights programs. Perhaps initial assignment was so powerful in this case pre- cisely because it was randomly assigned. This suggests that organizations should pro- ceed with caution, piloting initial assignment in particular offices or departments to see if it is possible to implement the practice in a way that does not invite retaliation. In summary, one of the great challenges associated with remediating inequality in organizations is that even when organizations introduce new programs designed to help employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed, employees who use the pro- grams often suffer negative career consequen- ces. This study demonstrates that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry can improve career outcomes of later work-family program users by giving them improved access to reputation-building work opportunities. This allows these employees to solidify their standing as able, committed, and marketable professionals in the eyes of a large invisible college of evaluators before becoming program users. In a world where particular groups are discriminated against in the workplace and where employee-rights programs designed to remedy inequality are often avoided by the intended beneficiaries, identification of employer practices that improve career outcomes for vulnerable employees is critical. Initial assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry could be a way for employers to help level the playing field for traditionally disadvan- taged groups in the workplace.

We provide these numbers to give a sense of the cat- egory of firms to which our research site belongs. Here and elsewhere, we withhold precise details about our research site to maintain anonymity. 2. An additional advantage of this approach is that non-prorated pay nets out the effects of any irregu- lar (partial) pay years that may arise if employees take leaves of absence. 3. We also have data on partnering. However, analyz- ing partnering reduces the usable sample size greatly because many associates started at the firm too recently to have become partners. 4. Results are similar if we choose other cut-points in the distribution of initial exposure. 5. We find similar results using other model specifica- tions, including a simple hazard rate model for attri- tion. Results are also similar for female employees only, although the negative effect of program use on performance pay rises from –20.575 ($20,575, p \ .05) to –30.405 ($30,405, p \ .01). 6. The selection and treatment models include as coef- ficients all variables that are significant from Table 2 (full models available in Part C of the online sup- plement). Although these models can be identified without it, we include a weak exclusion restriction in the form of a dummy variable for the first two years of tenure. This variable is correlated with the treatment but is not correlated with career out- comes across person-years. Few other options are available because many factors that select people into the program (e.g., sex or family status) are also correlated with exiting the firm. We patterned our approach after Fernandez and Sosa (2005) who modeled a two-stage hiring process in which many factors influencing first stage outcomes also influence second stage outcomes. 7. Attrition analyses are also robust to an alternative specification omitting the small number of exits that were internally designated by the firm as ‘‘unregretted attrition.’’ 8. As an additional analysis, we re-ran this analysis on female employees only. This produces similar Briscoe and Kellogg 315 results: a $28,980 increase in pay and a 21 percent reduction in the probability of attrition. 9. We generated these interaction magnitudes using the margins, predict() dydx() postestimation com- mand (available in Stata v.11) following the bipro- bit regression command. We computed the mar- ginal estimates of initial exposure separately for program users and non-users. 10. A parallel fixed-effects approach to the retention outcome, using a conditional logit model estimated on discrete-time event history data as suggested by Allison (2005), did not converge. 11. Future research could examine the durability over time of the beneficial initial assignment effect we identified, including after program un-enrollment (i.e., following a return to regular employment status). 12. Highly exposed users had performance pay out- comes around the same level as highly exposed non-users.

Forrest Briscoe is an Assistant Professor in the Depart- ment of Management and Organization at the Pennsylva- nia State University. His research focuses on changing organizational practices and their implications for career and labor market processes, particularly among profes- sionals. He also studies inter-organizational diffusion and institutional change. His papers have been published in Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Sci- ence Quarterly, Organization Science, and Industrial & Labor Relations Review. Current projects include a study on how relationships change after law firms merge, and a study on the diffusion of changes in corporate retiree benefits. Katherine C. Kellogg is Assistant Professor of Organi- zation Studies at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Her research on institutional change inside organizations in response to healthcare regulation has been published in the American Journal of Sociology and Organization Science. She is currently conducting a study of medical– legal partnerships that integrate lawyers in a health set- ting to help low-income patients navigate the complex government and community systems that often hold sol- utions to many social determinants of health.
