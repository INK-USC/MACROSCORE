Evidence from a Major Education Reform Louis-Philippe Morin, University of Ottawa This paper provides new evidence of gender differences in re- sponse to increased competition, focusing on important life tasks performed in a regular social environment. The analysis takes ad- vantage of a major education reform in Ontario that exogenously increased competition for university grades. Comparing students prereform and postreform using rich administrative data, I find that male average grades and the proportion of male students grad- uating “on time” increased relative to females. Further, the evidence indicates that these changes were due to increased relative effort rather than self-selection. The findings have implications for the delivery of education and incentive provision more generally. I. Introduction Experimental evidence from several recent studies, notably by Gneezy, Niederle, and Rustichini ð2003Þ and Gneezy and Rustichini ð2004Þ, in- dicates that males perform better than females in the face of increased I would like to thank Michael Baker, Branko Boskovic, Pierre Brochu, Victor Couture, Fernanda Estevan, Nicole Fortin, Caroline Hoxby, Josh Lewis, Rob McMillan, Hessel Oosterbeek, Phil Oreopoulos, Uros Petronijevic, Joseph Price, Richard Romano, Aggey Semenov, Aloysius Siow, and seminar and conference participants at Carleton University, l’Université de Sherbrooke, the University of Toronto, Wilfrid Laurier University, the November 2009 NBER Education Pro- gram Meeting, and the 2010 EALE/SOLE Meeting for many helpful comments.

They point to possible underlying differences in the cost of effort by gender, with effort expenditure becoming less costly for men relative to women in more competitive environments. To the extent that these differences carry over to important long-term tasks, they have the potential to explain—at least in part—several striking features of the US labor market, including the disproportionate presence of males in highly competitive jobs and gender inequalities in pay.2 It is natural to view differences in labor market outcomes as the result of long-run exposure to competitive environments in which individuals perform regular work-related tasks and are then evaluated according to a competitive selection process or tournament. Ideally, to learn about pos- sible differential responses by gender to increased competition, one would like to mimic the essential features of such a setting. This would include individuals performing day-to-day tasks over an extended period—tasks that they are highly incentivized to care about—and drawing a contrast be- tween performance in low- versus high-competition environments while controlling for all other relevant factors. The pioneering experimental studies referred to above are able to vary competition exogenously and cleanly control for potentially confounding factors. Yet the tasks these papers have focused on—solving computermazes and sprinting over short distances, for instance—are somewhat atypical. To lend credence to the notion that underlying gender differences in re- sponse to greater competition do indeed extend beyond the laboratory to regular activities in day-to-day life, this study analyzes the impact of an exogenous change in competition on gender performance differences in a regular social environment—the university classroom—focusing on life tasks that individuals have strong incentives to care about. In this instance, the tasks involve trying to master the material covered in university courses— somewhat analogous to skill accumulation in the workplace—with re- wards ðin the form of gradesÞ being based on relative performance over the course of the academic year. 1 Gneezy et al. ð2003Þ find that the relative and absolute performance of males increases as competition intensifies: males improve their performance, while fe- males do not. 2 A variety of possible explanations for female underrepresentation in compet- itive jobs appear in the literature, including career-family trade-offs ðBertrand, Goldin, and Katz 2010Þ, discrimination ðWolfers 2006Þ, and tastes for competition ðNiederle and Vesterlund 2007Þ, as well as differential performance in competi- tive environments ðGneezy et al. 2003Þ. project possible.

Information concerning access to the data used in this article is available as supplementary material online. 444 Morin More specifically, the analysis makes use of data from a major education reform in Ontario’s secondary school system that shortened high school by 1 year, from 5 years to 4 years. As a consequence of this reform, which abolished the final year of high school ðor grade 13Þ, two cohorts grad- uated from high school in June 2003, creating a so-called double cohort of students and drastically increasing competition for university places that year. Importantly, given that capacity did not increase anything close to proportionately, this in turn increased the quality of students who ended up being admitted to university. For universities that grade on a fixed bell curve, like the one studied here,3 the reformmade it harder to receive higher grades. That is, each student was now competing with higher quality ðand more homogeneousÞ students for the same fixed grade. In such circum- stances, one would expect student effort to play a larger role in the deter- mination of university grades. The incentives to exert higher effort would increase alike for males and females, but if males are more positively ðor less negativelyÞ affected by an increase in competition,4 then such cross-gender differences could result in a differential shift in effort, manifesting itself as a relative change in performance when comparing male and female out- comes. It is worth noting that the word “competition” in the context of class- room performance does not have the same meaning as in the traditional experimental economics literature ðe.g., Gneezy et al. 2003Þ. In this lit- erature, researchers introduce competition by moving from a piece-rate payoff scheme, where rewards are independent of the performance of oth- ers, to a payoff scheme where the relative performance of other subjects matters ða “tournament” pay schemeÞ. In this paper, student performance depends on the performance of the student’s peers, even in the “noncom- petitive” ðprereformÞ environment. Therefore, I study the impact of an increase in the level of competition.5 One could argue that the change in competition level observed here is closer to what we observe in the work- place. The first empirical goal of this paper is to see whether a differential performance shift occurred based on the increase in the level of compe- tition in university classrooms due to the Ontario double cohort.6 With 3 I present the actual marking guidelines suggested to professors in Sec. IV, and I show evidence of bell curve marking in Secs. IV and VI. 4 For instance, men might enjoy being in a competitive environment more than females ðor dislike it lessÞ. 5 In fact, the change in the level of competition observed in this paper makes it also close to some of the experimental work done on the effects of affirmative action on effort ðby changing the likelihood to win the tournament for some in- dividualsÞ. See, e.g., Calsamiglia, Franke, and Rey-Biel ð2013Þ. 6 I focus on differential effort by gender while in university, though the empirics below address the possibility that there may have been effects in high school also. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 445 that goal in mind, I examine the impact of increased competition on the gender performance gap using data from the University of Toronto. In this case, the University of Toronto provides a valuable context to shed new light on the gender effects of increased competition for several rea- sons. First, with more than 55,000 undergraduate students, it is one of the largest universities in North America and so affords very large sam- ples. Second, I have access to rich administrative data that allow me to observe virtually error-free performance measures for students who at- tended university in a normal environment ðbefore the double cohortÞ versus a more competitive environment ðentering university in Septem- ber 2003Þ, along with a set of useful controls. Third, the grading scheme guidelines at the University of Toronto clearly indicate a “bell curve”–like marks distribution throughout this time period, unlike other Ontario universities. The data make it possible to estimate a set of regressions showing whether the relative university performance of male students compared to females, that is, the university gender grade differential, improved in moving from a normal environment to a more competitive one, control- ling for student ability. Using this approach, I find that male students gained about 1 percentage point ðor 11% of a standard deviationÞ over female students during their first year in university in response to the increased competition. While modest in size, the effect persists, remain- ing around 1 percentage point throughout students’ 4 years of univer- sity. The increased competition not only affected student grades but also influenced credit accumulation ðespecially for “below-average” studentsÞ and on-time graduation rates, both suggesting that males became rela- tively more effective as competition increased. The second empirical goal of the paper is to shed light on the reasons for this differential change in performance. In the observational setting of the double cohort, the performance change might be attributable to dif- ferential changes in effort by gender—the hypothesized channel—but also to differential selection and other changes by gender. Although student effort is not directly observable, my approach makes use of the richness of the administrative data to address the most likely potential self-selection issues and alternative channels. To the extent that selection and other confounding factors do not appear to be significant, this points to differ- ential changes in effort by gender as the primary source of the measured performance differences. On the selection front, the main concern is that competitive environ- ments attract competitive individuals and repel noncompetitive individ- uals. Thus one might expect males ðand especially competitive malesÞ to differentially select into the double cohort relative to females. Looking at information on all applicants, regardless of whether they actually enrolled 446 Morin or not, the evidence indicates that the double cohort did not have dif- ferential selection effects by gender. Specifically, the proportion of females among applicants and enrolled students did not change significantly, com- paring the prereform period with the double cohort; nor did female rep- resentation within the ability distribution ðby high school average quar- tileÞ; and the proportion of female “fast-trackers”—students from the grade 13 program who graduated early and applied to university in 2002— did not change significantly either. I also investigate whether the increased competition affected dropout and program selection decisions differently by gender: the evidence does not show any gender differences in these de- cisions. Overall, self-selection bias in this context does not appear to be a cause for concern. Ideally, one would randomly assign the competition treatment to some students and the control to others. But in the current observational setting, the students in the “high competition” environment are clearly of higher ability than those attending university in the prereform period, on aver- age. Therefore, one necessary assumption for identifying the impact of competition on the gender performance gap is that observable controls for ability are adequate. One violation of this assumption serves as a potential threat to iden- tification. Since competition might have been tougher, not only in uni- versity classrooms but in high school also, the mapping of student ability into high school grades could have changed in the following confound- ing way. Suppose high school grades in the double cohort overestimated female student ability ðrelative to malesÞ; then this could result in one over- estimating male student performance in university relative to females and falsely attributing this increase in performance to heightened university com- petition. This scenario would require that females were more stimulated by competition than males in both high school and university, but this dif- ferential would need to be smaller in university. This seems unlikely given my findings relating to university performance: ðiÞ the unconditional and conditional university grades both suggest that the relative performance of males increased following the double cohort, and ðiiÞ the female representa- tion does not seem to have changed within the ability distribution of ap- plicants as competition increased. Nevertheless, I address this possibility using information on out-of- province students and students who attended a university prior to theUni- versity of Toronto, on the basis that the mapping of ability into grades is not likely to have changed for these students. Estimating regressions us- ing only these students gives results that are very similar to the ones ob- tained usingOntario secondary school students. Also, quantile regressions do not suggest that the differential impact of competition on performance by gender is driven by a specific type of student—whether of low or high Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 447 ability. The evidence points to differential changes in effort by gender over the entire ability distribution. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section describes existing research on gender and competition and then explains how the Ontario double cohort can shed new light on this topic. Section III sets out a model examining the potential impact of increased competition in university, analyzing the implications for effort choice. Section IV pre- sents the data and also evidence of increased competition at the Univer- sity of Toronto. The estimation strategy is described in Section V, and in Section VI the main results are presented. Section VII consists of a series of robustness checks, in particular shedding light on whether the results are driven by self-selection. Section VIII then investigates whether in- creased competition also affected performance beyond students’ first year in university, and Section IX concludes, drawing out implications of the analysis. II. Background A. Prior Literature This subsection discusses the well-known research in experimental eco- nomics that first examined how males and females respond to increased competition and also the small number of papers that have looked at this issue in an observational setting.7 The experimental economics literature on competition and gender performance differences has been motivated primarily by the findings in Bertrand and Hallock ð2001Þ. Those authors noted that women only represent 2.5% of the 1992–97 ExecuComp data set, consisting of the top-five executives in each firm of the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;PMidcap 400, and S&amp;P Smallcap 600.8 Gneezy et al. ð2003Þ and Gneezy and Rustichini ð2004Þ proposed and experimentally tested an explanation— aside from discrimination or occupational self-selection—as to why we might observe large gender differences in highly ranked ðand highly com- petitiveÞ labor market positions. Specifically, Gneezy et al. ð2003Þ con- ducted a laboratory experiment in which participants ðuniversity studentsÞ had to solve as many computer mazes as possible in a given amount of time. While men and women performed equally in the noncompetitive environ- ment, when placed in a more competitive environment, men significantly improved their performance while women did not. The authors concluded that “women may be less effective than men in competitive environments.” Gneezy and Rustichini ð2004Þ presented evidence that this gender differ- 7 For a more complete review of the literature on the topic, see Croson and Gneezy ð2009Þ and Niederle and Vesterlund ð2010Þ. 8 Wolfers ð2006Þ suggests that the female CEO representation is not improving, as only 2.5% of new CEO appointments between 2000 and 2004 were females. 448 Morin ence might hold at a young age as well, based on a field experiment in which children had to sprint over a certain distance in different competition set- tings. There also boys’ performance was enhanced by direct competition while girls’ performance was not. My paper investigates whether the findings in these pioneering studies also emerge in long-term tasks involving a regular social environment. There is a clear link between my paper and Gneezy et al. ð2003Þ: both studies compare performance across individuals, and in both cases one group receives the ðincreasedÞ competition treatment while the other does not. The main differences lie in the contrasting nature of the tasks studied ðsolving computer mazes vs. performing in university coursesÞ and the random assignment, which is only possible in the experimental setting. Note that the nature of the task studied here—long-term and mattering for future life outcomes—is key in gauging the potential of competitive gender differences to explain features of the labor market; Section VII of my paper tackles the selection issue. Few papers have studied the effects of an exogenous change in compe- tition on performance in observational ðnonexperimentalÞ environments. Price ð2008Þ looked at the effect of the introduction of the Graduate Education Initiative ðGEIÞ, which increased competition within PhD pro- grams, on the time to candidacy for students attending elite US universi- ties. The GEI sponsored fellowships intended to reward “students who made the quickest progress toward completing their degree” ðPrice 2008Þ. While males decreased their time to candidacy by 10%, women were not affected by the GEI. My paper analyzes a more common type of activity that a large fraction of the population will have to deal with at some point in their life. In the course of doing so, it takes a close look at the potential self-selection impacts of increased competition. Two recent studies have looked at potential gender differences in per- formance on university admission tests. Jurajda andMünich ð2011Þ looked at whether females become relatively less likely to be admitted in a uni- versity program as it becomes more competitive ðas the admission rate of the program decreasesÞ. Based on an entire cohort of Czech second- ary school graduates, each applying to about three university programs, they find that female applicants are significantly less likely to be admitted to most selective university programs relative to males with similar ability. In the same vein, Ors, Palomino, and Peyrache ð2013Þ studied gender difference in performance in the highly competitive entry exam to the master of science in management program at one of France’s top business schools ðHEC ParisÞ. They found that males outperformed females in the entry exam, while admitted female students outperformed their male counterparts during their first year at HEC—a less competitive environ- ment, according to the authors. They also found that female HEC appli- Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 449 cants outperformed male applicants in the baccalauréat exam, assumed to be a less competitive preapplication exam.9 Note that the three types of exam studied by Ors et al. ð2013Þ differed not only in their competition level but also in their format ðe.g., oral vs. written examsÞ and the skills ðe.g., general vs. management-specific knowledgeÞ that they tested. As with Price ð2008Þ, Ors et al. ð2013Þ does not focus on the potential impact of com- petition on gender differentials in self-selection. My paper is also related to Lavy ð2013Þ, in that both studies look at a regular competitive environment. Lavy ð2013Þ examines a tournament-like pay scheme rewarding Israeli teachers who performed better than their peers ðbased on the difference between the predicted and the actual per- formances of their studentsÞ. Contrary to the studies cited above, Lavy ð2013Þ does not find evidence of gender differences in performance in this competitive workplace environment. B. The Ontario Double Cohort A key challenge in estimating the impact of competition on performance in a natural environment is to find an exogenous source of variation in the competition level faced by individuals. The abolition of grade 13 offers such a source. As part of a major reform to its secondary school system, the govern- ment of Ontario announced the abolition of grade 13 in 1997. Prior to this reform, Ontario students entered college or university after completing grade 13, which contrasted with the other secondary school programs in Canada. Following the reform, students were now expected to complete secondary school in 4 years ðafter grade 12Þ instead of 5 years. The first cohort of the new program ðhenceforth, the G12 programÞ began secondary school ðgrade 9Þ in September 1999. Since students completed the new program faster than its predecessor ðthe G13 programÞ, the first cohort of the G12 program and the last cohort of the abolished program were expected to graduate and apply to postsecondary institutions in spring 2003, giving rise to the Ontario “double cohort.” Figure 1 shows the effect of the double cohort on the number of post- secondary institution applicants. There was a significant spike in the num- ber of applicants in 2003, increasing from about 60,000 to more than 100,000 between 2001 and 2003. Since Ontario universities did not ex- pand capacity in proportion, this large increase in the number of appli- cants made university access more difficult in 2003. We can see the im- pact of the double cohort on the selectivity of universities by looking at 9 Niederle and Vesterlund ð2010Þ suggest using caution when comparing the performance distribution of admitted students to the performance distribution of applicants as the former is a ðhighlyÞ truncated subsample of the latter. 450 Morin the application numbers for the University of Toronto. The relevant num- bers for 2001 and 2003 are presented in table 1.10 The increase in the number of applicants between 2001 and 2003 was 61.3%, which is significantly greater than the increase in enrollment ð25%Þ. This led the enrollments-to-applicants ratio to drop from 71% to 55%, indicating that university admissions became much more competitive than in previous years. By increasing competition for university admissions, the double cohort also affected the quality of students enrolled in university in 2003. It is natural to expect students admitted to a university during the double co- hort year to be better than students admitted to the same institution a few years before. The level of competition in university should also have been greater since each student would be facing better ðand more homogeneousÞ classmates in terms of high school averages. This is especially true if rela- tive performance is an important component of university grades, as the increased homogeneity in student ability and a fixed “bell curve” can in- crease the role of effort in determining university grades ðas explained in the next sectionÞ. It is worth noting that there was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2002 relative to 2001, looking ahead to some of the selection issues that will be addressed in Section VII. Although this increase is smaller than in 2003, it does suggest that some G13 students escaped the 10 This is the number of students who put the University of Toronto as their first choice institution when applying through the Ontario Universities’ Application Centre ðOUACÞ.

Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 451 double cohort by “fast-tracking” secondary school.11 If more females tried to avoid the double cohort by fast-tracking, the populations of male and female students who entered university in 2003 may not be comparable. The evidence presented below indicates that this is not an issue.12 Also, comparison of the female representation by high school average quartile between 2001 and 2003 indicates that the female representation did not change significantly within the student ability distribution ðsee table 2 in Sec. IV.AÞ. III. Increased Competition, Bell Curve Marking, and Effort In this section, I first examine the impact of increased competition fol- lowing the double cohort on the link between high school grades and uni- versity grades. In particular, I present predictions regarding the expected signs of the parameter estimates from regressing university grades on high school grades if a university grades its students based on a bell curve. This will allow me to verify later on that competition really did increase in university classrooms following the double cohort. I then present a sim- ple model that illustrates a possible channel through which performance gender differences can emerge as competition increases: differential changes in effort incentives. A. Increased Competition and Grades This subsection makes explicit the way that increased competition can affect the link between ability ðmeasured by high school gradesÞ and uni- versity performance. Suppose that, for every student i enrolled in univer- sity in year t, we observe a university grade, Ui,t, and a high school grade, Hi,t. Assume that the university grades on a fixed bell curve such that every year university grades follow a normal distribution with the same mean mU and variance j 2 U. Further, assume that Hi,t also follows a normal 11 It was possible for G13 students to fast-track secondary school, but only a small number of them would do so. Between 1996 and 2001, the proportion of Ontario university students who had graduated from high school after 4 years fluctuated between 7.7% and 8.5% ðKing et al. 2002Þ. 12 I investigate this possibility in Sec. VII.B, but I do not find any significant change in the proportion of female fast-trackers in 2002. Table 1 University Applicants and Enrollment Applicants Enrollment Enrollment/ Applicants Applicant Increase ð%Þ Enrollment Increase ð%Þ 2001 10,349 7,300 .71 2003 16,697 9,124 .55 61.3 25.0 SOURCE.—University of Toronto Admissions and Awards. 452 Morin distribution but with mean mH;t and variance j 2 H;t that are allowed to vary over time.13 We can link the two distributions using mU 5 at 1 btmH;t ð1Þ and j2U 5 b 2 tj 2 H;t; ð2Þ where bt is expected to be positive. Figure 2 illustrates the link between high school and university grades. The top panel of figure 2 presents the distribution of high school grades of students admitted to university, while the bottom panel presents the distribution of university grades. Assume that competition for university admission increases between t and t 0 . As competition increases, the distribution of high school grades admitted to university will shift to the right—the average will increase from mH;t to mH;t0—and, in turn, the variance, j 2 H;t, will decrease. These changes in mean and variance are simply due to the limited admission capacity of the university. This phenomenon is illustrated in the top panel of figure 2. Since the university keeps the same performance distribution from year to year ði.e., mU and j2U remain unchangedÞ, the increased competition will affect the link between high school grades and university grades. In the top panel of figure 2, we can see that j2H;t decreases as competition in- creases. Therefore bt0 will be larger than bt ðfrom a less competitive yearÞ to guarantee that equation ð2Þ still holds. Also, since both mH;t and bt in- crease, at will decrease to ensure that equation ð1Þ is satisfied. The framework presented above makes two predictions regarding the parameter estimates from estimating a regression equation of the following form: Ui;t 5 a1 gHi 1 pDCt 1 rðDCt HiÞ1 qi;t; ð3Þ whereUi,t is student i’s university grade,Hi is student i’s high school grade, and DCt is a dummy variable equal to one if student i is observed during the more competitive year. Equation ð3Þ can be seen as the base regression equation used in this paper. Here p and r will capture changes in the con- stant and slope parameters in equation ð1Þ—that is, p5 at0 2 at and r5 bt0 2 bt from the earlier discussion—following the increase in competition. If the university grades on a bell curve, we should first expect the slope coefficient to be greater ðr &gt; 0Þ and, second, the intercept to be smaller 13 Fig. 4 suggests that a normal distribution is a reasonable approximation to the actual grade distribution.

Note that these predictions are easily testable with the available data. The regression results in Section VI suggest that r &gt; 0 and p &lt; 0. B. Increased Competition and Effort in University The previous model made explicit the link between competition, grades, and bell curve marking. I now present a simple model to analyze the po- tential impact of increased competition and bell curve marking on the ef- fort incentive in university classrooms. Imagine students with ability a will exert effort e when studying to acquire knowledge, Kðe, aÞ. Assume that Kðe, aÞ is continuously differ- entiable and increasing and concave in e and a. The cost of studying is given by a continuously differentiable function Cgðe; a; lÞ ðin e and aÞ and increasing and convex in e—these assumptions yield well-behaved mar- ginal cost and marginal benefit of effort schedules. The cost to studying also depends on the student’s gender g ∈ f f ;mg and on the level of com- petition l in the classroom. Increases in the level of competition will de- crease the marginal cost of studying if students enjoy competition. Sup- pose that in the absence of competition ðat l 5 0Þ, males and females have the same cost functions: Cf ðe; a; 0Þ5Cmðe; a; 0Þ5Cðe; a; 0Þ: Therefore, females and males are expected to exert the same level of effort and perform equally for a given a—they have the same knowledge pro- duction and cost functions at l 5 0. Assume that males enjoy an increase in the level of competition more than females, in the sense that the marginal cost of effort decreases more for males as the level of competition increases:14 yC2f ðe; a; lÞ yeyl &gt; yC2mðe; a; l Þ yeyl : Now, the university grades its students according to the following scheme: Gðe; a; l Þ5 hl 1 llKðe; aÞ; where the university adjusts hl and ll to satisfy its bell curve marking scheme. In particular, the university is expected to increase the benefit to effort by increasing ll ðand to decrease hlÞ in a more competitive year.15 14 The results are exactly the same if they dislike competition less than females. 15 In app. B, secs. B.1 and B.2, I present a model that shows the impact of in- creased competition on the effort incentives set by a university that grades on a bell curve. I show that under mild conditions ðdepending on the complementarity between effort and abilityÞ, the university will increase ll as competition for uni- versity admission increases.

Figure 3 illustrates how female and male levels of effort will change following an increase in the level of competi- tion. The details relating to this comparative statics exercise are in appen- dix B. FIG. 3.—Increased competition and effort level 456 Morin First, recall that in the absence of competition ðat l 5 0Þ, females and males are assumed to have the same knowledge production and cost functions. Therefore, in the absence of competition, females and males will both choose an effort level equal to e*ða, l 5 0Þ. An increase in competition will affect both the marginal benefit ðby increasing llÞ and the marginal cost of exerting effort. The increase in marginal benefit will be the same for females and males, but the change in marginal cost will differ if males enjoy competition more than females. More specifically, males will experience a more pronounced rightward shift of their marginal cost curve than females. Consequently, male effort will shift from e*ða; l 5 0Þ to e*mða; l &gt; 0Þ, while female effort level will only shift from e*ða; l 5 0Þ to e*f ða; l &gt; 0Þ, as in figure 3. Under these circumstances, an increase in competition is expected to differentially affect the effort level of females and males. IV. Data In order to look at the effect of the increased competition in university classrooms on academic performance, I focus on students who enrolled at the University of Toronto—one of the largest universities in North America. I use an administrative data set provided by the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science that is composed of first-year stu- dents who started in Arts and Science in September 2001 or September 2003.16 In 2010, close to 22,000 undergraduate full-time students were attending University of Toronto’s Faculty of Arts and Science, making it the largest faculty of the University. The Faculty of Arts and Science combines three features necessary for analyzing the effect of competition on grades. First, and most important, the institution analyzed must grade its students based ðat least implicitlyÞ on a bell curve. Unlike a number of Ontario university faculties, the Faculty of Arts and Science had specific guidelines for the marks distri- bution, clearly suggestive of a bell curvemarking scheme.17 Second, the fac- ulty has large introductory classes—many of these classes are compulsory ðfor a given programÞ, and some of them have more than 1,000 students— making it possible to get relatively precise estimates. Third, most study 16 For related studies using college administrative data, see Sacerdote ð2001Þ using Dartmouth College data; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner ð2006Þ using Berea College data; Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos ð2009Þ, Hoffmann and Oreopoulos ð2009a, 2009bÞ, and Lindo, Sanders, and Oreopoulos ð2010Þ using data from a large Canadian university. 17 Until 2009, in the “Academic Handbook: Course Information for Instruc- tors” that was available on the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science website ðhttp://www.artsci.utoronto.caÞ, we could read that, although not required, experience suggests that there will normally be between 5% and 25% of A’s, not over 75% of combined A’s and B’s, and not over 20% of combined E’s and F’s in large classes. Since 2009, the marks distribution guidelines are slightly broader. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 457 subjects offered by the faculty were not affected by the Ontario second- ary school reform.18 This is not the case with other faculties. The data come from two sources of information that were linked us- ing students’ identification numbers: preuniversity admission information and university academic histories. The university academic history con- tains ðiÞ the numerical grades for all Arts and Science courses that the stu- dent completed, ðiiÞ the list of courses that the student dropped ðalong with the dates these courses were droppedÞ, and ðiiiÞ a dummy variable, “on-time graduation,” indicating whether the student had graduated from the university by July 1 of his/her fourth year ðe.g., July 1, 2007 for 2003 studentsÞ. The main dependent variable consists of individual course grades, on a 100-point scale. I focus on performance in larger classrooms ði.e., with at least 30 studentsÞ since bell curve marking in smaller classrooms is less likely and this type of marking scheme is assumed to be a driving factor behind my results. About 90% of first-year grades come from these larger sections. As a robustness check, I present the results from smaller class- rooms in Section VI.C. I also look at a student’s first-year ðcredit-weightedÞ averages ðon a 100-point scaleÞ, GPA, dropped courses, credit accumu- lation, and “on-time graduation.”19 Although I eventually look at student performance from the first through fourth university years, I concentrate the analysis on first-year performance. An obvious advantage of doing so is that it mitigates much of the potential impact of course selection, as many first-year courses are, as noted, compulsory given a specific program of study. A nice feature of the data is that they contain preuniversity admission information for students who applied to the Faculty of Arts and Science, regardless of whether their application was accepted or rejected. Hence, this information will be used not only to control for students’ backgrounds but also to look for evidence of increased competition in university ad- 18 The compression of the Ontario secondary school curriculum affected the delivery of material for some subjects and not others. For example, the mathemat- ics curriculum was affected, while the biology curriculum was not ðMorin 2013Þ. See King et al. ð2002, 2004, 2005Þ and Morin ð2013Þ for more details. As explained below, all mathematics courses are excluded from the analysis. 19 Students earn 0.5 credits for successfully completing a 1-semester course and a 1.0 credit for successfully completing a 2-semester course. As students take 1- and 2-semester courses, the student’s first year average is weighted by the credit units. I computed first-year averages for all students for which I observe at least two numerical grades by the end of the first year. I consider that students who report grades under 30% have, in fact, dropped the course. These course outcomes will be used, with the courses that were officially dropped, to see whether females ðor malesÞ were more likely to drop courses ðor “stop competing”Þ in 2003. As discussed in Sec. VII.A, including these grades would actually make my results slightly stronger. 458 Morin missions. This information will also be crucial to investigate whether fe- males tried to avoid the increased competition ðmore thanmalesÞ by choos- ing less competitive programs or simply by not applying/enrolling to the university in 2003, which is plausible if one thinks that females are more likely to “shy away from competition” ðNiederle and Vesterlund 2007Þ. For each applicant, I have the following information: a student iden- tification number, the applicant’s high school average, his/her year and month of birth, his/her gender, the name of the school attended by the applicant, the faculty program applied to ðcommerce, computer science, humanities and social sciences, or life scienceÞ, and his/her application status ðenrolled, accepted, canceled, or refusedÞ.20 I restrict the sample to Ontario high school graduates born in 1984 and 1985 for the 2003 student cohort and in 1982 for the 2001 cohort in order to avoid having the results affected by older students.21 Out-of-province students and students who already had some university experience be- fore applying to the faculty will be used in Section VII.C for robustness checks.22 The data contain an indicator of the secondary school curriculum ðgrade 12 or grade 13Þ the student graduated from. The G12/G13 indi- cator is necessary for performing the analysis with or without G12 stu- dents. There are pros and cons to including G12 students in the sam- ple. Focusing on G13 students ðexcluding G12 students from the sampleÞ guarantees that, aside from potential differences in academic ability, stu- dents from 2001 and 2003 should be quite similar in terms of academic background ðe.g., they come from the same secondary school programÞ and other dimensions such as maturity—since students have the same age. But, if grade 13 had a significant impact on students’ university prepa- ration and if gender composition differs across G12 and G13, then not including G12 students could overestimate or underestimate the effect of the double cohort on gender differences in performance. In addition, Morin ð2013Þ presents evidence that G12 students who entered university 20 Students interested in a specific study program offered by the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science have first to apply to one of the following general programs: commerce, computer science, humanities and social sciences, or life science. Enrolled status entails application acceptance ðfrom the facultyÞ and the student choosing to enroll. 21 The birthday cutoff date for primary school enrollment is December 31 in Ontario. Hence, students from the first G12 cohort are supposed to be born in 1985, while students from the last cohort of the G13 program should be born in 1984. As a robustness check, I also estimated the regression model including older students. The inclusion of these students does not affect the results. 22 Preadmission information frommany out-of-province students is missing, since they do not necessarily apply through the same process as Ontario high school grad- uates. Admission information for these out-of-province students is kept by the col- leges to which they applied to and not by the Faculty of Arts and Science. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 459 in 2003 were better-than-average students. If this is the case, and if the gender composition differs across G12 and G13 students, then exclud- ing G12 students could also result in biased estimation of the competition effect even if we assume no difference in university preparation across cur- ricula. For this reason, the estimations were all done with and without G12 students. Results show that including or excluding G12 students give very similar estimates. Finally, the secondary school mathematics curriculum was clearly af- fected by the reform ðMorin 2013Þ. Since female and male students might have reacted differently to the change in the mathematics curriculum, all mathematics courses were excluded from the analysis.23 This should mit- igate any potential bias due to differences across G12 and G13 university preparation. In practice, however, including mathematics performance in the university average does not affect my results. The drop between 2001 and 2003 in the enrollment/application ratio presented in table 1 already suggests a significant impact of the double cohort on university admission. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics used to look at the effect of increased competition on student university performance. The key point coming out of panel A is that the double cohort sig- nificantly increased competition for university admission and the quality ðbased on students’ high school averagesÞ of enrolled students. The aver- age high school grade increased by 2.6 percentage points between 2001 and 2003. This difference is statistically significant and considerable—repre- senting an increase of close to 55%of a standard deviation ðrelative to 2001Þ. The increase in student quality between 2001 and 2003 can be illustrated by comparing the distributions of enrolled students’ high school averages. The top panel of figure 4 plots estimated densities of high school averages for students enrolled at the Faculty of Arts and Science in 2001 and 2003. Clearly students enrolled in 2003 have higher high school averages than students who enrolled in 2001. What further suggests that competition increased in university class- room is the use of bell curve grading at the university. The university average was around 70% in 2001 and increased by about 1.4 percentage points ðless than 15% of a standard deviationÞ in 2003. As can be seen from the bottom panel of figure 4, this increase is significantly less ðin absolute or relative termsÞ than the increase in high school averages, suggesting that it became harder to get higher grades. Credit accumulation and “on- time graduation” rates also suggest a modest performance increase be- tween 2001 and 2003. In sum, evidence from figure 4 and tables 1 and 2 23 There is a large literature on the gender gap in mathematics. Interested readers should consult Ellison and Swanson ð2010Þ, Fryer and Levitt ð2010Þ, and Niederle and Vesterlund ð2010Þ for recent developments in the topic. 460 Morin all suggest that competition in classrooms increased significantly as a con- sequence of the double cohort. As expected, G12 students are on average exactly 1 year younger than G13 students ðsee panel A of table 2Þ. The student population is composed of a majority of females, comprising more than 60% of the population. Of note, the proportion of female students did not change significantly between 2001 and 2003. This is important evidence, especially if one is con- cerned that there could be significant gender differences in the taste for com- petition. Panel B of table 2 presents the proportions of female students by high school average quartile to further investigate whether there were signifi- cant changes in the female representation. Females tend to be slightly less present in the bottom quartile. There was, however, no drastic change in the female representation by quartile between 2001 and 2003. This is especially true if we compare the 2001 and 2003 G13 students. This is im- Table 2 Descriptive Statistics 2001 2003 G13 G12 G13 A.

V. Estimation The main estimation strategy used to gauge the effect of increased com- petition on gender performance differences is captured by the following ex- tension of equation ð3Þ:24 Ui;t 5 a1 gHi 1 dMalei 1 pDCt 1 rðDCt HiÞ 1 bðDCt MaleiÞ1 X iG1 qi;t: ð5Þ 24 Quantile regressions are also estimated in Sec. VI.B to investigate the pos- sibility of heterogeneous effects of competition on the university performance dis- tribution. FIG. 4.—High school average and university first-year average distributions of enrolled students in 2001 and 2003. 462 Morin In this equation Ui,t is a university performance measure ðthe student’s uni- versity average, the number of university credits earned, or on-time grad- uationÞ. The main outcome of interest is a student’s performance in a large first-year university courseUi,t,c ðwhere c stands for a specific courseÞ. For this specific outcome, equation ð5Þ is augmented with course fixed effects, wc. One of the main benefits of looking at first-year performance is that dur- ing this year the choice of courses is not as important as for later years, which can mitigate potential course selection issues. Furthermore, first- year courses usually have very high enrollments, as mentioned above. The variable Hi is a measure of student ability ðhigh school averageÞ, while Malei and DCt are a male dummy variable and a double cohort year dummy, respectively. Finally, Xi is a vector of other personal characteris- tics. The coefficient of interest is b, which represents the difference, across genders, in the effect of the double cohort. The coefficients p and r will capture common effects ðto males and femalesÞ of the increased competi- tion. Notice that the estimates of p and r are expected to be negative and positive, respectively ðas in eq. ½3Þ. The coefficient d allows one to test whether ðceteris paribusÞ males perform better than females at the univer- sity. Vector Xi will consist of controls like program fixed effects and age, which will be added to the equation in some specifications. Controlling for age could be useful when including G12 students in the analysis. VI. Results A. Competition and First-Year Performance Figure 5 shows the evolution of the university’s first-year average dis- tributions between 2001 and 2003 for males and females separately, already pointing to gender differences in response to the increased competition following the double cohort. First, the top panel of figure 5 shows that male and female pre–double cohort ð2001Þ performance distributions are similar. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for equality of distributions sug- gests that the two distributions are identical. Things are different in 2003. We see a clear shift to the right for both males and females ðin the bot- tom panelÞ, suggesting that the unconditional student performance increased in 2003. More important, the distributional shift for males is more pro- nounced—the male and female performance distributions are now statis- tically different. Interestingly, when comparing the female and male 2003 performance distributions, the male distribution looks, more or less, like a translation ðto the rightÞ of the female distribution. Although figure 5 only plots “unconditional” performance distributions, the regression results presented in table 3 and the quantile regression results presented in Sec- tion VI.B will support the idea that the difference in the shifts in perfor- mance distributions captures the effect of the increased competition ðas op- posed to changes in student characteristicsÞ. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 463 Table 3 presents results from estimating the course-level version of equa- tion ð5Þ with a course grade ðon a 100-point scaleÞ as the dependent variable for different sets of controls and for different subsamples. The results in table 3 will shed light on ðiÞ whether it became harder to get high grades as a consequence of the double cohort ði.e., whether the university graded on a bell curveÞ and ðiiÞ whether ðon averageÞ males’ performance significantly improved relative to females. Columns 1–3 of table 3 only include students who graduated from the G13 program, while columns 4–6 also include students who graduated from the G12 program. The effect of the increased competition on the uni- versity grading policy slope and intercept coefficients ðp and r in eq. ½5Þ are captured by “Double cohort” and “High school average  Double cohort,” respectively. “Male  Double cohort” gives an estimate of the difference across genders in the effect of the increased competition ðbÞ. Results in column 1 of table 3 do not include any personal character- istics aside from students’ high school average and gender.

These results suggest that uni- versity grades did not fully adjust for the increased quality of students in their classrooms. This is to be expected if we think that many universities recommend implicitly or explicitly using a bell curve marking scheme. Not surprisingly, the effect of the double cohort on university grades is statistically significant. An “average” 2003 female student—with an 88% high school average—had a 1.56 percentage point ðabout 0.17 SDÞ disad- vantage when compared to a similar student who entered the university in 2001.25 The estimated change in the gender performance gap due to the increased competition ð1.06 percentage pointsÞ is statistically significant at the 1% level, but modest ð0.114 SDÞ, suggesting that males coped better with the in- creased competition than females. These results are in line with the find- ings of Gneezy et al. ð2003Þ and Gneezy and Rustichini ð2004Þ. Note that, contrary to Gneezy et al. ð2003Þ and Gneezy and Rustichini ð2004Þ, I can only measure a relative ðas opposed to absoluteÞ change in performance due to the increased competition since the university seems to be grading on a bell curve ðgiven the estimated coefficients for r and pÞ. The effect of the double cohort varies significantly across the student population. For example, imagine two female students, one with a high school average one standard deviation ð4.4 percentage pointsÞ below and the other with a one standard deviation above the 2003 mean high school average ð88%Þ. The student below the mean would have had a 2.05 per- centage point disadvantage from being part of the double cohort. For the student above the mean, the disadvantage would be significantly smaller ð1.02 percentage pointsÞ. Controlling for course fixed effects and age ðcols. 2 and 3 of table 3Þ does not alter the findings. The coefficients estimates on “High school average” and “Male Double cohort” are very stable across specifications. Finally, the age effect is statistically significant but modest and negative: when comparing the youngest and oldest students coming out of the G13 pro- gram, we expect the youngest students to have a 0.78 percentage point advantage over the oldest. Columns 4–6 of table 3 replicate the estimates in columns 1–3, using the complete sample of Ontario students, including both G13 and G12 stu- dents. The inclusion of G12 students does not affect the estimated impact 25 88  0.117 2 11.86 ≈ 2 1.56. The null hypothesis H0: p1 88r5 0 is rejected at a 1% confidence level. In order to convert the effect in terms of standard de- viations, I use the 2001 university average standard deviation ð9.30Þ as found in table 2: 21.56/9.3 5 20.168. 466 Morin of increased competition on the gender difference in performance; it re- mains around 1 percentage point. One might think that the effect is modest enough not to have any im- pact on students’ grade point averages ðGPAsÞ. Using student GPA ðon a 4-point scaleÞ or a credit-weighted average ðon a 100-point scaleÞ as the dependent variable gives results very similar to the ones presented in ta- ble 3. The estimates for “Male  Double cohort” when using students’ credit-weighted averages fluctuate between 1.03 and 1.13 points and be- tween 0.08 and 0.10 GPA points when using students’ GPAs ðor between 0.10 and 0.11 SDsÞ. These results are presented in tables A1 and A2 in appendix A, respectively. In the end, all three measures of university per- formance ði.e., course-level performance, GPA, credit-weighted averageÞ suggest that male students coped better with the increased competition than females. B. Heterogeneity The least-squares regressions capture the effect of increased competi- tion on the average female-male performance difference. Although infor- mative, they may mask important heterogeneity in the impact of com- petition. The least-squares estimates could, for example, be driven by a specific group of students, such as male students in the upper tail of the performance distribution, who react more to competition than the rest of the student population. In this case, the increased competition would af- fect the shape of the performance distribution. In order to investigate this possibility, I estimated equation ð5Þ using a quantile regression methodol- ogy proposed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux ð2009Þ and where the de- pendent variable is students’ first-year ðcredit-weightedÞ averages ðthe av- erages plotted in fig. 5Þ. This methodology allows one to estimate the impact of “Male  Double cohort” on the quantiles of the unconditional university performance distribution, shedding light on a possible increase in performance dispersion due to the increased competition. Figure 6 plots the quantile regression “Male  DC” estimates for the 5th to the 95th quantiles and its 90% confidence interval band.26 The ef- fect of competition on the gender performance gap seems relatively stable over the performance distribution, as the least-squares point estimate is covered by the entire quantile regression band. What is clear from the quan- tile regression results is that the estimated effects of the increased competi- tion on the gender performance gap found above are not overwhelmingly driven by effects at specific points ðsay top or bottomÞ of the university performance distribution. They further suggest that the difference in the shift in performance distributions found in figure 5 is a reasonable illustra- 26 The 90% confidence band is based on bootstrapped standard errors. The stan- dard errors of each quantile are obtained from 500 replications. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 467 tion of the impact of the increased competition on the gender performance gap.27 C. Smaller Sections Evidence from table 3 suggests that instructors graded on a bell curve in large classes—recall that the sign of coefficient estimates for “Double cohort” and “High school average  Double cohort” are in line with bell curve marking. I argue earlier that this bell curve marking combined with the increased quality of students gave rise to an increase in the level of classroom competition. However, we should not expect the same kind of effects in smaller classes, as the suggested grading scheme ðsee footnote 17Þ was intended for larger classes ðe.g., those with more than 20–30 studentsÞ. Therefore, the increase in competition for grades should be lower in smaller classes, and we should expect the effect of the double cohort on the gender performance gap to be minimal. In order to investigate whether there was evidence of bell curve mark- ing in smaller classrooms, and also to see whether I find any evidence of a double-cohort effect on the gender performance gap, I reestimated 27 An alternative, albeit more restrictive, strategy to investigate the possibility of heterogeneous effects is to add interaction terms ði.e., “Male High school average  Double cohort,” with and without “Male  High school”Þ to eq. ð5Þ. The param- eter estimates of these interaction terms are always small and statistically insignifi- cant at conventional confidence levels. FIG. 6.—Quantile regression estimates 468 Morin equation ð5Þ but used only grades from sections with fewer than 30 stu- dents.28 Appendix table A3 does not suggest that instructors mark on a bell curve in these smaller classes: the coefficient estimates for “Double cohort” and “High school average  Double cohort” are small in magni- tude ðcompared to the ones found in table 3Þ, and they have the opposite signs that we would expect if instructors were to grade on a bell curve. Table A3 suggests not only that instructors do not grade on a bell curve but also that the increased student quality did not affect the gender perfor- mance gap in these smaller classes: the coefficient estimates for “Male  Double cohort” are all small, fluctuating between 20.166 and 0.271, and they are statistically insignificant. The combination of these two findings support the idea that bell curve marking could be a crucial driving factor behind the change in the gender performance gap observed following the double cohort—when there is an increase in student quality. VII. Selection Issues The results presented so far suggest that male students coped better with the increased competition than females. These results do not take into account the possibility that students are more or less free to drop out of courses/programs and to enroll and to apply to the university, or that competition might have increased not only in universities but in sec- ondary schools as well. This section investigates self-selection problems and looks at the potential consequences of increased competition at the secondary school level on the estimates presented so far. I start by consid- ering the possibility that males dropped out of courses disproportionately more than females as a consequence of the double cohort, which would ðprobablyÞ lead me to overestimate the gender difference in performance in 2003. Next, I use the available admissions data to investigate any gen- der differences in the enrollment or application decisions—the admis- sions data allow me to observe any student who applied to the Faculty of Arts and Science ðwhether they were accepted or notÞ. I also look at pre–university competition and its potential impact on the link between students’ ability and their high school averages ðthe ability measure used in this paperÞ. A. Dropouts If there are important gender differences when it comes to dropping a course, then the estimates presented above may overestimate or underesti- mate the full impact of the increased competition on university performance. 28 The class size cutoff was put at 30 students per section, instead of 20, to have a decent number of observations when running the regressions while having a class size small enough not to expect bell curve marking: 11.1% of first-year grades come from sectionswith fewer than 30 students, while only 4.7% come from sectionswith fewer than 20 students. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 469 If, for example, the 2003 male students who were more adversely affected by the increased competition dropped out of courses in a disproportionate way relative to their female counterparts, then the findings presented in Section VI.A could overestimate the gender performance differential— the results could be due to selection. In order to investigate this issue, I looked at individual courses, and I constructed a dummy variable equal to one if a course was dropped, and zero otherwise.29 I then estimated a linear probability model, using the same six specifications used to estimate the effect of competition on grades to test whether female and male drop- out decisions were affected differently by the increased competition. Table 4 shows that males did not drop out more than females when facing increased competition, supporting the idea that the gender differ- ences found above are not due to omitting students who failed to complete courses. The double cohort did increase the percentage of courses being dropped, all else equal: the estimated increase in dropout rates for an “aver- age” student is between 1.2 and 2.4 percentage points.30 This is signifi- cant since dropped courses represent about 8% of observed course out- comes in the sample. Overall, results from table 4 do not suggest that the results presented in table 3 are due to gender differences in the dropping out decision process. B. Participation The experimental economics literature suggests not only that males per- form better when faced with more intense competition than females but also that females might shy away from it.31 If a disproportionate number of females avoided the double cohort ðe.g., by delaying their university ap- 29 Note that courses for which the final grade is below 30% are also considered as dropped. Adding these grades to the sample analyzed in table 3 would make the estimates for “Male  Double cohort” slightly larger—the estimates being around 1.2–1.3 points. 30 Although the parameter estimates for “Double cohort” and “High school average  Double cohort” are not individually statistically significant when look- ing at G12 and G13 students, the null hypothesis H0: p1 88r5 0 is rejected at a 10% confidence level under every specification. 31 Experimental studies such as Niederle and Vesterlund ð2007Þ and Gupta, Poul- sen, and Villeval ð2013Þ find that males are more inclined to participate in compet- itive activities. Flory, Leibbrandt, and List ð2010Þ suggest that this gender differ- ence also holds in a natural environment. Dohmen and Falk ð2011Þ suggest that risk attitudes play a role in explaining this finding, while Gneezy, Leonard, and List ð2009Þ and Booth and Nolen ð2012Þ suggest that the role of nurture is important in this context. Interestingly, Gneezy et al. ð2009Þ and Andersen et al. ð2013Þ find that females’ and males’ tastes for competition differ when we are looking at a patriar- chal or a matrilineal society. Males are more competitive than females in a patriar- chal society, while it is not the case in a matrilineal society. See Croson and Gneezy ð2009Þ and Niederle and Vesterlund ð2011Þ for more complete ðand more generalÞ discussions of gender differences in preferences. 470 Morin plicationÞ, and if these females would have been more adversely affected by the increased competition, then the estimates presented in table 3 might underestimate the impact of competition on the performance gap. In order to investigate this possibility, table 5 presents numbers on the proportion of female students by status ðapplied and enrolledÞ and by year. Both the proportions of female applicants ðpanel AÞ and the proportions of female among enrolled students ðpanel BÞ suggest that females did not try to avoid the double cohort more than males. Whether I look at the female propor- tions among all students or by quartiles ðbased on high school averageÞ, I do not see any economically or statistically significant differences in the pro- portions of female applicants or enrolled students. These results are not sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of G12 students. The cost of delaying university enrollment by a year might be large compared to the cost of en- tering a more competitive environment, which could explain why we do not see changes in the female proportions of applicants and enrolled students between 2001 and 2003. Figure 1 suggests that 2002 was not a typical year in terms of university applications, which is why I use 2001 ðnot 2002Þ as a control year in my regression analysis. Nevertheless, the 2002 data can be used to further investigate whether relatively more females tried to avoid the double co- hort. This is not the case: the female proportion among fast-trackers de- Table 4 Impact of the Double Cohort on Dropped Courses G13 Students Only G12 and G13 Students ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ ð4Þ ð5Þ ð6Þ High school average 2.007*** 2.007*** 2.007*** 2.007*** 2.007*** 2.007*** ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ Double cohort .214** .222** .218** .086 .090 .089 ð.100Þ ð.102Þ ð.101Þ ð.079Þ ð.077Þ ð.077Þ Male .007 1.26e-4 -4.05e-4 .007 4.37e-4 7.08e-05 ð.008Þ ð.006Þ ð.006Þ ð.008Þ ð.006Þ ð.006Þ High school average  Double cohort 2.002** 2.002** 2.002** 2.001 2.001 .001 ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ ð.001Þ Male  Double cohort 2.001 .002 .002 2.006 2.003 2.004 ð.008Þ ð.008Þ ð.008Þ ð.008Þ ð.008Þ ð.008Þ Age .025*** .017*** ð.006Þ ð.004Þ Course fixed effects No Yes Yes No Yes Yes Number of observations 19,793 19,793 19,793 27,640 27,640 27,640 R2 .021 .019 .020 .019 .016 .017 NOTE.—The table reports the estimates of regressions of a dummy dependent variable equal to one if the course was dropped, zero otherwise, using a linear probability model.

Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 471 creased by ða non–statistically significantÞ 1.9 percentage points between 2001 and 2002, and it stayed virtually unchanged for the general student population. Another way female students could have tried to avoid the in- creased competition is by enrolling in programs that were “less competi- tive.” Looking at the proportion of female students per program across time does not suggest that this is cause for concern. The only program for which the proportion of female students changed significantly between 2001 and 2003 is computer science. Unfortunately, a couple of specializa- tions that were associated with computer science in 2001 were associated with life science in 2003, making it impossible to knowwhether the change in the female proportion was due to the double cohort or the change in program. In any case, this change should not affect my results. This pro- gram is the smallest in terms of enrollment—470 students out of the 6,000 observed in this paper are enrolled in computer science—and it has the smallest proportion of female students ðaround 23%Þ. C. Preuniversity Competition Results presented so far assume that a student’s high school grade is a good indicator of academic ability. Since students knew ðsince 1997Þ that university admissions would be more competitive in 2003 than in previous years, it is possible that they reacted by studying more in high school. The competition level would therefore not only increase at the university but also prior to attendance at the university. In this case, the link between Table 5 Female Participation by Student Status and Year Student Status Number of Students Female Proportion Difference in Proportions ð%2003 2 %2001Þ2001 2003 2001 2003 A.

The quartiles are based on the distributions of student high school averages. The last column presents the difference in female student proportion and results from testing the null hypothesis of equal proportions across years against the alternative hypothesis that they are different. None of these differences are statistically significant at conventional confidence levels. 472 Morin academic ability and high school grades might have changed between 2001 and 2003, representing a potential source of bias for the estimator. Two scenarios must be considered. First, assume that competition was intense at the high school level, which stimulated males more than females, as suggested by the exper- imental economics literature, resulting in males outperforming females with similar academic ability. Consequently, 2003 male academic ability could be overestimated by the male high school average, which would then translate into underestimating the impact of increased competition on the gender university-performance gap. This situation should not be a major concern, since I already find a positive effect, and it would only make it larger. The second scenario would be that females were actually more stim- ulated by the increased high school competition than males. This seems unlikely given that table 3 suggests that males increased their university performance relative to females in the more competitive year. Never- theless, it is still be possible in principle that females were more stim- ulated by competition both in high school and at the university. For that to be true, and to find a positive coefficient to “Male  Double cohort”— as I do—females’ high school performance would have to have improved significantly more than their university performance. The 2003 female high school average would have to severely overestimate ability. In this case, the 2003 high school average could overestimate females’ ability, which would result in overestimating the impact of increased competi- tion on the gender university-performance gap. I investigate this possibility by reestimating the regressions presented in table 3 but using only students whose ability measurement is not likely to have been affected by the double cohort ði.e., out-of-province students and students that attended a university prior to the University of To- rontoÞ. The results are very similar to the ones using Ontario secondary school students. In particular, the coefficient estimates for “Male  Dou- ble cohort,” although imprecise, fluctuate between 0.70 ðwhen not con- trolling for course fixed effects or ageÞ and 3.2 ðwhen controlling for course fixed effects, but not for ageÞ. This finding supports the idea that the esti- mates presented in table 3 are not driven by Ontario female student aca- demic ability being significantly overestimated in 2003.32 32 As an additional robustness check, I reestimated the regressions presented in table 3 on a pooled sample of Ontario and out-of-province students and stu- dents who attended a university prior to the University of Toronto. Using a full set of dummy variables and interaction terms ði.e., using a triple-difference estimation approachÞ, I test whether the academic ability of Ontario female students is sig- nificantly overestimated in 2003 ðrelative to Ontario male studentsÞ. If this is the case, then the coefficient estimate of an interaction term between an Ontario sec- Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 473 VIII. After the First Year Results from table 3 suggest that the increased competition following the Ontario double cohort had an impact on the gender gap in first-year university performance. I now show that the double cohort actually af- fected the performance gap during most of these students’ undergraduate years. Table 6 presents estimates of the competition effect on the gender performance gap for students’ first ðyear 1Þ to fourth year ðyear 4Þ at the university. Estimates next to “Year 1” are taken from table 3. The esti- mation strategy is exactly the same as the one used above except that the dependent variables are students’ upper-year course grades. Aside from a small drop for students’ third year, the effect of increased competition is surprisingly stable across years. The estimated coefficients using stu- dents’ fourth-year grades vary between 0.75 and 1.08 when controlling for course fixed effects, being close to the ones obtained using students’ first- year grades. Despite being of modest size initially, the competition effect could accumulate over time, affecting the gender gap in attrition rates, in credit accumulation, and, ultimately, in on-time graduation rates. I now turn to these. A. Attrition From year to year, the sample size of observed students decreases, as can be seen in table 6. Some students will change their program, change their university, or simply quit. If males and females differ in their deci- sion to stay in school ðor in the facultyÞ, the estimates found in table 6 could misrepresent the evolution of the competition effect. In particular, if some females were forced to quit school due to bad performances in their first year, then the results from table 6 might be underestimating the effect of competition on the gender performance gap. Table 7 inves- tigates this possibility. Using an estimation strategy similar to the one above, I regress ðusing a linear probability modelÞ a dummy variable equal to one if the student dropped out of the sample after 1, 2, or 3 years, respectively. Eighteen estimates of the “Male  Double cohort” parameter are presented in table 7. Most of the estimates are small and all are statistically insignif- icant. Some estimates ðe.g., based on G13 students observed after 2 yearsÞ, although not statistically significant, are not small when compared to the attrition rate. Note that these ðlarger but impreciseÞ estimates are all nega- tive, suggesting, if anything, that males might have dropped out of the sample ondary school dummy ðsay “ON”Þ and “Male  Double cohort” would be signifi- cantly different from zero. The coefficient estimate of this interaction term, although imprecise, is very close to zero in all specifications. This further suggests that the academic ability of Ontario female students is not significantly overestimated in 2003. 474 Morin T ab le 6 E vo lu ti on of th e Im pa ct of th e D ou bl e C oh or t on th e G en de r P er fo rm an ce G ap G 13 St u d en ts O n ly G 12 an d G 13 St u d en ts ð1 Þ ð2 Þ ð3 Þ ð4 Þ ð5 Þ ð6 Þ ða ÞY ea r 1 1. 06 1* ** 1. 01 9* ** 1. 00 9* ** 1. 04 2* ** 1. 01 4* ** 1. 01 5* ** ð.3 62 Þ ð.3 48 Þ ð.3 45 Þ ð.3 41 Þ ð.3 42 Þ ð.3 41 Þ N u m b er o f st u d en ts 4, 29 8 4, 29 8 4, 29 8 6, 00 0 6, 00 0 6, 00 0 ðb ÞY ea r 2 1. 03 6* ** 1. 03 5* ** 1. 00 3* ** .9 50 ** * .9 74 ** * .9 85 ** * ð.3 40 Þ ð.3 13 Þ ð.3 10 Þ ð.2 97 Þ ð.2 67 Þ ð.2 65 Þ N u m b er o f st u d en ts 3, 90 8 3, 90 8 3, 90 8 5, 46 6 5, 46 6 5, 46 6 ðcÞ Y ea r 3 .8 01 ** * .8 21 ** * .8 09 ** * .9 18 ** * .8 84 ** * .8 93 ** * ð.3 09 Þ ð.3 11 Þ ð.3 11 Þ ð.2 87 Þ ð.2 85 Þ ð.2 86 Þ N u m b er o f st u d en ts 3, 40 9 3, 40 9 3, 40 9 4, 84 7 4, 84 7 4, 84 7 ðd ÞY ea r 4 1. 77 4* ** 1. 05 5* ** 1. 07 7* ** 1. 26 0* ** .7 53 ** * .7 85 ** * ð.3 03 Þ ð.2 85 Þ ð.2 84 Þ ð.2 68 Þ ð.2 50 Þ ð.2 49 Þ N u m b er o f st u d en ts 3, 14 6 3, 14 6 3, 14 6 4, 47 4 4, 47 4 4, 47 4 C o u rs e fi xe d ef fe ct s N o Y es Y es N o Y es Y es A ge co n tr o l N o N o Y es N o N o Y es N O T E .— T h e ta b le re p o rt s 24 co ef fi ci en t es ti m at es o f “M al e  D o u b le co h o rt ” fo r u n iv er si ty y ea rs 1– 4.

Overall, these results suggest that dropouts are not driv- ing the results in table 6. B. Credit Accumulation While not strong enough to affect important decisions like dropping out of university, the competition effect might have been strong enough to slow down students and affect credit accumulation and therefore the probability that they graduate on time. In order to better measure the magnitude of the long-lasting effect of competition on the gender per- formance gap, I now look at student credit accumulation. Table 8 pres- ents coefficient estimates for the effect of competition on the gender dif- ferential in credit accumulation. The number of credits accumulated after X years includes the number of credits earned during year X but also the number of credits earned over the previous years. Therefore, the esti- mated effects presented in table 8 should be seen as cumulative effects. The results in the top panel of table 8 suggest that if I look at all stu- dents, the effect of the increased competition on the gender performance gap was not strong enough to significantly affect the number of earned credits. The estimates for “Male  Double cohort” seem to increase in magnitude as we look at the effect after 3 and 4 years, though the stan- dard errors also become larger. The results are different if I concentrate on students with a high school average of 88% and below—students who Table 7 Impact of the Double Cohort on Attrition Rates Dependent Variable: Dropped from Sample G13 Students Only G12 and G13 Students ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ ð4Þ ð5Þ ð6Þ ðaÞ After 1 year 2.015 2.014 2.014 2.007 2.006 2.006 ð.018Þ ð.018Þ ð.018Þ ð.016Þ ð.016Þ ð.016Þ Attrition rate .091 .091 .091 .089 .089 .089 ðbÞ After 2 years 2.021 2.024 2.023 2.007 2.007 2.007 ð.025Þ ð.025Þ ð.025Þ ð.021Þ ð.021Þ ð.021Þ Attrition rate .207 .207 .207 .192 .192 .192 ðcÞ After 3 Years 2.003 22.89e-4 2.83e-4 .004 .009 .009 ð.028Þ ð.028Þ ð.028Þ ð.024Þ ð.024Þ ð.024Þ Attrition rate .268 .268 .268 .254 .254 .254 Number of observations 4,298 4,298 4,298 6,000 6,000 6,000 Program fixed effects No Yes Yes No Yes Yes Age control No No Yes No No Yes NOTE.—The table presents 18 coefficient estimates for “Male  Double cohort” capturing the effect of competition on the gender gap in the probability to drop out of the sample ðused in table A1Þ.

Robust standard errors are in parentheses. None of the parameter estimates are statistically significant at conventional confidence levels. 476 Morin are more likely to fail or drop a course. The bottom panel of table 8 clearly suggests that the double cohort affected the gender differential in credit accumulation among below-average students. The estimates for “Male  Double cohort” increase steadily as students progress toward graduation. By the end of their fourth year, male students will have accumulated between 0.6 and 1.0 credits ðmore than a “standard” 1-semester courseÞ than similar female classmates as a result of the increased competition. C. Graduation One final aspect of the academic performance that I consider is on-time graduation. As the effect of increased competition seems to be long-lasting, it could affect the probability that a student graduates on time ði.e., not later than during the summer following his/her fourth yearÞ.

Unfortunately, the data do not allow me to observe 2003 students after their fourth year. Estimates of the double cohort effect on the gender difference in the probability of graduating on time are statistically significant and large. They range from 6.4 to 8.1 per- centage points. To put the size of the estimates in perspective, about 40% of the students observed in table 3 graduated on time. Prior to the double cohort, male students were less likely to graduate on time than females, the difference being around 7–9 percentage points. This difference completely vanished for double cohort students.34 The estimates presented here must be interpreted with caution. As the abolition of grade 13 affected university admission standards in 2003, so it could affect the admission standards for graduate school in 2007. Hence, while part of the effect estimated here could be due to performance, it is also possible that these estimates are capturing the effect of strategic be- havior. Some students may have been tempted to delay graduate school ap- plications by a year. Asmentioned earlier, femalesmay not “embrace” com- petition as much as males. If graduate school–bound female students delayed ðmore than malesÞ their graduation to avoid the double cohort, part of the competition effect presented above would be due to this behavior. Note that this behavior is not likely to explain all of the effect, since only a fraction of undergraduate students will apply to graduate school. In order to have an idea of how much of the estimates found above could be due to strategic behavior, I estimated similar regressions as those presented in table 9 ex- cluding students with a high school average above 88% to concentrate on studentswho are less likely to apply to graduate school. The “MaleDouble cohort” coefficient estimates are actually larger for “lower-ability” students, as is the case for earned credits, suggesting that the results presented in table 9 are not due to such strategic behavior.35 Interestingly, changes in uncondi- tional on-time graduation proportions between 2001 and 2003 for females and males show that males’ on-time graduation rate increased significantly ðfrom 33.6% to 38.1%Þwhile females’ decreased slightly ð43.8%–41.4%Þ. While comparison of changes in unconditional on-time graduation rates 33 The results presented in table 9 are from linear probability models. The re- sults from estimating Probit models are very similar. 34 The null hypothesisH0: d1 b5 0 ði.e., that the sum of the “Male” and “Male Double cohort” coefficients is equal to zeroÞ is not rejected at conventional confi- dence levels in any of the six regressions. Note that the effect of the double cohort is not statistically significant based on the “Double cohort” and “High school average Double cohort” coefficient estimates. Once I drop the “High school average  Double cohort” variable from the regression, the “Double cohort” coefficient esti- mate changes to around20.1 and becomes statistically significant at 1%. The “Male Double cohort” coefficient estimate remains unchanged at around 0.07. These re- sults are not presented here but are available upon request. 35 Detailed results for higher- and lower-ability students are available upon request. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 479 suggest that males’ performance increased while females’ did not change, comparison of changes in conditional graduation rates ðresults from ta- ble 9Þ suggest that the females’ graduation rate was significantly ðnega- tivelyÞ affected by the increased competition while the males’ graduation rate was not. Overall, results from table 9 suggest that there is a clear dif- ference in the reaction to increased competition by females and males and that results from table 6 are not due to male students taking more time to graduate. IX. Conclusion This paper has provided new empirical evidence of gender performance differences in response to increased competition, focusing on long-term tasks carried out in a regular social environment: the university classroom. The exogenous increase in competition generated by the abolition of grade 13 allowed me to assess whether the findings from the experimental econom- ics literature carry over to tasks that a large fraction of individuals of a given age perform over an extended period and have strong incentives to care about. As such, this helps to link the experimental evidence to competitive gender differences in important life outcomes, including those in the labor market. My results indicate that gender differences in performance under in- creased competition do carry over to an important nonexperimental set- ting: performance while at the university. The estimated effects are modest in size but are precisely estimated, and they appear to persist: the increased competition had an economically significant positive impact on males’ on- time graduation rates, especially for below-average students. The evidence also supports the view that the results are due to differential changes in effort by gender, rather than self-selection, as indicated by findings regard- ing the decisions to apply to university, enroll if accepted, and drop out of courses/programs. ðThe modest nature of the differential effects on perfor- mance by gender helps explain why the self-selection effects are muted.Þ While the results point to differential effort changes by gender, the nature of the task studied in this paper also allows for competition to affect per- formance through a peer channel—an important feature of workplace en- vironments.36 The double cohort, combined with the limited capacity of universities to expand rapidly, increased the quality of admitted students, and so of peers. Hence, the estimates presented here are likely to capture the combined ðnetÞ effect of two potentially significant mechanisms by which competition could explain stylized facts about the labor market. If female students benefit more from higher-quality peers, as suggested by recent evi- dence in Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner ð2006Þ, then my results are more 36 See Epple and Romano ð2011Þ and Sacerdote ð2011Þ for recent literature re- views on peer effects in postsecondary education. 480 Morin surprising, as they would represent conservative estimates of the impact of increased competition on the male-female performance differential. Still finding a significant increased-competition impact suggests that the “pure” competition effect due to changes in effort could be more important than the peer effect in explaining gender differences in performance. The results from this study have several implications. First, they indi- cate that male and female performance responds differently to an increase in competition for regular everyday tasks that are long-lasting and for which the outcomes matter to participants. This underlines the potential for competition to explain some of the gender inequality found in the labor market. The results also have implications for the delivery of education ðe.g., single-sex vs. coed schoolingÞ and for student achievement assess- ment. In terms of the former, my results suggest that the optimal level of competition associated with classroom activities for student learning ðor effortÞ may be different for females and males and that one should take this finding into account when weighing the pros and cons of single-sex education. One advantage of single-sex classrooms ðor schoolsÞ would be to allow teachers to adjust the competition level according to the gender of the student body. In terms of the latter, the results suggest that performance assessment measures ðe.g., bell curve markingÞ found in many universities may not be gender-neutral: a given performance measure can favor females ðor malesÞ, depending on the level of competition inside the classroom. Such a find- ing naturally raises the question of whether we should expect similar re- sults for high school students who will not go to college—for potential high school dropouts in particular. If so, the performance assessment mea- sures could be made more “competitive” by grouping males ðwho represent the majority of high school dropoutsÞ together and using tournament-based evaluations or within-class ability streaming, without negatively affecting fe- male students. For future work, it would be interesting to investigate the effects of competition in university on gender differences in performance once in the labor market—beyond the scope of the data I analyze in this study. Doing so would speak even more directly to the relative importance of gender competition versus discrimination and occupational self-selection in explaining important gender differences in the labor market, referred to in the Introduction. It would also be interesting to explore the strength of gender differences in tasks where absolute, rather than relative, perfor- mance can be measured. This would help clarify whether, on the one hand, the cost of effort rose less for males relative to females, or on the other hand, it fell by more in more competitive environments. One could also examine possible gender effects for tasks where the role of peers is more rather than less important, building on the analysis in Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner ð2006Þ.

Appendix B Competition and Effort Here I develop some details regarding the model presented in Sec- tion III.B. Using equation ð4Þ, we can see that as the level of competition increases, effort will increase or decrease depending on whether students enjoy or dislike competition and on how the university changes the link between knowledge and grades: de*g dl 5 2 dll dl yKðe*g ; aÞ ye 2 y2Cgðe*g ; a; lÞ yeyl ll y2Kðe*g ; aÞ ye2 2 y2Cgðe*g ; a; lÞ ye2 : ðB1Þ The gender difference in the change in effort following an increase in the level of competition is given by: 484 Morin D de* dl jl50 5 y2Cmðe*m; a; 0Þ yeyl 2 dll dl yKðe*m; aÞ ye jl50 l0 y2Kðe*m; aÞ ye2 jl50 2 y2Cmðe*m; a; 0Þ ye2 2 y2Cf ðe*f ; a; 0Þ yeyl 2 dll dl yKðe*f ; aÞ ye jl50 l0 y2Kðe*f ; aÞ ye2 jl50 2 y2Cf ðe*f ; a; 0Þ ye2 : ðB2Þ In the absence of competition ðat l 5 0Þ, females and males are assumed to have the same knowledge production and cost functions, and there- fore exert the same level of effort, for a given level of ability ðaÞ. Hence, we can simplify equation ðB2Þ: D de* dl jl50 5 2 y2Cf ðe*; a; 0Þ yeyl 2 y2Cmðe*; a; 0Þ yeyl l0 y2Kðe*; aÞ ye2 jl50 2 y2Cðe*; a; 0Þ ye2 jl50 : ðB3Þ The concavity of the knowledge production function and the convexity of the cost function guarantee that the denominator of equation ðB3Þ is strictly negative. Therefore, the sign of equation ðB3Þ will be determined by whether males enjoy competition more than females. If males enjoy competition more ði.e., if yC2f ðe; a; lÞ=yeyl &gt; yC2mðe; a; lÞ=yeylÞ, we would expect to see their effort level and academic performance increase relative to females as competition increases. 1. Competition and Effort Incentives ðltÞ In this section, I illustrate the potential impact of increased competi- tion and bell curve marking on effort incentives. I abstract from potential gender differences in response to competition to concentrate on the ef- fect of competition on the effort incentives set by a university that grades on a bell curve. Imagine a student with ability a will exert effort e to acquire some knowledge, Kðe, aÞ. Assume that Kðe, aÞ is continuously differentiable, increasing and concave in a and e, and that the marginal benefit of effort increases with ability ði.e., y2Kðe; aÞ=yeya &gt; 0Þ. The cost of studying is given by a continuously differentiable function Cðe, aÞ ðin e and aÞ and increasing and convex in e. Further, assume that the marginal cost of effort is decreas- ing with ability ði.e., y2Cðe; aÞ=yeya &lt; 0Þ. Students expect the university to mark on a bell curve. More specifi- cally, they expect that, every year, the average grade in university will be Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 485 m5 ht 1 ltEðKðe; aÞjtÞ; ðB4Þ where EðKðe; aÞjtÞ is the average knowledge of students enrolled in year t. The variance of university grades is also expected to remain constant across time: j2 5 l2tVarðKðe; aÞjtÞ: ðB5Þ Students take the mean and the variance of knowledge ðEðKðe; aÞjtÞ and VarðKðe; aÞjtÞ as given ði.e., they do not think they can individually affect the average performance or its varianceÞ. We can rewrite equation ðB5Þ to see what will affect lt: l2t 5 j2 VarðKðe; aÞjtÞ : Therefore, lt is expected to increase as VarðKðe; aÞjtÞ decreases. In order to see what happens to VarðKðe; aÞjtÞ ðand ltÞ as competition increases, we must go back to the student utility maximization problem. Student utility is simply defined by the difference between his/her uni- versity grade and the effort he/she exerted. So his/her utility maximization problem is max e ht 1 ltKðe; aÞ2Cðe; aÞ: The first-order condition for this problem is lt yKðe*; aÞ ye 2 yCðe*; aÞ ye 5 0: ðB6Þ We can see that student effort will increase as lt increases. Importantly, we can use equation ðB6Þ to show that de* da 5 lt y2Kðe*; aÞ yeya 2 y2Cðe*; aÞ yeya y2Cðe*; aÞ ye2 2 lt y2Kðe*; aÞ ye2 &gt; 0: ðB7Þ That is, higher-ability students will exert more effort. Since de*=da is strictly positive and Cðe, aÞ and Kðe, aÞ are continuously differentiable, there is a one-to-one correspondence between a and e. We can therefore define HðaÞ; Kðe*ðaÞ; aÞ: Now we can look at what happens when competition for university admissions increases from one year to the other. It is easy to imagine that 486 Morin if high school grades are determined in a similar fashion to university grades, the ability threshold that determines whether a student is accepted at the university will go up during the more competitive year. Therefore, as competition for admission increases, the variance of university-student ability should decrease while their average ability will increase as uni- versities become more selective—the ability distribution is being trun- cated from below. We can see what will happen to the variance ofHðaÞ if the variance of a decreases, using a Taylor approximation: Var ½HðaÞjt ≈ ½H0ðEðaÞjtÞ2 1 VarðajtÞ: ðB8Þ Under mild conditions HðaÞ is concave.37 If HðaÞ is concave, then as com- petition increases, H 0ðEðaÞjtÞ will decrease and so will Var½HðaÞjt. This means that the variance of knowledge VarðKðe; aÞjtÞ will be smaller and lt larger ðdue to eq. ½B5Þ in a competitive year, and consequently the optimal level of effort for a given a, e*ðaÞ will be higher in a competitive year ðdue to eq. ½B6Þ. This discussion indicates that although effort is not observa- ble here, one could imagine that the increased benefit to effort is one im- portant channel through which competition affects students’ performance. 2. Concavity of HðaÞ We know that HðaÞ is increasing in a: yHðaÞ ya 5 yKðeðaÞ; aÞ ya 1 yKðeðaÞ; aÞ yeðaÞ deðaÞ da &gt; 0: The second derivative of HðaÞ is given by y2HðaÞ ya2 5 y2KðeðaÞ; aÞ ya2 1 2 y2KðeðaÞ; aÞ yayeðaÞ deðaÞ da 1 y2KðeðaÞ; aÞ yeðaÞ2 deðaÞ da  2 1 yKðeðaÞ; aÞ yeðaÞ d2eðaÞ da2 : ðB9Þ The first and third terms of equation ðB9Þ are negative, while the second term is positive. In order for the sum of these three terms to be negative, the “complementarity” between ability and effort must not be too large in 37 Loosely speaking, HðaÞ will be concave if the concavity of the knowledge production function in effort and ability dominates the complementarity of these two inputs. The exact conditions for the concavity of HðaÞ are presented in app. B.2. Do Men and Women Respond Differently to Competition? 487 the production of knowledge. That is, the concavity of the knowledge production function must dominate the complementarity effect. A similar condition is sufficient for d2eðaÞ=da2 to be negative. To simplify the ex- position, I rewrite the first-order condition as yRðe*ðaÞ; aÞ ye 5 lt yKðe*; aÞ ye 2 yCðe*; aÞ ye : ðB10Þ Now, from equation ðB7Þ, we have de* da 5 2 y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2 : ðB11Þ So, d2e* da2 5 2 y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2   y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya2 1 y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2ya de* da   1 y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya   y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2ya 1 y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye3 de* da   y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2  2 ; A B Since B is always positive, the sign of d2e*=da2 will be determined by the sign of A. Using equation ðB11Þ, we can rewrite A as A5 2 y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2 y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya2 1 2 y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2ya y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya 2  y2RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya 2 y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye3 y2RðeðaÞ; a Þ ye2 ! : In order to guarantee A to be negative, the complementarity between a and e in creating knowledge must decrease with effort and ability, and the third derivative of R with respect to effort must be negative. That is, a sufficient ðbut not necessaryÞ condition is: y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye3 &lt; 0; y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ yeya2 &lt; 0; y3RðeðaÞ; aÞ ye2ya &lt; 0: 488 Morin References Andersen, Steffen, Seda Ertac, Uri Gneezy, John A.
