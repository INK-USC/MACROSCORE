This article takes a more critical ap- proach than most to the development and consequences of the “regime” for international investment. it examines the bargaining dynamics that have led to broad and asymmetrical rights for private economic agents, considers some of the consequences of such rights, and documents states’ efforts to renegotiate some of the central aspects of the regime. it also speaks to the conditions under which states make exceptionally constraining legal commitments and some of the governance conse- quences of such commitments. states have begun to push back against the investment regime, often attempting to guard their policy space in the face of the legal arrangements that constrain them. Credible com- mitment making is not exclusively about attracting capital; it is also a choice about economic governance more generally. The nature and operation of this international legal regime is poten- tially relevant to global flows of foreign direct investment, estimated to reach $1.45 trillion in 2013 and applicable to a worldwide stock of fdi in *This project began while on sabbatical leave at the straus institute for the advanced study of Law and Justice at new York University Law school, 2009–2010. i am grateful for comments received on early versions of this paper presented at the straus institute and the international Legal Theory Colloquium, new York University, april 2010; the Conference on Politics in hard Times, University of California, san diego, april 2010; the Conference on the Politics of Trade agreements, Princeton University, april 2010; University of southern California, april 2010; northwestern University, may 2010; and the international Law and international relations seminar, harvard University, septem- ber 2012.

ABSTRACT: The regime for international investment is extraordinary in public international law and controversial in many regions of the world. This article explores two aspects of this set of rules: its decentralization and the unusual powers it gives to private actors to invoke dispute settlement. Decentralization has contributed to a competitive environment for ratification of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and has elevated the importance of dyadic bargaining power in the formation of the regime. Governments of developing countries are more likely to enter into BITs and tie their hands more tightly when they are in a weak bargaining position, which in turn is associated with economic downturns of the domestic economy. Once committed, investors have sued governments with surprising regularity, arguably contributing disproportionately to legal awards that favor the private corporate actors who have the power to convene the dispute settlement system. States have begun to push back, revising their obligations and attempting to annul arbitral awards. One of the conclusions is that it is important not only to consider whether BITs attract capital—which has been the focus of nearly all the empirical research on BIT effects—but also to investigate the governance consequences of the international investment regime generally. bargaining over bits 13 1 see World Investment Report 2013: Global Value Chains: Investment and Trade for Development. geneva, switzerland: United nations Conference on Trade and development. available at http:// unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2013_en.pdf. 2 Yackee 2012. 3 For an explicit application of the regimes concept to international investment law, see salacuse 2010. 4 allee and Peinhardt 2014. 2012 of about $20 trillion.1 Yet, little research in international relations has taken a close look at it. investment treaties should be examined in a broader context and be compared with, for example, institutions for the protection and promotion of trade. Bilateralism and a private right of standing for private corporate actors imbues the international in- vestment regime with a peculiar character that stimulates competition for capital, weakens the bargaining position of states when they are in a vulnerable economic position, and exposes them to legal liabili- ties that they may not have anticipated when they “tied their hands” under these agreements in the first place. while investment treaties may indeed have facilitated some capital imports, researchers have ne- glected the other side of the coin: pushback from public actors who increasingly view the investment regime as currently constituted as not in their interest. a result has been, as one legal scholar puts it, “one of the most dynamic and controversial areas of international law today.”2 This article focuses on the international investment regime—from the negotiation of treaties to dispute settlement. By “international in- vestment regime,” i mean the collection of often decentralized (even sometimes incoherent) rules about the promotion and protection of for- eign direct investment.3 The first section puts the investment regime in context by comparing it with the regime for international trade. while space constraints do not allow for full testing of a range of explanations here, i suggest one reason for the differences between the two may be differences in dynamic contracting for trade and investment. sec- tion ii reviews existing explanations for the spread of bilateral invest- ment agreements. it supplements existing research that characterizes the ratification of bilateral agreements as competition for capital and hard bargaining. The finding that bilateral investment treaties (bits)— and especially their more delegative forms of dispute settlement—are associated with declining economic conditions supplements the find- ings of Todd allee and Clint Peinhart in this symposium.4 section iii explores the sovereignty consequences of the spread of bits. evidence suggests that they may have underdelivered investment and served up an unexpectedly large wave of litigation. moreover, new evidence is beginning to suggest that this litigation is contributing to expansion of ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The interna- tional investment regime is under pressure to change, reflecting push- back from states who feel the balance of advantages favoring investors has gone a little too far. i. background: a tale of two regimes— trade and investment international economic cooperation is characterized by one obvious fact without a clear explanation: even though international trade and in- ternational investment agreements both purport to facilitate economic relations across borders, and even though they are sometimes even ad- dressed in the same treaties, these two clusters of law are substantially different. The differences are hardly appreciated by social scientists largely because the legal regime for fdi has developed under the ra- dar of most international relations and international political economy scholars.5 There are at least two stark contrasts between the interna- tional institutions governing trade and investment: their respective de- grees of centralization and the nature of rights given to private actors. decentralization of the investment regime The international investment regime has no single institutional core; rather, it is comprised of a relatively decentralized system of rules, norms, and dispute resolution procedures. in contrast to international laws governing trade, which are influenced overwhelmingly by the laws of the general agreement on Tariffs and Trade/world Trade organi- zation (gatt/wto), investment rules developed first through custom- ary international law, and more recently through a system of bilateral and regional treaties whose primary purpose is to encourage interna- tional investment by protecting property rights of investors in foreign jurisdictions.6 5 a jstor search of economics and political science journals produced 219 articles whose abstracts include “wto” and only four that include “icsid.” another jstor search of these two disciplines turned up 569 articles with “international trade” in the abstract compared to only twenty-seven with “inter- national investment” in the abstract. interestingly, international investment treaties have also escaped much public political scrutiny: while congressional votes over trade agreements often make the news, the Us senate does not even register roll-call votes on bilateral investment treaties. By comparison, international lawyers have written voluminously in this area, likely because of the demand for their services as counsel and arbitrators. 6 There may be some tendency for countries with bits also to agree to preferential trade agreements (Tobin and Busch 2010), but such a relationship is by no means linear and hardly undercuts the obser- vation that the core of the trade regime is the multilateral wto system. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

But these conjectures do not explain why the investment regime tends to be more decentralized than is the case for the trade regime (although the latter is decentralizing as preferential and regional trade agreements become more common). despite the fact that the major capital-exporting countries have his- torically converged on general principles of customary international law,9 they have not been able to agree on multilateral treaty provisions among themselves, and certainly not with developing countries. Twice in modern history (in discussions of the international Trade organiza- tion in 1947 and the multilateral agreement on investment in 1995– 98), notable efforts were made to multilateralize the international in- vestment regime, and both failed. even the gatt’s Uruguay round (1986–94), noted for its sweeping accomplishments codified in fifty major new agreements, touched on investment in a relatively minor way.10 By the end of the Uruguay round, attention to fdi amounted to little more than a patchwork of international rules.11 while multilateralism languished, bilateral investment agreements flourished. Capital-exporting countries did not respond to the growing risks to investment in the 1950s and 1960s and to ito and organiza- tion for economic Cooperation and development (oecd) failures by sitting on their diplomatic hands. The governments of these countries 7 allee and Peinhardt 2014. 8 Koremenos, Lipson, and snidal 2001, 771. 9 The basic premise was reflected in customary international law of the time; no government was entitled to expropriate private property, for whatever purpose, without providing prompt, adequate, and effective payment. see then-Us secretary of state Cordell hull’s note to the mexican minister of Foreign affairs during the 1938 dispute over land expropriations, reprinted in green h. hackworth’s Digest of International Law, vol. 3, sec. 228 (1942). The rule itself predates hull’s statement, and it was restated in various decisions from the early part of the twentieth century. see Concerning the Factory at Chorzow (ger. v.

For example, bits typically require national treatment and most-favored- nation (mfn) treatment of foreign investments in the host country.12 They usually protect contractual rights,13 guarantee the right to trans- fer profits in hard currency, and prohibit or restrict the use of perfor- mance requirements.14 Perhaps most importantly, bits provide for in- ternational arbitration of disputes between the investor and the host country.15 This is an unusual arrangement in international law and is discussed in greater detail below. Judged by their spread, bits appear to have been spectacularly suc- cessful. Today there are some 2,600 known bilateral agreements gov- erning foreign investment in every region of the world and an increas- ing number of free trade agreements that include analogous investment provisions as well.16 Their growth was exceptionally explosive in the 1990s.17 But clearly, an international consensus has never existed for the development of a “world investment organization.” rather, rules are negotiated largely bilaterally and disputes settled in a much more ad hoc fashion than is the case with trade in goods and services. argu- ably, bilateralism has exacerbated the competitive rush to sign bits and contributed to bargaining concessions by developing countries when and where their bargaining power has been weakest. the privileged position of private actors: a private right of standing in the investment regime The trade regime and the investment regime have another interesting difference. Trade agreements are generally enforced by official state ac- tions through public mechanisms such as sanctions, while investment rules—at least as they have developed in the past fifty years of treaty law—are generally enforced by firms exercising a private right of ac- tion, typically granted in the treaties themselves, which may result in monetary compensation for damages.18 12 e.g., the 1994 Us Prototype Bilateral investment Treaty, office of the Chief Counsel for inter- national Commerce, Us department of Commerce; article 2(1), 2(2)(a). 13 e.g., 1994 Us Prototype BiT, article i(d)(ii). 14 e.g., 1994 Us Prototype BiT, article v(1–2). 15 e.g., 1994 Us Prototype BiT, article iX. 16 nafta, chap. 11. it is interesting that while bilateral bits have spread, few if any have expanded to take on more members. 17 elkins, guzman, and simmons 2006. 18 historically, by contrast, customary international legal protection for investors was generally me- diated by state-to-state relationships, schill 2010, 36.

The state-to-state system of dispute settlement on which cil was premised19 was replaced by a system in which inves- tors could seek compensation for losses due to host government actions without the support or even the approval of their home governments. This private right to sue a government for damages and to choose the forum in which to do so20 constitutes the most revolutionary aspect of the international law relating to foreign investment in the past half- century. 21 it is reflected not only in almost all bits, but also in several important regional and sector-specific investment agreements, such as the energy Charter Treaty (ect), the north american Free Trade agreement (nafta), and the Central american Free Trade agreement (cafta).22 The comparison between bits and the wto and the trade provisions of cafta and nafta is stark. These latter agreements allow states only to initiate disputes over trade practices,23 although firms can of course lobby their governments to take up their cause. outside of the eU, trade treaties do not provide for monetary remedies for firms in case of trade law violation.24 Trade and investment rules are sharply different with respect to their duration as well: whereas a state can exit the wto with a mere six months’ notice of intent to withdraw, bits typically continue to bind for ten to fifteen years after their termination.25 while it is beyond the scope of this article to test fully a satisfying gation agreements negotiated by many governments to protect investments prior to the rise of bits typically did not explicitly contain such a right. see sykes 2005, 4. 19 schill 2010, 34–6. For example see the Case Concerning the Payment of various serbian Loans issued in France. available at: http://www.worldcourts.com/pcij/eng/decisions/1929.07.12_payment 1.htm. 20 bits typically apply the rules of the international Center for settlement of investment disputes (icsid) or the United nations Commission on international Trade Law (uncitral). see the 2012 Us model BiT, article 24. available at: http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/BiT%20text%20for%20 aCieP%20meeting.pdf. 21 schill 2010. similarly, investors’ direct access to international tribunals represents a “normative breakthrough” according to grazzini 2012. 22 The ect has investment dispute settlement provisions for both investor-state and state-state dis- putes (Part v). while twenty-three claims have been initiated by investors against host states, to date there have been no state-state disputes under the ect. hobér 2010. 23 The eU is more complicated in that individuals can petition the european Court of Justice if their government is thought to have violated european law; individuals thereby indirectly have stand- ing to enforce international trade agreements in the eU context. 24 Under nafta and the wto, parties are not prohibited in cases of a trade violation from agreeing to a settlement that includes monetary damages, but they rarely do so. sykes 2005, 8. 25 wto withdrawal procedures are in article Xv of the marrakesh agreement, available at http:// tcc.export.gov/Trade_agreements/all_Trade_agreements/exp_005545.asp. on typical bit obliga- tions, see grazzini 2012. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

But once the investment is made, it may be rational for the host country to withdraw those concessions and to impose other costs up to and including expropriation. as has long been recognized in the obsolescing bargaining literature,27 the greater the sunk cost of invest- ment, the greater the dynamic risk for investors. Time-inconsistent preferences are far less acute in the trade area: once allowed entry, com- petitive goods are likely to weaken domestic producers, erode their po- litical opposition, and develop a consumer-based constituency. once goods are imported, changing political pressures may actually make importing governments’ ex ante and ex post preferences more consis- tent over time.28 Furthermore, the logic of credible commitment making is rein- forced by a weaker logic of reciprocity in the investment area than in trade. Traditionally, investment flows have been lopsided: developing countries want to attract capital but they are rarely capital exporters themselves on a significant scale. That is one reason why investor pro- tections contained in bits historically may have tended to involve a highly developed and developing dyad (though this is changing),29 and why defendants in the trade regime (gatt and wto cases) are over- whelmingly rich developed states while defendants in the investment regime (cases registered with the international Center for settlement of investment disputes [icsid]) are overwhelmingly middle or lower income states (Figure 1). reciprocity is most useful as an enforcement mechanism where the players’ interactions are symmetrical: where reci- procity is weak (across the developmental divide), legal hands-tying may be useful. in short, private investing actors have special privileges in interna- tional law compared to any other private actors, and they are increas- 26 sykes 2005, 17. 27 Kobrin 1987; vernon 1971. 28 rogowski 1989. 29 elkins, guzman, and simmons 2006. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Private traders 30 author’s calculations, based on wto data available at http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/ dispu_e/dispu_status_e.htm, and on icsid data, available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/iCsid/Front servlet?requestType=Casesrh&amp;actionval=ListCases. 31 according to international law, dispute settlement awards are enforced by national legislation and judiciaries, as stipulated through international agreements such as the new York and the wash- ington conventions. washington Convention (1965), section 6, article. 54(1): “each Contracting state shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecu- niary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that state.” 32 exhaustion of local remedies is not common in bits (douglas 2009), as it is for human rights claims in most international contexts. figure 1 comparison of defendants in trade and investment disputes gaTT/wTo defendants by iCsid respondents by</p>

Bilateral negotiations have been affected by the relative bargaining power of host states: the weaker their bargaining power, the tighter they may be willing to tie their hands to satisfy in- vestors—a point made by allee and Peinhardt.33 This section explores the competitive pressures to ratify bits and then tests the proposition that hands-tying has been influenced by an important source of erod- ing bargaining power—weak economic growth in the potential host country. the setting: competing for capital The late 1980s and first half of the 1990s was a time of extremely slow growth in international bank lending, which, on the heels of the debt crisis of the 1980s, was contracting in many parts of the world. For- eign direct investment was a potential way to borrow internationally in this period of stagnant bank finance. Figure 2 illustrates the relation- ship between the falling ratio of foreign bank debt and fdi inflows for low income and developing countries on the one hand, and the accu- mulation of new bits on the other. as the pool of available global fdi increased and international bank loans held steady or in some cases decreased, the ratification of bits followed. This context suggests that many governments were likely motivated to sign bits in order to com- pete more successfully for fdi at a time when alternative forms of inter- national borrowing were stagnant or on the decline. Patterns of bit signings seem to confirm the plausibility of a com- petitive dynamic among developing countries seeking a share of fdi. such capital could potentially be wooed away from investment ven- ues in which governments refused to provide investors the advantages 33 allee and Peinhardt 2014. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Zachary elkins, andrew guzman, and Beth sim- mons find that controlling for a broad range of other factors, develop- ing countries were far more willing to sign a bit with a richer coun- try if close competitors—those with similar infrastructures, similarly skilled work forces, and comparable export profiles—had done so.34 a dynamic of competition may not only reduce the marginal ability of each additional bit to attract capital, as Jennifer Tobin and susan rose-ackerman find,35 it also has the potential to encourage countries to concede more sovereign prerogatives than they otherwise might have done. hard economic times in addition to the competitive pressures documented in other stud- ies, economic pressures may have also contributed to the turn toward bits. Figure 3 illustrates the temporal relationship between the rate of growth globally and the cumulative number of treaties signed. it shows that the beginning of the global diffusion of bits coincides with the economic downturn of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

          <p id="s1p11">Figure 4 displays growth rates specific to each country in the years surrounding a bit signing (defined as a year in which any bit was signed). it demonstrates that growth rates are significantly lower in the three years preceding the signing of an agreement than they are in the same years for countries who have not signed. The difference in growth rates after signing, while appearing slightly higher for bit signers, is not statistically distinguishable from zero. Figure 5 takes an even more detailed look at bit signing episodes by looking only at “bit sprees,” defined here as any year in which a country concluded five or more bits. The difference in growth rates in the three years preceding such sprees is even more noticeable than when states sign any bit at all. These patterns suggest that periods of slow economic growth render potential host governments more willing to accept constraints on their freedom of action in order to attract capital than they otherwise might have been, as bargaining theory suggests. more generally, elkins, guzman, and simmons find in a well- controlled model of bit signings that the more positive a develop- ing country’s gross domestic product (gdp) growth, the less likely it was to ratify a bilateral investment treaty with another country, given that it had not done so already.36 every percentage point increase in growth in the potential host reduced the likelihood that a given coun- try pair would conclude a bilateral investment agreement by about 3 percentage points. To put that finding in perspective, the more than 11 percent drop in the Czech republic’s growth rate between 1990 36 elkins, guzman, and simmons 2006. g lo ba l g ro w th r at e (5 -y ea r m ov in g av er ag e) 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 4.5 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 C um ul at iv e B iT s 19 80 19 82 19 84 19 86 19 88 19 90 19 92 19 94 19 96 19 98 20 00 20 02 20 04 20 06 20 08 figure 3 world gdp growth and bits Cumulative BiTs</p>

(The Czechs, in fact, concluded eight bits in 1991. in 1993, while still hovering around zero growth, they were up to twenty-eight.) in contrast, Botswana, which averaged nearly 7 per- cent growth from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s were, according to these estimates, about 21 percent less likely to ratify a bit each year. By 2006, Botswana had in fact concluded only eight bilateral investment treaties. This evidence is consistent with the proposition that hard eco- nomic times lead to concessions to investors that governments might otherwise not make when economic growth is strong. if bits are in fact negotiated and concluded under stressful economic conditions—a situation that would naturally tend to reduce poten- tial hosts’ bargaining power vis-à-vis capital-exporting states—then it might be expected that the more unfavorable the conditions, the more significant the concessions governments are willing to make in order to conclude a treaty. moreover, slow economic growth can be expected to increase the impatience of the potential host country, lowering time horizons and making a government more willing to relinquish in- crements of sovereignty for the ability to attract economic activity in hopes of stimulating the economy. allee and Peinhardt’s data on dispute settlement make it possible to test the proposition that bit dispute settlement provisions reflect the eroding bargaining position of would-be host governments in periods of weak economic growth.37 simply stated, developing countries in dire economic conditions are expected to concede more of their sovereignty in these agreements than they might otherwise. The following indica- tors are useful: (1) is icsid mentioned at all as an option for interna- tional arbitration between the investor and the contracting party? is it the sole option mentioned in the treaty? and (2) is the United na- tions Commission on international Trade Law (uncitral) mentioned as an option? From this information one can infer whether either of the two major institutions for international arbitration is mentioned in the treaty. allee and Peinhardt code whether there is any explicit mention of investors’ ability to choose a local tribunal or court to settle a dispute. They also code whether or not there is a requirement for lo- cal remedies for dispute settlement to be fully pursued before submis- sion to international arbitration, and whether or not the treaty contains an explicit statement to the effect that the parties are consenting in 37 allee and Peinhardt 2014. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Table 1 displays results that are very suggestive in this regard. it shows the results of a probit model that tests the hypothesis that weak gdp growth in a potential host country in the three years leading up to the conclusion of a bit makes it much more likely to agree to arrange- ments that provide for disputes to bypass local institutions and go to international arbitration. The results are quite striking; in almost every case, the stronger the economic growth in the less developed bit partner, the stronger the domestic provisions and the weaker the international provisions con- tained in the dispute settlement section of a bit. The lone exception is a provision to use the icsid for dispute settlement, which has no consis- tent relationship with the developing country’s business cycle (model 1). in addition, strong economic growth in the less developed partner is strongly and consistently correlated with a much lower likelihood that the signed bit will contain a provision to use uncitral rules should a dispute erupt (model 2). Treaties that do not contain references to the icsid or to uncitral rules (model 3) are also convincingly corre- lated with positive growth in the less developed partner (but there are relatively few of these). Conversely, slow growth in a developing coun- try makes it less likely to negotiate a treaty without any references to one or more of these dispute settlement institutions/rules. Pre-consent clauses—general but explicit statements that commit the parties in ad- vance to arbitrate a dispute—may be mildly associated with stronger developing country growth rates during the negotiation phase (model 6), but the result is not statistically significant in either version of model 6. To get a substantive sense of the effect of the business cycle on the probability of negotiating an agreement without any icsid or uncitral clauses, imagine two states, a high-growth state and a low-growth state at two different points in time, 1985 and 2000. The results in Table 1 work out to a probability that a high-growth (10 percent per annum) developing country in 1985 stood about a 31 percent chance of signing a bit without any references to the icsid or to uncitral. a low-growth country suffering a –10 percent growth rate for the three years lead- 38 allee and Peinhardt 2010. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

By 2000, a country with 10 percent growth had only about a 7 percent chance of negotiating a bit without such a clause, but a country with –10 percent growth had only a miniscule chance (less than 2 percent) of achieving this result, con- trolling for all factors in model 3(a). models 4 and 5 test for the conditions conducive to adding local solutions to the dispute settlement sections of treaties. The likelihood that a bit will contain some reference to the investor’s ability to choose a local tribunal or court is positively associated with growth in the less developed bit partner (model 4). a provision that requires an investor to exhaust local remedies is also positively associated with the develop- ing country’s business cycle (model 5). Taken together, these results support the general tendency for developing countries with strong pos- itive growth to maintain somewhat greater national control over how investment disputes will be settled. downturns in the business cycle, by contrast, are consistently associated with much greater delegation to international tribunals in the event of a dispute. Figure 6(a–c) il- lustrates the substantive impact of the business cycle when a potential host experiences 10 percent growth versus –10 percent growth, holding all other conditions constant (that is, at their means). slower growth is associated with tighter hands-tying, even when several other conditions are controlled for. democratic countries tend to negotiate agreements with icsid clauses and avoid concluding trea- ties that contain neither icsid nor uncitral provisions. They are also much more likely, according to these results, to agree to treaties that contain explicit clauses that pre-commit them to arbitration in the event of a dispute. somewhat surprisingly, democracies do not tend to insist on local remedies (models 4 and 5). Consistent with stud- ies on other areas of international law,39 democracies tend to delegate authority with greater regularity to international institutions than do nondemocratic states. a bargaining framework might lead one to suspect that the greater the developmental difference between partners, the greater the ten- dency for bits to reflect international delegation for the settlement of disputes. The evidence in Table 1 is consistent with that hypothesis. when the difference between treaty partners is greater, there is a slight 39 simmons 2008. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Taking the absolute value of the differ- ence, this measure ranges from 0, when countries are from the same category, to 3, when they are from opposite extremes.

China has been less willing than other countries to delegate explicitly to either the icsid or the uncitral and is more likely to conclude treaties that make no reference to either and include localist provisions, and to not require pre-consent agreements in their bits. China’s preferences would ap- pear to be closer to those of a capital-importing country than a capital- exporting county, even when changes in dispute resolution provisions over time are controlled for. overall, allee and Peinhardt’s model of structural bargaining power can be supplemented with one based on economic cycles. developing countries not only make more concessions on dispute settlement pro- visions the more powerful their negotiating partners are, as allee and Peinhart have found,40 but they may also make more concessions when the economic tide begins to turn against them. iii. the consequences of ratification: field of dreams or</p>
          <p id="s1p54">litigation nightmare? the consequences of hands-tying The evidence discussed so far suggests that host states sign bits and ac- cept stronger constraints on their freedom of action when they are in a weak bargaining position. such constraints on sovereign decision mak- ing may be worth it if bits work—that is, if they attract capital. on this point, the jury is still out.41 early studies were able to document very little increased fdi in response to the ratification of bits.42 other stud- ies attribute positive impacts on investments flows to bit ratifications.43 and yet the empirical findings are not entirely consistent. some re- searchers have found that bits seem to increase foreign investment in countries that already have fairly good domestic institutions in place, which suggests that bits alone are not a quick fix for weak domestic in- stitutions.44 other scholars seem to have found precisely the opposite, that bits have their strongest effects where states are most likely to lack credibility.45 disagreement exists over whether bits with the United states have been beneficial to developing countries,46 with some re- 40 allee and Peinhardt 2010. 41 see the essays in sauvant and sachs 2009. 42 Banga 2003. 43 Kerner 2009; neumayer and spess 2004; Büthe and milner 2009; egger and merlo 2007. 44 hallward-driemeier 2003, 21–2; Tobin and rose-ackerman 2011. 45 rosendorff and shin 2012. 46 Compare the findings of gallagher and Birch 2006 and shadlen, schrank, and Kurtz 2005. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Figure 7(a–c) illustrates the relationship between the signing of bits and the ensuing registra- tion of new investment cases before the icsid.48 with only three- to five-years’ lag, the shapes of the curves measuring the number of bits worldwide and the number of new cases registered each year with the icsid are nearly identical (Figure 7(a)). Figure 7(b) and (c) illustrate the same relationship for Latin america and argentina, respectively. The latter two graphs show the same precipitous climb, but also a fairly swift retreat from the peak in 2003. a simple generalized least squares model suggests that each addi- tional bit significantly raises the risk of arbitration (defined in this case as the registration of an investment dispute with icsid, see Table 2). Three relationships are quite solid. First, arbitration comes in clusters; arbitration in the previous year is a very strong predictor of arbitration in any given year. whether this represents piling on among investors or the widespread consequences of particular government policies, litiga- tion under the auspices of the icsid is characterized by a good deal of inertia. second, the probability of a new case generally increases each year. This system has a lot of built-in momentum, at least for the years examined here (1980 through 2006). Third, independent of time and piling on, the more bilateral investment treaties a country signs, the more likely it will be sued in this venue. “if you build (sign) it, they will come (litigate).” Litigation seems to come at the worst possible time for many coun- tries—when macroeconomic conditions generally are unstable. infla- tionary pressures, a deteriorating external position, and flagging inves- tor confidence in a country’s economic performance generally are all correlated with litigation. The higher the (log of ) inflation, the greater the probability of arbitration is two years later. a country’s deterio- rating external position is signaled by reserve losses as a proportion of imports, the outflow of foreign direct investment, and a worsening capacity to service foreign debt. although it is not quite statistically significant by traditional standards, a country’s risk premium—the ex- 47 Kerner and Lawrence 2013. 48 The icsid is the only institution that requires public registration of disputes, limiting the ability to analyze disputes of different rules or forums. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This ev- idence suggests that litigation may very well be dangerously procycli- cal. That is, it may flow from broader economic conditions over which governments that have opened up to financial liberalization have little direct ability to control, and aggravate those conditions in the process. Litigation may further complicate the very conditions it is responding to by encouraging further capital flight. table 2 bits and international arbitration Explanatory</p>

This is where the asymmetry built into the archi- tecture of most bits becomes quite important. giving investors a pri- vate right of action allows them to decide when, where, and on what basis to sue public entities for damages. it therefore gives them ex- traordinary agenda-setting power in future law development.51 as Jose alvarez notes, “These firms, not their home states, are the regime’s private attorneys general and are in the driver’s seat . . . in the course of investor-state disputes. . . . [n]on-state parties play a crucial role in en- forcing the relevant international legal guarantees and in determining their interpretation and development. . . . [T]he emerging (and ever more abundant) arbitral investment case law is at least as much the cre- ation of corporate investors as it is of the states that enter into bits.”52 (Certainly, the same assessment would never be made of wto rules and dispute settlement practices, which remain firmly in the hands of the wto members.) moreover, investment treaty arbitration is nonrecipro- cal: it gives investors the right to sue, but does not give states a similar right. This allows for the possibility that law development—interpreta- tion of the rules going forward—will be lopsided, trending toward the interests of the parties with the right to choose the forum, rules, and legal issues, and without the traditional safeguards of judicial indepen- dence that are built in to most credible domestic legal systems.53 even if states could anticipate that they would be sued by private actors in the case of breach—and the history of negotiations for a sophisticated country such as the Czech republic suggests this eventuality was not well understood54—it might be quite difficult to assess how the treaties they signed would be interpreted by arbitration panels over time. evidence on the actual pattern of arbitral decision making is very suggestive in this regard. gus van harten, a legal scholar specializ- 49 Büthe and milner 2009. 50 Büthe and milner 2009. 51 Keohane, moravcsik, and slaughter 2000. 52 alvarez 2009 94–5. 53 van harten 2012. 54 Fecák 2011. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

These claims over jurisdiction provide an opportunity to analyze the drift of legal interpretation over time. They are issues that by definition could go either way and are litigated precisely because the parties care about them and cannot easily anticipate the outcome. van harten’s painstak- ing coding of all publicly available awards in english—some 140 cases under investment treaties handed down as of 2010—suggests a clear tendency toward the expansion of investor’s rights where jurisdictional matters were at stake. van harten considered how broadly and flex- ibly arbitrators interpreted the terms “corporate person investor” (69 instances); “natural person investor” (6 instances); “investment” (116 instances); “minority shareholder interest” (72 instances); “permissibil- ity of investment” (27 instances); “parallel claims” (165 instances); and “scope of mfn” (60 instances). he finds that more than 76 percent of the time tribunals chose to interpret these contested terms broadly so as to advantage investors over states. moreover, the primary national- ity of the claimant matters as well. Claimant firms from the Us, UK, and France were more likely to win expansive interpretations of inves- tor’s rights than were firms from Latin america, the european periph- ery (Cyprus and Turkey) or the Far east (singapore). This evidence of lopsided law development is consistent with the broader literature that notes that arbitrators have incentives to favor the interests of those who have the power to invoke the use of the system (in this case, the private investor).55 Table 3 analyzes van harten’s data on contentious jurisdictional questions to shed light on the effect of asymmetrical mixed arbitration on law development. The key dichotomous dependent variable is the tribunal’s decision on a jurisdictional question—whether “expansive” in favor of the investor-claimant or “restrictive” in favor of the state- respondent. The unit of analysis is the issue, of which there may be as many as five in a single arbitral case. The cases themselves are all those for which van harten’s team was able to locate a jurisdictional award in english. as such, they use a range of arbitral rules (icsid, uncitral, international Chamber of Commerce (icc), stockholm Chamber of Commerce (scc), or ad hoc, for example.). The first line confirms van harten’s finding; claimants from ma- jor capital-exporting countries are about 20 percent more likely to get 55 van harten 2012. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The sec- ond line shows that poorer respondent states are also likely to receive awards that expand rather than restrict investors’ rights in the juris- diction award. each progressive move downward through the world Bank’s income categories—upper, upper middle, lower middle, and lower—results in about a 10 percent chance that an arbitration panel will rule expansively, that is, in favor of investors’ rights. Unsurpris- ingly, when the investor appoints the presiding officer of the arbitra- tion panel, expansive rules are more likely.56 Using icsid rules tend slightly to favor restrictive interpretations (favorable to the state), while uncitral rules tend to be associated with more expansive ones (favor- able to investors). while space limitations prevent a detailed analysis of arbitration rules here, it is interesting to note a certain consistency with Table 1, which reports that the weaker the economic growth and 56 For a full discussion of data coding see van harten 2012. table 3 litigation and law development: influences on “expansive” jurisdictiona Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 (MFN only) Claimant from Us, UK, France or germany .207*** (p = .004) .191*** (p = .009) .204*** (p = .003) .195*** (p = .007) .326 (p = .242) income Category</p>

This means that states with bits may be even more constrained than they might have anticipated. in the case of mtd equity sdn. Bhd. and mtd Chile, s.a. v. republic of Chile, for example, american investors used a bit Chile had negotiated with malaysia (there is no Us-Chile bit)57 to establish a right to fair and equal treatment and relied on ma- laysia’s treaties with denmark and Croatia to establish that such a right required land use rezoning, even though the Chilean treaty with ma- laysia did not require rezoning at all.58 governments may not expect such expansive interpretations when they sign a bilateral treaty with a specific state. indeed, broad interpretations of mfn clauses are consid- ered a key mechanism for “ratcheting up” state obligations under bits.59 Finally, there is some evidence consistent with a claim that bilat- eralism has paid handsome dividends for investors in terms of mon- etary damages. while very little information is available on the terms of monetary awards, twenty-eight of the cases in van harten’s data- base include information on their monetary outcome. it is important to note that these are a subset of cases, and hardly a random one at that: arbitral awards are only made public when both the investor and the state agree to do so. when the nationality of the claimant and the income level of the respondent are controlled for, an ordered logit on the magnitude of the monetary damages awarded in a particular case shows that complaints based on bits are much more likely to be as- sociated with larger monetary awards than cases based on multilateral agreements (nafta and the ect, for example). Compared to the non- bilateral treaties, bits reduced the probability that the monetary award would be zero by about 60 percent and increased the probability that an award would be in the $100 million range or the $500 million range 57 according to the Us department of state; see http://www.state.gov/e/eb/ifd/bit/117402.htm. 58 For a discussion of this case see http://www.biicl.org/files/3915_2004_mtd_v_chile.pdf. 59 mcLachlan, shore, and weiniger 2007, 254. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The choice of commercial rules—those of business groups such as the icc or the scc—is also associated with larger awards. indeed, inves- tors were about 60 percent less likely to receive an award of less than $1 million and 80 percent more likely to get an award over $500 mil- lion when commercial venues, such as the icc or scc, were used (for example, compared to the icsid or uncitral). while causal inference is difficult to assign in this case—the choice of tribunal itself is likely to be quite strategic—it is an interesting finding in light of the fact that in almost all international investment agreements, it is the investor who has the right to choose the rules that govern the case. iv. push-back: annulments and renegotiation The international investment regime differs from the trade regime in its degree of centralization and the special protections afforded to pri- vate actors who invest. The dispute settlement mechanism contained in most bits is quite different from those contained in trade agree- ments in another important way as well: it is a one-shot deal. There is no provision in the most widely used arbitration rules for appeal; decisions of the tribunals are final and binding.60 annulment is the only option, 60 For this reason, scholars often refer to “the sovereign character of international investment tri- bunals.” grazzini 2012. 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 –0.2 –0.4 –0.6 –0.8 –1 marginal effect</p>

This is in obvious contrast with the way disputes are settled among wto states: the appellate body can cor- rect tribunal decisions, giving an unhappy litigant some satisfaction if the decision was a bad one and also helping to provide some degree of uniformity to decisions made under wto rules. The investment regime has no such mechanism; it grew out of a commercial arbitration model,61 the results of which are typically held to be both binding and final. only a very narrow set of conditions can be used as the basis for annulling an award of an icsid tribunal, for example, including the complete absence of proper reasoning or the finding that a tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers.62 an award is not supposed to be overturned just because the decision was “bad” or “wrong.” in general, there is no way to correct the poor judgment of a mixed arbitration investment tribunal. and yet, there has been an explosion in the registration of cases seeking annulment of icsid awards (Figure 9). surprisingly, in 2008 there were more new registrations for icsid annulment proceedings than there were awards on the merits in original cases.63 interestingly, to date, only one country in the high income category, the United arab emirates, has sought to annul an icsid award. For the most part, an- nulments have been sought by middle-income countries concentrated in Latin america. argentina, a country that has experienced its share of hard economic times in the last decade, alone accounts for about one-quarter of all annulment requests.64 why do these countries seek to have awards of duly constituted icsid tribunals annulled? To be clear, the restrictive conditions on annulment make it almost impossible to succeed in this endeavor. only about 8 percent of icsid awards have been annulled in whole or in part.65 one possibility is that annulment proceedings are a symbolic action to ex- press growing frustration with the regime. as david Caron argues, 61 For a discussion of the influence of commercial law and public law on the investment arbitration system, see roberts 2013. 62 see annex 6 of “Background Paper on annulment for the administrative Council of iCsid* august 10, 2012.” available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/iCsid/Frontservlet?requestType=iCsid newsLettersrh&amp;actionval=showdocument&amp;docid=dCevenTs11. 63 awards based on the merits only; excludes awards on the jurisdiction as well as those based solely on a settlement that the parties asked the tribunal to write up in the form of an award. i also exclude any panel decisions that are not referred to on the icsid web site as “awards.” 64 The others are as follows: egypt, 4; Chile, 3; ecuador, malaysia and Peru, 2 each; Cameroon, the democratic republic of Congo, gabon, guinea, indonesia, Kazakhstan, morocco, Philippines, and seychelles, 1 each (as of 2010). 65 see figures compiled by the icsid at https://icsid.worldbank.org/iCsid/Frontservlet?request Type=iCsidnewsLettersrh&amp;actionval=showdocument&amp;docid=dCevenTs11. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

These sec- tors have particular public significance. They impact the daily lives of thousands, even millions, of people in a very real, ongoing way and are the kind of cases where governments have decided to take their stand for sovereignty over “policy space.” one other trend is quite interesting with respect to annulments. There has been a sharp shift in the type of regime that has sought to annul the decisions of investment arbitration panels over time. in the 1980s and 1990s, they were mostly defiant autocracies that were loath to relinquish their interests in the name of law. But increasingly, the annulment seekers are relatively highly democratic countries with clear lines of accountability to their domestic publics. in fact, when compar- ing the registrations for annulment before and after 2008, it is stunning to realize that the polity score for all annulment seekers before 2008 66 david Caron, “investment arbitration and the distinction between appeal and annulment,” lecture, investment Law and Policy speaker series, Columbia University Law school, new York, n.Y., april 8, 2010. awards</p>

Fa- miliar political economy theories, quite likely involving the dynamic contracting issues surrounding investing, may account for these dif- ferences. ex post, governments have an incentive to renege, skim rents from sunk investments, and reclaim their sovereign regulatory space. in the case of trade, domestic resistance eventually is likely to be com- peted away. if the logic of ronald rogowki’s Commerce and Coalitions underlies the domestic political dynamics of trade, then raymond ver- non’s Sovereignty at Bay underlies that of international direct foreign investing. The purpose of this article has not been to test an explanation of these differences, but rather to explore the consequences for gover- nance. whether bits attract capital is an important question, but it is not the only question one might raise about the investment regime. The literature shows theoretically and empirically that the need to make credible commitments in the context of bilateral negotiations has led to a competitive ratification dynamic. Power asymmetries im- ply pressures on developing countries to make concessions to powerful exporting countries, and i show that business cycles contribute to pat- terns in concession making as well. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The explosion of arbitration suggests some kind of breakdown in expecta- tions: whether bits have failed to tie the hands of rapacious govern- ments, or whether investors have incentives to gamble on a tribunal that they alone can invoke, few governments anticipated the expan- sion in investors’ rights or the number and size of claims they would soon face as a result of ratifying bits. arguably, these are not the re- sults many developing countries anticipated when they signed these agreements.67 in addition, is it not clear that many states thought through the pos- sible consequences of acquiescing to asymmetrical arbitration in which the market for legal decisions is driven largely by one side of the dis- pute. other scholars have explored the incentives this creates for arbi- trators, and especially for repeat arbitrators, who gain financially when selected by firms to represent their interests.68 while a causal test has yet to be done, arbitrators in mixed investment disputes have been much more likely to accept the broad jurisdictional claims of inves- tors than the narrower arguments of states. about a third of the time, mixed arbitration panels award no money at all to the complainant,69 but an icsid arbitration panel’s recent award of $1.67 billion to the complainant in the case of occidental oil Company v. The republic of ecuador, decided october 5, 2012, is a good reminder that the stakes in investment disputes are potentially significant.70 The outcome of decentralized rule making and asymmetrical dis- pute settlement over the past three decades has contributed to a strong pro-investment regime. The array of rights and protections for a spe- cific class of private actors in public international law is quite extraordi- nary. in contrast to the trade area, where rights and benefits are based on reciprocity among the wto members party to an agreement, the 67 Pakistan’s attorney general described the general level of ignorance in his country about the legal liabilities associated with Pakistan’s bit program when the country was sued under a bit in 2001 by the swiss multinational société générale de surveillance: “To be perfectly honest, i did not have a clue, so i had to look it up on google. i typed in ‘icsid’ and ‘bit,’ and that’s how i learned about these instruments for the first time.” The interview is available at http://www.iisd.org/itn/wp-content/uploads/2009/04 /iTn-april-2009.pdf. 68 dezalay and garth 1996. 69 see tables compiled by susan Franck at http://law.wlu.edu/faculty/facultydocuments/francks /awardtables.pdf. according to Franck, thirty-one of the 102 awards in her database result in no mon- etary compensation. 70 see the icsid web site, available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/iCsid/Frontservlet?request Type=Casesrh&amp;actionval=showdoc&amp;docid=dC2672_en&amp;caseid=C80.

To what extent bit-like hands- tying mechanisms can (or should) constrain public policies in these areas is increasingly a matter of debate. if it is true, as andrew Kerner asserts, that “public opposition [to a bit] may increase the incentives governments have for ratifying the treaties in the first place,”74 then there may well be some serious tensions built into the international in- vestment regime, at least as it is currently constituted. The investment regime described in this article is experiencing some pressures to change. The explosion of efforts to annul awards is one 71 including the treaty-based right to have a monetary award enforced by domestic courts around the world. 72 salacuse 2006, 156. 73 Turyn and Perez aznar 2010. 74 Kerner 2009, 97. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 13 00 03 12 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.
