However, how value is created in green partnerships remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, the authors examine the ef- fects of announcements of green partnerships (marketing ver- sus technology) on shareholder value. It is argued that in green partnerships firms leverage marketing and technology-related capabilities for value-enhancing purposes. The results show that announcements of green marketing partnerships have an immediate positive and significant effect on shareholder val- ue, whereas announcements of green technology partnerships produce an immediate negative and significant effect. Nevertheless, green technology partnerships can accrue posi- tive returns, but over a longer-term (1 year) period. In Bdirtier^ industries, it is more difficult to generate positive returns to green partnerships. Counterintuitively, though, in high- polluting industries, firms having a history of positive envi- ronmental performance experience lower financial gains from announcements of green partnerships than firms that were less environmentally responsible in the past. Keywords Green strategic partnerships . Corporate environmentalism . Organizational capabilities . Firm performance . Shareholder value Introduction The topic of corporate environmentalism continues to grow in importance in today’s business world. Responding to social pressures for environmental stewardship, businesses dedicate substantial organizational resources to sustainable products and practices (Kotler 2011). In their quest to make their businesses greener, many firms increasingly rely on strategic partnerships with other organi- zations in the market (Wassmer et al. 2014). For example, in 2013–2014, Exxon Mobile engaged in 11 environmentally oriented partnerships. Wal-Mart’s 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Report listed more than 20 ongoing green col- laborations with suppliers, universities, and NGOs. Ford Motors’website touts nearly 30 collaborative green initiatives with North American and international organizations, many extending over several years. Forbes recently declared sustainability-oriented alliances among the top ten trends in the business world (Forbes, Jan. 18, 2012). Inter-firm partnerships represent an established and active research area, have shown to be an important vehicle for fos- tering firm performance and account for as much as one-third of a firm’s revenue (Gulati 1998; Mani and Luo 2015). Nevertheless, practice reveals that they are risky and costly endeavors, and many fall short of meeting expectations (Kale and Singh 2009; Wuyts and Geyskens 2005). The environ- mental sustainability context makes the prospects of inter-firm Satish Jayachandran served as Area Editor for this article.

Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 DOI 10.1007/s11747-016-0490-9 partnerships even less certain. A recent meta-analytical review by Margolis et al. (2009) suggests that socially responsible companies may do better than their not so responsible coun- terparts. However, there is no definitive conclusion if the ef- fect of corporate environmentalism, as an integral part of firm CSR efforts, on a firm’s bottom line is exclusively positive (Jacobs et al. 2010; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013). Despite their growing significance to business practice, green partnerships still remain a poorly understood phenomenon (Lin and Darnall 2010; Selsky and Parker 2005; Sharma and Kearins 2011) with unclear rewards (Wassmer et al. 2014). The eco- nomic potential of inter-firm green strategies has not yet been fully explored (Cronin et al. 2011). Given the importance of strategic partnerships in the mar- ketplace, and in response to the call for more research into the implementation forms and outcomes of corporate green strat- egies (Chabowski et al. 2011; Cronin et al. 2011), we explore the effects of announcements of green strategic partnership on shareholder value. We address the following key research questions: 1. How do green strategic partnerships contribute to share- holder wealth? 2. What firm- and industry-related green factors drive the magnitude of the impact of green partnership announce- ments on shareholder wealth? We adapt Gulati’s (1998) definition of strategic partner- ships and apply it to the green context. We define green stra- tegic partnerships as voluntary arrangements between two or more organizations for the purpose of exchanging, sharing or co-developing environmentally friendly, or Bgreen^, products, technologies or services to pursue a set of strategic green goals or address critical business needs. Furthermore, in this paper, we distinguish between green marketing and green technolo- gy partnerships. A green marketing partnership is an agree- ment among organizations focusing on the green value chain activities, penetration of green markets, promotion of green product and services, and customer acquisition and retention (Park et al. 2004; Swaminathan and Moorman 2009). A green technology partnership is an agreement among organizations to jointly develop new, environmentally friendly products and services or implement novel greener production technologies (Das et al. 1998; Mowery 1989). We propose a model that links green strategic partnerships and firm stock market value and examine the boundary con- ditions under which firms may experience positive or negative financial returns to announcements of green strategic partner- ships. Building on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and organizational capabilities literature, we propose that in green partnerships, firms combine organizational resources such as marketing and technology capabilities with firms’ environmental expertise for value-creating purposes. Based on an extensive archival search, we develop a unique dataset of 190 green strategic partnerships announced by 59 firms in 2005–2007 and analyze it by event study and regression analyses. Specifically, we find that in the short term, stock mar- kets react more favorably to the news about green marketing partnerships than to the news about green technology partner- ships. The latter are still able to accrue positive financial returns but only over longer periods. When considering firm- and industry-related green factors, mixed patterns emerge. Investors become skeptical and discount stock market value of a firm if it has a history of poor environmental performance in the past or if it operates in the pollution-intensive industry. However, a firm’s good green behavior in the past seems to have no direct effect on investors’ valuation of green partnerships. This study offers several contributions. First, we focus on the CSR practice, which is increasingly relevant for practi- tioners—green strategic partnerships—and quantify their im- pact on the stock market performance of a firm. Second, we identify the roles that marketing and technology capabilities play in green strategic partnerships and outline the pathways these capabilities can be leveraged for eco-based competitive advantage. We further explore the relative importance of mar- keting versus technology capabilities with respect to value cre- ation potential in the context of green strategic partnerships. Finally, we incorporate other firm- and industry-related green factors that have not been previously considered, such as prior environmental performance of a firm and the industry’s envi- ronmental profile (industry pollution levels). In this respect, we contribute to a long-standing debate about who is to benefit more from corporate environmentalism—those firms that only recently started to Bgreen^ their businesses or the firms that have consistently been working on improving their environ- mental performance (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Varadarajan 2015). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we briefly review the literature on the impact of corporate CSR on firm financial performance. Then, we develop a set of hypotheses explaining how organizational capabilities affect the relation- ships between the announcements of green strategic partner- ships and firms’ stock market value. We then proceed with the methodology and results and conclude with implications for theory and practice and limitations of the study. Theoretical background and hypotheses development Corporate environmentalism and firm financial performance The paradigm of environmental sustainability is considered by many as a common goal for societal and economic develop- ment (Peloza and Shang 2011). Understanding what growth opportunities sustainability can provide, while minimizing the 252 J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 negative impact on the biosphere, has become paramount for organizational survival (Connelly et al. 2011). Research on the economic impact of corporate environmentalism surfaced more than three decades ago and only continues to grow (Peattie 2001). A recent meta-analytical review by Margolis et al. (2009) summarizes a large volume of research on the topic and concludes that corporate social responsibility efforts may enhance firm financial performance, but the ultimate ef- fect is contingent on various organizational andmarket-related characteristics. Recently, several studies have adopted the contingency per- spective to explore what factors might affect the association between firm CSR and its financial outcomes (Barnett and Salomon 2006; Crittenden et al. 2011). For example, an early paper by Luo and Bhattacharya (2006) examined how efforts to increase consumer satisfaction help leverage firm CSR for shareholder wealth.Mishra andModi (2016) expanded on that issue by exploring the complementarity effects between mar- keting capabilities and CSR activities to enhance shareholder value. Another stream of papers (Chakrabarty and Wang 2012; Katsikeas et al. 2016; Luo and Bhattacharya 2009; Surroca et al. 2010) focused on the role and contributions of organizational innovation to the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The representative research on the top- ic and the relevant findings are summarized in Table 1. We further extend this line of research by proposing that various organizational capabilities have a differential effect on the relationship between inter-firm green strategies and firm financial performance. We explore the relative importance of different types of organizational capabilities, specifically mar- keting capabilities versus technology capabilities, in the con- text of green strategic partnership. Organizational capabilities and green strategic partnerships Firm marketing capabilities can be broadly defined as an orga- nizational capacity to compete in the marketplace, based on su- perior market sensing and stakeholder linking (Day 1994, 2011). Market-sensing capabilities help organizations to identify critical consumer needs. In the green context, partnerships with environmental activist groups, research institutions, and NGOs provide firms with access to a variety of unique environmental knowledge accumulated by those organizations (Rondinelli and London 2003). Strong market-sensing capabilities help identify environmental knowledge and competencies most relevant for addressing the needs of firm customers and the broader stakeholder community. For example, in a partnership with NGO Greenpeace, German company Foron successfully combined its market knowledge and Greenpeace’s unique en- vironmental expertise to create a first-of-its-kind Freon-free refrigerator. The far-reaching outcome of the collaboration was an emergence of a whole new industry of eco-friendly refrigerators in Europe (Stafford et al. 2000). Moreover, market-sensing capabilities can improve firm’s value creation potential by erecting competitive barriers and extending firm competitive advantage (Day 1994). Strong market-sensing ca- pabilities can assist firms in addressing emerging ecological regulations by learning about them early on and responding preemptively (Delmas and Montes‐Sancho 2010; Diestre and Rajagopalan 2011). For example, firms can partner with government agencies to lobby regulations that favor their green products or join influential industry associations to promote private industry standards that could raise competitors’ costs. Stakeholder-linking marketing capabilities help organiza- tions to build and maintain close relationships with the stake- holder community (Bhattacharya and Korschun 2008; Day 2011). Consumers increasingly make Bbuy/not to buy^ deci- sions based on the environmental performance of firms (Cronin et al. 2011). Companies with strong stakeholder- linking capabilities can more effectively inform stakeholders about corporate environmental practices, reinforce firms’ green image in consumer minds and stimulate them to buy firms’ eco-friendly products (Du et al. 2011; Wagner et al. 2009). Because green products are typically credence goods, for which eco-quality often cannot be fully asserted even after a purchase, other factors such as firm green reputation play an increasingly important role (Siegel 2009). Research has shown that in consumers’minds, companies become increasingly tied to the environmental performance of their business partners and can be Bovershadowed^ by their green reputation (Vachon and Klassen 2006). By partnering with green market leaders, firms elevate their own environmental profile and provide stronger signals of green value to stakeholders (McWilliams and Siegel 2001; van Marrewijk 2003). Because green products are gen- erally perceived to have additional functional benefits of envi- ronmental friendliness, firms can charge premium prices for those and enjoy higher revenues and profits (Homburg et al. 2013; Olsen et al. 2014). Firm technology capabilities reflect firms’ capacity to con- vert resource inputs to desirable outputs more effectively and efficiently via product and process innovation (Moorman and Slotegraaf 1999). Firms with advanced technology capabili- ties assume superior economic performance because of greater competitiveness, higher growth potential, and ability to ad- dress emerging consumer needs in a timely manner (Mizik and Jacobson 2003). Products and processes with innovative green technologies at the core help respond to green market demands and opti- mize costs and improve operational efficiencies (Closs et al. 2011). For example, in green partnerships with channel mem- bers, firms can track the green performance of their products from cradle to grave, develop innovative zero-waste products with a closed-loop life cycle, remove hazardous materials and implement substitutes for depleting and increasingly costly inputs, thus minimizing costs and improving operational J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 253 efficiencies (Pujari et al. 2004; Varadarajan 2015). In green partnerships with unrelated partners, firms can implement joint production operation systems, in which partners utilize each other’s by-products and waste that would otherwise be discarded (Mariadoss et al. 2011; Sharma et al. 2010). For example, the beer producer Molson Coors Brewery and Merrick and Company, specializing in the renewable energy markets, have jointly developed and implemented a unique technology allowing for the conversion of brewing by- products to gas substitute ethanol (Kwok and Rabe 2010). The partners have maximized joint utilization of organization- al resources, leveraged the efficiencies of material and energy savings and reduced operating and production costs, thus in- creasing economic benefits. In summary, in green strategic partnerships, firms combine marketing and technology capabilities with environmental ex- pertise for value creation purposes. Partners mitigate the risks of scarcity of valuable resources by making them last longer, optimize firm costs by improving operational efficiencies, and increase revenues by better linking with stakeholders and exploiting emerging opportunities in the green markets. Consequently, we hypothesize that H1: Announcements of green strategic partnerships will pos- itively affect firm market value. Marketing versus technology capabilities in green strategic partnerships Organizational resources that are more unique and inimitable can become a better source of competitive advantage and have a greater value creation potential (Hunt 2011; Kozlenkova et al. 2014). Marketing literature suggests that marketing ca- pabilities might be difficult to imitate due to their social com- plexity (Eisend et al. 2015; Krasnikov and Jayachandran Table 1 Research examining the role of organizational resources in shaping the corporate environmentalism–financial performance relationship Empirical research Research question Empirical context Marketing factors considered Technology factors considered Relevant empirical findings Barnett and Salomon (2006) The role of a firm’s screening strategies in explaining the curvilinear relationship between CSR and firm’s financial performance Socially responsible mutual funds No No Screening based on the environmental performance was negatively related to the average risk-adjusted finan- cial returns of mutual funds Luo and Bhattacharya (2006) The role of customer satisfaction in informing the CSR–financial performance relationship Fortune 500 companies, multiple industries Yes No Customer satisfaction mediates the relationship between the CSR and firm financial performance Luo and Bhattacharya (2009) The role of CSR, marketing and R&amp;D factors in reducing firm risks Publicly-traded firms, multiple industries Yes Yes CSR can reduce firm-specific risks, but the ultimate effect will depend on advertising and R&amp;D strategies of a firm Surroca et al.

Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 2008). By contrast, knowledge related to technology capabil- ities is more likely to be codified and disclosed in patents, allowing competitors to build on or work around those inven- tions, and renders technology capabilities, to a greater degree, prone to imitation (Joshi and Nerkar 2011). In the green context, those discrepancies are presumably even more pronounced. Today, firms are expected to respond to the demands of diverse stakeholder groups beyond the tra- ditional customers, employees, channel members, and inves- tors (Ferrell et al. 2010). The disparate, often conflicting, per- spectives of various stakeholders need to be negotiated, bal- anced and aligned with firm economic objectives, which re- quires fine-tuned market intelligence, higher-order organiza- tional learning, cultural sensitivity and openness to opposing viewpoints - skills that are socially complex, tacit, and caus- ally ambiguous (Hillebrand et al. 2015; Mish and Scammon 2010). Furthermore, firms are not under any pressure to re- lease knowledge related to marketing capabilities in the public domain (Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008). In contrast, in the green context, technology capabilities are not only more likely to be codified and disclosed via patents as previously noted, but because of the social desirability of green technologies, firms might be under pressure to share those in the public domain to facilitate the diffusion of green practices in society. For example, after the commercial success of a Freon- free refrigerator co-developed by Foron and Greenpeace was proven, Greenpeace pressured its partner to make the technol- ogy available for free to other interested firms, to accelerate dissemination and ensure mass adoption of the innovation (Stafford et al. 2000). Thus, marketing capabilities are more difficult for competi- tors to imitate than technology capabilities are because the for- mer are less tangible and less formalized and based on experi- ential learning, whereas the latter are more likely to be codified and disclosed in the public domain due to social pressures. Thus, in the context of green strategic partnerships, marketing capabilities represent a better source of competitive advantage and have a greater potential to enhance firm performance than technology capabilities do (Hunt 2011). Accordingly, H2: Announcements of green marketing partnerships will have a greater positive impact on firm market value than announcements of green technology partnerships. Firms’ prior green performance and green strategic partnerships Corporate environmental performance can be negative, reflecting an environmentally reactive position of a firm, or it can be positive, reflecting a firm’s environmentally proac- tive stance. A reactive firm keeps environmental activities to a legal minimum for the mere purpose of reducing liabilities associated with non-compliance. An environmentally proac- tive firm goes beyond the legal minimums and voluntarily exceeds the environmental standards (Hart and Dowell 2010; Kärnä et al. 2003). Importantly, firms may demonstrate positive, proactive environmental behavior in some of their business operations, while exhibiting negative, reactive envi- ronmental practices in other functional areas (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lopez 2007). Prior green performance is indicative of green competen- cies and expertise a firm has developed and affects investors’ valuation of a firm’s future cash flow. Prior negative green performance suggests that a firm previously followed a course of actions that was minimally acceptable and mandatory for everyone, for example, installed a minimal end-of-pipe pollu- tion control equipment to ensure that emissions did not exceed a specific threshold. By following this path, a firm incurred costs associated with environmental policy compliance but did not acquire any green expertise because anyone can follow the same nominal strategy (Hunt 2011; Leonidou and Leonidou 2011). Although an announcement of a green part- nership might signal that a firm intends to improve its envi- ronmental performance, because a firm has no unique envi- ronmental expertise to be leveraged with marketing and tech- nology capabilities in a green partnership, such a firm is sub- ject to higher liability risks and poor financial performance. In contrast, prior positive green performance indicates that a firm has been consistently working on improving its environ- mental performance. A firm’s proactive environmental position has already been ingrained in investors’ minds and built into their expectations of a firm’s future cash flow. Announcement of one more environmentally positive action is consistent with the status quo and will not change the stock market valuation of a firm. Thus, H3a: A firm’s prior negative green performance will be neg- atively associated with a change in the stock market value of the firm in response to announcements of green strategic partnerships. H3b: A firm’s prior positive green performance will not have an effect on the stockmarket value of the firm in response to announcements of green strategic partnerships. Industry pollution intensity and green strategic partnerships Extant literature suggests that certain industry attributes can have a differential effect on the stock market valuation of stra- tegic partnerships. Industries vary in terms of their pollution intensity—the average emission rates of various pollutants as- sociated with industry activities. In industries that produce high pollution levels, so-called Bdirty^ industries such as petroleum production or chemical industries, firms face higher liability J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 255 risks and are subject to greater scrutiny and more stringent environmental regulations (Varadarajan 2015). Research has shown that firms under unfavorable regulatory regimes assume higher costs of capital (Filbeck and Gorman 2004). Moreover, in those Bstigmatized^ industries, environmental costs comprise a sizable portion of firms’ total operational costs. To improve environmental performance, firms undergo significant upgrades of operations far above and beyond pol- lution prevention measures that are small in scale and easy to implement (Diestre and Rajagopalan 2011). Advanced tech- nological modernizations for improving firms’ environmental performance result in escalating costs and rapidly diminishing returns on investments (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lopez 2007; Hart and Ahuja 1996). Hence, in dirtier industries, cost-related benefits of environmental improvements achieved in a green partnership will be lower than in less dirty economy sectors. Furthermore, in dirtier industries, the potential of market- ing capabilities to leverage a firm’s green expertise for value creation purposes might be limited due to weaker stakeholder linking. According to a recent study (Barnett and King 2008), people often hold persistent, unquestioned beliefs regarding the potential ecological threats posed by highly polluting in- dustries and do not discriminate between the firms that act responsibly and improve their environmental performance and those that do not. As a result of the negative reputational commons associated with the industry as a whole, stake- holders push for more stringent control and liability measures for the total population of firms in the industry, rather than underachievers alone (Barnett and King 2008). The finance literature also suggests the persistence of the negative Bhalo effect^when the wrongdoings of a few firms might have long- term negative financial consequences for the whole industry (Jarrell and Peltzman 1985; Mitchell 1989). Thus, H4a: All other things being equal, industry pollution intensity is negatively related to the change in firm’s stock market value in response to announcements of green strategic partnerships. With respect to the past performance of firms operating in pollution-intensive industries, prior positive green perfor- mance suggests that a firm has already developed some envi- ronmental expertise. However, it also indicates that a firm has implemented at least some voluntary upgrades in excess of legal minimums. Given the disproportionally high negative environmental impact of those industries and the higher- than-average environmental compliance costs incurred by in- dustry incumbents, further and more advanced environmental improvements would require substantial technological mod- ernization of firm operations, which is highly risky and as- sumes escalating operational costs (Hart and Ahuja 1996). As industry Bdirtiness^ and the complexity of modernizations increase, the rising costs of upgrades would gradually offset the savings gained from the improvements implemented. In contrast, prior negative green performance indicates that a firm did not invest in environmental upgrades and presum- ably faced higher ecological liability risks in the past. An announcement of a green partnership would signal a firm’s intentions to improve its environmental performance. For Bhigh polluters^who just started implementing environmental upgrades, there are still sufficient opportunities for improve- ments via low-cost pollution-prevention measures, even in the context of dirtier industries (Aragon-Correa and Rubio-Lopez 2007). For those firms, improvements in environmental per- formance would lead to lower liabilities and better financial performance in the future. Therefore, H4b and (c): As the level of industry pollution intensity in- creases, a firm with more negative (positive) green per- formance in the past will experience higher (lower) returns to announcements of green strategic partnerships. The theoretical model is summarized in Fig. 1. Research methodology To test the theory herein proposed, we use event study and regression analyses. The event study allows for testing the causal effects of green partnership announcements on a change in firmmarket value (Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009). Through cross-sectional analyses, we explore the determinants of the magnitude of change in firm market value in response to green partnership announcements. Event study design The event study methodology is based on the efficient market hypothesis, which argues that at any moment a stock market price reflects all information regarding that stock in the public domain up to that point (Brown and Warner 1985). The meth- odology allows the impact of an event to be measured by examining the change in stock price when the event becomes public knowledge. We calculate the abnormal return for the stock of a firm i on the day t as follows: ARit ¼ Rit–NRit; where ARit is the abnormal return for a firm i on day t, Rit is the actual return for a firm i on day t, and NRit is the predicted return of a firm i on day t. The event date is labeled as time t = 0. To predict NRit, we utilize the market index model: NRit ¼ αi þ βiRmt þ εit 256 J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 where αi and βi represent ordinary least squares estimates of the regression coefficients, Rmt is the equal-weighted market return on day t, and εit is an independent and identically dis- tributed disturbance term. We estimate NRit over a period of 255 days that ends 30 days before the event date, assuming that during the estimation period no information regarding the event of interest is released. We calculate the cumulative ab- normal return (CAR) of a firm i as the sum of daily abnormal returns over the event window [t1, t2]: CARi t1; t2½  ¼ X t2 t1 ARit We estimate the abnormal return on the day of announce- ment and the cumulative abnormal returns over the various event windows within 10 days either side of the announce- ment day to control for information leaks and delayed stock market reaction to partnership news. To assess whether the average cumulative abnormal returns are significantly differ- ent from zero, we use a combination of the parametric Patell’s standardized residual method and the non-parametric general- ized sign test (Kothari and Warner 2006). Data collection We define an event of interest as a public announcement of a strategic partnership between a publicly traded company and other organizations in the market, with the explicit environmen- tal objectives stated in the announcement. To test the proposed research hypotheses, we collected a dataset of green partner- ships announced by publicly traded US companies over the period of 2005–2007. First, we used the KLD Research and Analytics Database to obtain a list of firms for which an inde- pendent, third-party assessment of the environmental perfor- mance is available. For those firms, we searched the Corporate Register database, which provides access to CSR reports of the largest global corporations. We performed a con- tent analysis of the reports to identify information related to green strategic partnerships. Next, we searched Lexis-Nexis, FACTIVA, newswire services and company websites to identi- fy the dates of the first information releases. If there was ambi- guity regarding the precise announcement date, we excluded that announcement from the dataset. We checked for contem- poraneous financial (dividend announcements) and manage- ment (mergers and acquisitions, other partnerships, law suits, environmental awards, executive management changes, new product launches) announcements. If any such events had oc- curred in 3 days either side of the announcement day, we re- moved these announcements from the dataset. We also exclud- ed minor, short-term events that were unlikely to impact the stock market valuation of a firm, e.g., a 1-day computer recycling event organized by a manufacturer in the distributor’s location. The final dataset was composed of 54 observations for 2005, 64 observations for 2006 and 83 observations for 2007, 190 events in total. Stock market data were obtained from the Centre for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Variables Dependent variable The dependent variable is a firm’s short-term abnormal stock returns, estimated using the event study methodology de- scribed above. Independent variables Partnership type We operationalized a partnership type as a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if a firm announced a green marketing partnership and a value of 0 if it announced a green technology partnership. Examples of each type of green partnerships are provided in Table 2. Firms’ prior green performance (positive vs. negative)We operationalized a firm’s prior green performance based on the environmental indices from the KLD Research and Analytics database. The KLD environmental indices represent a set of six Bstrengths^ and seven Bconcerns^ reflective of how firms allo- cate resources with respect to environmental performance. The Bstrengths^ refer to a firm’s positive environmental actions (i.e., reliance on renewable energy, use of recycled materials, or commitment to voluntary environmental programs). The Bconcerns^ indicate that a substantial portion of firm revenues come from hazardous chemicals or that a firm falls behind industry competitors in environmental improvements or has high environmental liabilities (KLD Research and Analytics, Inc. 2003). A firm can have a variety of strengths and concerns and can be evaluated as Bgreen-positive^ in some of its busi- ness operations and Bgreen-negative^ in others. Following oth- er studies in the field, we transformed the individual environ- mental indices to form the aggregate measure of the Prior Positive Green Performance by summing all the strengths and the aggregate measure of the Prior Negative Green Performance by summing all the concerns. However, we did not aggregate them further to obtain a single measure of a firm’s prior green performance because prior research has shown that environmental strengths and environmental con- cerns are related but theoretically and empirically distinct con- structs (Delmas and Doctori-Blass 2010; Mattingly and Berman 2006). Industry pollution intensityWe operationalized industry pol- lution intensity based on the capital expenditures associated with pollution abatement activities in that industry (Klassen andMcLaughlin 1996; Zaim 2004). Data on industry pollution abatement costs are available from the Pollution Abatement J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 257 Costs and Expenditures (PACE) reports provided by the U.S. Census Bureau every 2 to 5 years. We used the PACE report 1999, published in 2002. The next report, PACE report 2005, was published in 2008. Control variables We also controlled for firm reputation, firm size, firm partner- ship experience, financial leverage, firm book-to-market ratio and stock market beta, year and industry effects. Table 3 pro- vides the details of the variables and sources from which the data were drawn. Model specification The decision of a firm to undertake a strategic move can be influenced by certain private information not observable by stock markets (Prabhala and Li 2007). Some firms might be more motivated to pursue green strategies than others (Margolis et al. 2009). Accordingly, we used the two-stage Heckman (1979) selection model to control for selection bias due to systematic differences between the firms that choose to engage in green partnerships and those that do not. Selection model with Heckman procedure In the first stage, we obtained a matched sample portfolio consisting of publicly listed firms that did not announce green strategic partnerships during the period under study. Consistent with prior literature, we selected the matched firms based on the same industry sector and similar market capital- ization (+/− 20%) for the same year (Homburg et al. 2014; Purnanandam and Swaminathan 2004). In a few cases, when the announcing firm was the largest one and no other firm satisfied a selection criterion of similar size, we matched the firms with the second largest company in that industry. We then ran a probit selection model in which firms’ choices to engage in a green strategic partnership were coded as 1 and as 0 if they chose to abstain. Based on a literature review (Gulati 1998; Kale et al. 2002; Shan et al. 1994), the following factors were included as likely to affect firm decisions to form green strategic partnerships: firm age, market capitalization, firm sales, firm financial leverage, firm market share, firm partner- ship experience, industry competitive intensity, industry growth rate, and industry and year-specific effects. A dummy was also included to control for the industries with more strin- gent environmental regulations (chemicals SIC 28xx, metals SIC 33xx, paper SIC 26xx and petroleum SIC 2911). Firms in those industries are subject to greater scrutiny and may be more motivated to pursue green efficiencies (Cho and Patten 2007). For the full details regarding the variables and data sources, please refer to Table 3. Because some firms in the dataset announced more than one partnership, we estimated a model with robust errors and clustered events. Decision to form a green partnership=f(Firm Age, Firm Market Capitalization; Firm Financial Leverage; Firm Sales; Market Share; Partnership Experience; Industry Competitive Intensity; Industry Growth; Environmentally Sensitive Industries; Industry Effects; Time Effects). The results of the first-stage selection model are provided in Table W2 (web appendix). We used the resulting parame- ters to calculate the inverse Mills ratio lambda and included it as an additional explanatory variable in the second-stage mod- el to control for selection bias. Second-stage model The dependent variable is a firm’s abnormal returns, estimated in the event study. The independent variables include industry pollution intensity, firm’s prior positive green performance, firm’s prior negative green performance and the interaction terms of industry pollution intensity with prior positive and negative green performance.Wemean-centered the concerned variables before creating the interaction terms. The model also controls for partnership type, firm size as measured by firm sales, firm financial leverage, firm reputation, firm partnership Announcement of a Green Strategic Partnership Firm Market Value Partnership Type Firm’s Prior Negative Green Performance Industry Pollution Intensity H1 H2 H3a H4a H4b Firm’s Prior Positive Green Performance H3b H4c Fig. 1 Theoretical model 258 J. of the Acad.

Results The dataset comprises 190 partnerships announced by 59 com- panies over the period 2005–2007 and includes 83 green mar- keting partnerships and 107 green technology partnerships. Of the 59 firms, 27were engaged in both greenmarketing and green technology partnerships. Among those preferring one or another partnership type, 5 firms were exclusively engaged in green mar- keting partnerships, 7 firms repeatedly engaged in exclusively green technology partnerships. Twenty firms announced only once, either a green marketing or green technology partnership. The average firm market capitalization was $40 963.2 million. The dataset covers three broad economy sectors including 16 industries, as described by 2-digit SIC codes. The food, textile, chemical sector (SIC 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29) comprised 65 part- nerships, or 34% of the dataset. The plastic, metal, and machin- ery sector (SIC 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37) comprised 55 partnerships, or 29%. The transportation and public utilities sector (SIC 40, 42, 48, 49) constituted 70 partnerships, or 37%of the dataset. Table 4 provides descriptive statistics and correlations. To explore the effects of green partnership announcements, an event study using the market model estimation procedure was implemented. The results demonstrate that stock markets do not react significantly to the aggregate announcements of green partnerships. The aggregation of announcements of dif- ferent types might obscure the relationships that exist. After the dataset was split into green marketing versus green tech- nology partnerships, an analysis of the daily abnormal returns for the 20 days around the announcements reveals that the day of the event and 1 day after show significant stock market reactions. The results are shown in Table 5. Consistent with prior studies in the field (Chaney et al. 1991; Homburg et al. 2014), the event windows with the sig- nificant parametric and non-parametric statistics in both part- nership categories were selected for further analysis. Green marketing partnerships reported positive average ab- normal returns (+.31%), p &lt; 0.01, on the day of an announce- ment t = 0 and cumulative abnormal returns (+.49%), p &lt; 0.05, on the next day. Green technology partnerships reported neg- ative average abnormal returns (−.25%), p &lt; 0.05, on the day of an announcement t = 0 and cumulative average abnormal returns (−.32%), p &lt; 0.05, on the next day. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the daily (MAR line) and cumulative abnormal returns (MCAR line) following announcements of green marketing partnerships and green technology partnerships, respectively, for the event window (−10, +10). The results of mean difference tests for green marketing versus green technology partnerships for both the day of an announcement t = 0 and for the event window (0; +1) also confirm that average abnormal returns (AARs) differ across partnership types at a significance level of p &lt; .05, with the marketing partnership sample reporting positive means and the technology partnership sample reporting negative means (Table W1, web appendix). Thus, H2 is supported.

Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 259 We also checked whether the observed difference in stock market reaction towards announcements of green marketing versus green technology partnerships can be explained by industry attributes, such as technological turbulence. The pre- vailing view in the strategic management literature is that in high-tech industries, technology partnerships outperformmar- keting ones, and the opposite is true for the mature low-tech industries (Das et al. 1998). Our dataset includes a good mix of high- and low-tech industries, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Heckler 2005). The green marketing sample has a nearly equal split of 43 partnerships announced by firms in operating in low-tech industries and 40 partnerships an- nounced by companies in high-tech economy sectors. The green technology sample comprises 62 partnerships an- nounced by firms in low-tech industries and 45 partnerships announced by firms in high-tech industries. The mean differ- ence tests conducted on the aggregate sample, as well as sep- arately on the green marketing and green technology subsam- ples, show no statistically significant difference in mean ab- normal returns for the low-tech versus high-tech industries for any of the event windows. From the short-term perspective, irrespective of the industry technological turbulence, an- nouncements of green marketing partnerships consistently generate higher abnormal stock returns than announcements of green technology partnerships do. Next, we estimated the long-term abnormal returns to an- nouncements of green strategic partnerships using a long- horizon event study method that allows researchers to test for abnormal returns spread over long horizons, usually 1 to 5 years (Kothari and Warner 2006). In line with the literature and following the recommendations presented in a recent re- view of methodological issues in long-horizon event studies by Ang and Zhang (2011), we used two alternative estimation approaches, the buy-and-hold abnormal returns approach and the calendar-time portfolio returns with the Fama-French benchmark. Due to a relatively small sample size, a 1-year horizon was utilized (Kolari and Pynnönen 2010). The buy-and-hold long-term abnormal returns (BHAR) ap- proach is reflective of a strategy of investing into the stock that completed the event of interest and selling it at the end of the pre-determined holding period. We estimated the BHAR ab- normal returns as compounded monthly returns over a 1-year period on a Fama-French benchmark. The calendar-time port- folio long-term abnormal return approach is based on estimat- ing calendar-time portfolio returns for the firms completing the event of interest and calibrating whether those returns are Table 3 Variables and data sources Variable Description Source Dependent variable: Firm’s abnormal stock returns Estimated with event study, CRSP Independent variables: Partnership type Dummy, marketing partnership (1), technology partnership (0) Press Releases Firm’s prior positive green performance Aggregate of firm’s environmental strengths KLD Database Firm’s prior negative green performance Aggregate of firm’s environmental concerns KLD Database Industry pollution intensity Industry pollution abatement costs Pollution Abatement Costs Report, U.S. Census Bureau 2002 Firm reputation Firm reputation index Fortune’s Most Admired Companies Ranking Firm market share Firm’s sales relative to total industry sales COMPUSTAT Firm sales Firm sales COMPUSTAT Firm market capitalization Firm market capitalization COMPUSTAT Firm financial leverage Firm’s long-term debt relative to firm’s total assets COMPUSTAT Firm partnership experience Number of partnerships firm engaged in 5 years preceding the announcement Thompson SDC Platinum Firm book-to-market value ratio Book-to-market value of equity COMPUSTAT Firm betas Stock betas computed prior to the event over −275 to −25 days Event study Firm age Number of years since firm foundation Firm SIC filings Industry growth Average 3-year sales growth of the industry COMPUSTAT Industry competitive intensity Inverse Herfindahl-Hirschman index COMPUSTAT Industry SIC Industry dummies COMPUSTAT Industry sensitive to environmental regulations Dummy for SIC 26xx, 28xx, 2911, 33xx COMPUSTAT Year of partnership announcement Year dummies Press Releases 260 J. of the Acad.

Both the BHAR approach and the calendar-time portfolio approach have their weaknesses and limitations. BHAR approach is known to produce inflated estimates due to compounding effects (Ang and Zhang 2011), whereas the calendar-time portfolio ap- proach is criticized for having very low power and being over- ly conservative (Kothari and Warner 2006). To address these criticisms and ensure the robustness of the results, we used both approaches. Table 6 shows the results of the analysis. The long-term abnormal returns following the news of green marketing part- nerships were not significantly different from zero using either of the two estimation approaches. By contrast, the results for green technology partnerships show positive and statistically significant abnormal returns of approximately 6% of firmmar- ket value if estimated with the BHAR model and 4% if esti- mated using a more conservative calendar-time portfolio with- in 1 year after the announcement. Despite the initial negative reaction of investors, firms were still able to accrue positive financial returns following the green technology partnership announcements but over a longer period. Thus, based on the results of both short-term and long-term event studies, we found support for H1. To test H3a,b and 4a,b,c, we ran cross-sectional analysis. The dataset is longitudinal in nature, wherein some firms an- nounced once and others made multiple announcements over the observed period. In this case, a mixed linear model design was deemed appropriate because it allows researchers to ac- count for unobserved heterogeneity and control for the corre- lated errors among observations nested within firms over time. We specified a mixed model with random intercepts and ran- dom slopes reflective of the individual firm and time effects and a set of covariates. The dependent variable is firm abnormal returns on the announcement day t = 0. We used with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation procedure (Müller et al. 2013). To examine goodness of fit and identify the best model, we tested the baseline Model 1 with control variables only vs. Model 2 with controls and main effects vs. full Model 3 with the controls, main effects and interaction terms. To compare the models, we used the traditional log-likelihood estimator and the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), which penalizes more complex models, lead- ing to the optimal, most parsimonious one (Schwarz 1978). The model specification that minimizes the log-likelihood and BIC estimators indicates the model that best fits the observed data. The results (Table W3, web appendix) indicate that Model 3, which includes the controls, main effects and inter- action terms and decomposes the direct effects of the industry pollution intensity and a firm’s past environmental perfor- mance, positive and negative, performs best, reporting the lowest log-likelihood and BIC estimators. We report the results of the cross-sectional analysis in Table 7. The partnership type variable is a positive and signi- ficant determinant of AARs (p &lt; 0.01), which supports H2. Consistent with the results of the event study, in the short run, green marketing partnerships generated higher abnormal returns than green technology partnerships. Similarly, the firm past negative performance variable is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.05), supporting H3a. The impact of an announcement of a green partnership on a firm stock market value is lower if a firm had a history of poor environmental performance. As pre- dicted, we did not observe a significant effect of firm’s past positive performance on the stock market valuation of green partnerships. Thus, H3b is supported. The industry pollution intensity variable is a negative and significant determinant of AARs (p &lt; 0.05), confirming H4a. As industry pollution inten- sity increases, firms experience lower abnormal returns. Furthermore, we observed that the interaction term of the Table 4 Descriptive statistics and correlations, main model N Mean Std. dev. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 AAR (day 0) 190 −0.05 12.58 1.00 2 CAR (0; +1) 190 0.01 16.11 .64** 1.00 3 Partnership type 190 0.44 0.50 .22** .25** 1.00 4 Firm sales (ln) 190 10.10 1.03 0.01 0.00 −0.05 1.00 5 Firm reputation 130 6.72 0.82 0.00 0.02 −0.08 .43** 1.00 6 Partnership experience 190 1.41 0.90 .16* .15* 0.02 .30** −.20* 1.00 7 Firm’s financial leverage 190 0.21 0.10 −0.09 −0.10 −0.11 −0.45 −.40** −.19** 1.00 8 Stock market betas 190 0.90 0.29 0.03 0.05 0.08 .234* 0.14 0.08 −.17* 1.00 9 Book-to-market value ratio 144 0.44 0.21 .26** 0.00 −0.03 0.03 −0.15 0.10 .27** 0.03 1.00 10 Industry Pollution Intensity 180 2.63 0.47 −0.02 −0.02 −0.08 −.36** −0.05 −0.06 .31** −.21** .20* 1.00 11 Firm’s prior positive green performance 148 −71.89 33.10 −0.09 −0.08 .23** −.35** −.32** −0.02 −0.10 −0.06 −.29** −.41** 1.00 12 Firm’s prior negative green performance 148 45.81 23.42 0.01 0.15 0.04 0.13 0.04 .27** −.26** 0.13 −.40** −.28** 0.10 **p &lt; .01, *p&lt; .05 J. of the Acad.

Thus, H4c is supported. Finally, the inter- action term of the industry pollution intensity and firm’s past negative green performance was not significant, although the direction was as predicted. H4b is not supported. In addition to the predicted effects, we also obtained insights into additional factors that affect the stock market valuation of green partnerships. The Firm Sales variable is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that larger firms gain less from announcements of green partnerships. The partnership experi- ence variable is positive and moderately significant (p &lt; 0.1), which is consistent with the established view in the strategy literature that firms with stronger partnership capabilities select most attractive partners and establish partnerships with higher value creation potential. Finally, the firm financial leverage var- iable is negative and significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that as firm debt increases, investors become more pessimistic about firm investments into environmental initiatives. Themodel was also re-estimated for the event window (0; +1). Six out of seven parameters associated with the hypotheses remained stable in terms of direction and significance. The effect of industry pollution intensity became non-significant, but the sign was preserved as hypothesized. Additional robustness checks To further increase confidence in the results, we performed var- ious robustness checks. First, we re-estimated firms’ abnormal returns with the alternative Fama-French-Carhart four-factor Table 5 Green strategic partnerships, cumulative abnormal returns over different event windows (−t1, + t2), market model estimations Green marketing partnerships Green technology partnerships Event window N Mean CAR Patell Z Generalized sign Z N Mean CAR Patell Z Generalized sign Z (−7, +7) 83 0.84% 1.63 0.96 107 0.04% 0.79 0.93 (−6, +6) 83 0.55% 1.05 0.96 107 −0.09% 0.34 0.55 (−5, +5) 83 0.50% 1.08 1.62 107 −0.09% 0.28 0.74 (−4, +4) 83 0.39% 0.98 1.40 107 −0.25% −0.18 0.16 (−3, +3) 83 0.69% 1.84* 2.94** 107 −0.12% 0.14 −0.03 (−3, +2) 83 0.75% 2.40** 2.06* 107 −0.16% −0.11 0.35 (−2, +3) 83 0.71% 2.01* 2.28* 107 −0.20% −0.21 0.35 (−2, +2) 83 0.77% 2.64** 2.50** 107 −0.24% −0.52 0.16 (−1, +2) 83 0.54% 2.19* 1.84* 107 −0.09% 0.14 1.13 (−2, +1) 83 0.62% 2.43** 3.16*** 107 −0.39% −1.37 −1.774* (−1, +1) 83 0.40% 1.93* 2.28* 107 −0.24% −0.76 −0.23 (−1,0) 83 0.63% 3.07** 2.06* 107 −0.16% −0.66 −1.774* (0) 83 0.31% 2.68** 3.38*** 107 −0.25% −2.03* −1.97* (0, +1) 83 0.49% 3.01* 2.50** 107 −0.32% −1.94* −1.77* (0, +2) 83 0.63% 3.07* 2.06** 107 −0.16% −0.66 −1.774* **p &lt; .01, *p&lt; .05 -0.40% -0.20% 0.00% 0.20% 0.40% 0.60% 0.80% 1.00% 1.20% 1.40% 1.60% 1.80% -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A bn or m al r et ur ns , % Days Green Marketing Partnerships MAR MCAR Fig. 2 Daily average abnormal return (MAR) and cumulative abnormal returns (MCAR), green marketing partnerships 262 J. of the Acad. Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 model (Carhart 1997; Fama and French 1993). The results (Table W4, web appendix) were similar to those obtained with the market model, confirming that on the announcement day t = 0, in both partnership categories, stock markets report statis- tically significant abnormal returns to announcements of green partnerships. However, for the event window (0; +1), green technology partnerships report a non-significant non-parametric rank test, which suggests that the results might be driven by influential outliers. This finding confirms that AARs observed on the day of an announcement t = 0 are themost appropriate for cross-sectional analysis. Second, we re-estimated a cross- sectional model with regression with robust standard errors and clustered events, an alternative estimation approach used when data are heteroscedastic and intra-group correlations are suspected. The results of the regression with robust standard errors and clustered events (Table W5, web appendix) replicate those reported in Table 7. Finally, we re-estimated the expanded version of a cross-sectional model with the mixed model design by including additional firm and industry controls, namely firm market share, industry growth, and industry competitive intensi- ty variables. All the hypothesized relationships remained stable in terms of their sign and significance. None of the additional controls was significant, and the model fit did not improve sig- nificantly. For reasons of parsimony, we retained a shorter ver- sion of the cross-sectional model and reported the results as our main findings. Discussion and implications for theory and practice We designed this study to explore the impact of green strategic partnerships on firm financial performance. Overall, our find- ings have implications for theories of CSR, organizational capabilities, and marketing-finance interface. Theoretical implications To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore an increasingly relevant type of corporate environmental practice- green strategic partnerships, and their contribution to the stock market performance of a firm and the boundary conditions under which the economic gains are maximized. Our findings demonstrate that stock markets are selective in reacting to announcements of green partnerships, and some of those initiatives can, in fact, destroy shareholder value. In the short term, green marketing partnerships systemati- cally outperform green technology partnerships, which offers a contrasting view to previous research. Historically, varia- tions in the valuation of different types of inter-firm collabo- rations have been explained by industry dynamism (see, for example, Park et al. 2004; Song et al. 2005). According to the traditional point of view, in high-tech industries, technology partnerships would be more greatly rewarded by stock mar- kets than marketing partnerships because the former spur or- ganizational innovation, which is a better source of competi- tive advantage under the conditions of volatile and rapidly changing high-tech industries. In contrast, our research dem- onstrates that irrespective of industry dynamism, green mar- keting partnerships can be superior and generate greater returns than green technology partnerships do. This finding contributes to the emerging stream of marketing literature ad- vocating for the relative advantage of marketing over technol- ogy resources and elevates marketing’s position in the hierar- chy of organizational functions (Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008; Mishra and Modi 2016).

Mark. Sci. (2017) 45:251–267 263 An emerging stream of research has begun to examine the inter- play of organizational capabilities with firm CSR and explore their joint value creation potential (Luo and Bhattacharya 2009; Mishra and Modi 2016; Servaes and Tamayo 2013). We extend this line of research by explicitly outlining the pathways through which firm marketing and technology capabilities can be com- bined with environmental expertise to gain eco-based competi- tive advantage in the context of strategic partnerships. We also quantify the effect of green marketing versus green technology inter-firm strategies on shareholder wealth. Third, we contribute to advancing research on the marketing- finance interface. Many studies examining the association be- tween firm CSR and shareholder value focus on the short-term implications and analyze the immediate stock market reaction to firm CSR news. This study takes a step further and analyzes both the short-term and long-term consequences of green CSR, revealing an interesting reverse trend. Initially, green tech- nology partnerships negatively affect firm value but later expe- rience upward stock market price’s adjustments. This trend sug- gests that financial markets are unable to immediately recognize the economic value of green technologies and incorporate it into the stock market price with a drift. Over time, as uncertainty associated with green innovation projects diminishes, investors revise and update their expectations regarding future cash flow, which results in positive abnormal returns (Sorescu et al. 2007).1 Moreover, a legacy of prior environmental performance can drive investor sentiment towards green partnerships. In contrast to the argument in the extant literature that CSR may protect firms in times of crisis and offset negative conse- quences (Schnietz and Epstein 2005), we show that stock markets are, in general, insensitive to information about prior positive environmental behavior and do not amend for that. As levels of pollution intensity in industry increase, firms might even be penalized for being environmentally responsi- ble. Investors also become skeptical if a green partnership is announced by a firmwith a history of poor green performance, which reinforces the idea of general investor conservatism regarding green partnerships. The reason for stock market conservatism can be a lack of experience in CSR and green partnerships in particular. Green collaborations have only recently become a widespread phe- nomenon, and investors might not have enough expertise to 1 We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this insight.

Environmental quality in some of its aspects is a public good andmarket prices often do not exist for those (Reinhardt 2000). Lacking reliable information about costs and benefits of green initiatives, investors tend to be more conservative and discount their future value. Implications for managers We offer valuable insights for managerial practice as well. First, our results reliably suggest that green partnerships can be instrumental in carrying out firms’ environmental strategies and generate economic gains. At the same time, managers must be aware that not all of those initiatives generate imme- diate positive returns. Based on the sample of firms studied, announcements of green marketing partnerships, on average, led to a $126.99 million increase in firm market value on the day of an announcement. By contrast, a firm’s market value decreased, on average, by $102.41 million on the day when a green technology partnership was announced. Nevertheless, 1 year after an announcement of a green technology partner- ship, the firms concerned reported an average increase of $1638.52 million in stock market value. Managers interested in greening firm operations can choose alternative pathways to allocate firm resources to green marketing or green technology domains, based on their short-term and long-term goals. Firms should also pay attention to their environmental rep- utation. The results highlight the fact that Bdoing bad^ hurts more than Bdoing good^ helps. It is in the interest of firm shareholders that managers implement positive green strate- gies across all business domains and avoid negative green approaches altogether. At the same time, managers should be cognizant of the potential risks associated with green activism in pollution-intensive industries and that stock markets might not recognize those initiatives as investments with positive future cash flow. Limitations and suggestions for further research This study is not without limitations, which suggest avenues for future research. First, one of the major challenges of this study is related to the high heterogeneity of the sample due to the scarcity of green partnership data within any particular industry. Unobserved industry attributes may have affected the examined relationships. Over time, as the amount of data on green partnerships increases, future studies could explore whether the observed effects hold in more homogenous set- tings and whether other Bhidden^ relationships surface. Second, due to limitations associated with secondary data, this study focuses on US companies. It is possible that in other countries, stock markets exhibit different patterns of reacting to green partnership news. Future research could consider in- cluding data from, for example, European countries, where sustainability issues are of high importance. Third, in contrast to this study, which focuses on large, established firms, future research could explore how small and medium-sized compa- nies (SMEs) use green partnerships. SMEs comprise a major- ity of businesses worldwide, often lack necessary resources and might be more interested in pursuing green partnerships for efficiency reasons. Finally, the dataset in this study was dominated by partnerships with two partners only, as opposed tomulti-partner collaborations. Recent research suggests that a dyadic versus multiple-partner structure might drive investor valuation of strategic collaborations (Fang et al. 2016). Future studies could investigate whether green partnerships with mul- tiple partners, vertical and horizontal, make any difference to changes in stock returns.
