VAN HOUWELING University of California at Berkeley Candidates often make ambiguous statements about the policies they intend to pursue. In theory,ambiguity affects how voters make choices and who wins elections. In practice, measurement andendogeneity problems have impeded empirical research about the consequences of ambiguity. We conducted survey experiments that overcame these obstacles by manipulating a common form of ambiguity: the imprecision of candidate positions. Our data show that, on average, ambiguity does not repel and may, in fact, attract voters. In nonpartisan settings, voters who have neutral or positive attitudes toward risk, or who feel uncertain about their own policy preferences, tend to embrace ambiguity. In partisan settings, voters respond even more positively to ambiguity; they optimistically perceive the locations of ambiguous candidates from their own party without pessimistically perceiving the locations of vague candidates from the opposition. We further find, through analysis of two additional new data sets, that candidates often take—–and voters frequently perceive—–ambiguous positions like the ones in our experiments. The pervasive use of ambiguity in campaigns fits with our experimental finding that ambiguity can be a winning strategy, especially in partisan elections. Candidates for public office regularly make vaguestatements that leave voters uncertain about thepolicies they intend to pursue. In the United States, the Democratic Party was founded on a platform of ambiguity, which helped Andrew Jackson win the 1828 presidential election and build a broad coalition with diverse views (Aldrich 1995, 108–10). Modern U.S. candidates have proven just as willing to use ambiguity as a campaign strategy. Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush were renowned for taking fuzzy positions at crucial points during their successful runs for the presidency (Bartels 1988, 101), and Barack Obama captured the White House in 2008 while re- maining vague on key issues.1 Why do candidates employ ambiguity, and what are the consequences? A substantial theoretical literature has addressed these questions (Alesina and Cukierman Michael Tomz is Associate Professor, Department of Political Sci- ence, Stanford University, Encina Hall West, Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305-6044 (tomz@stanford.edu).

Empirical research has not proceeded apace, though, due to problems of measurement and endogeneity. Previous research has been hampered by inadequate measures of the ambiguity of candidate positions. Rec- ognizing this problem, some analysts have resorted to indirect estimation of uncertainty (Bartels 1986; Berin- sky and Lewis 2007; Campbell 1983; Gill 2005), and oth- ers have incorporated direct measures of uncertainty into specialized surveys (Alvarez and Franklin 1994; Brady and Ansolabehere 1989). Unfortunately, these studies reach contradictory conclusions, and they do not distinguish ambiguity from other sources of uncer- tainty.2 Previous research has also been limited by funda- mental problems of endogeneity. Politicians, thinking strategically, are most likely to make ambiguous state- ments to audiences who would not penalize them for being vague. And citizens will tend to know—–or at least report to know—–more about the issue positions of candidates they already like for other reasons. We overcame these problems of measurement and endogeneity by fielding survey experiments in which we manipulated the ambiguity of candidate platforms. In our experiments, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults chose between candidates who stated policy positions with varying levels of precision. Data from our experiments reveal that, on average, ambiguity does not repel and may, in fact, attract vot- ers. In nonpartisan settings, voters who have neutral or positive attitudes toward risk, or who feel uncertain about their own policy preferences, tend to embrace ambiguity. In partisan settings, voters respond even more positively to ambiguity; they optimistically per- ceive the locations of ambiguous candidates from their 2 Uncertainty is a psychological state in which voters are unsure about the policy positions of candidates. Ambiguity, in our usage, is an attribute of candidate position taking. Uncertainty arises not only when candidates make ambiguous statements, but also when voters fail to receive or correctly interpret campaign messages. 83 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Our findings imply that ambiguity can be a winning strategy, especially in partisan elections. In the remainder of this article, we explain why voters may be attracted to or repelled by candidates with am- biguous policy positions. We then discuss the findings and limitations of existing research about the conse- quences of candidate ambiguity. We next develop and analyze experiments that isolate the effects of ambigu- ity on voter perceptions and behavior. We also use two original data sets to gauge how well our experiments reflect the ambiguity of candidates in actual campaigns. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for campaign strategy and election outcomes. THEORETICAL APPROACHES Consider a unidimensional policy space in which one candidate takes a single stand and the other candidate represents a probability distribution over points in the issue space. Denote these two candidates as precise (P) and ambiguous (A). If voters have single-peaked utility functions, under what conditions would they prefer A over P? We discuss two approaches to this question. Expected Utility The first approach involves expected utility theory, which Shepsle (1972) and nearly all subsequent con- tributors have used to analyze choices between pre- cise and ambiguous candidates. In this framework, each voter evaluates candidates based on the satisfac- tion candidates are likely to bring. The expected util- ity from candidate P is simply EU(P) = u(p), where p represents the candidate’s position and u(.) is the voter’s utility function. The anticipated payoff from A is slightly more complicated because the voter can- not know in advance which outcome A will produce. The expected outcome from electing A is a probability- weighted average, E(A) ≡ µ = ∫a a f (a)da, where f (a) gives the probability density of each position a that the ambiguous candidate could take. Similarly, the ex- pected utility from selecting the ambiguous candidate is EU(A) = ∫a u(a) f (a)da. Whether the expected utility criterion favors the am- biguous candidate depends partly on the voter’s atti- tude toward risk, as reflected in the shape of u(.). Re- searchers commonly assume that voters are risk averse (Alvarez 1998; Bartels 1986; Enelow and Hinich 1981; Gill 2005) (i.e., they receive less utility from playing the lottery than from receiving its expected payoff with certainty, such that EU(A) &lt; u(µ)). Risk-averse voters would prefer the precise candidate whenever p = µ, and they might opt for the precise candidate even when the ambiguous one is closer (when |v − µ| &lt; |v − p|, where v is the voter’s ideal point), to avoid the risk that the ambiguous candidate could deliver an undesirable outcome. What if some voters are risk acceptant, and thus pre- fer gambles over their expected outcomes, such that EU(A) &gt; u(µ)? Shepsle (1972) analyzes the implica- tions of risk acceptance when an incumbent candidate, whose position is known with certainty, confronts a challenger who can pursue a strategy of ambiguity. If the incumbent were located at p, the challenger could win the support of risk-acceptant voters by adopting an ambiguous platform with mean value µ = p. More- over, even if v were closer to p than to µ, risk-acceptant voters might gamble on A in the hope of getting a favor- able outcome. Shepsle’s analysis identifies one reason why voters might prefer ambiguous candidates over precise alternatives.3 An important exception arises when the precise can- didate advocates a policy on the voter’s ideal point. In this situation and others like it, even risk-acceptant vot- ers (those with convex loss functions) would prefer the precise candidate. After all, when the precise candidate and the voter coincide, the voter cannot gain and may in fact lose by selecting the risky candidate (Bendor and Meirowitz 2004, 297; Page 1976, 747). Our empirical analysis, discussed later, exploits this fact to show why risk acceptance cannot explain the behavior of some participants in our experiments. Biased Probabilities To this point, we have assumed that people use objec- tive probabilities: they soberly evaluate where candi- dates are likely to stand, given the available informa- tion. We now relax this assumption and explore the possibility that voters have biased perceptions about the policies that ambiguous candidates actually favor. The first possibility is general optimism: when con- fronted with an ambiguous candidate, optimistic voters assume the candidate is closer to themselves than the facts warrant. Operationally, they perceive a proba- bility distribution more favorable to themselves than the evidence implies, resulting an expectation µI such that |v − µI | &lt; |v − µ|. This optimistic misperception, if present, should increase the likelihood that the voter would choose the ambiguous candidate over the pre- cise one. Previous research suggests the plausibility of this hypothesis. Psychological studies since the 1950s, for example, have documented that people systematically overestimate the probability of desirable events (e.g., Irwin 1953; Rosenhan and Messick 1966). Studies have also uncovered powerful evidence of a “false consen- sus effect,” in which people overestimate the proba- bility of agreement with others whose views are not already known. Importantly, people tend to make this mistake “regardless of their sentiment toward the group” (Krosnick 2002, 125). Across-the-board opti- mism should give ambiguous candidates a boost in competition against precise candidates. An alternative hypothesis holds that voters are se- lectively optimistic and pessimistic; they expand or 3 If voters are indifferent between gambles and their expected out- comes (i.e., EU(A) = u(µ)), they will prefer the ambiguous candi- date over the precise one when |v − µ| &lt; |v − p| and will like both candidates equally if |v − µ| = |v − p|. 84 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This idea is the focus of an extensive but currently inconclusive literature about how citi- zens project views onto candidates (Krosnick 2002). Democratic voters, for example, might exhibit posi- tive (proximity-enhancing) bias toward Democrats but negative (proximity-detracting) bias toward Republi- cans. When courting Democratic voters, then, ambi- guity could aid Democratic candidates but undermine Republican ones. Other Conditions That Favor Ambiguous Candidates These theories do not exhaust the set of interesting pos- sibilities. One could model utility not only as a function of the distance between the voter and the candidate, but also as a function of candidate traits that do not fit conveniently into the standard spatial framework. For example, voters in a complex world might value flexibility—–a willingness to adapt to changing circum- stances instead of clinging to singular positions. Candi- dates who take broad stands in campaigns may signal their flexibility and therefore score points in the eyes of some voters, especially ones who are not rigid about their own positions.4 Alternatively, ambiguity could evoke a negative re- action, even among voters who might otherwise sym- pathize with the range of positions in a candidate’s plat- form. As Campbell (1983, 278) conjectures, ambiguity could “hurt a candidate’s public image” by revealing the candidate as “evasive or spineless.” Thus, ambiguity could be consequential not only because it affects the assumed positions of candidates, but also because it informs judgments about candidates’ character. EXISTING EVIDENCE AND OBSTACLES TO INFERENCE Although ambiguous statements are ubiquitous in po- litical campaigns and have been a focus of sustained theoretical inquiry, we have surprisingly little evidence about how candidate ambiguity affects the preferences of voters. The handful of existing studies do not sepa- rate ambiguity from other sources of uncertainty, and they reach contradictory conclusions about uncertainty in toto. In his analysis of the 1980 U.S. presidential election, Bartels (1986, 709) found that voters disliked uncer- tainty about the issue positions of the leading candi- dates, and that uncertainty was “sufficiently pervasive and important to rival issue distances as a determinant of electoral choices.” In a similar vein, Brady and An- solabehere (1989) studied two unique data sets about the utility functions and vote choices of California res- idents. They concluded that citizens were risk averse 4 Psychologists have identified individual predilections for some- thing like flexibility versus decisiveness in traits such as need for closure. See, e.g., Webster and Kruglanski (1994). and therefore preferred candidates about whom they knew more (see also Alvarez 1998). Other studies, however, suggest that voters are not fazed by uncertainty. Campbell (1983) analyzed polling data from U.S. presidential elections during the years 1968 to 1980. Disagreement about the positions of can- didates, measured by the standard deviation of pub- lic perceptions, had “no discernible direct impact on electoral outcomes.” If anything, Campbell’s study im- plied that vagueness and other sources of uncertainty may help candidates when public opinion is dispersed, issues are salient, or the uncertain candidate’s views differ substantially from the electoral median. Berinsky and Lewis (2007) cast additional doubt on the hypothesis that voters dislike uncertainty. Using a new estimator for the power term in voters’ utility functions, they rejected the null hypothesis that Amer- ican voters are risk averse. Most, they argue, are risk neutral, neither punishing nor rewarding presidential candidates about whose positions they are uncertain. Finally, Morgenstern and Zechmeister (2001) found that many Mexican voters were risk acceptant, lead- ing them to gamble on the untested Partido Acción Nacional instead of supporting the “devil they knew,” the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional. Why have there been so few empirical studies, and why have they reached conflicting conclusions about a topic so central to democratic politics? Research has been stymied by inadequate data about candidate plat- forms and by seemingly insurmountable problems of endogeneity. Problems of Measurement The American National Election Study (NES) took a valuable step toward measuring candidate issue stances when it began asking respondents to locate candidates on seven-point issue scales. Unfortunately, most NES surveys do not directly measure individual perceptions about the precision of candidate platforms. Participants assign each candidate to a single point, usually without indicating how certain they feel or whether the can- didate might stand elsewhere (Weisberg and Fiorina 1980). Recognizing this problem, scholars have devoted much creative energy to developing indirect proxies for uncertainty about candidate positions. Bartels (1986) proposed one approach, based on the pattern of “don’t know” responses. Suppose that each person has a latent degree of uncertainty about where the candi- date stands; that people whose uncertainty exceeds a particular threshold refuse to place the candidate on the scale; and that uncertainty, although unobservable, varies with demographic and contextual variables that are present in the NES. One could then estimate a probit model of nonresponse, compute the predicted probability of nonresponse for each citizen with re- spect to each candidate and issue, and use the predicted probabilities as measures of uncertainty. Even proponents of the probit method acknowl- edge, however, that it “requires strong assumptions” (Berinsky and Lewis 2007, 144) and is “sufficiently 85 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Indeed, the two leading applications of this approach have reached opposite conclusions about the effects of uncertainty (Bartels 1986; Berinsky and Lewis 2007). Other scholars have used the sample distribution of issue placements as a measure of uncertainty. Camp- bell (1983) computed the standard deviation of public perceptions about each candidate’s position, and Gill (2005) calculated entropy scores. As Bartels (1986, 710) pointed out, however, there is no necessary connection between individual-level uncertainty and population- wide variability. If, for example, all voters were un- certain about a candidate’s position but had exactly the same expectation, standard deviations and entropy scores would overstate voters’ certainty. Conversely, if voters disagreed about where a candidate stood but were completely firm in their beliefs, standard devia- tions and entropy scores would overstate the uncer- tainty in voters’ minds. A few scholars have directly measured people’s cer- tainty about candidate positions. In a unique study, Alvarez and Franklin (1994) not only asked respon- dents to locate candidates on a scale, but also invited them to say whether they were “very certain, pretty certain, or not very certain” about where each candi- date stood (also see NES 1994 and 1996). Brady and Ansolabehere (1989) employed a related procedure by treating each person’s self-reported knowledge about a candidate as an index of their awareness of the candi- date’s position. Subjective measures of certainty hold much promise, but they are rarely available in standard surveys, and they leave open the question of whether point estimates reflect the mean, the mode, the worst case, the best case, or a random draw from the candi- date’s probability distribution. Moreover, none of these measures isolates the actual ambiguity in candidate position statements. Instead, each quantifies the total uncertainty arising from nu- merous sources, only one of which is the vagueness of candidate proclamations. Consequently, one cannot infer how much of the reaction is due to candidate vagueness versus other sources of uncertainty. Problems of Endogeneity Even without measurement problems, three sources of endogeneity make inference difficult. First, candidates are strategic: they take into account the likely reac- tion of voters when deciding how much information to reveal. Rational candidates avoid making vague state- ments to audiences who would react harshly against it, and they avoid speaking precisely when specificity would damage their electoral fortunes. Thus, the strate- gic behavior of candidates confounds efforts by re- searchers to detect the consequences of ambiguity. Second, voters are more attentive to candidates they like. People initially drawn to a candidate’s charisma, race, or experience, for example, may end up attending rallies and following media reports about the candi- date, and thereby learning about the candidate’s policy positions. Election primaries reinforce this pattern. Registered Democrats, for example, are especially likely to participate in Democratic primaries. They follow Democratic candidates throughout the primary season and accumulate information about their plat- forms. By the time the general election campaign be- gins, Democratic voters will know more about their party’s candidate than about the opposition. Thus, both psychological and institutional forces lead citi- zens to learn about the issue positions of candidates they already favor for other reasons. Unless somehow controlled, this endogeneity will cause researchers to overstate the costs of ambiguity. Finally, voters may overestimate the precision of po- sitions articulated by candidates they like. Ambiguity gives voters leeway to see what they want: to perceive a candidate as being similar to themselves. If citizens encounter a candidate who seems attractive on other grounds, they may perceive more of the candidate’s probability distribution as being piled near their own ideal point. In the extreme, voters may perceive the candidate as a probability spike over the most at- tractive point in the candidate’s range. When asked about the candidate’s level of ambiguity, voters may then report more precision than the facts warrant. In the minds of voters—–and therefore the data sets of researchers—–the vague candidate will appear artifi- cially precise, causing a downward bias in the estimated benefits of ambiguity. Taken together, problems of measurement and en- dogeneity pose seemingly insurmountable obstacles to studying the effects of candidate ambiguity. In the next section, we describe an experiment that overcomes these obstacles. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We designed an experiment to assess the effect of can- didate ambiguity on voter choice and embedded it in an Internet survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Our experiment involved three steps. First, we measured respondents’ preferences about the appropriate level of government services. Second, us- ing the same issue, we described the platforms of vague and precise candidates and asked which candidate re- spondents preferred. Third, we asked respondents to supply a point estimate for the location of a vague can- didate, and we collected data on the risk preferences of participants. Measuring Respondents’ Ideal Points The survey began by asking respondents about a key political issue, government provision of services. Fol- lowing the NES, we explained: “Some people think the government should provide fewer services even in areas such as health and education in order to reduce spending. Other people feel it is important for the government to provide many more services, even if it means an increase in spending.” We then asked respondents to select one of seven alterna- tives: increase services by a large, medium, or small 86 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The posi- tions were described verbally rather than numerically, though for convenience we sometimes use the integers one through seven as shorthand for the seven fully labeled options. As a follow-up, we asked half the participants how certain they were about their own position. The op- tions included extremely sure, very sure, moderately sure, slightly sure, and not sure at all. We assigned this question to only half the sample to guard against the possibility of priming. Respondents who expressed certainty about their own position, for example, might have felt pressure to choose precise candidates over vague ones with similar expected locations, in order to remain consistent with their stated level of certainty. As it turned out, our concerns about priming were un- warranted: respondents behaved similarly regardless of whether they had been asked about the firmness of their own position. Measuring Preferences about Candidates We then asked respondents to choose between two candidates, one vague and the other precise. “In the last election,” participants were told, “candidates were surveyed by a non-partisan group. We would like your views about two candidates, whose names will remain confidential.” Using the same issue and policy options that respondents had seen previously, we offered verbal and graphical summaries of the platforms of two can- didates (Figure 1a–c). The precise candidate took one of seven discrete positions on the scale. The ambigu- ous candidate, in contrast, advocated that “the gov- ernment should increase services” or that “the govern- ment should decrease services,” but in neither case said how much. Our description of the vague candidate was purposefully neutral. We avoided language that might have been taken as criticism or praise of ambiguity. After displaying the views of both candidates, we asked who the respondent preferred on that issue.5 Half the respondents encountered unbranded can- didates, who were identified by letters such as “A” and “B”; the other half encountered party branded candidates, who were labeled as Democrat and Re- publican. Each type offered unique opportunities for inference. By denoting some candidates with letters, we were able to test many theories of ambiguity in their purest form, without the potentially confounding effects of party. By denoting other candidates as Demo- crat and Republican, the design allowed us to study how partisanship—–one of the most powerful factors in electoral politics—–conditions the consequences of ambiguity.6 Respondents retained their initial assign- ments (unbranded or branded) for the duration of the interview. 5 We measured respondents’ preferences “on this issue” to keep the focus on government services and prevent people from choosing based on assumptions about the candidates’ views on other topics. 6 When candidates were party branded, we made sure the Demo- cratic candidate was at least as liberal as the Republican candidate. We also randomized the locations of candidates. Our stratified random assignment algorithm ensured, to the greatest extent possible, that each respondent had an equal chance of receiving one of four types of scenarios. In Type I, the precise candidate was closer to the voter (i.e., |v − p| &lt; |v − µ|, where v was the voter’s bliss point, p was the position of the precise candidate, and µ was the center of the vague candidate’s interval). Type II reversed the inequality, such that the ambiguous can- didate was the proximity favorite. Type III, a straddle tie, occurred when the precise candidate took a posi- tion at the center of the vague candidate’s interval (i.e., p = µ). Finally, Type IV, a reflected tie, arose when the respondent stood between the two candidates and was equidistant to them (i.e., p = µ and |v − p| = |v − µ|).7 Having asked about one pair of candidates, we in- vited respondents to consider another: “We are inter- ested in what you think about other candidates, as well. Here are the views of two different candidates about the level of government services and spending.” Once again, the precise candidate was randomly assigned to one of the seven discrete positions. The ambiguous can- didate, in contrast, took one of the three central ranges: increase medium to keep the same, increase small to decrease small, or keep the same to decrease medium. Because these positions were more cumbersome to de- scribe verbally, we leveraged respondents’ familiarity with our format by offering a graphical summary with- out a verbal description, as in Figure 1d.8 We ended this phase of the experiment by display- ing two more pairs of candidates, some of which we positioned to allow within-subject analysis of the ef- fects of ambiguity. Our method involved mimicking the earlier scenarios but, in each case, replacing the am- biguous candidate with a precise candidate who stood at the midpoint of the previous ambiguous interval. We presented these “precise scenarios” as if they in- volved entirely new candidates, rather than ones that respondents had already encountered.9 By studying the choices each voter made in the ambiguous scenario and its matching precise scenario, we inferred the voter’s response to changes in candidate ambiguity, holding other factors constant. 7 All voters were eligible to receive Types I to III, but only voters in the central positions could receive Type IV. This constraint arose because the vague platforms implied either µ = 2 or µ = 6 on the seven-point scale. Consequently, the probabilities of assignment for Types I, II, III, and IV were [1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4] when voters were at positions 3, 4, or 5, and [1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0] when voters were at positions 1, 2, 6, or 7. In Types I to III, candidates could, by chance, take the exact position of the respondent (i.e., v = p and/or v = µ). 8 With vague candidates in the central positions, implying µ = 3, 4, or 5, more voters became eligible for reflected ties. Thus, the prob- abilities of assignment for Types I, II, III, and IV were [1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4] when voters were at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but remained at [1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0] when voters were at positions 1 or 7. Our findings about the behavior of voters in scenario Type IV should be interpreted with this fact in mind. 9 When subjects had previously considered an ambiguous scenario in which two unbranded candidates were straddle tied (i.e., p = µ), we did not present a matched precise scenario because the two precise candidates would have been identical to each other in all respects except the letter identifying them. 87 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Measuring Preferences for Precise versus Ambiguous Candidates Note: Subjects received either unbranded or branded candidates for all scenarios. Measuring Expectations and Taste for Risk The third phase of our experiment investigated how citizens form expectations about the likely positions of vague candidates. Each respondent saw a single candidate who was randomly assigned to one of five vague intervals depicted with the now-familiar square bracket. The candidate was identified as Democrat or Republican in the party branded condition, or by a letter in the unbranded condition. “If you had to guess,” we asked,“which position do you think this candidate would actually take?” Respondents chose one of the three precise positions spanned by the bracket. 88 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Total sample size was 1,299 in the unbranded condition and 1,241 in the party branded condition. The averages at the bottom of the table are unweighted means. We closed the interview by assessing voters’ attitudes toward risk. “Some people like taking risks. Other people prefer to avoid taking risks whenever possible. What about you? Do you prefer to take risks, prefer to avoid taking risks, or don’t you have a preference either way?” 10 DATA AND FINDINGS The experiments discussed in this article were admin- istered by Knowledge Networks, an Internet-based polling firm, with support from the National Science Foundation. Knowledge Networks uses random digit dialing to recruit participants and provides Internet access to households, resulting in a nationally repre- sentative sample. The interviews took place in August 2007, and 1,001 people (76% of invitees) agreed to take the survey. The Average Effect of Ambiguity Table 1 shows the percentage of people who chose the ambiguous candidate in each of the four key politi- cal configurations: precise candidate closer (Type I), ambiguous candidate closer (Type II), straddle tie (Type III), and reflected tie (Type IV).11 The distance differential measures the voter’s absolute distance to 10 We placed this item last to avoid priming respondents to think about risk when selecting between vague and precise candidates. It is unlikely that people misreported their taste for risk to make it consistent with their earlier choices about candidates. Other ques- tions intervened between our initial vague–precise scenarios and our measure of risk propensity. Moreover, the risk question was not explicitly about politics, further minimizing the possibility of posttreatment contamination. 11 Most of the 1,001 respondents evaluated two or three distinct sce- narios in which an ambiguous candidate competed against a precise one. We treated each scenario as a separate observation, resulting in a total sample of 2,540 cases. We found no evidence of question order effects. Table 1 gives exact binomial confidence intervals. We the precise candidate, minus the voter’s absolute dis- tance to the midpoint of the ambiguous candidate’s interval (i.e., |v − p| − |v − µ|). The distance differen- tial ranged from –5 to 5; we grouped –4 with –5 and 4 with 5 to increase the sample sizes at the extremes. Table 1 reveals two clear patterns. First, proximity strongly influences the decisions of voters (see also Tomz and Van Houweling 2008). According to prox- imity theory, ambiguous candidates are at an electoral disadvantage when the distance differential is negative, but they enjoy an electoral advantage when the differ- ential is positive. Our data are highly consistent with this expectation. In the unbranded condition, support for the ambiguous candidate increased from a low of 4% when the difference differential was −4 or less, to a high of 94% when the ambiguous candidate enjoyed a proximity advantage of at least 4 points. Data from the party branded condition display an even stronger pattern. As the difference differential shifted from its minimum to its maximum value, the ambiguous can- didate went from having no supporters to enjoying almost unanimous backing.12 Second, and just as striking, ambiguity appears to carry no significant cost. Averaged across all scenarios in Table 1, with or without party brand names, respon- dents were as likely to choose the ambiguous candidate as they were to choose the precise one. Ambiguity proved innocuous even when restricting attention to ties, situations in which the voter was equidistant to the precise candidate and the midpoint of the vague candidate’s interval. In the unbranded condition, 48% also computed block-bootstrapped confidence intervals, which were no larger than the binomial intervals in Table 1. 12 The pattern is stronger because the effects of partisanship re- inforced the effects of proximity. In our experiment, Democratic candidates were always at least as liberal as Republican candidates. Moreover, Democratic voters are typically more liberal than Re- publican ones. Thus, most voters in our sample were closer to the candidate of their party than to the candidate of the opposite party. 89 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Within-Subject Tests of the Effects of Ambiguity (a) Was the voter attracted by ambiguity? (b) Was the voter repelled by ambiguity? ZY ZAYP Precise scenario Ambiguous scenario Attracted by ambiguity Not attracted by ambiguity ZY ZAYP Precise scenario Not repelled by ambiguity Ambiguous scenario Repelled by ambiguity of voters who faced ties liked the ambiguous candi- date more than the precise one. In the party branded condition, 56% of ties went to the ambiguous candi- date, suggesting that ambiguity benefitted candidates in partisan elections. We return to this theme later in the article. The reflected ties in Table 1 are of special interest. In polarized political environments, candidates of dif- ferent parties generally take distinct positions, making reflected ties far more common than straddle ties. Cen- trist or “swing” voters—–the ones most likely to deter- mine elections—–are especially likely to encounter re- flected ties because partisan candidates often distribute themselves on opposite sides of the political center. When reflected ties arose in our sample, a substantial majority of voters (64% in the unbranded condition and 62% in the party branded condition) preferred the ambiguous candidate.13 13 In contrast, only 32% of respondents who faced unbranded strad- dle ties chose the ambiguous candidate. In these special cases, the only difference between the candidates—–other than their alphabetic identifiers—–was their level of ambiguity. This might have encour- aged respondents to interpret our portrayal as implicit criticism of the ambiguous candidate, an implication we had tried to avoid by describing ambiguity as neutrally as possible. It might also have led respondents to place unusually high weight on ambiguity as a nega- tive character trait, while giving atypically low weight to potentially attractive features of ambiguity. Furthermore, some straddle ties are To check the robustness of these findings, we next conducted a within-subject analysis. In particular, we compared how each voter responded to a pair of pre- cise candidates versus how the same voter responded to an otherwise identical scenario in which one of the can- didates took an ambiguous position. For the purpose of illustration (Figure 2), consider a “precise” scenario in which candidates Y and Z locate at specific points, and an “ambiguous” scenario in which candidate YP locates precisely at Y, but candidate ZA announces an ambiguous platform centered on Z. In this setting, YP is a replica of Y and ZA is an ambiguous analog to Z. The choices that voters make in scenarios like these can reveal whether they are attracted to or repelled by ambiguity. As Figure 2a illustrates, voters who chose Y in the precise scenario could have been attracted by ambiguity. Those who opted for ZA in the ambiguous scenario were in fact attracted by ambiguity, whereas those who selected YP were not attracted by ambiguity. Figure 2b displays the other logical possibilities. Vot- ers who chose Z in the precise scenario could have been repelled by ambiguity. Among them, voters who triple conjunctions (v = p = µ) in which neither risk acceptance nor optimism would lead voters to choose the ambiguous candidate. Fu- ture research should examine how voters respond when ambiguity is cast positively or negatively, and investigate why voters evaluate candidates differently in straddle ties than in other settings. 90 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Panel (a) includes all available cases. Panel (b) includes only “close calls” in which the distance differential was either 0 or 1. defected to YP in the ambiguous scenario were repelled by ambiguity, whereas voters who chose ZA were not. We presented people with matched pairs like the one in Figure 2. In half the cases, we denoted each of the four candidates with a unique letter. In the other half, we referred to the leftmost candidate as a Democrat and the rightmost candidate as a Republican. For each matched pair, we recorded the respondent’s choice pattern: attracted to ambiguity (Y, ZA), not attracted to ambiguity (Y, YP), repelled by ambiguity (Z, YP), or not repelled by ambiguity (Z, ZA). Table 2 reports the rates at which voters were at- tracted to or repelled by ambiguity, and it summarizes the net effect. When we analyzed all available cases (Table 2a), nearly 19% of the 207 respondents who could have been attracted by ambiguity actually chose the ambiguous candidate. In contrast, less than 13% of the 275 respondents who might have been repelled by ambiguity were in fact turned away. Rates of attraction and repulsion were lower (about 8% and 3%, respec- tively) in the party branded condition, where most re- spondents consistently chose the candidate from their own party in both the precise and the ambiguous sce- narios. On balance, ambiguity had neutral or slightly posi- tive effect on the fortunes of political candidates. By making vague rather than precise policy statements, an unbranded candidate could gain 0.8% of the total vote, and a branded candidate could win the support of an additional 2.1% of the electorate. The apparent rewards for ambiguity were larger for close calls: scenarios with a distance differential of 0 or 1 (Table 2b). These cases were especially in- formative because the distance differential was less likely to override the consequences of ambiguity. In close calls, ambiguity improved the vote share of un- branded candidates by 2.6 percentage points and the vote share of partisan candidates by 3.6 percentage points. Thus, the within-subject tests reinforce the con- clusions from the between-subject tests: ambiguity is not costly and may, in fact, help candidates win close elections. Why do so many voters in our study seem to support candidates with ambiguous messages? How do the in- dividual characteristics of voters affect whether they are attracted to or repelled by ambiguity? Why do vot- ers respond somewhat differently in the branded and unbranded conditions? The next four sections explore these questions in greater detail, using four distinct analytical techniques. Using Ties to Test Causal Mechanisms As a first step toward isolating causal mechanisms, we exploited the special characteristics of ties. Triple con- junctions (scenarios in which v = p = µ) are especially interesting because the voter cannot gain and may, in fact, lose by selecting the risky candidate. Thus, in a triple conjunction, neither risk acceptance nor opti- mism can explain why the voter would choose the ambiguous candidate. When our respondents faced triple conjunctions, though, they selected the ambigu- ous option 25% of the time when candidates were un- branded and 40% of the time when candidates were party branded. What explains this pattern? One possibility, sug- gested previously, is that voters value flexibility and think ambiguous candidates are more willing to adapt to changing circumstances. A second possibility, which applies only to the party branded condition, is blind party bias. Perhaps citizens break ties not by determin- ing which candidate presents less risk, but by blindly selecting the candidate from their own party. If such bias were ubiquitous, respondents in our experiment, which randomized party labels, would have chosen the vague candidate around 50% of the time. By compar- ing reactions to triple conjunctions in the branded ver- sus unbranded conditions, however, one sees that pure party bias could have boosted the fortunes of ambigu- ous candidates by only about 40 − 25 = 15 percentage points. A final possibility is pure error. Perhaps respon- dents made mistakes, either by not paying attention to the question or by accidentally choosing the candidate they did not intend to pick. Other research on issue vot- ing, though, found a baseline error rate of only 15.5% (Tomz and Van Houweling 2008, 312), far short of the rate at which our respondents chose the ambiguous candidate. 91 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Sample sizes are 647 in the model with unbranded candidates and 627 in the model with party branded candidates. To estimate how much behavior could be due to risk acceptance and/or optimism, we compared triple conjunctions with double conjunctions (scenarios in which p = µ = v). When candidates were unbranded, respondents opted for the vague candidate 34% of the time when facing double conjunctions versus 25% of the time when facing triple conjunctions. Some combi- nation of risk acceptance and optimism could, there- fore, be responsible for around 26% ((34 − 25)/34 = 0.26) of the preference for vague candidates. In the party branded scenarios, support for the ambiguous candidate was 52% with double conjunctions ver- sus 40% with triple conjunctions. Thus, about 23% ((52 − 40)/52 = 0.23) of votes for party branded vague candidates could be due to risk acceptance or optimism. In summary, existing theories can explain only part of voters’ preferences for ambiguity. Using Probit Regression to Test Causal Mechanisms We next used probit regression to test causal mech- anisms. Our dependent variable took a value of 1 if the respondent chose the ambiguous candidate and a value of 0 otherwise. The model with unbranded candidates included three explanatory variables. The first, risk aversion, tested whether respondents’ atti- tudes toward risk affected their willingness to gamble on imprecise candidates. Our measure of risk aversion was 1 if respondents said they preferred to avoid taking risks and 0 otherwise.14 The second independent vari- able measured voters’ certainty about their own loca- tion. We reasoned that respondents who were certain of their own position would dislike vague candidates, whereas other respondents would exhibit the oppo- site tendency. Our measure singled out people who 14 In our data, respondents who preferred to take risks behaved about the same as respondents who did not have a preference about avoiding versus taking risks. expressed extreme certainty about their location on the government services and spending scale. Finally, we controlled for the distance differential, which proved important in Table 1 and is central to proximity theory. The distance differential, which ranged from –5 to 5 with a modal value of 0, should have a positive effect on the probability of selecting the ambiguous candidate. Table 3a presents the estimates from our probit re- gression with unbranded candidates.15 The first nu- meric columns give coefficients and standard errors, and the remaining columns show how a one-unit in- crease in the explanatory variable affected the prob- ability of choosing the ambiguous candidate. Other factors equal, risk-averse citizens were about 9 per- centage points less likely to choose the ambiguous can- didate. This effect was substantively large, and its 95% confidence interval was strictly negative. Similarly, cit- izens who were certain about their own position were 9 percentage points less likely to embrace ambiguity, although the confidence interval slightly overlapped zero. Finally, the large positive coefficient on distance differential fit the central prediction of proximity the- ory: voters prefer the candidate closest to themselves. Our model with party branded candidates included the same three explanatory variables plus measures of party affiliation, which could affect votes in two ways. First, partisanship could distort perceptions about the locations of candidates. Respondents might be opti- mistic about the positions of vague candidates from their own party (partisan optimism) and/or pessimistic about the positions of vague candidates from the op- posite party (partisan pessimism). Second, partisanship could trigger blind bias: voters might favor candidates from their own party and disfavor members of the op- position, regardless of the candidates’ vague or precise policy statements. 15 Only 494 of the 1,001 respondents in our survey were asked about the certainty of their own position. Thus, the sample in Table 3 is only half as large as the sample in Table 1. 92 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

In our model with branded candidates, party match was 1 if the voter and the ambiguous candidate be- longed to the same party; party mismatch was 1 if they belonged to different parties. Independent voters, who neither matched nor mismatched the party of the am- biguous candidate, were the reference category. As Table 3b shows, the introduction of party brand names muted the effects of risk aversion and voter cer- tainty. When candidates were identified as Democrat or Republican, risk aversion and respondent certainty each lowered the preference for the ambiguous can- didate by about 5 percentage points, an amount sta- tistically indistinguishable from zero at standard confi- dence levels. Distance differential, however, continued to have strong effects even in the presence of party brands. Finally, party affiliation influenced choices. The probability of selecting the vague candidate was 34 percentage points higher when the respondent and the candidate belonged to the same party, but was 32 per- centage points lower when they belonged to different parties. Using Imputed Locations to Test Causal Mechanisms From the cross-sectional probit, we could not tell whether the effects of partisanship arose entirely from blind partisan bias, or whether partisan optimism and pessimism were also at work. To shed light on this im- portant question, we analyzed another type of data. Our experiment asked voters not only to choose be- tween vague and precise candidates, but also to in- dicate where they expected ambiguous candidates to stand. For each voter, define imputation bias as B = |v − µ| − |v − µI |, where v is the voter’s bliss point, µ is the midpoint of the ambiguous candidate’s policy interval (which we regard as an unbiased reading of the candidate’s position), and µI is the location the voter imputed to the ambiguous candidate. Positive values of B imply optimism, in which respondents shifted the vague candidate’s probability distribution toward their own ideal point. Negative values of B, in contrast, re- veal pessimism, in which respondents skewed the can- didate’s probability distribution away from themselves. B = 0 means no bias in either direction. Table 4 presents the average value of B, conditional on the party affiliations of the voter and the candi- date. Table 4 supports three inferences. First, there is little evidence of general optimism. Independent voters believed that unbranded candidates were only 0.01 scale points closer and that branded candidates were only 0.05 scale points closer than an unbiased estimate would suggest. These levels of optimism were statistically indistinguishable from zero. Partisan voters were slightly pessimistic about unbranded candidates, but not at statistically significant levels. Overall, then, respondents offered fairly objective assessments when party was not a factor. Second, we find strong evidence of partisan opti- mism. Democrats and Republicans perceived ambigu- ous candidates from their own party as 0.32 scale steps closer to themselves than to the midpoint of the vague interval. The 95% confidence interval ranged from 0.20 to 0.43 points, affording great certainty that peo- ple viewed members of their own party through rose- colored glasses. Third, we found much less evidence of partisan pessimism. Voters moved candidates from the opposite party only 0.11 points further from their self-locations than an objective analysis of candidate positions would dictate. This effect was statistically insignificant at conventional levels. Thus, our analysis uncovered an asymmetry, in which partisan optimism exceeded partisan pessimism in both magnitude and statistical significance. Using Within-Subject Data to Test Causal Mechanisms If the optimism–pessimism asymmetry influences be- havior, then ambiguity should help candidates gain votes from members of their own party without los- ing much support from members of other parties. We tested this hypothesis by applying within-subject meth- ods (as in Figure 2 and Table 2) to three mutually ex- clusive and exhaustive subgroups of our party branded sample. Respondents in the first subgroup considered a sce- nario with two precise candidates, and also considered an equivalent scenario in which their own party’s candi- date was ambiguous (Table 5a). In the scenario involv- ing two precise candidates, 14 of 114 people voted for the opposition.16 Seven of them instead chose their own 16 When both candidates were precise, two factors may have led the overwhelming majority of respondents to choose the candidate from 93 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Close calls are cases in which the distance differential was either 0 or 1. party’s candidate when that candidate was ambigu- ous. Thus, ambiguity enabled candidates to attract half of the attractable respondents from their own party. In contrast, ambiguity drove away only 1 of the 100 people who potentially could have been repelled. On balance, ambiguous candidates outperformed precise candidates by 5.3 percentage points among members of their own party. Ambiguity proved even more ben- eficial in close calls (when the candidates were exactly or nearly equidistant from the voter). In those cases, ambiguity swelled support among copartisans by more than 10 percentage points. Respondents in the second subgroup encountered an ambiguous candidate from the other party, instead of their own party (Table 5b). In these party mismatched cases, ambiguity drew 4 of the 113 respondents who could have been attracted, while driving away 4 of the 23 respondents who could have been repelled. Thus, ambiguity attracted exactly as many voters as it repelled. The same pattern held in close-call sce- narios. Overall, then, ambiguity neither increased nor decreased support by members of the opposite party. The final subgroup of our party branded sample con- tained independents (Table 5c). Among this group, the net effect of ambiguity was slightly positive. Ambiguity raised support among independents by 1.7 percentage points in the sample as a whole and by 3.1 percentage points in close-call scenarios. The confidence intervals around both effects overlapped zero, however. These findings, combined with previous ones, paint a consistent picture about the effects of ambiguity in par- tisan elections. Citizens are optimistic about where am- biguous candidates from their own party stand. Setting aside other potential consequences of ambiguity, this selective optimism makes ambiguity an advantageous strategy for candidates who want to increase their vote share among members of their own party. At the same time, people fairly perceive the positions of ambiguous candidates from the opposite party, instead of assum- their own party: respondents were typically closer to that candidate, and respondents may have had blind party bias. ing the worst about them. Other factors equal, then, ambiguity does not undermine candidates’ attempts to woo voters from the other party. Thus, in partisan elections, ambiguity may help candidates more than it hurts them. PATTERNS OF AMBIGUITY IN CAMPAIGNS Our experiments compared candidates who made pre- cise statements with candidates whose pronounce- ments were substantially, but not completely, ambigu- ous. Vague candidates advocated policy intervals that covered 3 of 7 points, or 43% of the issue space (Fig- ure 1). We now investigate how well our experiments reflect the ambiguity candidates employ in actual cam- paigns. Through analysis of an innovative public opin- ion poll and the content of presidential and vice presi- dential debates, we find that our experiments represent a common range and type of ambiguity in U.S. elections. The Range of Ambiguity In August–September 2008, we conducted a nationally representative survey that measured how much ambi- guity people perceived in statements by John McCain (R) and Barack Obama (D) on the issue of government services and spending.17 People placed the candidates on the same seven-point issue scale used in our experi- ments. Departing from the standard practice in surveys, we allowed respondents to express the ambiguity in candidate statements by selecting multiple points on the scale.18 To familiarize respondents with our format and en- courage them to use multiple points when appropriate, 17 The survey was conducted by Knowledge Networks, and 983 peo- ple (47% of invitees) completed the questionnaire. 18 In the 1979 NES pilot survey, Aldrich et al. (1982) pioneered a similar method for measuring respondents’ own positions on a seven- point scale. They strongly recommended this “ambiguity format,” but to our knowledge it has not been adopted in subsequent surveys. 94 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Panel (b) is based on analysis of all 429 prospective statements about tax policy that candidates from either party made in presidential primary and general election debates (2007–2008), and in the vice presidential debate (2008). we displayed four examples of candidates. The first can- didate said the government should increase services by a small amount. We showed respondents how to place this candidate at the corresponding point on the scale. The second candidate said the government should in- crease services, but was vague about the amount. We demonstrated how to place this candidate, by choosing all three points in the implied range from increase by a small amount to increase by a large amount. The third candidate said that the government should not increase services, but was vague about which of the remaining options he or she favored. We taught respondents to summarize such statements by selecting four points, ranging from keep services the same to decrease ser- vices by a large amount. The final candidate was totally vague when saying whether the government should in- crease services, decrease services, or keep them the same. We instructed respondents to place a candidate like this across all seven points. After providing these examples, we asked respon- dents to summarize what McCain and Obama had said about the issue (Table 6a).19 Overall, 51% of people who evaluated McCain’s statements put them at a sin- gle point, and an additional 34% saw the statements as straddling two or three scale points. Similarly, 51% perceived Obama’s statements as occupying one point, and 42% felt the statements encompassed two or three points. Table 6a supports two conclusions. First, many peo- ple believed that the presidential candidates were mak- 19 We gave respondents the option of not placing a candidate if they had not heard the candidate say anything about the issue. We offered this alternative to prevent people from attributing vague positions to candidates simply because they had not paid attention to the campaign. Of our respondents, 40% had not heard any rele- vant statements from Obama, and 51% had not heard any relevant statements from McCain. We dropped them from the analysis. ing ambiguous policy statements about government services such as health and education. Second, the vast majority—–around 90%—–perceived a range of ambigu- ity like the one in our experiments. For additional evidence about candidate ambiguity in actual campaigns, we catalogued statements by pres- idential and vice presidential candidates in 2007–2008 on a related fiscal issue, federal tax policy. Our analysis covered all tax policy proposals by all participants in 25 Democratic and 15 Republican primary debates and in 4 general election debates. There were 489 proposals; 88% pertained to the level of taxation and thus could be put on a scale like the one we used in our experiment. The remaining 12% called for systemic reform such as replacing the income tax with a national consumption tax. We discuss the statements about tax levels now and revisit the systemic statements later in the article. We coded each statement based on two criteria. First, did the candidate advocate increasing taxes, decreasing taxes, keeping taxes the same, or some combination of the three? Second, did the candidate specify the magnitude of any proposed change? We regarded can- didates as specific if they offered a precise proposal (e.g., “change the marginal rate from 33% to 39%” or “eliminate the capital gains tax”). Based on these criteria, we coded the maximum number of scale points each proposal spanned. As Ta- ble 6b shows, 48% of statements called for a specific change or unequivocally advocated keeping taxes the same, implying no ambiguity. An additional 41% of statements spanned three points because the candidate advocated increasing or decreasing taxes but did not say how much. Around 10% of statements covered four points because the candidate held open two op- tions: either keeping taxes the same or changing them in a particular direction. Finally, only 1% of statements were totally vague because they did not make clear 95 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

This analysis rein- forces the lessons from our survey: candidates speak vaguely about fiscal issues, but they typically limit their ambiguity to the levels in our experiments. Types of Ambiguity Of course, ambiguity comes in other forms, includ- ing broad but vacuous statements about policy goals. During the 1952 presidential campaign, for example, Dwight Eisenhower pledged “I shall go to Korea” with the purpose of ending the war. Richard Nixon was sim- ilarly vocal about goals but silent about means: in the 1968 campaign, he promised “new leadership” to end the Vietnam war. We found equally ambiguous goal-focused state- ments about taxes in the 2007–2008 presidential de- bates. Recall that around 12% of statements advocated systemic tax reform. Of these, 17% (comprising 2% of the entire sample) announced sweeping goals (e.g., “changing the entire tax system” to make it “fairer,” “less oppressive,” and less beholden to “special inter- ests”) without mentioning particular tax instruments. These kinds of ambiguous statements, although rare, may have different consequences than ones in our ex- periments. Another form of candidate ambiguity arises when candidates espouse inconsistent positions. Senator John Kerry famously voted to authorize the use of U.S. force in Iraq in 2002, only to renounce the war when running for president two years later. In the 2008 presi- dential campaign, John McCain proposed to extend tax cuts that he had vigorously opposed years earlier. Ex- periments and historical analyses could help quantify the costs and benefits of intertemporal inconsistency, or “flip-flopping.” Some candidates take inconsistent stands even within a single speech. In a 2007 Democratic primary debate, for example, Congressman Dennis Kucinich said he would not increase taxes. However, in the next breath, he pledged to repeal the tax cuts that President Bush had given to the richest Americans. These kinds of logical inconsistencies appeared in only 2 of the 489 tax proposals we examined, but may be more common in other issue areas. Finally, ambiguity arises when candidates send im- plicit, rather than explicit, messages. In the late 1960s, gubernatorial candidate George Wallace “gained le- gitimacy for himself through ambiguity” (Mendelberg 2001, 91; see also Chester, Hodgson, and Page 1969). Wallace used symbols to attract racist voters without employing segregationist language that other people would have found offensive. Researchers could design experiments like the one in Mendelberg (2001, 191– 208) to compare the effects of implicit versus explicit messages on a wide range of campaign issues. More generally, the effects of ambiguity could vary by issue. We focused on government services and spending, the central dimension that parties have con- tested since the New Deal. Ambiguity may evoke dif- ferent responses on other issues, such as complex de- bates about health care reform and global warming, or moral debates about abortion and gay marriage. Although our experiments examined a ubiquitous type of ambiguity in doses that candidates commonly use, one must be careful about extrapolating our con- clusions to other types and levels of ambiguity. Voters may, for example, accept ambiguity within the range we studied but shun candidates who are totally vague. This hypothesis, if correct, could explain why candidates in the 2008 presidential campaign delivered vague mes- sages but stopped short of total ambiguity. Our experi- mental template—–unlike observational studies—–could be used to infer the consequences of levels and types of ambiguity that politicians rarely employ. CONCLUSION In this article, we offered an experimental solution to measurement and endogeneity problems that have impeded previous research about candidate ambigu- ity. Between-subject and within-subject tests showed that citizens are at least as likely to prefer ambigu- ous candidates as to prefer precise ones. Our tests also showed that, in a partisan context, ambiguity can help candidates gain support from members of their own party without costing them votes from members of the opposition. Why do many voters tolerate or even embrace ambi- guity? Our evidence points to three explanations. The first concerns voter attitudes toward risk. Some par- ticipants in our study reported that they preferred not to take risks and made choices that reflected this pre- disposition. Their preferences were counterbalanced, however, by a majority of respondents who said they did not mind, or even enjoyed, taking risks. These risk-neutral and risk-acceptant respondents were more willing to gamble on ambiguous candidates, even when precise alternatives were at least as close. The second explanation focuses on the firmness of voters’ policy preferences. In our study, people who were extremely confident about their own position on government services and spending tended to shun am- biguous candidates. Others, who were less sure about the best course of action, chose ambiguous candidates with greater frequency. The final explanation involves partisan optimism. When voters encountered an ambiguous candidate from their own party, they expected the candidate to lean significantly in their own direction, instead of im- plementing a policy at the center of the candidate’s ambiguous platform. Beliefs about candidates from the opposite party were more neutral. Indeed, we could not reject the hypothesis that voters had unbiased expec- tations about the stances of candidates from the oppo- site party. This asymmetry—–partisan optimism without partisan pessimism—–helps make ambiguity profitable. Our findings have interesting implications for cam- paign strategy. The experiments with unbranded can- didates suggest that voters neither punish nor reward ambiguity in nonpartisan elections. The experiments 96 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

The attractiveness of ambiguity will vary with the composition of the electorate. Ambiguity should pay especially large dividends in jurisdictions where many voters identify with the ambiguous candidate’s party and/or where voters have heterogeneous policy pref- erences that would be difficult to satisfy by taking a single, precise position. Ambiguity may prove useful not only in general elec- tions, but also in primaries. Although we did not simu- late a primary-like contest between two candidates of the same party, our experiments offer potentially rele- vant insights. If voters are selectively optimistic about the positions of all primary contestants from their own party, ambiguity could be a net plus. But even if voters respond neutrally, as if the primary contestants were unbranded, ambiguity could still be part of a forward- looking strategy. Candidates could speak vaguely about policy issues in primaries without suffering an elec- toral penalty. Later, and without contradiction, they could announce moderate positions that cater to the median voter in the general election. Vagueness could also give candidates room to update their positions in response to new information, including lessons from the primaries (Meirowitz 2005). Indeed, we find that candidates regularly employ ambiguity in primaries and general elections. Two orig- inal data sets, one based on a textual analysis of cam- paign debates and the other gathered via public opin- ion polling, show that candidates often take—–and vot- ers frequently perceive—–ambiguous positions like the ones we portrayed in our experiments. The pervasive use of ambiguity in campaigns fits with our experimen- tal finding that ambiguity can be strategically advanta- geous. Of course, the strategies of other political actors may mediate the attractiveness of ambiguity, sometimes de- creasing and sometimes increasing its appeal in ways not captured by our experiments. Candidates may try to counteract their opponents’ efforts to benefit from ambiguity. During the 1984 Democratic primary, for example, Gary Hart productively employed ambiguity until Walter Mondale exposed the stratagem in a tele- vised debate by asking, “Where’s the beef?” (Bartels 1988, 101–102). We found less colorful attempts to crit- icize politicians for being vague about tax policy in the 2008 presidential campaign. However, candidates may portray their own ambigu- ity as a virtue—–as proof of their commitment to bipar- tisanship, flexibility, and thoughtfulness. Hillary Clin- ton, the most ambiguous Democrat we encountered in debates about tax policy, exemplified this rhetorical strategy. When barraged with questions about whether she would maintain or raise the cap on payroll taxes, Clinton refused to take a position because it would be a mistake to start “negotiating about what I would do as president” “before we have a bipartisan process.” Similarly, when asked about the Alternative Minimum Tax, Clinton would not “get committed to a specific approach” because the issue was “extremely compli- cated” and had “a lot of moving pieces.” 20 We presented ambiguity with neutral language, which neither encouraged nor discouraged voting for the ambiguous candidate. Future experiments could manipulate the negative and positive spins that po- litical actors give to ambiguity. Our analysis answers foundational questions while suggesting that efforts to study candidate ambiguity should be redoubled. REFERENCES Aldrich, John H. 1995. Why Parties?
