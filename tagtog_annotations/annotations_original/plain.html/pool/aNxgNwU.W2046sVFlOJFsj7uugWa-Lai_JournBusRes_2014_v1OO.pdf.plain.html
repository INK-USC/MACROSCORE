This study takes a different approach, conducting empirical research on three types of Taiwanese parks (export pro- cessing zones, industrial zones, and science parks), in which economic development is particularly prominent, and which have industry cluster characteristics. The study explores the effects of special resources and relation- ships among cluster firms on innovation performance, and focuses on knowledge management as the mediator for investigation. A survey, regression analysis, and correlation analysis probe into the effects of the special resources and relationships among industrial clusters on corporate knowledge management and innovation performance. Knowledge management emerges as the mediator of industry clusters in terms of corporate inno- vation performance, thus providing support for the research hypotheses. The findings of this study are valuable for further research and strategic thinking on the sustainability of corporate operations. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.1. Introduction Over the last few decades, scholars are dedicating an increasing amount of their research efforts to the relation between industrial cluster knowledge management and innovation (Arikan, 2009; Bell, 2005; Casanueva, Castro, &amp; Galán, 2013; Connell &amp; Voola, 2013; Gnyawali &amp; Srivastava, 2013; Lissoni, 2001; Phelps, 2010; Tallman, Jenkins, Henry, &amp; Pinch, 2004). The knowledge necessary for corporate innovation activities is, however, more complex, and even large-scale firms face shortages of knowledge. Given their scarce resources, firms attempt to cooperate with other firms to acquire knowledge and resources, and engage in cross-organizational learning to enhance innovation performance (Casanueva et al., 2013; Yli-Renko, Autio, &amp; Sapienza, 2001). The industrial cluster is a new organizational form that aims to enhance regional development. By forming a cluster, firms can lower their investment costs and facilitate the acquisition of professional labor, knowledge, and techniques to access common suppliers, cultivate professional labor, create spillover effects of techniques and knowledge, and enhance competitiveness (Amin &amp;mments and guidance from the re responsible for all limitations cobhsubr@gmail.com .edu.tw (Y.-M. Chen), ghts reserved.Thrift, 1995; Bell, Tracey, Jan, &amp; Heide, 2009; Casanueva et al., 2013; Connell &amp; Voola, 2013; Gertler, 2003; Tallman et al., 2004). Most extant studies on industrial clusters discuss the relationships and effects between innovation systems or activities, and clusters (Bell, 2005; Gnyawali &amp; Srivastava, 2013; Phelps, 2010; Porter &amp; Stern, 2001; White &amp; Bruton, 2007; Yeh &amp; Chang, 2003; Yli-Renko et al., 2001), the ef- fects of industry clusters on corporate competitive advantages (Amin &amp; Thrift, 1995; Bahrami &amp; Evans, 1995; Bell et al., 2009; Gertler, 2003; Zhang &amp; Li, 2010), and the knowledge management of cluster firms (Arikan, 2009; Casanueva et al., 2013; Lissoni, 2001; Tallman et al., 2004). Although, in terms of innovation performance, knowledge is one of the most important factors in an industrial cluster (Arikan, 2009; Belso-Martinez, Molina-Morales, &amp; Mas-Verdu, 2011; Casanueva et al., 2013; Tallman et al., 2004), the effect of industry clusters on innovation performance and the role of knowledge management as a mediator are seldom the focus of discussion (Connell &amp; Voola, 2013).With the increas- ing importance of knowledge management and innovation, what is the current level of awareness of knowledge management in relation to cluster firms? With the special resources and relationships that charac- terize cluster firms, are the effects on corporate knowledge management significant and do they influence performance? This study aims to explore the theory regarding the effects of industry cluster knowledge management on innovation performance and validation in an attempt to contribute to both theory and practical management. In terms of its industry cluster development index for the years 2007–2009, Taiwan ranks first worldwide, according to the 735Y.-L. Lai et al. / Journal of Business Research 67 (2014) 734–739competitiveness ratings of the WEF (World Economic Forum, 2007– 2009). This leading position demonstrates the competitive advantage of Taiwan's industry cluster development. Following the economic reforms in China, Taiwan's economic development is particularly prominent. China is taking its cue from the Taiwanese model when establishing its own Export Processing Zones. More than 200 economic zones following the EPZ model are now appearing around the world. Thus, the three main kinds of parks used to compile the Taiwanese industrial cluster index are the focus of this study.2. Research hypotheses In accordance with its research purpose and motivation, this study develops four hypotheses to explore the effects of the relation- ships between the knowledgemanagement of industrial clusters and innovation performance. A description of these hypotheses appears below. With respect to the effect of industrial clusters, the conditions for successful clusters mean that firms should form networks with knowl- edge sharing and information exchange (Breschi &amp; Malerba, 2001; Porter, 1998). Therefore, cluster zones with advanced knowledge and techniques are attractive to new companies because they can reinforce local industry's capabilities and knowledge base (Maskell, 2001b). In a knowledge economy, information and knowledge exchange within a cluster can enhance firms' capabilities and lead to knowledge creation (Arikan, 2009; Casanueva et al., 2013; Lissoni, 2001; Lorenzen &amp; Maskell, 2004; Maskell, 2001a, 2001b). Drawing on these findings, this study suggests that interaction and exchange within an industrial cluster can center on knowledge. The use of cluster resources and rela- tionships by firms to acquire knowledge management, and obtain or create new knowledge influences the performance of innovation activities. H1. Industry clusters significantly and positively influence knowledge management. Knowledge management facilitates effective information exchange and cost benefits. Afuah (1998) and Porter (1990) suggest that the key to innovation activities is to apply new knowledge to commerciali- zation, and to create corporate value. Corporate innovation activities mean that members contribute implicit techniques and knowledge to create and confirm the concepts of new products. Finally, knowledge that individuals acquire in the innovation process spreads to different departments, and even different organizations. Thus, knowledge management is one of the main forms of lowering uncertainties when reforming technical systems (Carrillo &amp; Gaimon, 2004; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). Arikan (2009), Belso-Martinez et al. (2011), Casanueva et al. (2013), Koskinen (2000), Koskinen, Pihlantob, and Vanharanta (2003), Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), and Oliver, Dostaler, and Dewberry (2004) all indicate that the enhancement of knowledge management yields improvements in innovation performance. Drawing on the above literature, innovation activities create an environment for the exchange of knowledge. As for product development, innovation enhances both member exchange and interaction, which in turn triggers demand for knowledge, and develops diverse knowledge activities for knowledge integration. Therefore, knowledge manage- ment and innovation activities share a relationship. H2. Knowledge management significantly and positively influences innovation performance. Industrial clusters enhance the depth and breadth of cooperation and competition, and bring together various industries to form cluster relationship networks, which boosts corporate operational performance (Anderson, 1994; Kotler, 2000; Olson, 1998; Porter, 1990). Maskell (2001a) argues that the cooperation of both upstream and downstreamfirms effectively lowersmutual transaction costs and develops fixed con- tracts. Trust develops to enhance transactions. From the perspective of network theory, positive interaction is a key factor for firms to maintain their competitive advantage (Bell et al., 2009). According to Audretsch and Feldman (1996), Feldman and Florida (1994), Gnyawali and Srivastava (2013), Phelps (2010), White and Bruton (2007), and Zhang and Li (2010), industry clusters can strengthen firms' innovation perfor- mance. On the basis of the above literature, through industrial clusters, firms canmore easily acquire resources, and thus cut costs. This approach reinforces cluster relationship effects, which in turn influences corporate innovation performance. H3. Industry clusters significantly and positively influence innovation performance. Numerous governments use industry clusters as an important policy tool for regional economic development on account of their capacity to attract talent, which results in a variety of information and knowledge exchange modes. Through the formation of clusters, firms can lower their investment costs, access common suppliers, cultivate a professional work force, and develop a spillover effect for techniques and knowledge (Tallman et al., 2004). Lissoni (2001), and McEvily and Zaheer (1999) point out that the structure of an organization's alliance network can strengthen through the sharing of knowledge. According to Leonard and Swap (2000), in highly competitive industry clusters, some important skills in business management, or techniques to do with knowledge, are neces- sary for the industry cluster to support the activities of the industry. Yli- Renko et al. (2001) find that networks provide critical access to infor- mation, and that knowledge acquisition shares a positive correlation with knowledge exploitation in innovation performance. Finally, the knowledge that individuals acquire in the innovation process spreads to different departments and even organizations. In a knowledge econ- omy, information and knowledge exchanges that occur within the clus- ter reinforce the firms' capability, knowledge creation, and innovation performance (Arikan, 2009; Bathelt, Malmerg, &amp; Maskell, 2004; Casanueva et al., 2013; Connell &amp; Voola, 2013; Lorenzen &amp; Maskell, 2004; Maskell, 2001b; Tallman et al., 2004). According to the above lit- erature, the industry cluster is an important policy for numerous gov- ernments when developing regional economies. Industry clusters not only enhance relationships and reorganize resources, but also attract talent. Thus, firms can easily acquire a professional work force, knowl- edge, and techniques to enhance innovation performance. This study posits that a relationship exists among industrial clusters, knowledge management, and innovation performance. H4. Knowledgemanagement is themediator of a significant and positive effect of industry clusters on innovation performance.3. Methodology 3.1. Research framework This study first establishes the research framework, then deduces the research hypotheses, and finally describes the analysis tools, sta- tistical methods, sampling method, and sample structure. SPSS sta- tistical software allows for the analysis of the questionnaire data, the description of the research findings, and a comparison of theories with empirical results, all with the aim of drawing conclusions from the study. As per the literature, this study divides industrial clusters into two variables (namely, cluster resources and cluster relation- ships) and divides knowledge management into knowledge creation and acquisition, and knowledge dissemination and storage. Innova- tion performance breaks down into market performance and prod- uct performance, which serve as variables for the study. Fig. 1 shows the research framework.

Operational definitions and measurement of dimension variables For all items, this study employs a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The operational definitions of dimen- sions appear below. 3.2.1. Industry cluster The industry cluster splits into two variables, with six items for clus- ter resources and five items for cluster relationships (11 items). 3.2.2. Knowledge management Knowledgemanagement breaks down into two variables, with eight items for knowledge creation and acquisition, and eight items for knowledge dissemination and storage (16 items). 3.2.3. Innovation performance Innovation performance splits into two variables, with five items for market performance andfive items for product performance (10 items). 3.3. Research subjects and sampling design In the formation of industrial clusters, special economic zones make a prominent contribution to national economic development, and are thus important indices of industry cluster development. The subjects of this study are the three main kinds of parks that make up the indus- trial cluster index in Taiwan: science parks, export processing zones, and industrial zones. Table 1 displays a description of these three types of parks. The data sources for this study are the science parks, export process- ing zones, and industrial zones in Taiwan, which serve as the subjects. Random sampling, stratified by firms with the same characteristics within the cluster industry, yields partial samples for investigation, and the results shed light on the overall situation. A total of 1500 re- spondents received questionnaires, returning 210 usable question- naires; a valid retrieval rate of 14% (38 questionnaires from science parks, 50 questionnaires from export processing zones, and 122 ques- tionnaires from industrial zones). The confidence level of the sample is 95% with a sampling error of ±6.72%. Of the questionnaires, 73% (154 questionnaires) come from the manufacturing industry (food, plastic, chemistry, machinery, LCD and IC, optics, and energy manufacturing) and the remaining 27% (56 questionnaires) come from other industries (trading, software, service companies). Of theTable 1 Statistics of parks in industry clusters.

Empirical analysis 4.1. Reliability and factor analysis This study has three dimensions. As Table 2 shows, all values of Cronbach's α are above 0.84, suggesting that the questionnaire of this study has very good reliability, and very clearly classifies each dimen- sion, given that all the values of the factor loadings are high and with considerable concentration. These figures also suggest good discrimi- nate and convergent validity. Factor analysis methodology extracts mutually independent com- mon factors from multiple relevant variables in cases with unknown factorial model structures. To confirm whether the data are suitable for factorial analysis prior to formal analysis, this study first calculates the KMO values, originally planning to apply 37 questions relating to three dimensions. All KMO values are above 0.87. Therefore, the data are suitable for factor analysis. By using the principal components ap- proach to factor analysis, this study extracts six factors and30questions, with accumulative explanatory variation exceeding 67.3%. 4.2. Correlation analysis Pearson correlation analysis validates the correlation between vari- ables. According to Table 3, although the effects of industry cluster re- sources on market performance and the effects of industry cluster relationships on product performance are insignificant, they do share a small relationship. Nonetheless, the p values of the other variables are below0.05, and thus the correlation among the variables is both sig- nificant and positive. The correlation between knowledge creation and acquisition and knowledge storage and dissemination in the knowledge management of the industry cluster is both significant and positive. Thus, the original resources and the relationship of the industrial cluster can enhance the degree of knowledge management. With the enhancement of knowl- edge management, innovation performance is more significant in rela- tion to market performance and product performance. Thus, the data supportsH1, H2, andH3: industry clusters and knowledgemanagement have direct, significant, positive relationshipswith corporate innovation performance. 4.3. Regression analysis Table 4 displays the results of the regression analysis, showing that an industry cluster and its resources and relationships can influence knowledge management and innovation performance. The coefficients of Model 1 are significant overall, meaning that the industry cluster sig- nificantly and positively influences knowledge management, thus supportingH1. The coefficients of Models 2 and 3 are also all significant, meaning that the resources and relationships of the industry cluster Table 2 Factor analysis.

The coefficients of Model 4 are sig- nificant, indicating that the industry cluster significantly and positively influences innovation performance. In other words, when firms are in an industry cluster, the degree of their innovation performance is higher, thus lending support to H3. The coefficients of Models 5 and 6 are significant. Thus, the resources and relationships of the industry cluster influence innovation performance. Similarly, knowledge man- agement, knowledge creation and acquisition, and knowledge storage and dissemination influence innovation performance. The coefficients of Model 7 are significant, implying that knowledge management both significantly and positively influences innovation performance. InTable 3 Correlation analysis.

The co- efficients of Models 8 and 9 are also significant, demonstrating that firms' knowledge creation and acquisition, and knowledge storage and dissemination influence innovation performance.4.4. Analysis of knowledge management as a mediating effect This section attempts to determinewhether industrial clusters influ- ence innovation performance through knowledgemanagement. Taking the four conditions of mediators as a basis (Baron and Kenny, 1986), Fig. 2 shows the results of the mediator path analysis. According to Fig. 2, the regression analysis includes correlation coefficients in a path diagram (βa, βb, βc, ′βc). The effects of industry clusters on knowledge management (βa = 0.42, t = 6.66, p b 0.05), of knowledge management on innovation performance (βb = 0.53, t = 8.95, p b 0.05), and of industry clusters on innovation performance (βc = 0.16, t = 2.40, p b 0.05) are significant. Moreover, the indirect effect of industry clusters on innovation performance is insignificant (′βc = −0.07,t = −1.06, p N 0.05). Therefore, the originally signifi- cant, direct effect path becomes insignificant after including the media- tor–which matches conditions 1 to 4 from Baron and Kenny (1986)–, indicating the possible existence of mediating effects. Thus, in industry clustering, knowledge management can improve corporate innovation performance. Therefore, results offer support for H4. Table 4 Regression analysis.

Conclusions Under the pressure of global competition, participation in industrial clustering is important for sustainable corporate development. Through industrial clusters, firms can use resourcesmore effectively, lower costs, and enhance competitiveness. In addition, geographical proximity positively influences firms' innovation performance. By focusing on the three major types of parks that figure in the calculations of the Taiwanese industry cluster index, this study probes into industrial clustering resources and relationships, knowledge management, and innovation performance. The theo- retical discussion gives rise to several hypotheses concerning rela- tionships between the above variables. Statistical testing then validates these hypotheses and relationships. Key findings are as follows.When the resources of an industrial clus- ter are complete, firms vertically integrate in central locations to lower costs and share resources. Such actions enhance knowledge creation and acquisition, and knowledge storage and dissemination, supporting H1. With industrial clustering, corporate knowledge creation and acqui- sition, and knowledge storage and dissemination can influence innova- tion performance and reinforce the internal knowledgemanagement of firms, thus supporting H2. Upon the formation of an industrial cluster, firms directly influence innovation performance, with positive and significant effects. In prac- tice, acquiring resources and information through industrial clusters is easy, and provides firms with more frequent interaction among differ- ent levels of government, schools, corporations, and upstream and downstream firms, resulting in better innovation performance. This study shows that, upon the formation of an industrial cluster, firms can easily acquire resources and lower costs, thereby reinforcing theFig. 2. Path analysis of mediating effeffects of cluster relationships, which influence corporate innovation performance. In addition, the analysis uncovers significant, positive ef- fects of industry cluster resources on innovation performance, and of the industry cluster relationship on innovation performance. H3 thus garners support from the data. The firms in industry clusters achieve better innovation performance due to knowledge management. In practice, industrial clustering not only unites similar industries, but also attracts industry talent, which leads to information and knowledge exchange, with a spillover effect of sharing techniques. Regarding knowledge management, through the effects of industrial clustering, firms enhance their operational perfor- mance. Thus, industry clusters indirectly influence innovation perfor- mance. H4 posits this relationship, so the data offers support for H4. 5.2. Managerial implications This study has the following key managerial implications. (1) Industry clustering can positively enhance corporate innovation performance. This finding suggests that the enhancement of cor- porate sustainable development and competitiveness should rely on industrial clustering resources and relationships to increase competitive advantage. (2) Industry clustering in science parks, industrial zones, and export processing zones can reinforce corporate knowledge creation and acquisition. Industrial clusters can help introduce innovative techniques of knowledge management to enhance core compet- itiveness. (3) Knowledgemanagement can boost the innovation aswell as out- put performance of firms in industry clusters. Firms should coop- erate with supply chain agents, and foster industry–academia cooperation, in an attempt to upgrade knowledge and technical management capabilities.ect of knowledge management. 739Y.-L. Lai et al. / Journal of Business Research 67 (2014) 734–739(4) Cluster relationshipsmay differ depending on the kind (parks) of industry clusters. For instance, as the government devises and establishes different industrial types and orientations of science parks, industrial zones, and export processing zones, cluster relationships also differ. Thus, results imply that for better cluster relationships, such as vertical supplier integration, information sharing, and strategic alliances, firms can make the development of export processing zones a priority, followed by industrial zones. Therefore, in the selection of industrial zones,firms should rely on industrial characteristics and their own requirements, to achieve better results. (5) The government and private companies should establish strate- gic cooperation platforms. Knowledge management is one of the factors that enhance competitiveness. Strategic alliances, competition and cooperation should work on the basis of the sharing and integration of resources. This facilitates joint efforts in innovation and R&amp;D and improves the international competi- tiveness of companies. Clusters should develop high value-added products or services and brace themselves for new challenges in the marketplace. References Afuah, A. (1998).
