Combining extant stress models with theoretical considerations from team research, we address temporal variations in the buffering effect of trust in teammates. We hypothesize that trust buffers the negative effect of objective physical activity on perceived strain and that this buffering effect is more pronounced during later performance episodes (i.e., when employees complete a series of temporally distinguishable tasks). We tested the hypotheses with a sample of professional firefighters who completed a sequence of 3 performance episodes in a high‐fidelity simulation environment. Each participant was equipped with a smartphone capturing individual motion activity, which we used as an indicator of physical activity. In line with our hypotheses, multilevel modeling revealed a buffering effect of trust on the relationship between physical activity and perceived strain. Importantly, this buffering effect was more pronounced in the second performance episode as compared with the first performance episode. Our findings add a temporal perspective to the understanding of the effectiveness of job resources. In addition, the current study illustrates the usefulness of smartphones for obtaining behavioral data in a naturalistic setting. KEYWORDS high‐reliability occupations, social sensing, teams, time, trust1 | INTRODUCTION In some occupations, employees are regularly pushed to their limits and beyond. Emergency physicians experience time pressure and a turbulent work environment, police officers face life‐threatening situations, and firefighters have to cope with extreme heat and smoke. These occupations have been jointly referred to as high‐reliability occupations—complex work environments rich with the potential for error, where errors have serious consequences (Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 1999). Central characteristics of high‐reliability occupations include (a) that many tasks are performed in teams (e.g., Flin, O'Connor, &amp; Mearns, 2002; Wilson, Burke, Priest, &amp; Salas, 2005) and (b) that these teams perform their work in recurring performance episodes (Ishak &amp; Ballard, 2012; Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001). The current study aims to improve our understanding of how these characteristics interact to affect work outcomes. In particular, we investigate temporal variations in the buffering effect of job resources across multiple performance episodes.wileyonlinelibrary.comJob resources are assumed to buffer the negative impact of job demands by affecting the perceptions evoked by said demands (Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Kahn &amp; Byosiere, 1992). In the team context, trust constitutes a key variable that affects a variety of pro- cesses and outcomes (e.g., De Jong, Dirks, &amp; Gillespie, 2016; Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008; Salas, Sims, &amp; Burke, 2005). Importantly, when people work together, trust influences one person's perception of their colleagues' actions or events related to those actions (Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2001). Following this notion, we sug- gest that trust in teammates represents a resource capable of affecting work perceptions in high‐reliability teams; in particular, we propose that trust buffers the negative effects of objective physical activity on perceived strain. Although research has provided useful insights into the work of high‐reliability teams (e.g., Salas &amp; Rosen, 2013), little is known about the impact of recurring performance episodes. This is a problem because recurring performance episodes constitute an inte- gral part of the work routine in high‐reliability occupations and they© 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd./journal/job 1099 1100 BURTSCHER ET AL.have wide‐ranging consequences for team members (Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, &amp; Jundt, 2005; Ishak &amp; Ballard, 2012; Mathieu et al., 2008). We address this issue by investigating temporal varia- tions in the buffering effect of trust across multiple performance episodes. Combining the job demands–resources model (JD‐R; Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, &amp; Schaufeli, 2001) with both Hobfoll's (1989, 2002) conservation of resources (COR) theory and theoretical considerations from team research (e.g., Ilgen et al., 2005; Ishak &amp; Ballard, 2012), we propose that trust in teammates will be more important during later performance episodes. This is because employees need to spend a significant amount of physical resources to complete a first perfor- mance episode, which increases their motivation to look for alterna- tive resources and hence will make trust more salient later on. We test our propositions in the context of firefighting. Given their similarities, we expect that our argumentation can be applied to other high‐reliability occupations (Baumann, Gohm, &amp; Bonner, 2011). We envision three main contributions of the current research. First, we extend the theoretical understanding regarding how psy- chological job resources shape employees' work outcomes across multiple performance episodes. By combining stress models with theoretical considerations from team research, the current study addresses temporal variations in the buffering effect of job resources. We consider this as a compelling extension of extant models of occupational stress that could both stimulate empirical research and further theorize regarding the effectiveness of job resources. Second, the current study clarifies the role of trust in teammates as a remedy for attenuating some of the negative effects of working in high‐reliability occupations. Given the high stakes in these occupations and the inevitability of high demands, this repre- sents an important contribution that could help employees to com- plete their tasks successfully in spite of adverse working conditions. Finally, this study makes a methodological contribution by illustrating how smartphones can be used to capture behavioral data in a naturalistic environment (e.g., Miller, 2012).2 | THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES 2.1 | High‐reliability occupations: a challenging work environment Employees in high‐reliability occupations have to complete complex, highly interdependent, time‐limited tasks (e.g., rescue missions, firefighting, and complex surgery), often under adverse conditions, and their failures can have fatal consequences (Baker, Day, &amp; Salas, 2006; Weick et al., 1999). One central characteristic of these occupa- tions concerns the role of teams: Teamwork is considered vital for maintaining performance and safety (Baker et al., 2006; Flin et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2005). As another central characteristic, perfor- mance episodes are an integral part of many high‐reliability teams' work routine (Ishak &amp; Ballard, 2012; Sundstrom, McIntyre, Halfhill, &amp; Richards, 2000). Importantly, these performance episodes are recur- ring; that is, a specific team will conduct several performance episodesduring which its members engage in similar patterns of activity (Marks et al., 2001; Mathieu et al., 2008). For example, over the course of a day, an emergency medical team usually deals with multiple incidents, each representing a distinct performance episode. The fact that high‐reliability teams perform their work in recurring performance episodes has several important implications. For one, out- comes of one performance episode can serve as inputs for subsequent episodes (Ilgen et al., 2005; Mathieu et al., 2008): If, for example, fire- fighters are exhausted from an incident, this might impede their ability to successfully handle a subsequent incident. In addition, performance episodes are characterized by epochality and finality (Ishak &amp; Ballard, 2012). Epochality includes the notion that unlike employees in other occupations, high‐reliability teams cannot simply take a break or post- pone a task. Finality refers to the irreversibility of work outcomes: If firefighters fail to extinguish a fire in time, they cannot redo their work at a later time. Research has provided important insights into the functionality of high‐reliability teams including the role of leadership (Klein, Ziegert, Knight, &amp; Xiao, 2006), team learning (Ishak &amp; Williams, 2017), and training (Salas &amp; Rosen, 2013). However, explicit efforts to understand the impact of recurring performance episodes are notably absent from the literature. Given the wide‐ranging implications of recurring perfor- mance episodes noted earlier and their ubiquity in high‐reliability occu- pations, we believe that investigating how performance episodes affect team members' work outcomes constitutes a valuable extension of the literature. In the current study, we focus on team members' appraisal of the specific demands associated with recurring perfor- mance episodes, that is, their perceived strain.2.2 | Job characteristics of high‐reliability occupations The JD‐R classifies occupational characteristics into two categories: job demands and job resources (Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Demerouti et al., 2001). On the one hand, job demands—also termed stressors—include the “physical, social, or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort and are there- fore associated with certain physiological and psychological costs” (Demerouti et al., 2001, p. 501). High work pressure, adverse physical working conditions, or difficult client interactions represent typical job demands (Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007). On the other hand, job resources refer to the physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are functional in achieving goals, reduce job demands and the associated costs, or stimulate personal growth and development (Demerouti et al., 2001). This includes a great variety of factors such as career opportunities, support from supervisors, and autonomy (Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Bakker, Demerouti, &amp; Euwema, 2005). In fact, job resources have been described as “anything per- ceived by the individual to help attain his or her goals” (Halbesleben, Neveu, Paustian‐Underdahl, &amp; Westman, 2014, p. 1338). Given these broad definitions, it seems necessary to specify job demands and resources in high‐reliability occupations. The importance of job demands and resources in a certain occupa- tion depends on the specific job characteristics (Bakker et al., 2005). Whereas job demands vary across high‐reliability occupations, many BURTSCHER ET AL. 1101settings have a significant physical component. For example, physi- cians and nurses in an emergency department have to lift patients, per- form cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and run from one room to another. In this context, firefighting represents an occupation that is especially physically demanding (e.g., Bos, Mol, Visser, &amp; Frings‐ Dresen, 2004; Mamen, Oseland, &amp; Medbo, 2013). Firefighting tasks involve running, climbing, and lifting (e.g., removing barriers and carry- ing victims), which require continuous physical activity from the fire- fighters. In sum, we submit that physical activity constitutes an important job demand in high‐reliability occupations, particularly in firefighting. In terms of job resources of high‐reliability teams, trust in team- mates represents a potentially important resource because trust con- stitutes a central determinant of effective teamwork (De Jong et al., 2016; Mathieu et al., 2008; Salas et al., 2005). Trust has been defined as “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerabil- ity based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another” (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, &amp; Camerer, 1998, p. 395). With regard to team settings, trust comprises the expectation that one's teammates will perform specific actions that are important to the team, irrespec- tive of one's ability to monitor or control their actions (Breuer, Hüffmeier, &amp; Hertel, 2016). The positive expectations forming the basis of trust can be attributed to both cognitive and affective ante- cedents (e.g., Colquitt, LePine, Zapata, &amp; Wild, 2011).1 Whereas cogni- tive antecedents include beliefs in others' ability and reliability, affective antecedents include beliefs in others' benevolence and con- cern (Colquitt et al., 2011; Mayer, Davis, &amp; Schoorman, 1995; McAllister, 1995). Trust is particularly important in high‐reliability teams because individual members' tasks are highly interdependent; that is, all members' contributions are necessary for completing the task, and each member must take action for other members to do any part of their work (Wageman, 1995). For example, in a firefighting team, Team Member A, who is tasked with extinguishing the fire, cannot complete his work without the support of Team Member B, who is tasked with securing water supply. Thus, Team Member A has to be confident about Team Member B's ability (i.e., he has the necessary skills) and benevolence (i.e., he would not intentionally do anything that would compromise A). Without trust, task completion would become very inefficient, because Member A would be inclined to closely monitor B (e.g., Langfred, 2004) and second‐guess his decisions (e.g., choice of fire hydrant). In line with this argument, research has highlighted the importance of trust in high‐reliability teams (Colquitt et al., 2011; Wildman et al., 2012).2.3 | Negative consequences of high physical demands The negative consequences of job demands are well documented (e.g., LePine, Podsakoff, &amp; LePine, 2005; Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004; Spector, Dwyer, &amp; Jex, 1988). Extant stress models have1We acknowledge that some researchers regard cognition‐ and affective‐based trust as separate constructs (e.g., McAllister, 1995). Following Colquitt et al. (2011), we conceptualize trust as a unitary construct that has both affective and cognitive antecedents.specified the process leading from objective job demands to nega- tive work outcomes (e.g., Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). For example, Spector (2002) proposed that job characteristics first have to be perceived as stressors, which in turn leads to negative emotions. These emotions then lead to different types of distal strain reac- tions—both behavioral (e.g., alcohol abuse) and physical (e.g., health conditions). In this context, it is necessary to detail how job demands and strain are conceptualized in the context of the current research. Daniels (2006) proposed to differentiate between perceived and enacted job characteristics with the latter including observable behavioral activities in the job as they happen. Importantly, these enacted characteristics— and not enduring perceptions or structural features of work—are con- sidered to be the locus of the appraisal processes that influence strain (Daniels, 2006). Moreover, enacted characteristics capture the behav- ioral dynamics of job demands (e.g., How much actual physical activity did a firefighter exhibit during a specific performance episode?). By contrast, perceived job characteristics refer to stable or typical experi- ences (e.g., How physically demanding does a firefighter perceive his work in general?). In order to understand the dynamic processes involved in determining how job resources are utilized to manage job demands, calls have been made to focus on enacted job characteristics (Duong, Tuckey, Hayward, &amp; Boyd, 2015). Consequently, we concep- tualize physical demands as the amount of objective physical activity during a specific performance episode. Recently, research has started investigating intraindividual differences in job demands and resources across time—typically in the context of diary studies (see Schaufeli &amp; Taris, 2014, for an over- view). These studies suggest that day‐level variations in work out- comes can be explained by day‐level variations in job demands. However, empirical investigations of the short‐term dynamics between enacted job demands and job resources are still scarce (Duong et al., 2015). This neglect is particularly problematic in high‐ reliability occupations where success and failure is determined at the level of a single performance episode. Each firefighting mission is a dis- crete event with a separate outcome; failure in one mission can seldom be compensated by success in another. Thus, we need to understand not only how job demands and resources affect employees in general but also how they shape work outcomes in a specific performance episode. To address this issue, we investigate employees' immediate reactions to being exposed to a series of physically demanding tasks and, in particular, the role of trust in shaping these reactions. As we are interested in employees' immediate reactions, we focus on the most proximal work outcome: perceived strain. Similar to perceived exertion, perceived strain captures the subjective situational appraisal of the task and incorporates several signals, perceptions, and experiences (cf. Borg, 1982). Just as other stress‐ and strain‐related subjective appraisals, perceived strain results from the interplay of external task demands and employees' resources; it is this subjective appraisal that antecedes long‐term strain outcomes (Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1992; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). For this reason, perceived strain has been used frequently as an outcome in research on physically demanding tasks in high‐reliability occupations such as firefighting (Lusa, Punakallio, Luukkonen, &amp; Louhevaara, 2006) and police work (Johnsen et al., 2017). 1102 BURTSCHER ET AL.Studies on the effects of physical demands using self‐reports of typical work experiences suggest negative effects on variables associated with psychological strain (Li, Jiang, Yao, &amp; Li, 2013; van Den Tooren &amp; de Jonge, 2008). Accordingly, we propose an effect of objective physical activity on perceived psychological strain— employees' subjective appraisal of the strain‐related psychological aspects of a specific task. In line with research suggesting that day‐ level variations in work outcomes can be explained by day‐level varia- tions in job demands, we propose that variations in perceived psychological strain across performance episodes can be explained by variations in physical activity across performance episodes, and thus, we expect to replicate previous findings regarding the effects of physical demands on the performance episode level.Hypothesis 1. Employees' objective physical activity during a performance episode is positively related to their perceived strain after the performance episode.2.4 | The buffering effect of job resources Importantly, we propose that trust in teammates represents a resource capable of buffering the hypothesized negative effects of objective physical activity. Trust can either have a main effect or alternatively moderate the effect of another variable on work outcomes (Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2001). Focusing on the moderating effect, we argue that high trust in teammates buffers the effect of job demands by affecting how individual members perceive these demands. Two different literatures support our argument that trust affects the perception of job demands. First, in the occupational stress litera- ture, it is generally assumed that a variable can act as a buffer when it makes job demands more understandable to an employee; that is, the employee appreciates the “reasons for the presence of a stressor and their exposure to it” (Kahn &amp; Byosiere, 1992, p. 622). Building on this notion, the JD‐R proposes that job resources can buffer the nega- tive impact of job demands by affecting the perception of these demands (Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007). For example, appreciation from a supervisor can make a highly demanding task more bearable for an individual. To this regard, Crawford, LePine, and Rich (2010) have sup- plemented the JD‐R by including appraisal processes of job demands. Appraisal processes play a central role in many stress models by shap- ing the relationship between objective demands and their subjective perception (e.g., Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). In this context, trust in management has been proposed to affect the extent to which employees perceive job demands as negative (Mishra &amp; Spreitzer, 1998). In support of this notion, employees with high trust in their management were found to be less negatively affected by work overload, presumably because trust makes the presence of high workload more understandable, thereby mitigating the negative evalu- ations that usually result from this job demand (Harvey, Kelloway, &amp; Duncan‐Leiper, 2003). Similarly, a recent study based on propositions of COR theory found that trust in management represents a resource capable of buffering the negative effects of job insecurity (Jiang &amp; Probst, 2016). We argue that trust in teammates can have similar effects in team settings. In an individual work setting, management actions are a majorfactor responsible for employees' job demands because they distribute tasks, assign responsibilities, and set deadlines. As a result, trust in management influences how employees evaluate a highly demanding situation. In a team setting, however, employees' job demands depend on the other team members: If their teammates loaf or are incompe- tent, employees' workload is likely to increase—in particular if their tasks are highly interdependent as is the case in high‐reliability occupa- tions. Consequently, other team members' actions constitute a main driver of workload, and trust in teammates is likely to influence how employees evaluate a highly demanding situation. Second, in the literature on trust in organizations, Dirks and Ferrin (2001) argue that trust acts as a moderator by affecting a person's interpretation of another's past actions or events related to those actions. Specifically, under high levels of trust, employees are likely to interpret their coworkers' actions more favorably than under low levels of trust (Dirks &amp; Ferrin, 2001). Accordingly, if employees trust their teammates, they should be more likely to inter- pret their teammates' actions favorably because they are confident that their teammates will perform actions that are beneficial for the team (e.g., Breuer et al., 2016). By contrast, if employees do not trust their teammates, they are not sure that their teammates' actions are beneficial for the team because they are dubious about their teammates' ability or benevolence. As a result, their interpretation of their teammates' actions should be less favorable. As an example, con- sider a medical team in which the anesthetist insists on double‐ checking instruments and drugs before starting surgery. If the surgeon trusts her teammate, she will likely interpret her colleague's action as an expression of genuine concern and will not mind double‐checking. However, if she does not trust her, she might interpret it as an attempt to undermine her authority because she has doubts about her teammate's benevolence. Consequently, she will be likely to regard the double‐checking as unnecessary. In support of our argumentation, trust has been found to affect individuals' perceptions of others' behavior in the team context (Brown, Crossley, &amp; Robinson, 2014). Building on these two streams of literature, we propose that trust in teammates affects how team members perceive a highly demanding task. Trusting one's teammates implies positive expectations about their actions and motivation (Breuer et al., 2016; De Jong &amp; Elfring, 2010). These expectations are rooted in the belief in one's teammates' ability and benevolence. Thus, if employees trust their teammates, they are confident that (a) their teammates are competent and (b) that their teammates would not intentionally do anything to compromise them. By contrast, if employees do not trust their teammates, they are not sure that their teammates are competent and well meaning. These differences can affect employees' interpretation of physical demands. Because high‐trusting employees are confident that their teammates do their part of the job, they will be more likely to interpret high physical demands as a consequence of the task. Low‐trusting employees, however, will likely interpret high physical demands as a consequence of their teammates' lack of motivation or competence. As a result, they will regard these demands as unnecessary or unfair burden (“I would not have to do this if my teammates had done their part”). Tasks that are considered unnecessary have been found to be more straining (Semmer et al., 2015). Taken together, we propose that, because of differences in the interpretation of job demands, BURTSCHER ET AL. 1103employees who do not trust their teammates will perceive a high amount of physical activity as more straining, as compared with employees who do trust their teammates.Hypothesis 2. Trust in teammates moderates the rela- tionship between physical activity and perceived strain: Physical activity is more positively related to perceived strain under conditions of low trust as compared with conditions of high trust.2.5 | The effect of recurring performance episodes Turning to the central contribution of the current study, it has been recently suggested that the effectiveness of job resources may vary across task situations (van Woerkom, Bakker, &amp; Nishii, 2016). Interest- ing questions arise when the hypothesized buffering effect of trust is seen in light of task characteristics that might cause these variations —namely, recurring performance episodes. We argue that due to the job characteristics described above, employees are regularly forced to operate at their limits. As a conse- quence, completing a single performance episode is likely to result in a significant depletion of physical resources (Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007; Demerouti et al., 2001). Thus, they will start the next perfor- mance episode with fewer resources at their disposal. Combining the JD‐R with Hobfoll's (1989, 2002) COR theory, it has been assumed that in such a situation of resource loss, other resources can be partic- ularly salient (Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, &amp; Xanthopoulou, 2007). Building on this notion, we propose that trust in teammates should become a more salient resource in later performance episodes. Specif- ically, we argue that firefighters are motivated to offset the significant loss of physical resources that occurred during the first performance episode. Because direct replacement of physical resources is not pos- sible in this situation, they should—according to COR theory—strive to seek replacement through indirect means (Hobfoll, 1989). Conse- quently, they should be highly motivated to look for alternative resources that help them in dealing with the demands of the next per- formance episode. As trust in teammates represents an important resource in the team context, it should become more salient. In Hypothesis 2, we have argued that employees who do not trust their teammates interpret high demands less favorably, as compared with employees who do trust their teammates. Building on this argu- mentation, we propose that the increased salience of trust affects the perceptions underlying the associated buffering effect. High‐ trusting employees are inclined to interpret high demands as conse- quence of the task situation. Making trust more salient should not change their perception of job demands. Thus, the effect of physical demands on perceived strain should remain stable. By contrast, low‐ trusting employees are inclined to interpret their high demands as a consequence of their teammates' lack of motivation or competence. Making trust more salient should lead to an even less favorable inter- pretation, resulting in a stronger effect of physical demands on per- ceived strain. Thus, when trust becomes more salient in a second performance episode, differences in the interpretation of job demands between high‐ and low‐trusting employees should increase: Employees without an additional resource at their disposal—trust inteammates—should perceive high physical demands as even more straining than employees with this resource. This is again in line with COR theory, which assumes that persons with more resources are “less negatively affected by resource drain or loss that occurs in the face of stressful conditions” (Hobfoll, 2002, p. 318). Accordingly, we formulate the following hypothesis.Hypothesis 3. The buffering effect of trust in team- mates on the relationship between physical activity and perceived strain becomes more pronounced during later performance episodes.3 | METHOD 3.1 | Participants We conducted the study in cooperation with the fire department of a Western European city. Participants were 45 professional firefighters. All participants were male. We used age cohorts: 8.9% of the partici- pants were between 24 and 29 years, 17.8% were between 30 and 35 years, 13.3% were between 36 and 41 years, 22.2% were between 42 and 47 years, 24.4% were between 48 and 53 years, and 13.3% were over 53 years old. 3.2 | Context Data collection took place in a burn building—a high‐fidelity training facility for naturalistic simulations of fire incidents. The burn building is used for training purposes on a regular basis, so participants were familiar with the facility. Training scenarios in the burn building are highly realistic, as they resemble real‐life incidents in many aspects. They involve actual fires, extreme heat, high humidity, restricted visi- bility, and thick smoke. Moreover, firefighters use their regular equip- ment including breathing apparatus with pressurized air, protection suit, hose, turntable ladder, and fire engine. Participants completed a customized training scenario, which we designed in cooperation with two training instructors specifically for the purpose of the current study. The scenario involved a fire on the third floor of an apartment building (i.e., the burn building). The partic- ipants arrived in two fire engines. The entrance to the building was blocked, so they had to enter via the roof. This required the use of the turntable ladder. In the building, visibility was limited due to smoke. Thus, it was difficult to locate the source of the fire. The scenario involved an unconscious person (i.e., dummy) in the building. Partici- pants had to rescue the person first and then to extinguish the fire in order to complete their mission. 3.3 | Procedure On each day of the data collection, participants arrived at the training site with their regular equipment and were informed about the study. They completed a consent form and the trust measure. Each partici- pant was handed a smartphone. Importantly, all participants were required to carry their smartphone in exactly the same manner (i.e., left breast pocket) to ensure both accuracy and comparability of measure- ments. Next, a training instructor gave a technical briefing about the 1104 BURTSCHER ET AL.training scenario, and the first trial was conducted. After the trial, par- ticipants had a break of about 15 min during which they completed the perceived strain measure. After their third trial, participants were thanked and debriefed. The trials had an average duration of 12.45 min (SD = 1.90). Participants completed the trials in seven teams of seven to nine firefighters. The teams consisted of firefighters that worked together on a regular basis. Each team was scheduled to repeat the same, stan- dardized scenario three times. Repeating the same scenario rather than doing different scenarios ensured that the overall physical demands of the task remained constant across performance episodes. To impede learning effects, participants switched their roles after each trial. Team composition remained constant across the three trials, and each team completed all their trials on the same day. Due to organizational issues, three trials had to be canceled. However, the same team of firefighters conducted the scenario at least twice together. The analyses for the current study were based on a sample of 114 observations (i.e., individ- ual firefighters completing the scenario) from the 45 participants, whereby each individual firefighter provided either two or three observations.3.4 | Measures The study represents an observation study with three measurement points: Trust was measured once before the first trial, physical activity was measured during each trial, and the outcome variable perceived strain was measured immediately after each trial.3.4.1 | Trust in teammates We used the trust scale by Colquitt et al. (2011), who developed this scale specifically for the context of firefighting. The scale assesses the extent to which firefighters trust their colleagues regarding a num- ber of standard tasks. Sample items include “I trust my colleagues to discuss fire tactics before beginning operation” and “I trust my col- leagues to study maps of the local territory.” Participants indicated their agreement on a 5‐point scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The scale was translated in cooperation with a grad- uate student who was an experienced firefighter. A first version of the scale was pretested in a sample of firefighters. One item was deleted because it did not apply to the current setting. The final German version used in this study included eight items and had a high reliability (α = .87).2Using all six items of the TLX produced a similar pattern of results.3.4.2 | Perceived strain As the setting prevented us from using lengthy questionnaires after each trial, we employed a short instrument to assess perceived strain. We used the National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationTask Load Index (TLX)—a multidimensional scale designed to obtain subjective perceptions of work outcomes (Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988). Participants indicate their ratings regarding six items on a scale between 0 and 20. The scale has been validated in many settings (Hart, 2006), and TLX items have been used to operationalize perceived strain in other high‐reliability occupations (Collet, Averty, &amp; Dittmar, 2009; Weigl, Müller, Sevdalis, &amp; Angerer, 2013). For the purpose of the currentstudy, we focused on three relevant items of theTLX that tie in closely with perceptions of psychological strain: perceived mental task demands, perceived temporal task demands, and perceived effort.2 A sample item is, “How hard did you have to work to complete the task?” The three items were aggregated to obtain a single indicator of perceived strain. The scale had good reliability (α = .76).3.4.3 | Physical activity We used individual motion activity during the scenario to operationalize physical activity. Motion activity was measured with smartphones (see Appendix A for a detailed description). A number of studies using similar approaches have demonstrated that smartphones' built‐in accelerometers can accurately recognize individuals' physical activities and thus reveal, for example, whether people are standing still, walking, running, or climbing a ladder (Kwapisz, Weiss, &amp; Moore, 2011; Miller, 2012; Piwek &amp; Joinson, 2017). Physical activity values can potentially range from 0 (i.e., person did not move at all during the scenario) to +1 (i.e., person was always physically active).3.5 | Analysis strategy We analyzed the data with the packages lme4 (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015) and multilevel (Bliese, 2013b) of the statisti- cal software R (R Core Team, 2015). The data had a hierarchical structure spanning three levels: Repeated observations of the depen- dent variable were nested in individuals, which were again nested in teams. Moreover, trust was measured at the individual level. In other words, whereas the participants completed the trust measure only once (i.e., on the individual level), we elicited the independent variable physical activity and the outcome measure perceived strain for each performance episode (i.e., on the measurement level). Following the recommendations by Bliese (2002, 2013a), we first determined whether the data warranted taking their nested nature into account by investigating the intraclass correlations (ICCs) of the outcome variable perceived strain on the individual and team levels. Nonindependence was present only on the individual level, ICC(1) = .56, F(44, 69) = 4.23, p &lt; .001, ICC(2) = .76, but not on the team level, ICC(1) = −.02, F(6, 107) = 0.63, p = .70, meaning that perceived strain values depended on the person from whom they were obtained, but not on the team. This pattern seems reasonable given that all teams conducted the same standardized scenario, and thus, outcomes should be rather affected by individual differences than by team‐level factors. To account for the hierarchical nature of our data, we employed mixed models (i.e., multilevel models) in the analysis (Gelman &amp; Hill, 2006). Mixed models include all variables on their respective levels, thereby providing the most accurate statistical representation of a repeated‐measures scenario such as the present one (Galecki &amp; Burzykowski, 2013). Specifically, we employed a two‐level random intercept model and tested whether the addition of random slopes explained significant further variance in the dependent variable (Bliese &amp; Ployhart, 2002). To account for effects of performance BURTSCHER ET AL. 1105episodes, we used the trial number as an additional predictor. As we were interested in differences between performance episodes, per- formance episode was operationalized as a categorical predictor. Using difference coding, we calculated two contrasts: one comparing the second trial with the first and one comparing the third trial with the second.4 | RESULTS Table 1 provides an overview of descriptive statistics of the study variables. As we measured perceived strain and physical activity for each performance episode, we report them separately for each episode (i.e., trial).

Notably, the average level of physical activity remained constant across the three performance episodes. We constructed the initial model as a random intercept model with varying intercepts for perceived strain. An alternative random intercept and slope model did not fit the data better than the random intercept model, Δχ2(2) = 0.18, p = .92. We thus employed the random intercept model for hypothesis testing (Model 1). Following conventions for testing interactions, we first added mean‐centered trust in teammates as a Level 2 predictor in a second step (Model 2). Then, we added the two‐way cross‐level interactions between trust and physical activity, and trust and performance episode, to test Hypothesis 2 (Model 3). Finally, we added the three‐way interaction between trust, physical activity, and perfor- mance episode (Model 4). Please note that in the absence of a random slope as in these models, cross‐level interactions pertain only to the fixed effects and are interpreted analogous to interaction effects in ordinary least squares regression; that is, the effect of one fixed effect (i.e., physical activity) on the dependent variable (i.e., perceived strain) depends on another variable (i.e., trust in team- mates). The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 2. In addition to p values, we also report bootstrap confidence intervals (based on 5,000 resamples) for the parameter estimates. Finally, we estimate the models' total variance explanation with the pseudo‐R2 for generalized mixed models (Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth, 2013).4.1 | Hypothesis testing In support of Hypothesis 1, Model 1 revealed a significant relationship between physical activity, operationalized through the smartphone‐ based measurement of motion activity, and perceived strain in Model 1 (γ = 6.62, p &lt; .001; 95% CI [4.16, 9.00]).

The effect of physical activity remained significant in all models. In Model 2, trust did not have a significant main effect on perceived strain. As a side note, our analysis also revealed a significant interaction between physical activity and performance episode. Our second hypothesis proposed that trust in teammates would moderate the relationship between physical activity and perceived strain. Model 3 revealed a significant effect of the interaction between physical activity and trust on perceived strain (γ = −4.07, p = .034; 95% CI [−7.76, −0.30]), which remained significant in Model 4. This finding provides support for our second hypothesis. The two‐way interaction, however, was expected to be qualified by the three‐way interaction predicted by Hypothesis 3. Regarding our third hypothesis, the final model revealed a signifi- cant three‐way interaction between physical activity, trust, and the dif- ference between the second and first episodes (γ = −6.71, p = .047; 95% CI [−13.27, −0.31]). By contrast, the three‐way interaction between physical activity, trust, and the difference between the third and second episodes was not significant (γ = 6.99, p = .13; 95% CI [−1.97, 15.88]). This finding indicates a difference in the buffering effect of trust between the first and second episodes, but not between the second and third. The plot indicates an overall interaction between physical activity and trust (Figure 1): The relationship between physical activity and perceived strain appears to be weaker under conditions of high trust (+1 SD) as compared with low trust (−1 SD), which is in line with Hypothesis 2. Moreover, under conditions of low trust, the rela- tionship between physical activity and perceived strain seems to vary across performance episodes, whereas under conditions of high trust, this relationship is similar for all performance episodes. Specifically, the effect of physical activity on perceived strain becomes more pro- nounced in the second performance episode, but only for firefighters who do not trust their teammates. This pattern is in line with our pre- diction. At first glance, the strength of this effect appears to become weaker again in the third episode such that it lies between the first and the second. Although the difference between Episodes 2 and 3 is not significant, this could indicate a nonlinear effect of performance episode on the buffering effect of trust. We decided to further explore this possibility in an additional analysis.33We thank the editor for this suggestion.4.2 | Additional analysis To further clarify the three‐way interaction, we constructed an alterna- tive model using polynomial contrasts: one contrast for the linear effect of performance episode (i.e., 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3) and one contrast for the nonlinear (i.e., quadratic) effect. This model is identical to Model 4 in most respects including log‐likelihood, total variance explanation, and predicted values. The only differences concern estimates for parameters involving performance episode. The analysis reveals a significant two‐way interaction between performance episode and physical activity for the nonlinear effect (γ = −3.94, p = .025; 95% CI [−7.28, −0.50]), but not for the linear effect (γ = 2.02, p = .219; 95% CI [−1.15, 5.25]). The same pattern emerged for the three‐way interaction: We found a significant non- linear effect (γ = 5.60, p = .045; 95% CI [0.43, 10.98]), but no linear effect (γ = 0.20, p = .948; 95% CI [−5.65, 6.14]). This pattern is in line with the previous model and the plot. For low‐trusting firefighters (−1 SD), the effect of physical activity on perceived strain becomes significantly stronger in the second performance. The effect becomes weaker again in the third performance episode such that it lies between the first and the second, but this change is not significant. By contrast, for high‐trusting firefighters (+1 SD), the effect of physical activity on perceived strain appears to be stable across performance episodes.5 | DISCUSSION The current study adds a temporal perspective to research on the effectiveness of job resources by investigating variations in the buffer- ing effect of trust in teammates. In line with our hypotheses, multilevel modeling revealed a significant positive effect of objective physical activity on the subjective perception of strain. Moreover, our findings suggest that trust in teammates buffered the effect of physical activity on perceived strain. Importantly, and as expected, this buffering effect varied across performance episodes: It was more pronounced in the second performance episode as compared with the first performance episode. Specifically, firefighters with low trust in their teammates were more negatively affected by high physical activity in the second performance, whereas this was not the case for firefighters with high trust in their teammates. This finding suggests that the effectiveness BURTSCHER ET AL. 1107of job resources in buffering the influence of job demands can vary over time. Overall, the current study offers several contributions in terms of theory, research methodology, and practice. First, one major contribu- tion of the current research lies in presenting theory and empirical evi- dence regarding temporal variations in the buffering effect of job resources. We demonstrate that the buffering effect of trust on the relationship between physical activity and perceived strain becomes more pronounced during a second performance episode. Although the stability of the buffering effects of job resources has been recently called into question (van Woerkom et al., 2016), temporal variations in buffering effects have received limited attention in the literature. Empirical evidence suggests that job resources are not consistently effective in buffering the negative effects of physical demands (Bakker et al., 2005). Moreover, diary studies investigating dynamic elements of the JD‐R suggest that job demands and resources fluctuate over the course of a week (e.g., Schaufeli &amp; Taris, 2014). The current study extends these lines of research by demonstrating that the buffering effects of job resources can vary across performance episodes. We consider this an important addition to existing research that contrib- utes to an improved understanding of how temporal factors shape the interplay of job demands and resources and, thus, inspires both empirical research and further theories. Of course, we do not provide an exhaustive analysis of all factors that influence the buffering effect of job resources. Our findings, however, do imply that research on job resources should consider temporal factors. It should be noted that our analysis did only reveal a difference in the buffering effect of trust between the first and second perfor- mance episodes, but not between the second and the third. Moreover, our additional analyses suggest that the effect of performance epi- sode is nonlinear. Retrospectively, this resonates with our argumenta- tion. We have argued that a single performance episode results in a significant depletion of physical resources, which increases employees' motivation to look for alternative resources and thus makes trust in teammates more salient (Bakker et al., 2007; Hobfoll, 1989). It is conceivable that the relationship between the loss of one resource and the increased salience of alternative resources is not linear. Instead, this relationship might be better described in terms of a threshold model, such that resource loss in excess of a critical threshold level does not lead to a further increase in salience of alter- native resources. Following this interpretation, the depletion of phys- ical resources during the first performance episode might have been enough to reach the threshold and thus render trust a more salient resource. After that, however, additional loss of physical resources did not result in a further increase in the salience of trust, and the buffering effect of trust did therefore not differ between the second and third performance episodes. Alternatively, this finding might be accounted for by the setting of the current study. The participating firefighters knew that the third performance episode would be the final one and that they could replenish their physical resources after that. This knowledge might have decreased their motivation to focus on alternative resources and thus affected the salience of trust in teammates and the respective buffering effect. In sum, findings from our analyses suggest that the detected variations in the buffering effect of trust follow a nonlinear rather than linear pattern. However,more research is needed to fully understand how the effectiveness of job resources can vary over time. A second contribution of the current study lies in demonstrating how recurring performance episodes affect work outcomes in the team context: Our findings indicate that they are a source of variation in the functionality of trust in teammates. On a conceptual level, researchers have long emphasized the importance of time for team processes and performance (e.g., Gersick, 1988; McGrath, 1991). Yet researchers have hardly addressed variations in team processes and emergent states across performance episodes. In this regard, a recent review of literature stated a notable absence of empirical studies that analyze the dynamic effects predicted by temporal models of team- work (Mathieu, Tannenbaum, Donsbach, &amp; Alliger, 2014). Against this background, the current study provides initial evidence for how the functionality of team‐related variables (i.e., trust in teammates) varies across performance episodes. Although we focused on individual members' work outcomes, our work contributes to an improved under- standing of temporal dynamics in the team setting. Third, our work has implications in terms of research methods. We illustrate how smartphones can be used to quantify job demands in an applied setting. The reliance on subjective, self‐report data in the study of job demands has been criticized for a long time (Spector et al., 1988). Self‐report data are prone to bias (e.g., Podsakoff, MacKenzie, &amp; Podsakoff, 2012; Spector, 1994), which poses a threat to objectivity. The current study addresses this issue by using smartphone‐based motion activity data as an objective measure of physical activity, which also reduces the risk of common method bias. Social sensing research has shown that wearable sensors can be used to measure human behavior in organizational settings (Pentland, 2010; Schmid Mast, Gatica‐Perez, Frauendorfer, Nguyen, &amp; Choudhury, 2015). Building on this research, we were able to obtain objective behavioral data in a setting where such data are hardly accessible through conventional methods. The current study also illustrates how smartphones could promote the study of temporal phenomena in organizations. We have already discussed the lack of empirical work on team dynamics. In this context, innovative measurement techniques such as smartphones have been recently proposed as a means for advancing research (Kozlowski, 2015). Apart from team research, applied psychology in general has been criticized for neglecting the temporal aspects of behavior (Roe, 2008). Smartphones can help address these issues as they are capable of gener- ating behavioral data at a much higher temporal resolution than conven- tional methods (Miller, 2012). Of course, for the purpose of the current research, we used a relatively simple approach to conceptualize physical activity that did not make full use of smartphones' functionality. For example, we did not use location data (e.g., Global Positioning System, which did not work inside the building) that would have potentially allowed us to determine covered distances more precisely. Future research should further capitalize on the different sensors to obtain even more precise measures of physical activity. Besides, because social sens- ing is still a new field, there are no standards regarding the use of smartphone‐based measures. As a result, studies require substantial preparation work in developing and testing their measures, which is com- plicated by the large amount of data produced by this approach (Miller, 2012). On a general level, however, we think that the present study 1108 BURTSCHER ET AL.illustrates the usefulness of smartphone‐based metrics and provides an example of how smartphones can be used to collect behavioral data in applied settings. In doing so, we hope to further promote the use of behavioral data in organizational psychology. 5.1 | Practical implications Another goal of our study was to identify psychological resources that help members of high‐reliability teams in dealing with the effects of highly demanding working conditions. Our findings indicate that trust in teammates buffers the negative effects of physical activity. Notably, trust seems to play an important role even in a predominantly physical work setting. The practical implications of this finding become appar- ent if one considers that physical demands constitute an integral part of many high‐reliability occupations. Physical demands, in turn, are associated with high levels of strain. Because physical demands often cannot be reduced, it is important to identify job resources that help employees deal with these demands. Against this background, the cur- rent study makes a practical contribution by demonstrating that trust in teammates buffers some of their negative effects. Importantly, as opposed to the physical activity required to com- plete a task, trust can be targeted by interventions. Two basic strate- gies are available to improve trust. First, team composition could be modified to maximize trust among team members. This strategy, how- ever, is unfeasible in applied settings where team composition is deter- mined by shift schedules and staffing requirement. The second strategy—interventions to promote trust—seems more promising. Research has provided a variety of specific interventions that can be used to promote trust in interpersonal relations (Abrams, Cross, Lesser, &amp; Levin, 2003). For example, leaders and command personnel should give employees the opportunity to voice concerns and present sugges- tions for improvements. Everyone's contribution should be valued in order to create a climate of open and collaborative communication, which in turn should increase interpersonal trust (Abrams et al., 2003). In general, we think trainers and human resource managers should pay increased attention to psychological resources. Some high‐reliability occupations such as health care have long acknowl- edged the role of human factors (Baker et al., 2006), and training pro- grams addressing these issues have been designed (e.g., Wilson et al., 2005). In view of our findings, similar training approaches to promote trust could be beneficial for employees in high‐reliability occupations. 5.2 | Limitations and future research As this is the first study addressing temporal variations in the buffering effect of job resources, there are several limitations and a number of avenues for future research. First, our study focused on investigating variations in the buffering effect of a single job resource (i.e., trust in teammates). As a consequence, we cannot be sure to what extent our findings can be generalized, that is, whether similar variations can be found in the buffering effect of other job resources. As the mecha- nism underlying the observed variations in the buffering effect of trust —namely, that other resources can become particularly salient in the context of resource loss—is well established in the literature (e.g., Bakker et al., 2007), we are confident that this finding is not specific to the current setting.Similarly, our study can be criticized for focusing on the physical aspects of firefighting. While we believe that firefighting is character- ized by its physical demands, we acknowledge there are instances in which firefighting is also mentally demanding (e.g., decision making under uncertainty). Moreover, in other high‐reliability occupations such as emergency medicine, job demands are not primarily physical but also involve emotionally demanding interactions with patients. Thus, future research should investigate the buffering effect of trust in the context of multiple types of demands including physical, mental, and socio‐emotional demands. For example, it would be interesting to investigate the buffering effect of trust in emergency care. In general, future research should try to validate our findings using different combinations of job demands and resources. Another limitation of the current study concerns our focus on the short‐term dynamics of the strain processes. We only investigated var- iations in the buffering effects of trust with regard to the most proxi- mal variable in that process—perceived strain. Although the relationship between a job demand and the perception of said demand constitutes a vital part of the strain process, future studies should investigate other strain outcomes. Our study featured a limited number of similar teams (i.e., all members were highly trained professionals who worked together regularly), which could explain the absence of a group‐level effect on perceived strain. Thus, future research should investigate the buffering of trust in teammates in a larger, more diverse set of teams. A potential study could compare multiple teams performing different tasks. We also measured trust only once at the beginning of the study. Although we think it is rather unlikely that trust in teammates could have changed over the course of the three scenarios, we cannot exclude this possibility. Consequently, future research should measure trust in teammates before each performance episode to account for potential variations. Another avenue for future research would be to focus on negative emotions, which constitute an important part of the strain process (Spector, 2002). It would be worthwhile to investigate the role of negative emotions in the context of recurring performance episodes. For example, if emergency physicians are frustrated from dealing with a first incident, they might sustain this negative emotion, which could impede their ability to successfully handle subsequent emergencies. A potential question would be whether trust in teammates could prevent “carryover effects” of negative emotions from one performance episode to the next.6 | CONCLUSIONS The current study offers three main contributions. First, we add a tem- poral perspective to research on the effectiveness of job resources by investigating variations in the buffering effect of trust in teammates. Our findings indicate that this buffering effect varies across perfor- mance episodes: Trust in teammates was more effective in buffering the negative effects of physical activity during a second performance episode. Second, we show that trust in teammates is an important psy- chological resource for employees in high‐risk occupations that is capa- ble of buffering some of the negative effects of objective physical job BURTSCHER ET AL. 1109demands. Third, the current study illustrates how smartphones can be used for obtaining objective behavioral data in an applied setting.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors thank the members of the City of Zurich Fire Department, in particular Jan Bauke and Pascal Eichmann, for their support through- out the study.

We devel- oped an Android™ app to sample the phone's built‐in sensors: Acceler- ation sensors were used to measure participants' body movements (please see also Feese et al., 2013 for a description of the technical background). To quantify motion activity during the scenario, we used a thresh- old‐based approach: The motion data were divided into active seg- ments (i.e., acceleration is above the activity threshold) and nonactive segments (i.e., acceleration is below active threshold). A segment had a duration of 1 s, which means each performance episode consisted on average of 745 segments. For each 1‐s segment, the smartphone's triaxial accelerometer provided 50 measurements of the changes in X, Y, and Z directions. Thus, on average, more than 100,000 individual data points were used for the calculation of each physical activity score. The data were aggregated in a two‐step procedure. First, using a two‐component Gaussian mixture model, the activity threshold waslearned from all available data (&gt;10 million data points). Second, the threshold was used to decide for each segment (i.e., each second) whether or not the firefighter was active. Similar procedures have been used in other studies (Bulling, Blanke, &amp; Schiele, 2014; Karantonis, Narayanan, Mathie, Lovell, &amp; Celler, 2006; Olguin et al., 2009). Overall motion activity was then calculated as the ratio of active segments during the scenario. Values can potentially range from 0 (i.e., person did not move at all during the scenario) to +1 (i.e., person was always physically active). A recent review of the literature indicates that triaxial accelerom- eter data—as were used in the present study—are strongly correlated to indicators of physical activity such as oxygen consumption and energy expenditure (Butte, Ekelund, &amp; Westerterp, 2012). This sug- gests that our approach of operationalizing physical activity consti- tutes a valid measurement strategy. To assess construct validity more directly, we related our measure to the TLX item capturing physical strain.4 Multilevel regression revealed a strong positive relationship between smartphone data and perceived physical strain (γ = 12.43, p &lt; .001; 95% CI [8.84, 16.09]), which provides further evidence for the validity of our measure.4We thank the editor for this suggestion.</p>
