The author substantiates this claim with a case study of resis- tance against the Holocaust. He combines a unique and underutilized collection of postwar testimonies gathered in light of an honorary pen- sion program with postwar trials of pro-Nazi collaborators and liter- ature on nonrescuers, to trace both successful and failed rescue at- tempts. In line with the theory, the analysis reveals that Catholic rescue groupsweremore successful in Protestant regions andvice versa because their minority position facilitated mobilization while reducing exposure. Statistical analyses of postwar testimonies and arrest records confirm this picture, demonstrating that it is the distinctive local posi- tion of groups that enables the production of undergroundmovements.INTRODUCTION Clandestine movements have played a crucial role in the instigation of rev- olutions (Lenin 1970; Gould 1995), resistance movements (Finkel 2015),ld like to thank Marnix Croes, Peter Tammes, Herman van Rens, the late Jan Son- , theDutch Social InsuranceBank, Jean-EmileVeth,DocDirect, Aike van der Ploeg, Blocq, and theDutchMuseum for JewishHistory for sharing data.

American Journal of Sociology Allguerrilla groups (Viterna 2006), terrorism (Sageman 2011; Shapiro 2013), rescue operations for victims of mass persecution (Foner 2015), and trans- formative collective actionmore broadly (Smelser 1962).When talking about revolutions, Lenin, one of themore influential movement organizers inworld history, identified secrecy as the most important condition for success (Lenin [1902]1970;Erickson1981).Despitetheimportanceofclandestinecollectiveac- tion, we lack a complete understanding of why some communities are able to produce and sustain underground operations while others are not. In addi- tion to obvious data collection problems, this is—at least according to some— due to a scholarly focus on public claim making in the collective action liter- ature (Zwerman, Steinhoff, and della Porta 2000). Existing explanations of clandestine collective action focus on how na- tional factors, such as levels of repression, leadership, and the nature of pro- test waves (Fein 1979; Zwerman et al. 2000; della Porta 2013), or individual attributes, such as adventurousness, moral outrage, ideology, values, and biographical availability, push and pull nascent rebels into clandestine op- erations (London 1970; Viterna 2006). Recognizing that these approaches fail to account for differential mobilization within countries, more recent re- search has tried to explore interactions between individual motives and na- tional forces (Viterna 2006; della Porta 2013). Inspired by scholarship of other types of high-risk collective action, this mesolevel approach has shown how recruitment through dense networks connects individuals to broadermacro- environments, enabling undergroundmobilization from the ground up (Mor- ris 1981; McAdam 1986; Gould 1995; della Porta 2013). Although this focus on network density has significantly enhanced our understanding of secre- tive movements, it fails to explain why some communities are able to pro- duce social relationships that allow for careful clandestine recruitment while others are not. This article sheds light on the local challenges of clandestine collective ac- tion, to explain where clandestine recruitment is more successful. In partic- ular, I draw on the sociology of secrecy (Simmel 1906; Erickson 1981; Herdt 1990; Fine and Holyfield 1996) and covert social networks (Raab and Mil- ward 2003;Morselli, Giguère, and Petit 2007; Sageman 2011; Crossley et al. 2012), to show that clandestine mobilization is a distinctive form of high- risk collective action (McAdam 1986; Loveman 1998) that, in addition toTammes, Herman van Rens, Sadia Saeed, Charles Seguin, Wout Ultee, MarthaWilfahrt, SidneyTarrow, ChrisWay,AlexKuo,KevinMorrison, participants inNorthwestern’s So- cialMovement/EnterpriseWorkshop, and theAJS reviewers provided excellent comments on earlier versions of this project.

Minorities and Collective Actionthemore commonly studied high-risk collective action problem, involves an extra trade-off because the network density, coordination, and communica- tion required for mobilization automatically reduce secrecy on a local level (Goffman 1970; Baker and Faulkner 1993; Shapiro 2013). The central hypothesis of this article is that local minority communities are better able to solve the clandestine collective action dilemma because minority isolation simultaneously increases (a) group commitment (Cole- man 1988) and (b) decreases the flow of information to undedicated outsid- ers in the immediate environment (Granovetter 1995; Portes 1995), produc- ing hubs of commitment that exploit the advantages of dense networks while reducing exposure by embedding them in isolated structures. As a re- sult, clandestine collective action often remains rare and confined to limited sets of local communities. Clandestinity poses enormous obstacles for empirical investigation.Gain- ing direct access to contemporary clandestine cells is next to impossible ex- actly because these cells need to reduce exposure in order to survive. Archi- val work on historical cases can alleviate this challenge because it allows us to study groups that are no longer under immediate threat, reducing the ur- gency of secrecy (Crossley et al. 2012). Moreover, when political structures open and regimes change, former clandestine networks sometimes go public in order to gain recognition for their activities against past foes. This often opens up a wide array of archives and testimonies. Instead of focusing on contemporary cases, this study therefore focuses on a historical episode of clandestine collective action: the secret protection of Jews during the Holo- caust. I zero in on Twente, an economically and socially integrated region in the Netherlands located across the Catholic-Protestant fault line that divides Western Europe. As a result, important economic and social factors, includ- ing top-down enforcement by elites, national norms, levels of threat, scrutiny, repression and ideology, can be kept constant when comparing Protestant and Catholic groups in minority and majority contexts. The extraordinary availability of unused archival sources presented by theHolocaust inTwente enables me to study clandestine collective action in a detailed fashion. I de- ploy two unique and underutilized collections of postwar testimonies. The first collection consists of research done in light of anhonors pension program and contains information about peoplewho either protected Jews themselves or lost familymemberswhodid so.The secondbody of documents is collected in light of postwar trials against collaborators and provides information about the detection of Jews inhiding. In combinationwith existingwork on themen- tality of nonrescuers (Hilbrink 1989; Van Der Boom 2012; Demant 2015), these sources provide an unusual opportunity to trace the evolution of suc- cessful and unsuccessful clandestine rescue operations (i.e., networks that were detected and dismantled by security forces).265 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology AllIn support of the minority thesis, the data reveal that (a) minority leaders were able to exploit the mobilizing capacity of committed members, (b) ma- jority rescue operations were more likely to get denounced early on, (c) reli- giousmixing undermined theminority advantage by undercutting isolation, and, as a result, (d ) insulated pockets of Protestants were more successful in protecting Jews in Catholic regions while the same was true for Catholic en- claves in Protestant areas. A quantitative analysis of commemoration books and postwar testimonies of rescuers throughout the Netherlands backs up these findings fromTwente. In addition, the case study helps me link deeply structural factors to actual outcomes, by suggesting three feedback mecha- nisms that translate the (somewhat) abstractminority advantage into actual higher levels of clandestine mobilization: group isolation assures organizers that mobilization is possible (Elster 1989), it helps organizers to recruit the right operatives (Marwell andOliver 1993), and it improves the selective re- tention of resistance by reducing infiltration from outsiders (Aldrich 1999). This article extends my earlier research on the religious rescue of Jews in the Netherlands, which used a statistical analysis of geocoded evasion data, to show that Jews living in the vicinity of minority church buildings were more likely to survive the war (Braun 2016). This earlier research assumes, but never proves, that this was the case because minority congregations were both more motivated and better able to protect. Here, I zero in on the ability to protect and identify several mechanisms underlying the statistical patterns in Braun (2016), using detailed case studies of rescue operations. Taken together the two articles use different methods to illuminate different steps in the causal chain that link minority status to resistance against geno- cide.2 In addition, this article makes six distinct but interrelated contributions to scholarship on collective action, political violence, social movements, and humanitarian protection. First and foremost, this article suggests that we should study the interaction between individual factors, mesolevel net- works, and national-level processes if we really want to understand where andwhy clandestine resistance against genocide emerges (Hagan andRymond- Richmond 2008). The potential of this multilevel framework is detailed in the conclusion. Second, this article sheds light on the root causes of clandestine mobiliza- tion. Existing work has shown that dense and spatially clustered networks embedded in formal organizations provide the relational base for secret mo- bilization (Gould 1995). Yet, strong organizational networks and personal ties abound, while clandestine mobilization is rare. This article shows that2 For now, I shy away from assessing the relative importance of ability andmotivation, as the two often reinforce each other (Joas 1993). I further explore this issue in my book (Braun, in press). 266 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective Actiondense networks need to be structured in a particular way to facilitate under- ground collective action, qualifying the relationship between networks and coordinated opposition. Third, I contribute to debates on the secrecy-efficiency trade-off in the study of covert networks. Advocates of this trade-off argue that clandestine networks need to be sparse and decentralized to remain covert and are, as a consequence, inefficient in solving complex collective action problems (Raab andMilward 2003; Enders and Su 2007). Opponents have suggested that efficiency and secrecy actually reinforce each other because density and centralization improve secrecy by facilitating coordination, careful recruit- ment, and internal solidarity (Simmel 1906; Erickson 1981). The current analysis suggests that insights from both camps should be combined, as iso- lated hubs of commitment conducive to secretmobilization are locally dense but globally sparse (Sageman 2011; Crossley et al. 2012), specifying a non- linear relationship between network structure andmobilization (Gould 1993). In so doing, this finding contradicts theories suggesting that covert opera- tions are aided bya group’sweak ties,which can improve access to resources, enhance cohesion through the collection of information about threatening outsiders (della Porta 2013), and facilitate the diffusion of resistance (Gould 1995). Fourth, this article strengthens links between the literatures on social movements and political violence by investigating how outcomes of mass killing are contingent on localized forms of clandestine mobilization by by- standers. Scholars of political violence traditionally depict civilians as pow- erless pawns in the hands of warring parties who either support rebels or are coerced to provide local intelligence (Kalyvas 2006). More recently, scholars of social movements have looked at the mobilization of killers (Su 2011) and victims (Einwohner and Maher 2011). This article demonstrates how and where empathetic or adventurous bystanders can mobilize in secret to con- dition the local impact of political violence. Fifth, this article reveals the Reformation’s lasting impact on clandestine resistance to political violence centuries later. As such, I join a small body of work that reveals howprotectivemobilization not only affects victimization directly but is itself shaped by historical legacies of long-gone political movements. These legacies of contention introduce a new set of historical variables understudied by social movement scholars and highlight the im- portance of embedding the study of both political violence and collective ac- tion in the broader historical context of contentious politics (Clemens 2007). Sixth, although the article focuses on minorities in general it also sheds light on the role of religion and collective action. Traditionally, European social theorists have portrayed religious hierarchies as agents of passivity that hamper mobilization, while scholars on the other side of the ocean de- picted them as actors that inspired transformativewaves of collective action267 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology All(Morris 1981). This article suggests that whether church communities pro- duce resistance is dependent on how they are embedded in the local commu- nity. In the following section, I introduce the clandestine collective action di- lemma, explaining how and why minorities are better able to produce and sustain secretive mobilization in defense of threatened neighbors. I then in- troduce the region of Twente and describe the developments that led to its religious split. The following section describes the archival materials that allow me to interrogate the roots of clandestine protection. The qualitative analysis is presented in the subsequent section. I then use a subset of com- memoration books and postwar testimonies to assess whether the minority hypothesis travels beyond its borders. In the conclusion, I explore the scope conditions of my theory and provide building blocks for a multilevel theory of clandestine collective action that combines national context, individual motivation, and community capacity.THEORY The Clandestine Collective Action Dilemma Underground mobilization poses two interrelated challenges that together constitute what I call the clandestine collective action dilemma. First, one needs to mobilize. This involves the well-studied high-risk collective action problem. A secret organization requires the establishment of communica- tion lines, safe houses, forged documents, and the collection of sufficient food for its members (Finkel 2015). This is too much work for one person or family alone, necessitating cooperation beyond the household. Individu- als are reluctant to take part in these activities because both the costs and risks of participation are extremely high.However, numerous scholars have shown that dense or centralized interpersonal networks (McAdam 1986; Marwell and Oliver 1993), often embedded in associations (Morris 1981; Gould 1995), allow movements to overcome high-risk collective action prob- lems by enabling recruitment and coordination (McAdam 1986; Sageman 2011; della Porta 2013), as well as producing solidarity through social sanc- tioning (Coleman 1988). Second, in addition to solving the high-risk collective action problem, re- sistance networks need to be sustained. This requires secrecy becausemove- ment organizers cannot exclude oppressors from the areas in which they op- erate (Shapiro 2013). Becoming known to the persecuting power not only leads to operational failure but also results in compounding security threats as perpetrators try to arrest associates of captured individuals (Sullivan 2016). The secrecy challenge is related to the high-risk collective action prob- lem because heightened secrecy reduces the odds of getting caught, making268 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective Actionparticipation more attractive for forward-looking actors. However, under- ground mobilization faces a unique trade-off that distinguishes it from other forms of high-risk collective action: mobilization requires dense and central- ized networks for recruitment, sanctioning, coordination, and communica- tion, all ofwhich increase the chances of detection and a group being compro- mised (Goffman 1970; Raab and Milward 2003; Enders and Su 2007). Hence, the tools needed to increase the collective capacity of a group are the very tools that put these groups at risk (Shapiro 2013), a dilemma that network analysts commonly refer to as the secrecy-efficiency trade-off (Morselli et al. 2007; Crossley et al. 2012). Advocates of this trade-off assume that covert networks necessarily sacrifice collective capacity for secrecy and consequently are characterized by low density, the exact reverse of a net- work structure conducive to high-risk mobilization (Raab and Milward 2003; Enders and Su 2007; Crossley et al. 2012). Studies of criminal net- works have challenged this assumption, revealing that underground orga- nizations do sometimes rely on dense networks for complex tasks because denser networks increase solidarity and facilitate careful recruitment and coordination, thereby reducing the risk of exposure by enhancing the qual- ity of mobilization (Baker and Faulkner 1993; Morselli et al. 2007; Crossley et al. 2012). The sociology of secrecy suggests that dense networks need to be struc- tured in a distinct way in order to facilitate clandestinity. More specifically, covert networks need to be both dense and isolated.On the one hand, secrecy— just like high-risk mobilization—requires strong group commitment, cohe- sion, and dense internal networks (Fine and Holyfield 1996). On the other hand, underground groups need to exclude uncommitted outsiders (Herdt 1990) in order to create barriers that prevent the leakage of secrets to the outside world (Gibson 2014). Whereas the classic collective action problem requires creating a core of committed followers who are willing to mobilize, the secrecy challenge necessitates that information actually stays within this core and does not spread to undedicated outsiders who could potentially re- veal clandestine activities (Herdt 1990). Overcoming both challenges at once requires isolated hubs of commit- ment withoutweak ties that could potentially transmit secrets to the uncom- mitted (Herdt 1990). The same process that makes weak ties strong when looking for jobs (i.e., the flow of new information) turns them into a liabil- ity for clandestine collective action (Granovetter 1995) and explains why co- vert organizations often emergewithin segregated groups of like-minded in- dividuals (Raab and Milward 2003). This notion combines insights from scholars arguing both in favor of and against the secrecy-efficiency trade- off, as isolated hubs of commitment are locally dense clusters located in a broader network that is sparse (Crossley et al. 2012), revealing a nonlinear relationship between network density and clandestine collective action in269 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Allgeneral (Gould 1993). Isolated hubs of commitment evoke the structure of many 21st-century terrorist organizations that consist of small and “leader- less” cells (Raab andMilward 2003) operating largely independently in pur- suit of a common cause (Sageman 2011).The Minority Advantage The high premium on commitment and secrecy restricts recruitment. Be- cause it is easier to generate group commitment between similar actors al- ready engaged in frequent interactions, recruitment into illicit collective action often proceeds through existing bonds of trust, typically resting on kinship ties or other strong relationships. As a result, clandestine collective action in times of upheaval often inherits group structures present in un- eventful times (Erickson 1981); put otherwise, preexisting group relation- ships create the confines within which clandestine mobilization emerges in times of crisis. Given the distinct challenges of clandestine mobilization, some groups are better equipped for its challenges than others because of the way in which they are locally embedded. The main hypothesis of this article is that minority groups have a natural advantage in producing and sustaining clandestine networks because they are anchored in isolated hubs of commit- ment that provide relatively safe places for illicit mobilization. At least four reinforcing processes increase isolation and commitment of minorities: distinctive identification, exclusionary pressures, social closure, and, in some cases, membership screening. According to the distinctiveness postulate, people rely on perceptual selectivity to make sense of who they are and what groups they are willing to commit to. Individuals tend to com- mit most to characteristics that are relatively rare in their social environ- ments because rare traits provide the most information about who you are. In line with the distinctiveness postulate, social psychologists studying collec- tive action have demonstrated that minority groups, those organized around relatively rare traits, display strong group identification andaremore likely to invest in within-group networks. These network choices and levels of identi- fication in turn increase internal cohesion, compliance with group norms, overall loyalty, and voluntary self-sacrifice among members, as well as social isolation (Brewer and Silver 2000). Needless to say, isolation is not always driven by the behavior of the mi- nority itself. Dominant groups see the practices and beliefs of minorities as strange and deviant, producing perceptions of threat and prejudicial atti- tudes, which in turn results in avoidance. Exclusion by the majority rein- forces isolation from mainstream society, while at the same time increasing the importance of cohesion and internal networks (Coser 1956).270 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective ActionIn cases inwhichmembership is voluntary, exclusion also creates isolated hubs of commitment and trust by changing the membership profile of mi- nority groups. Whenever social life is segregated by group membership, a minority position acts as a natural screening device because it imposes un- productive costs on members by inhibiting participation in dominant polit- ical, economic, and social networks. If one is not allowed to interact with out-group members in a region where everyone belongs to one’s commu- nity, membership costs aremarginal. However, if on a local level one’s group decreases in size relative to another community, prohibitions start to matter, and the costs of limited interaction become enormous for minority members. At the same time, these costs subsequently screen out potential free riders and increase the importance of the collectivity for everyone (Iannaccone 1994; Berman 2011). Finally, the combination of strong internal networks and exclusion also enhances social closure, providing opportunities to sanction members who decide to betray their fellows (Coleman 1988). Taken together, distinctive identification, exclusion, membership screening, and social closure turn mi- norities into dense networks of committed individuals (Coleman 1988) that are insulated from undedicated outsiders (Granovetter 1995; Portes 1995). These isolated hubs of commitment in turn create an opportunity to over- come the dual challenge of high-risk collective action and secrecy.From Isolated Commitment to Clandestine Mobilization As outcomes cannot be explained by their consequences, the minority ad- vantage in clandestine capacity does not manifest itself automatically (Els- ter 1989). Reliable and committed volunteers who happen to be embedded in isolated networks cannot simply walk to a recruiting office, nor do all or- ganizers automatically possess the cognitive skills and information to seize the opportunity provided by social enclaves. This study exposes three feed- backmechanisms that translate the abstract minority advantage into higher levels of clandestine mobilization among minority enclaves: selective reten- tion, organizer’s assurance, and organizer’s selectivity. First, selective retention refers to the process through which entities with favorable traits perpetuate themselves because they are more likely to sur- vive their environmental conditions (Aldrich 1999). Selective pressures for resistance groups are severe, as repressive authorities have consistent strat- egies to detect, infiltrate, and uproot clandestine networks (Sullivan 2016). These strategies depend on intelligence about where illicit activities take place. Given their isolated nature, minority groups are less likely to reveal this information thanmajority groups and are consequently less likely to see their mission interrupted by intelligence agents. Selective retention also am- plifies the overall segregation of clandestine organizations. Expansion of re-271 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Allcruitment outside the confines of an existing group is appealing to some be- cause it can enlarge an organization’s impact and scope, but networks that scale outward often create internal differences in ideology, strategy, or style in the process, triggering innate strife and increasing the demand for coor- dination.Consequently, expansion reduces the likelihood that a rescue orga- nization can keep intelligence out of the hands of its much stronger opponent. Second, the importance of a minority position for clandestine collective action reveals itself to forward-looking organizers and recruits via an as- surance mechanism. As followers embedded in minority groups are more willing to take on risks for group and leadership, rescuers recognize that clandestine coordination is possible within the confines of their enclave, something that is reinforced by the segregated structures that were already in place before thewar. Themere assurance that fellowswould cooperate in this way increases the overall motivation among group members to set up and engage in clandestine missions (Elster 1989). Third, selectivity denotes the organizers’ ability to distinguish individu- als who are valuable for complex collective action from those who are not (Marwell andOliver 1993). It is easier forminority organizers to acquire this internal intelligence. In part, this ability derives from deep inside knowl- edge of the community. Because of the isolated nature of enclaves, minority organizers have larger networks that allow them to better tap into informa- tion flows, increasing the number of available signals with which they can recognize the preferences, trustworthiness, and capacities of fellow group members. Networks in which close primary relationships are provided in this way not only assure organizers about the feasibility of mobilization, they also produce an inventory of the different skills and resources available within the group, all of which could be accessed without having to leave the enclave of trust. The network closure of minorities, as a result, cuts across individuals with different skill sets, allowing for coordinated action among trustworthy actors. Leadership plays a central role in two of the three mechanisms because it is centralized organizers who are ensured that mobilization is possible and identify the best recruits. This does not imply, however, that the mecha- nisms are conditional on the existence of strong authority structures or for- mal hierarchies. All that is necessary for these mechanisms to operate is the presence of one or two individualswho arewilling to take the first step in the mobilization process. A large body of scholarship suggests that such orga- nizers exist even in the most egalitarian and antiauthoritarian communities (Swidler 1979). I return to this question in the conclusion, where I discuss several examples that indicate that the minority mechanisms also operate in organizations without authority. This point is further reinforced by the following case studies that reveal how nonformal authorities often were the first movers in mobilizing communities.272 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective ActionTWENTE Twente was established as a unified political entity when the Netherlands became part of the Holy Roman Empire in 804.With an eye to existing tribal boundaries, Charles the Great turned the region into a separate shire that much later became part of the Episcopal principality of Utrecht. Under the rule of the bishop, the region became completely Catholic, staying this way after the Burgundian andHapsburg emperors took over. This changedwhen a coalition of Dutch merchants and Calvinists staged a revolt against the Catholic king of Spain in 1555. The local elite in Twente reluctantly joined the Dutch revolt in order to maintain local privileges. Although, the whole of Twente became part of theDutch republic in 1597, a newwave of violence in 1605 split the region,which hadbeen unified formore than 600 years. For a little more than 20 years, Twente’s northwest remained Dutch, while the re- gion’s southeast fell under Spanish rule, until FieldMarshal Casimir rejoined both parts within the Dutch Republic (Klokhuis 1982). This brief 20-year political split had a resounding and long-term impact on the religious composition of Twente, amplified by the ongoing Reforma- tion and Counter-Reformation. While the northwest came to be dominated by Protestants, the southeast remained aCatholic stronghold (fig. 1).Minor- ity church communities were able to maintain themselves on both sides ofFIG. 1.—Twente, 1940273 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Allthe divide: in the Catholic south, Protestants were able to penetrate with help from the federal government, while in the Protestant north, Catholic enclaves survived with help from coreligionists living in nearby Germany. Under the influence of religious developments in nearby Germany, the re- gion also became a hotbed of Orthodox Protestant movements, attracting followers dissatisfied with modernism in the mainstream Protestant church throughout the 19th and 20th centuries (Demant 2015). The consequences of this religious history were still visible at the onset of the Holocaust. Figure 2 shows the distribution of Catholicism, Protestant- ism, and Orthodoxy in Twente in 1942.3 As one can see, Catholics were still dominant in the southeast, Protestants dominated the northwest, and mi- nority enclaves of Protestants and Catholics existed on either side of the re- ligious fault line. Figure 2b reveals that both Catholic and Protestant parts of Twente were home to numerous smaller Orthodox Protestant commu- nities. Figure 2c shows that in 1942, right before the deportations began, al- most 3,000 Jews were living across Twente. Because Jews resided in both Catholic and Protestant parts of Twente, it is possible to compare rescue in both parts of the region.4 Twente is unique for a second reason:with the exception of the 20 years of the Counter-Reformation, it has always been a unified administrative terri- tory. Religious differences notwithstanding, the region integrated econom- ically and politically under Dutch rule. Because it was relatively isolated from the rest of the country, it independently developed a textile industry by relying on extensive cottage industry. In 1830, the Dutch government des- ignated Twente as the country’s textile center, reinforcing unity even more (Klokhuis 1982). The major religious divergence aside, this level of economic integration guaranteed that the region’s economic and political homogeneity was sus- tained. This enables me to keep other factors that could potentially explain minority mobilization constant. Figure 3 compares newly digitalized census data for different religious groups living in the Protestant and Catholic parts ofTwente in 1947 (the year closest toWorldWar II forwhich subgroup-level data are available) and Jewish census data from early 1942, right before the deportations started.Thefigurepresentsdifference-in-means tests and accom- panying P-values for Jews, Protestants, Orthodox Protestants, and Catho- lics living in Catholic and Protestant counties for a range of socioeconomic variables.

Minorities and Collective Actionestants, or Catholics residing in the northwest ofTwentewere indeed roughly comparable to their counterparts in the southeast in terms of age, economic activity, and levels of integration. Statistical analysis elsewhere has revealed that Jews and minorities were not more likely to live in proximity of each other, nor were they better integrated (Braun 2016).5 The subnational focus onTwente has a third advantage in that it controls for potentially macrolevel confounding variables. Crucially, top-down en- forcement of mobilization between congregations is largely kept constant as Protestant and Catholic leaders in the Netherlands protested anti-Semitic legislation collaboratively, repeatedly, and consistently at the national level, providing allChristians, regardless of congregation or social position (minority/ majority), with the same moral message of how German persecutions went against the tenets of their faiths (Croes and Tammes 2004). In addition, mi- nority andmajority congregations inProtestant andCatholic parts ofTwente were exposed to the same occupation regime and as a result faced similar lev- els of threat and repression.6QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS Data Although studying clandestine behavior is hard, Twente offers a rich body of archival material with which to compare between (1) clandestine collec- tive action and nonmobilization and (2) successful and failed clandestine networks. This allows us to assess overall differences in the mobilization ca- pacity of minority and majority groups. Hilbrink (1989) provides a comprehensive list of all recognized resistance fighters in the region. Using this list, it is possible to access a unique and un- derutilized collection of postwar testimonies that sheds light on successful resistance against genocide. The collection consists of research done byFoun- dation 40/45 in light of an honorary pension program. After the war, Dutch citizens could request an additional state stipend if they could prove that they or a deceased immediate family member had extra expenses or suffered in- jury because of resistance activities. Sheltering Jews was one of the activities that qualified as costly resistance. After someone had filed a request, Foun- dation 40/45 would start an investigation. Interviews with neighbors, relia- ble policemen, mayors, surviving Jews, and other members of the resistance were conducted to assess the trustworthiness of the claimant (Cammaert 1994).5 Given the low number of observations, theP-values should be takenwith a grain of salt. 6 Nazi reports also reveal that minority andmajority groups were not scrutinized more or less by security agencies (Braun, in press). 275 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).

Minorities and Collective ActionTestimonies from other resistance fighters prove particularly useful in re- constructing the social structure of clandestine organization, as almost all interviews started with a brief description of how the testifier and the claim- ant had come into contact with each other. The files are stored by the Social Insurance Bank and can be consulted in Winschoten, a city in the north of the Netherlands. In total, I consulted 207 files that provided information on 53 rescue networks active in 21 of all 26 counties. In total, eight of these 21 counties were Catholic. Religious organization plays an important role in 42 out of the 53 identified networks. Because these files are based on testimo- nies of survivors, they mostly provide information on successful networks.7 To compare successful and unsuccessful mobilization (networks that are detected and completely dismantled by security forces), I combine the files from the Social Insurance Bank with postwar trials of collaborators whoFIG. 2.—Religious minorities in Twente, 1942: a, Catholic and Protestant minorities; b, minority Protestants; c, Jews.7 I redid all the analyses, relying only on testimonies provided by surviving Jews, tomake sure thatmy data generation processwas not driven by strongerminority networks.

Minorities and Collective Actionwere active in Twente. Denouncing and arresting innocent Jews is, of course, unconstitutional and was heavily persecuted after the war. These were also crimes that were relatively easy to prove, as the Nazis kept records of how they deployed Dutch collaborators. As a result, trials often provide informa- tion on Jews that were arrested in hiding, enabling us to get information on failed resistance. The trial documents also provide information on how the Nazis tried to detect associates of captured individuals, granting some insight into how and why some networks failed. These trial documents are stored in the National Archives in The Hague. In order to compare successful mobilizationwith nonmobilization, I com- plement the two bodies of testimonies with diaries and existing interviews of people who decided not to save Jews (Hilbrink 1989; Van Der Boom 2012; Demant 2015). These accounts shed light on obstacles to mobilization, which minority groups, according to the central hypothesis of this article, are better positioned to overcome. The next section discusses the qualitative analysis. I first detail the dilemma that clandestine organization posed for Gentiles who sympathized with Jews. I then give a bird’s-eye view of all religious rescue operations inTwente before providing more detailed cases of successful and unsuccessful mobilization for both Protestant and Catholic parts of Twente. These sections are organized around the three mechanisms of selective retention, organizer’s assurance, and organizer’s selectivity. Finally, the last subsection highlights the impor- tance of religious segregation for minority organizers and points out how reli- gious mixing undermined the minority advantage by reducing isolation.The Clandestine Collective Action Dilemma The Wehrmacht invaded the Low Countries in 1940. During its first two years, the occupation regime slowly marginalized Jews, before begin- ning deportations to the infamous extermination camps in Eastern Europe (Croes and Tammes 2004). How did individual Christians respond to the Jewish persecutions? If nascent resistance fighters were indeed facing a clan- destine collective action dilemma,wewould expect that a lot of peoplewilling to rescue refrained from doing so out of fear. Indeed, diaries paint such a pic- ture. Partly under the influence of religious leaders who repeatedly protested theNazis, the overall attitude ofChristians inTwentewas pro-Jewish and anti- German. Sjouke Wynia from Denekamp remembered his father being furi- ous when their Jewish neighbors had to leave their house (Demant 2015, p. 139).WillemDingelheim, also fromDenekamp,wrote in his diary that “ev- eryone was heartbroken” because of the “undefinable suffering of the Jews.” Several high school headmasters in the Twente area were seen crying when explaining to their pupils that their Jewish classmates and teacher were no279 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Alllonger allowed to attend their institution. The diary of the head of the Jewish Council ofEnschede confirms that the general population resented the depor- tations (Demant 2015, p. 139). Postwar interviews with both Jews and Gentiles in Twente indicate that sympathy had translated into small-scale help for Jews before the roundups started.When Jewswere no longer allowed to buy groceries in regular stores, a shop owner in Haaksbergen provided food to former Jewish customers for free under the counter. In Enschede, Gentiles secretly bought groceries for Jews living in their street (Demant 2015, p. 134). Other neighbors helped to soften financial strain by lending money or providing employment (Geritz- Koster 1999). It has been argued that in Enschede Jews and Gentiles grew closer to each other than ever before during the early years of the war (De- mant 2015). On occasion, Gentiles even displayed public support for their persecuted neighbors. In both Almelo as Enschede, groups of Gentiles ac- tively protested the introduction of the Jewish star by wearing one them- selves. This open form of resistance was short-lived, however, and ended when the police started arresting participants (Demant 2015). These relatively low-risk activities notwithstanding, large-scale clandes- tine protection of Jews was rare. Risk perceptions formed an important im- pediment to this form of resistance. After observing Jewish mothers asking Gentiles to save their children, a bystander wrote in her diary: “Who has the courage to do that? It is not allowed. You will undergo the same fate.” The clandestine nature of the operation was deemed particularly challenging: “How on earth could you hide five grown-ups, three children,” a woman wrote after hearing about the arrest of a Jewish family that had gone into hiding to avoid deportation (Van Der Boom 2012, p. 244). Gentiles, al- though outraged by what happened to the Jews, also recognized that protect- ing Jews was difficult and risky. When responding to the question whether he ever considered sheltering Jews, Benno van Delden from Enschede said: “No never. . . . The SS, the camps, firing squads, torture and all that misery. You had to be very strong to shelter someone” (Demant 2015, p. 141). Fear and uncertainty resulted in an overall feeling of helplessness. One diary, for instance, characterized the first roundups as “systematic elimina- tion against which we could not do anything.”Trying to capture the overall mental state of bystanders, a female witness to an early roundup wrote: “Everyone was deeply moved. Outraged out of pure powerlessness” (Van Der Boom 2012, p. 244). That the risks involved made it hard for people to imagine any form of organized solidarity with Jews is revealed in the fol- lowing statement by a nonrescuer: “I am willing to go to jail for my convic- tions. It would have an enormous impact if everyone was willing to do this, but this is not the case. . . . It is hard to know what to do” (p. 244). Another diary similarly shows that the prospect of punishment created passivity among Dutch citizens: “We poor Christians could not do anything but fol-280 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective Actionlow Lukas 22:53. Follow from afar that is our fate and cross. Let’s hope our sympathy can revitalize Jews” (p. 244). It is of course possible that Gentiles were trying to find easy excuses to le- gitimate their passive behavior. However, testimonies from Twente’s Jew- ish population suggest that the feelings of powerlessness were justifiable. In interviews conducted by social scientist Demant during the early 2000s, sev- eral survivors asked themselves what they would they have done as Gen- tiles and concluded that passivity was a normal response in times of hard- ship and threat (2015, p. 183). After studying testimonies of successful protection networks, it is not hard to understand where feelings of powerlessness among Gentiles came from. Successful rescue organizations had to supply Jews with fake identi- fications papers, rationing cards, produce, clothes, information about up- coming roundups, medical care, funeral services, marriage counseling, psy- chological treatment, safe houses, ability to travel, communication lines, and, most important, numerous hiding places, as few rescuerswere able to provide shelter for a long period of time.8 Even thoughmost Christianswere outraged by anti-Jewish legislation, they recognized that they could not simply engage in clandestine collective action because it was too dangerous. Yet, as I will show in the next section, being embedded in a minority congregation in- creased the impact an outraged citizen could have on evasion by reducing both the actual and perceived danger.The Minority Advantage The central hypothesis of this article is thatminority groups are better able to overcome the clandestine collective action dilemma outlined in the previous section. To assess this systematically, I have coded all rescue groups active in Twente that could be found in the files of Foundation 40/45. I marked all groups that sheltered at least one Jew who survived World War II as suc- cessful and groups that mobilized but were not able to successfully shelter a single Jew as unsuccessful and dismantled.9 I code a network as religious if it was set up by a religious leader such as a reverend, priest, chaplain, re-8 On funeral services andmarriage counseling, respectively, see Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB) file 23 and SVB file 8, Docdirect, Winschoten; psychological treatment, Yad Vashem file L. Gerritsen in Michman et al. (2004); and communication lines, Dagboek Douwes, Netherlands Institute for War Documentation (NIOD) 244 1065, Amsterdam. 9 This is a crude operationalization strategy that does not allowme to capture partial dis- mantling of networks. As I have no exact information on the number of sheltered Jews who survived and got arrested per network, more fine-grained measurement is impossi- ble. However, the following case studies and quantitative analysis suggest that minority status affects infiltration and dismantling more broadly. 281 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Allligious schoolteacher, or politician active in a religious party. Using the de- nomination of the religious leaders active in the organization, I determined the denominational color of the organization. If theminority hypothesis holds, we would expect Protestant networks to be most successful in the Catholic southeast, Catholic networks to be most successful in the Protestant north- west, and Orthodox Protestant groups to be successful throughout Twente. Successful networks are depicted in figure 4 and are largely in linewith the minority hypothesis. All but two of the eight Protestant rescue organizations were active in areas dominated by Catholics. When we look at Catholic net- works, we see a similar picture with only two of the 15 successful movements operating in Catholic territory.10 Orthodox Protestant protection of Jews emerged in both Catholic and mainstream Protestant areas. This is in line with our theory, as the Orthodox formed minority communities everywhere. Figure 4c displays the five unsuccessful networks that could be found in the files. As we can see, all of these networks are connected to majority con- gregations.11 Overall, this spatial pattern suggests that minority networks were better able to produce and sustain successful rescue operations, while attempts of majority groups were more likely to fail.Assurance Why were minorities better at producing clandestine collective action? In a postwar interview, Catholic Chaplain Visser, who was active in the pre- dominantly Protestant town of Wierden, explicitly talks about the impor- tance of minority isolation in assuring him that mobilization was possible. Acting out of sympathy for those in need, he knew he could always rely on specific local Catholic farmers to help with providing food and shelter. In turn, farmers blindly trusted their Catholic front man and were suspicious of everyone outside of their religious enclave. Religious segregationswere so strong that Catholics even went to the chaplain and local Catholic head- master for medical advice because they refused to listen to the local doctor, who happened to be Protestant. Exploiting the commitment of his followers, Visser purposively created an isolated organization to reduce exposure. He built his rescue network around people he could trust and ignored contacts outside of his own congregation: “I always wanted to stay independent. No-10 These four majority networks emerged in tiny villages or were inspired by interregional movement entrepreneurs, suggesting that geographical isolation and external efforts can compensate for a lack of minority secrecy (Gould 1995). 11 Because of the lenient criterion for success (one Jewish survivor), only five networks failed according to my coding. Relaxing this criterion is hard to do with the current data. However, the case studies below reveal that selective retention played an important role in producing resistance within isolated hubs of commitment. 282 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective Actionbody outside my parish knew what I was doing. . . . My own people knew but they kept quiet” (Hilbrink 1989, p. 323). In Protestant Enschede, chaplain Van Der Brink told a similar story of how minority isolation enabled clandestine mobilization by assuring both secrecy and commitment. Already before the war, Van Der Brink’s church had successfully summoned Catholics to leave the Dutch Nazi Party.When the deportations started, he convinced Catholic police officers to refuse co- operation with anti-Semitic legislation. Inspired by his brother, who pro- vided himwith illegal newspapers, fake identity papers, and food vouchers, he set up an underground network with the help of parish members and po- lice officers. Hewas able to find several shelters for Jews amongmembers of his community after temporarily hiding them in presbyteries. Catholic boy scouts were used as couriers, while funding for his organization was ob- tained from businessmen in the parish. In advance of roundups, a local po- lice officer would post a warning note on the doors of the Catholic church (Bekkenkamp 2000). All contacts ran via the presbyteries to maintain the exclusively Catholic character of the operation. Similar to what we saw in Wierden, the chaplain of Enschede never forayed outside his parish in order to reduce exposure, noting “Within your own parish you knew whom to ap- proach for help. Those people will not let you down.”12Selective Retention Compared to their counterparts in minority enclaves, majority leaders were less successful in creating and sustaining clandestine organizations. Their attempts to set up coordinated resistance along lines of trust often got dis- rupted because of early denunciations by uncommitted parish members. As a result, retention of their rescue organizations was less likely (Aldrich 1999). This reinforced the minority advantage in clandestine collective action. To illustrate, it is instructive to compare the trajectory of Enschede rev- erends Leendert Overduin and Nanne Zwiep. Until 1926 their careers fol- lowed a similar path. Both men received their religious education at elite universities and aimed to become ministers in the mainstream Dutch Re- formed Church. But whereas Zwiep had led Dutch Reformed congrega- tions in northern parts of the country before coming to Enschede, Overduin had decided to switch to theminuscule andmore orthodoxReformedChurch in Restored Dependency that was founded in 1926 after an intense scriptural debate about whether Adam was able to hear the snake in the Garden of Eden talk. Their doctrinal differences notwithstanding, the two men came together with other religious leaders in September 1941 to file a complaint against early12 Interview, kapelaan Van Der Brink, NIOD. 283 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).

Minorities and Collective Actiondeportations of Jews with the local authorities. On multiple occasions Zwiep and Overduin gave anti-Nazi sermons in which they denounced anti-Jewish legislation and tried to convince people to resist (Bekkenkamp 2000). But de- spite these similar actions, their fates diverged dramatically on April 20, 1941. Whereas Zwiep was arrested and died in Dachau, Overduin became the or- ganizer of one of the most successful rescue networks in the country. What explains this difference? Overduin’s congregation consisted of fewer than 50 souls, all of whom he knew personally. His sermons were only heard by loyal people he could trust. Zwiep, however, lectured in themain church of Enschede and sometimes drew crowds of around 500 people, some of whom hadnever seen each other. Zwiepwas cautioned numerous times and asked to tone it down: “Reverend watch out, they are watching you! Your enemies do not sleep. They will be in the church this very morning” (DeWolf 1947, p .7). His sacristan told him he had seen the organist, whose son was a Nazi, take notes while Zwiep was preaching (Bekkenkamp 2000). While an undedicated member of his congregation denounced Zwiep, Overduin was able to exploit the dense networks of his community to save over 700 Jews. His organization could grow rapidly, as his followers “always said yes” and he knew exactly whom to trust. Much like Zwiep, his followersFIG. 4.—Rescue networks in Twente: a, Roman Catholic and Protestant networks; b, Orthodox Protestant networks; c, failed networks.285 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Allwere often driven by “the desire to help those in danger” and the command- ment to love thy neighbor.13 Dressed up as a baker or chimney sweeper, he traveled between different members of his organization hiding secret doc- uments in his umbrella (Weustink 1985). The core of this organization con- sisted of 20 operatives, most of whomwere recruited from the tiny Reformed Church in Restored Dependency.14 Fromwithin his parish, Overduinwas able to recruit helperswith diverse skill sets. One of his main assistants, the head of the church’s council of al- dermen, was employed in a wood factory and could therefore provide both the resources and skills to build secret hideouts and storage rooms in homes. Other members of his parish were painters who helped to camouflage shel- ters, typographers who delivered paperwork, and a graphic specialist who forged documents.15 Contrary to Overduin and in a similar vein as mainstream Protestant Zwiep, theDutchmajorityReverendsVanGelder fromSteenwijk, VanStaaij from Wierden, Le Roy from Almelo, and De Geus from Almelo were all ar- rested early on while mobilizing their congregations because their activities became exposed by disloyal adherents (Hovingh 2015). DeGeus illustrates the dangers a religious leader faced whenmoving from aminority tomajority community, revealing that the selective retentionmech- anism was more important than individual organizing skills. Before coming to Almelo, DeGeuswas at the helm of a small Dutch Reformed congregation in the Catholic town of Beuningen, near Nijmegen. Within this enclave he forcefully and freely preached against the Nazis without any repercussions. Despite numerous warnings from within his congregation, he continued his anti-Nazi tirades when he was transferred to Protestant Almelo in 1940. “If Church and Christ no longer tell the truth no one will” (Touw 1946, p. 620) wasDeGeus’s responsewhen his closest followers tried to caution him. In line with the fears of congregation members, De Geus was apprehended by the Nazi security police when they found out he had distributed pro-Jewish texts among his followers in January 1942 (Touw 1946). Selective retention also operated in the Catholic southeast. Before the Ger- man invasion, Pastor Stokman from Oldenzaal worked with the Catholic mayor to help Jewish refugees from Germany. He called on his followers to open their houses for those fleeing anti-Semitic legislation and convinced both the local Franciscan monastery and Parish house to set up emergency kitch-13 Yad Vashem file A.

Minorities and Collective Actionens. Numerous followers answered his requests. A Roman Catholic cinema owner even made one of his theater rooms available as a shelter. Of course, Stokman had to abandon his open help to Jewish refugees when the Germans took over the country. Instead, he shifted his focus to a more covert operation.He tried tomobilize people he knew from theCatholic labor union to help Jews and to distribute anti-Nazi pamphlets. Unfortunately, he failed miserably, as his activities became known to the Nazis within weeks. One of his followers had leaked information. Already in 1940, two years be- fore themajor deportations started, he had to fleeOldenzaal. His partner, the mayor, was imprisoned. Despite the revealed preference for resistance, no Catholic rescue network filled the void left by Stokman’s departure (Weus- tink 1985).Organizer’s Selectivity Close inspection of rescue operations a few miles outside of Twente suggests that a minority shell also made it easier for religious leaders to recognize and recruit committedmembers. TheRoukema familywas part of the tightly knit Vrijgemaakten church, within which there “were no social boundaries.” Al- though they were not particularly interested in politics, they listened to the sermons of themilitant ReverendKlaas Schilder who called on true believers to step up against anti-Jewish policies during the early years of the war. The oldest Roukema son, Gijs, was motivated by Schilder’s words: “He encour- aged us to stop talking and resist forcefully.Out of the emergency shelter, into your uniform” (Hilbrink 1998, 96–98). The leadership of the Vrijgemaakten church was soon made aware of Gijs’s attitudes toward the Germans. A local pastor happened to be in the Roukema residence when Gijs openly expressed how excited he was about the foresight of resistance. Not much later, another reverend visited the family. He knew the family because Roukema senior had been his school- teacher, and he had heard about Gijs’s defiance toward the Germans. The pastor approached Gijs to become his assistant in an illegal rescue organiza- tion that helped hundreds of Jews by the end of the war. Not far fromwhere the Roukemas lived, youngster Spanhaak also got in- spired by one of his religious leaders: Horreeus de Haas. In debates with National Socialist leader AntonMussert, DeHaas attacked the anti-Semitic foundations of the Dutch Nazi Party. When he lost his job, Spanhaak was committed to do something about German policies. As a mainstream Prot- estant, however, he was unaware of the activities being undertaken by the nearby minority enclave of the Vrijgemaakten church until much later. Al- thoughwilling to participate, he always remained “an outsider” to the better organized clandestine resistance networks of the small Orthodox community287 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Alla fewblocks away and, as a result, was never able to fully engage in organized resistance (Hilbrink 1998). As the comparison between Gijs Roukema and Spanhaak illustrates, be- ing a member of a minority congregation conditioned the impact that a mo- tivated rescuer could have on the fate of Jews because individuals were de- pendent on leadership and organization to make a difference. Compared to their majority counterparts, minority leaders had the advantage of organiz- er’s selectivity; that is, they were more likely to recognize committed recruits and incorporate them in rescue operations (Marwell and Oliver 1993). The reverse also happened. Sometimesminority leaders could exploit their local intelligence to determine who was not suited for clandestine work. In Goor, for instance, church chaplains refused to include one of their parish- ioners into their rescue operations. As it turns out, this was a wise idea. The devote Catholic was somewhat delusional, thinking he could single-handedly win the war by physically besieging city hall.16 Not being embedded in a community of dedicated fellows not only ham- pered secrecy; it also made it hard to solve complex problems, such as find- ing enough financial resources. The nervous diary entry of Jewish Theresa Wertheim, who decided to go underground in Enschede but was not helped by a minority congregation, is emblematic: “When does the misery finally stop? Two or three months at most and our money will be gone. . . . We are starting to get worried. Soon we will run out of money. Then what will happen?”17 Minorities, however, were able to find financial resources because leaders had enough intelligence to selectively recruit actors with a wide range of skills who were willing to support their cause. When discussing the rescue activities of Catholic Chaplain Van Der Brink, we already saw that minor- ity leaders were able to mobilize funds from rich and committed parish members to overcome the problem thatTheresaWertheimwas facing. Some- times, however, the coordination of different skill sets was so strong that it simply solved financial problems by turning a rescue operation into little au- tarchic firms in which Jewish fugitives provided labor. In Nijverdal, an Or- thodox reverend brought together the owner of a fabric store, a baker, and a group of farmers, some of whom already knew each other from the Ortho- dox school, the church, or choir.18 The baker provided food for Jews, who in turn made bags out of straw provided by the farmers. The straw bags were then sold by the shopkeeper who used themoney to pay for food. As a result, 90 Jews were rescued without outside money.1916 SVB file 40, Docdirect, Winschoten. 17 Diary of Theresa Wertheim, http://www.joodscheraadenschede.nl. 18 Archive Flim NIOD 471 13 D. 19 SVB file 8, Docdirect, Winschoten. 288 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective ActionMinority networks in which close social relationships abound, thus, not only embed rescue organizers in hubs of commitment but also create an in- ventory of different skills and resources available within the confines of trusted enclaves. In this way, the network closure of minorities cut across individuals with different skill sets, allowing for coordinated solutions to complex problems while minimizing risks of defection.Segregation and Mixing One striking feature of both Catholic and Protestant rescue operations was that they tended to be completely segregated by denomination. Despite co- operation among religious leaders at the national level, local clandestine networks simply reproduced the structure of Dutch society. As prewar reli- gious networks were completely separated at a local level, recruitment of participants was almost automatically contained within one congregation. A baker’s son from Nijverdal who mobilized rescuers explains this general pattern quite straightforwardly: “We were Orthodox, hence so were our friends and customers. So these were the people where you brought [Jewish] children. . . . This way I placed ten Jews.”20 Mutual distrust and ignorance between different religious groups rein- forced network segregation. Protestants either did not know or refused to accept that Catholics were effective organizers of rescue operations. Despite the fact that the aforementioned Catholic Chaplain Van Der Brink from Enschede was able to run a rescue operation that sheltered almost 500 in- dividuals, some Protestants still considered him a sloppy and indiscrete daredevil who lacked organizational skills. The leader of a Protestant group in Hengelo even claimed that Catholics in general were nothing more than passive bystanders who were either cowards or pro-German.21 Fewwere as extreme as Orthodox leader Johannes ter Horst, who repeatedly expressed his contempt for people from different backgrounds. He went as far as to say he would shoot members of another denomination if he would run into them during a secret operation (Hilbrink 1989, p. 78). Stereotypes also permeated Catholic society. Members of Catholic net- works in Twente used the pejorative term “reverend’s clique” to allude to the passiveness and insolence of Orthodox Protestants. Mutual disrespect was equally widespread. On the rare occasion that actors from different de- nominations did come together, Catholics got annoyed by the fact that Prot- estants always had to start every communication with prayer (Hilbrink 1989).20 Interview Flim, Archive Flim NIOD 471 13C. 21 SVB file 22, Docdirect, Winschoten; Archive NIOD 251a 61. 289 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology AllInherited mistrust could even trump proven dedication to the illegal cause. In Catholic Borne, a member of the majority church volunteered to join a Protestant resistance organization after he had helped one of its lead- ers escape fromaGerman security official. Despite the risks the boy had taken to save the life of one of its coremembers, the Protestant organization refused his further services because he was considered “too loose” by the Protestant community. Ironically, his reputation was partly created by his mother, who spread negative rumors about him because she wanted to sabotage his rela- tionshipwith a Protestant girl he had recently started dating. As a goodCath- olic, she could not approve of this relationship.22 Actors aiming to bridge social divides were seen as intruders by other re- sistance fighters. In Almelo, a social democrat decided to join an Orthodox group in 1943. Despite the fact that he had already proven to be a dedicated resistance worker on his own, it did not work at all. Other Orthodox Prot- estants found it difficult to cooperate with him and looked at the outsider with contempt. On more than one occasion they tried to get rid of him early on by providing misinformation about future meetings and activities. A year after he joined the organization, he was arrested.23 As emerged out of the stories of Chaplains Van Der Brink and Visser, re- ligious leaders often actively guarded the boundaries of their group. In a similar vein, Leendert Overduin, the reverend of the tiny Reformed Church in Restored Dependency in Enschede, also made sure his networks did not interfere with the activities of other groups beyond what was strictly neces- sary. Overduin was infuriated when he found out that one of the families in his network had recently started to house a resistance fighter andmember of a different network who was on a mission to kill a local collaborator. Overduin did everything in his power to prevent the murder from happen- ing and had the resistance member removed from the household (Weus- tink 1985). Repeatedly, Overduin had arguments with secular rescuer Tusveld about who should take care of specific Jews. Overduin did not trust Tusveld, and the men refused to cooperate with each other, despite the fact that they were sheltering members of the same family (Bekkenkamp 2000).24 One of Over- duin’s closest accomplices commented that “you got reprimanded” by Over- duin if a rescuer engaged in other resistance activities and networks.25 In an extreme case, arguments over segregation even created a rupture within organizations. In Catholic Oldenzaal, a Protestant rescue mission led by political party leaders Van Der V. and P. operated at the margins be-22 SVB file 52, Docdirect, Winschoten. 23 SVB file 41, Docdirect, Winschoten. 24 SVB files 28 and 13, Docdirect, Winschoten. 25 SVB file 14, Docdirect, Winschoten. 290 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective Actioncause it could not recruit widely. VanDerV. tried to circumvent this problem by coopting a few Catholic helpers from outside his trusted circle in the orga- nization. P. was outraged when he found out about this and immediately decided to split off from the already minuscule organization. After the war, it was discovered that the two Catholic recruits were actually traitors.26 Several other cases reveal that minority leaders had good reason to be concerned about religious mixing, as it often undermined their clandestine mobilization advantage by increasing exposure. When information left the confines of the minority enclave, coordination problems emerged and denun- ciation became more likely. For example, when a rescue network emerged within the confines of a Catholic minority community in Almelo, it expanded outward quite suddenly. This turned out to have dramatic consequences for the movement. Take, for example, the Catholic boy scout leader Van Hessen who initi- ated the movement; secrecy was of the utmost importance. He even refused to tell his own brother the exact details of his activities. After a while, how- ever, his friend Buiter became less careful and started to recruit outside of Van Hessen’s network, feeling that the Catholic enclave was too small for his ambitions. The resulting inclusion of people from different backgrounds caused internal conflict about what strategy to pursue and, eventually, be- came Buiter’s downfall, at least according to Van Hessen: “In the begin- ning, he [Buiter] relied heavily on my contacts to build up a resistance net- work. Soon, however he seemed to know more people than I did. He even forged a link between our group and the LO [Protestant]. Soon after, the network was betrayed and infiltrated by a V-Man [Nazi spy].”27 Together with Protestant organizers, several members of the originally Catholic move- ment, including Buiter, were arrested. Before the arrest, numerous people had already warned Buiter that the movement was becoming too visible (Hilbrink 1989). After this partial dismantling of the network, Van Hessen moved back to a more segregated setup, which in his own view was safer: “We decided to go fully underground again. Shield the organization from the outside world to make it harder to penetrate by outsiders. Create a more camouflaged and fragmented organization.”28 The story of Buiter and Van Hessen is emblematic of numerous cases in which crossing religious boundaries resulted in operational failure of whole rescue missions. Mixing, however, could also affect the success rate within the same rescue operation. In Catholic Borne, an anonymous Protestant minister encouraged at least two families within his parish to shelter Jews.2926 SVB files 50 and 33, Docdirect, Winschoten. 27 SVB file 47, Docdirect, Winschoten. 28 SVB file 47, Docdirect, Winschoten. 29 SVB file 51, Docdirect, Winschoten. 291 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology AllWhereas the first worked in isolation and was able to keep Jews under- ground despite several searches, the second failed to do so.30 The head of the second household was arrested during a meeting with socialist and Catholic resistance workers. The meeting was set up to resolve disagree- ments about the distribution of food coupons between different factions within the network.31 All but one of the attendees was arrested (Hilbrink 1989). All these examples reveal how selective retention amplifies the overall segregation of clandestine organizations. Expansion of recruitment outside the confines of existing groups was appealing to some, as it could enlarge an organizations’ impact and scope. Unfortunately, networks that scaled out- ward often created internal differences in ideology, strategy, or style. This triggered innate strife and, in turn, increased the demand for coordination, reducing the likelihood that a rescue organization could keep intelligence out of the hands of its much stronger opponent. Whereas assurance and organizer’s selectivity both enhance minorities’ capacity to produce clandestine networks, the selective retention mecha- nism guarantees that minorities are also better at preventing detection. On the basis of this, we can derive two hypotheses that will be tested with quan- titative data in the next section: HYPOTHESIS 1.—Minority communities are more likely to produce rescue operations for Jews. HYPOTHESIS 2.—Once mobilized, minority communities are less likely to suffer from arrests.QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS To establish whether the minority advantage also operates outside of the borders of Twente, I use data on the location, religion, and detention of 1,013Dutch rescuers throughout theNetherlands provided byYadVashem (Michman et al. 2004) to statistically analyze whether minority groups were indeed both more likely to mobilize and less likely to get arrested when they did. Although these data are less refined and less complete than the data presented in the previous section, they do allow us to assess whether the les- sons drawn from the Twente case travel beyond its borders. As a first cut at the data, I divided the Netherlands into municipalities dominated by Prot- estants and those dominated by Catholics. I then counted the number of Dutch Reformed rescuers in the latter half as well as the number of Catholic rescuers in the former half and added the number of rescuers belonging to30 SVB file 30, Docdirect, Winschoten. 31 SVB file 51, Docdirect, Winschoten. 292 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective ActionOrthodox Protestant denominations. This sum was then divided by the to- tal number of rescuers for whom their religion was known. The results are presented in figure 5. According to this coding scheme, 26.6% of the general population would belong to a minority congregation. Overall, postwar tes- timonies seem to confirm that minority groups were more likely to rescue Jews. Of all the rescuers commemorated by Yad Vashem (Michman et al. 2004), 62% belonged to a minority church. The data have serious limita- tions, as Yad Vashem only recognizes altruistic rescue and ignores rescue provided out of financial or personal motives. Therefore, I conducted a sim- ilar analysis using survey data collected among Jewish survivors (Evers- Emden and Flim 1996). A similar picture emerges: of the 226 rescuers whose religion is known, 61% adhered to aminority religion. Aswe can see, the per- centage of minority rescuers is very close in both data sets, giving us some confidence that measurement is valid. It is of course possible that geographical difference and other omitted var- iables might be driving this result. In particular, it is plausible that instead of the minority status that is based on relative size, it is absolute group size that causesmobilization. Smaller groups have an advantage inmobilization because contributions aremore likely tomake a difference, and they are eas- ier to monitor (Olson 1965). Therefore, I also analyzed the Yad Vashem data in a multivariate framework keeping geographical factors and abso- lute size constant.32 ImatchedYadVashem–recognized rescuers to all Cath- olic, mainstream Protestant, and Orthodox Protestant communities that ex- isted in the Netherlands in 1930 (Central Bureau for Statistics 1931 census). This results in a database of 2,883 religious communities nested in 1,027 counties for which we know how many rescues took place according to Yad Vashem. If the minority hypothesis holds, we would expect Catholic communities to be more likely to produce rescuers in Protestant parts of the country, Protestant communities to produce more rescuers in Catholic parts of the country, and Orthodox communities to be more likely to rescue everywhere. To capture this minority effect, I interact whether a commu- nity is Catholic with the percentage of Catholic Christians in amunicipality. The logic behind this is that Catholics should be more likely to rescue in ar- eas where relatively few Catholics live but less likely to rescue in areas where Catholicism is widespread because they are no longer a minority.33 I control for logged group size to disentangle the minority effect from small32 I prefer to use the Yad Vashem files over the survey data, as the former have a broader coverage providing more opportunities to keep geographical factors constant. Analysis based on the survey data is consistent with the results presented below. 33 This strategy tests the minority argument for Catholics and mainstream Protestants in one model, as Catholics are not mainstream Protestants and vice versa. 293 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).

Minorities and Collective Actiongroup effects. Results of the analyses, with municipality clustered standard errors and population weights, are presented in table 1. Model 1 looks at the percentage of rescuers for each religious community, while model 2 looks at whether at least one rescuer was active in a commu- nity. In line with theminority hypothesis, the effect of Catholicism on rescue is conditional on the overall strength of Catholicism in the region, regard- less of what outcome variable is chosen. Since interaction effects are some- what hard to interpret, the model is visualized in figure 6. As we can see in figure 6b, Catholics are 50% more likely to produce networks of assistance to Jews in Protestant areas, while the same is true for Protestants in Catholic areas (see also fig. 7). Figure 8 reveals that Orthodox groups, the smallest congregation everywhere, are about 12%more likely to stage rescue opera- tions. The third model shows that the results are robust to the inclusion of municipality-level fixed effects, suggesting that the minority effects are not driven by local-level omitted-variable bias. The case study of Twente shows that minority networks were also less likely to be exposed and uprooted. Using Yad Vashem files, it is possible to retrieve whether rescuers were arrested, which can be used as a proxy for ex- posure. Again, the effect of Catholicism on getting arrested is conditional onTABLE 1 Religious Communities and Rescue of Jews, 1940–45 % RESCUE RESCUE YES/NO % RESCUE Model 1: OLS Model 2: Logit Model 3: OLS Catholic community . . . . . . . . . . . .01*** .51*** .02*** (.00) (.13) (.01) Catholic strength . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .02** .72*** (.01) (.18) Catholic community  Catholic strength . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.03** 21.16*** 2.06** (.010) (.32) (.02) Orthodox community . . . . . . . . . . .013*** .12*** .01** (.00) (.04) (.00) Constant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .00* .23*** 2.01*** (.00) (.05) (.00) Municipality fixed effects . . . . . . .

Minorities and Collective Actionthe overall religious environment. As we can see in figure 7b, Catholics en- gaged in rescue operations in Protestant parts of the Netherlands were more than 20% less likely to get arrested than their Protestant counterparts. This effect reverses in areas dominated by Catholics, where mainstream Protes- tant clerics were almost 10% less likely to get arrested. Figure 8 reveals that Orthodox Protestant clerics were about 8% less likely to get arrested overall. The effects become more pronounced when municipality-level fixed effects are included, suggesting that the minority argument is not likely to be con- founded by local geographical factors (see table 2). Yad Vashem files are based on testimonies of Jewish survivors and are therefore likely to capture successful mobilization missing large numbers of exposed networks. This truncates the sample and could potentially bias the results. Retrieving religious information from all arrested rescuers in the country is probably impossible. As another test, I focus on a important sub- set of rescuers for which denominational information is easy to obtain: cler- ics. The case study above revealed that clerics frequently played a role in rescue operations. It is therefore reasonable to assume that arrests of clerics provide some insight into the overall exposure rate of religious groups.

American Journal of Sociology Allhave constructed a database of 405 clerics from 200 municipalities who en- gaged in rescue operations throughout the county, by combining informa- tion on successful attempts culled from the already used Yad Vashem files (Michman et al. 2004), with unsuccessful attempts obtained from religious commemoration books (Hamans 2008; Hovingh 2015). This allows me to compare arrests rates between majority and majority clerics. Figure 7c vi- sualizes the results. In line with what we saw for rescuers in the Yad Vashem files alone, Ro- manCatholic clerics active in Protestant areasweremore than 60% less likely to get apprehended by security forces, while Protestants were 26% less likely to be exposed in Catholic areas. Orthodox Protestants were 17% less likely to be arrested throughout the country. Focusing on clerics reduces the number of observations and, as a result, variationwithinmunicipalities. Thismakes it impossible to include fine-grained fixed effects. Nevertheless, taken together these analyses provide compelling support for the minority analysis in sug- gesting that in the Protestant parts of the Netherlands, Catholics were more likely to produce successful rescue operations that were less likely to be ex- posed, while the same is true for Protestant communities in Catholic parts of the country.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This article shows that local minority groups are better at producing and sustaining clandestine operations. Because they form isolated hubs of commitment, minority enclaves can mobilize while reducing exposure to uncommitted outsiders, thereby overcoming the clandestine collective ac- tion dilemma. Studying the protection of Jews in the Netherlands provides a unique opportunity to substantiate this thesis. Still, it is plausible that the clandestine capacity of minorities is conditional on the associational seg- mentation, overall levels of opposition to foreign occupation, pluralism, open and cooperative protests by national elites, or the highly centralized nature of religious communities that characterized Dutch society during the war. To explore whether these conditions somehow delimit the importance of minority mobilization, making my finding unique to the Netherlands, I turn to Yad Vashem testimonies of 6,407 religious rescuers during the Holocaust living in 20 countries with different political and religious traditions. I divide the share of minority rescuers in the body of testimonies by the percentage of minority believers in a particular country, to assess whether religious minor- ities were under- or overrepresented among rescuers. An overview of these ratios is presented in figure 9. As we can see, religious minorities are overrep- resented among clandestine rescuers in both majority Catholic and Protes- tant countries, including countries with limited religious segmentation (e.g., France), where resistance was rare (e.g., Italy), where national leaders did300 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).

American Journal of Sociology Allnot protest (e.g., Belgium), and that were not occupied (i.e., Germany). More- over, minority mobilization not only emerged in more formally centralized Protestant andCatholic congregations but also within communities that lack formal hierarchies such as theQuakers in Germany and France, SeventhDay Adventists in the Ukraine, or Pentecostals in Russia, suggesting that minority capacity accommodates different forms of formal authority. Although minorities are overrepresented among clandestine rescuers al- most everywhere, the theory does not seem to travel to places where rescue missionswere highly individualized, such as Poland andLithuania, or where the persecuting regime permitted national elites to openly cooperate with leaders of majority congregations to resist the Nazi occupation in general, suchas inDenmark. In otherwords, the theorydoesnotwork incases inwhich rescue was neither collective nor clandestine (Braun, in press). The overall prevalence of religious minority mobilization throughout Eu- rope forces us to rethink the relationship between religion and theHolocaust, which often gets analyzed as a function of doctrine. For Catholics, it has been argued that their religion reduced solidaritywith Jews because of its reaction- ary tendencies and the traditional Jewish-Christian schism.Orthodox Protes- tantism has been linked to fascism, as it hinges on biblical racism, while others claim that Orthodox Protestants were willing to defy German author- ities because of their individualistic traditions and emphasis on the Old Tes- tament, in which the Jews were depicted as the chosen people. The opposite has been said about Lutherans who, the conventional wisdom goes, blindly accepted any form of secular political authority in line with their religion (Moore 2010). This analysis reveals that it is not doctrine, dogma, or religious identity that drives religious resistance. Instead, I draw attention to the social position of religious communities and its subsequent network effects. This in turn raises the question whether we are observing a distinctively religious phenomenon. It is possible that religious minority status during WorldWar II in the Netherlands provided a concrete research site through which the relationship between organized minority status and clandestine mobilization could be studied (Guhin 2014). But, religion’s strong organiza- tional infrastructure and defining powers might make it more robust in the creation of undergroundmovements than other social categories (Brubaker 2015). The Twente data speak directly to this question. Although 49 out of the 58 rescue networks could be classified as religious, secular networks did also play an important role. With the exception of a network run by a no- bleman who housed Jews on his estate and another for which the actual or- ganizational base could not be identified, secular groups protecting Jews in Twente all had a radical left profile. As in most of Western Europe, commu- nists and radical left-wing organizations in theNetherlandswere political out- casts. Much like members of minority congregations, several prominent com- munist resistance workers active in Twente were therefore expelled from302 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). Minorities and Collective Actionmainstream organizations and had to pay the costs for their revolutionary ide- als and formed isolated hubs.34 These extreme-left hubs translated into rescue organizations inVriezenveen,Almelo,Hengelo, andEnschede (Hilbrink 1989). Outside of the Netherlands, ethnic minorities played an important role in clandestine protection to Jews. Most notably, Poles, often lamented for not doing enough for the Jews in their own country, came to the rescue of Jews in the Ukraine where they formed an ethnic enclave (Arad 2009), again con- firming the notion that a formal (church) hierarchy was not necessary to ac- tivate minority mechanisms. Moving beyond protection networks for Jews, an abundance of anecdotal evidence suggests that minorities provide the clandestine backbone for revo- lutions and insurgencies across time and space. For centuries, rebellions and revolutions in China have been facilitated by Buddhist groups, such as the White Lotus Society (Perry 1976), while Lollard enclaves, Millenarian sects, and ethnic communes have played the same role in Western Europe as well as in Latin America (Engels 1967; Hobsbawm 1971). Together, this supports Smelser’s (1962) claim that minority groups often form the secretive linchpin of major social transformations. The importance of Quakers, Methodists, and immigrant groups for the Underground Railroad (Foner 2015), ethnic minorities’ role in criminal networks (Light 1977), and the overrepresentation of sects and immigrants among terrorist groups (Berman 2011; Sageman 2011) all draw attention to the fact that extremely centralized and “leaderless” minorities alike have an advantage in maintaining clandestine operations. This does not imply that my theory travels everywhere. It is important to note that pure minority isolation can only operate in the presence of mass media, such as the radio or telephone during World War II or the Internet more recently, which can transmit information aboutmovement goals with- out relying on face-to-face interaction. In the absence of such communica- tion lines, weak ties and central leadership structures are likely to become more important for overcoming the clandestine collective action dilemma (Sageman 2011). This article makes a call for a multilevel perspective on clandestinity that interrogates the interactions between microlevel factors, local community structures, and national processes to better understand how,when, andwhere social relations can be translated into covert resistance against genocide (Hagan and Rymond-Richmond 2008). The data presented above illustrate the usefulness of such an approach. First, they provide powerful evidence that the influence of microlevel factors, such as biographical availability, motiva- tion, and adventurousness, is conditional on minority capacity. My analysis, for instance, shows that adventurous individuals in minority communities34 SVB file 48, Docdirect, Winschoten. 303 This content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on August 07, 2019 07:18:56 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c). American Journal of Sociology Allwere able to join successful clandestine operations and rescue hundreds of Jews, while individuals with the same traits in majority congregations failed to have a similar impact. It also reveals that moral outrage was not sufficient for clandestine collective action. Many individuals were shocked by anti- Jewish legislation but refrained from clandestine collective action because they were not assured that the production of rescue networks was feasible. Only outraged individuals embedded in minority groups had the ability to translate their sentiments into underground networks. In addition, altruistic religious majority leaders who mobilized on behalf of Jewish refugees before the war were not able to continue their activities illegally once the occupation began because their networks were immediately exposed or because they could not recruit the right people. Hence, whether adventurous, available, and outraged individualswith strong identities and values are able tomobilize in secret is dependent on the local-level structures in which they are embed- ded. Second, national forces affect clandestinemobilization differently, depend- ing on whether communities form minority enclaves. Several testimonies re- veal that national church leaders played an important role in motivating Christians to engage in rescue. Others believed that the persecution of Jews didnotbelong inaplural society.However,most of these peoplewerenot able to translate theirmotivations into action because they considered the risks too high. Gentiles who did try saw their attempts thwarted by the Nazi security apparatus early on. It was citizens embedded inminority enclaves who could not only see an opportunity to act on national norms and obey their national leaders but who could also circumvent the challenges of a wartime repressive context. As withmicrolevel factors, the impact of national leadership, plural- istic norms, and repressive contextswas conditioned by the availability of dis- tinct local networks. This article thus suggests that ifwewant to better under- stand clandestine operations in times of mass repression, we need to take into consideration the local challenges of clandestine collective action in addition to micromotives and national conditions, and in turn we need to explain when, where, and how social networks can be appropriated for underground mobilization. Although this article compellingly shows the usefulness of a multilevel perspective for explaining the initial production of clandestine mobiliza- tion, it also has its shortcomings. Most important, it fails to shed light on how hubs of commitment can come together to produce social transforma- tion. Minority isolation facilitates secrecy, but at the same time, it limits the carrying capacity of rescue networks that hardly ever spread beyond the narrow confines of small enclaves, preventing the emergence of concerted challenges to authority. This highlights both the potential and the inefficien- cies ofminority groups that, much like tight-knit neighborhoodmovements, require interregional ties to transform society (Gould 1995).

However, we know from successful insurgencies and revo- lutions that secret cells do sometimes come together to transform society. Therefore, future studies should try explain why some disjointed covert ac- tivities percolate upward and forge these connections while others do not, exploring interactions with broader political opportunities, broader institu- tional coalitions, or broader issue networks (Loveman 1998).APPENDIXAll use subjecPrimary Source Archive Flim NIOD 471 13 D Archive NIOD 251a 61 Dagbook Douwes, NIOD 244 1065 Diary of Theresa Wertheim, http://www.joodscheraadenschede.nl Interview Flim, Archive Flim NIOD 471 13C Interview kapelaan Van Der Brink, NIOD SVB file 8, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 13, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 14, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 22, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 23, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 28, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 30, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 33, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 40, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 41, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 47, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 48, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 50, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 51, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 52, Docdirect, Winschoten SVB file 55, Docdirect, Winschoten Yad Vashem file A.
