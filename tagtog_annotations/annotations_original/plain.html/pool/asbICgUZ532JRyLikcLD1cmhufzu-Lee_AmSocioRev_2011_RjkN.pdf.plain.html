First, we describe a three-stage process in which a grow- ing productivity gap between the private-manufacturing and public-service sectors disrupts traditional class solidarity. We contend that emerging conflicts between private and public sectors due to public-sector expansion and a growing inter-sectoral productivity gap eventu- ally lead to employment and budget crises, as well as the weakening of coordinated wage- setting institutions. Furthermore, political, institutional, and economic transformations origi- nating from sectoral cleavages and imbalance lead to increased income inequality. We test this argument using an unbalanced panel dataset on 16 advanced industrial democracies from 1971 to 2003. We find that public-sector employment has a strong negative effect on income inequality when the productivity gap between sectors is low. In such situations, public-sector employment fulfills its promise of equality and full employment. However, as the inter-sectoral productivity gap increases, the negative effect of public-sector expansion on income inequality evaporates. The findings suggest that severely uneven productivity gaps due to different degrees of technological innovations significantly weaken and limit the effec- tiveness of left-wing governments’ policy interventions through public-service expansion. Keywords public-sector employment, sectoral productivity gap, sectoral conflicts, cross-class alliances, income inequality Recent studies on income inequality in advanced industrial countries follow two trends. One strand emphasizes the role of domestic political and institutional mecha- nisms in reducing inequality. Previous stud- ies of the welfare state highlight ways in which social policies have successfully reduced income and wealth gaps among citi- zens. In particular, scholars of power resource theory emphasize the role of traditional social democratic class politics in developing public provisions for social aUniversity of Chicago bHallym University Corresponding Author: Cheol-Sung Lee, Department of Sociology, University of Chicago, 1126 E. 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637 E-mail: chslee@uchicago.edu American Sociological Review 76(1) 100–124  American Sociological Association 2011 DOI: 10.1177/0003122410396195 http://asr.sagepub.com welfare and achieving more equal distributions of income. This work shows that welfare states led by left-wing governments and sponsored by strong labor unions have consciously employed redistributive tax and income transfer policies that (controlling for popular measures of glob- alization) greatly reduced income inequality (Bradley et al. 2003; Hicks and Swank 1984; Huber and Stephens 2001; Korpi and Palme 1998) and poverty (Brady 2005, 2009; Kenworthy 1999; Moller et al. 2003). Research also demonstrates that corporatist wage- bargaining institutions arranged among the state, strong unions, and employers have played decisive roles in decreasing wage inequality in northern and continental Europe (Checchi and Garcia-Penalosa 2008; Garrett and Way 2000). More specifically, the level of wage- setting, the concentration of unions, and the share of the labor force covered by collective bargaining play important roles in accounting for pay differentials across countries (Rueda and Pontusson 2000; Wallerstein 1999). The second strand of research identifies globalization as the driving force behind increasing income inequality (Alderson and Nielsen 2002). Some proponents of economic globalization argue that it benefits all income groups (Burtless et al. 1998), or at least low- income groups, by providing basic commodi- ties at lower prices (Bhagwati 2004). Many other scholars, however, agree that globaliza- tion has had detrimental effects on the poor and the working classes in advanced industrial countries (Hurrell and Woods 1995; Rodrik 1997; Tonelson 2000). However, these studies fail to detect or explain the increase in income inequality dur- ing the past few decades in advanced indus- trial countries in the context of the contradic- tions generated by the welfare state itself in its interaction with deep structural changes. We propose an explanatory model that empha- sizes the roles of domestic sectoral conflicts and structural imbalance between sectors in limiting a traditional component of left-wing governance: the egalitarian effects of public- sector employment. The structural imbalances and concomitant political conflicts between private and public sectors, as O’Connor (1977) pointed out, are deeply rooted in the capitalist economy, espe- cially with the development of the modern welfare state. Cleavages between the private and public sectors received a great deal of attention in liberal countries, such as the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s, when deep eco- nomic crises brought to the surface the funda- mentally different economic and political con- ditions between sectors (Blais, Blake, and Dion 1990; Edgell and Duke 1986). Building on this literature, we argue that sectoral divisions play a critical role in explaining the recent growth in income inequality, not only in liberal and continental European countries, but also in the heart of social democratic countries. By highlighting the role of sectoral politics and structural imbalance between sectors, we hope to explore the structural and political dynamics underlying the previously suggested determi- nants for income inequality, such as ‘‘the decline of wage-setting coordination’’ (Alderson and Nielsen 2002:1285) and ‘‘decreased employment’’ (Kenworthy and Pontusson 2005:453–54). We argue that an interactive process of public-sector expansion and a growing productivity gap between sec- tors results not only in employment and bud- get crises, but also in the weakening of coor- dinated wage-setting institutions, which, in turn, leads to increased income inequality. THEORETICAL DISCUSSION Stage I. The Link between Public- Service Expansion and Income Inequality: A Traditional Model In postwar advanced industrial democracies, public-sector employment, along with gener- ous social transfers, has effectively reduced income inequality through two mechanisms: increased job opportunities for former labor Lee et al. 101 market outsiders, and generous pay scales underpinned by coordinated wage bargaining. First, public-sector employment has reduced income inequality by providing socially and economically marginalized popu- lations with greater employment opportuni- ties. Public-sector expansion absorbs not only the redundant labor force but also socially marginalized populations (e.g., women) and other labor market outsiders into the public delivery of health, education, and social services (Gustaffson and Johansson 1999; Huber and Stephens 2000; Kenworthy 2008). When the formerly unemployed or non-employed enter the labor market, income inequality will drop. This public employment strategy has been the most effective tool for achieving full employment and equality, not only in social democratic countries but also, to a more mod- erate degree, in some continental European and liberal countries, such as Austria, Bel- gium, Canada, Ireland (in the 1980s), and the United Kingdom (in the 1970s). Partisan governments that use this supply-side ‘‘human capital creation’’ strategy (Boix 1998; Garrett 1998) have generated numerous jobs in public-service areas such as daycare, elder- care, afterschool programs, and job training programs (Benner and Bundgaard Vad 2000). Second, welfare states, as employers in pub- lic-sector services, reduce income (mainly wage) inequality by providing employees with higher pay than they would receive on the market and by maintaining this generous wage policy through coordinated wage-bargaining institutions. In this political- institutional process of public-service expan- sion, four actors—public-sector workers, pri- vate-sector workers, public-sector employers (government), and private-sector employers— formulate class-based coalitions based on their economic interests. The traditional public- sector expansion strategy should be economi- cally and politically viable as long as all four parties regard it as beneficial. Private-sector unions, especially in manufacturing sectors, will likely remain in the solidaristic wage- setting arrangement as long as productivity gaps between public and private sectors are low, because the unions can reduce wage gaps in and between sectors through coordi- nated wage bargaining. In addition, private- sector employers prefer to remain in coordi- nated wage bargaining, provided (1) their com- petitive advantage is substantially guaranteed by wage restraint and (2) sound macro-eco- nomic environments provide them with a satis- factory level of demand. Public-sector workers prefer to remain with coordinated wage bar- gaining because governments guarantee them relatively higher wages and fringe benefits than the free market could provide. The Stage I column in Figure 1 summa- rizes this process of political and institutional compromise. At this stage, the productivity gap between manufacturing sectors and public-service sectors is relatively small. Dur- ing this period, centralized blue-collar union confederations in Northern Europe and lead- ing industrial unions in other advanced democracies marshaled coordinated wage bar- gaining with private-sector business associa- tions. The results of this bargaining became a reference point for white-collar unions, including public-sector unions (Gourevitch et al. 1984; Hicks 1999; Stephens 1979; Swank 1999).1 With small wage differentials within and between sectors, public-sector expansion under a coordinated wage policy remains effective in reducing overall income inequal- ity. Based on this discussion, we predict the following: Hypothesis 1: Public-service expansion will have a strong negative effect on income inequality. Stage II. Increasing Productivity Gaps and the Emergence of Sectoral Conflicts Notwithstanding Hypothesis 1, we find that when countries pursue a high employment strategy via public-sector employment, it 102 American Sociological Review 76(1) generates conflict between the private and public sectors. Private-sector workers become increasingly discontented with public-sector workers’ wage and job secu- rity. Union leaders and members in the private sector consider public-sector unions’ close relationships with left-party or coali- tion governments to be unfair, because private-sector unions have to endure more hostile environments (e.g., lay-offs or wage-cut threats). Private-sector workers likely see public-sector workers’ privileges as luxurious working conditions sponsored by their tax money (Furåker 1987; O’Con- nor 1977). Private-sector employers may become increasingly critical of public-sector expansion, because they assume a growth in government employment will decrease profits and investment. These kinds of conflicts between the public and private sec- tors were salient in liberal countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as in some social democratic countries in the 1990s and 2000s, during times of economic crisis.2 The fundamental division between the pub- lic and private sectors is based on different rates of productivity growth,3 different levels of organizational and bargaining capacity against employers, and different levels of exposure to world markets. First, the majority of jobs created through public-sector employ- ment are low-productivity service jobs, for which increases in productivity over time are nearly impossible (Baumol 1967). When these jobs’ wages are determined only by productiv- ity, service-sector workers suffer from extreme poverty, as is often the case in the United States (Esping-Andersen 1990, 1999). Second, as public-sector employment increases, so does the power of public-sector unions. Public-sector unions, with strong bar- gaining power based on high memberships and a close relationship with their employers (i.e., left-wing or coalition governments), often attempt to launch independent wage bar- gaining efforts, regardless of wage bargaining Stage I Stage II Stage III Sectors Private Manufacturing Public Service Private Manufacturing Public Service Private Manufacturing Public Service Productivity Gap Low Increasing High Total Employment High Stagnant Stagnant/Decreasing Wage Bargaininga Coordinated Wage Bargaining Terms Set Up Follow Bargaining Results in Manufacturing Sectors Wage Restraint due to Intensified Competitions Conflicts Wage Increase Based on Strong Bargaining Power Industry or Firm-Level Wage Bargaining Conflicts Wage Restraint due to Government Budget Crisis → ←→ ←→ Between- Sector Inequality Low Highb Lowc Within- Sector Inequality Low Low Low Low High High Figure 1.

Lee et al. 103 in the private sector. Although pay raises without increases in productivity lead to the exit of services from the market in principle, well-organized public-sector unions and labor-friendly, left-wing governments jointly allowed the low-productivity/high-wage pub- lic sector to persist for decades. Third, public-sector workers are not exposed to increasingly competitive world markets; they therefore have more freedom to increase their wages with greater militancy, without being punished by lower employment. More productive private manufacturing-sector workers who are highly invested and trained are unable to seek higher wages, because the coordinated bargaining system suppresses wage increases in private sectors. Higher wages often lead to failure to conform to a world market price, loss of competitiveness, and a consequent decline in employment (Garrett and Way 2000). Some private-sector unions, witnessing the durable solidarity between public-sector unions and incumbent left-wing or coalition governments, become increasingly disen- chanted with their traditional partners. In par- ticular, private manufacturing-sector firms are faced with increasing pressure to accomplish higher levels of production flexibility and quality (Pontusson 1992; Pontusson and Swenson 1996). Employers’ needs for higher flexibility weaken existing coalitions based on solidaristic union movements. This decline in intra-class solidarity fosters new firm- or industry-level cross-class alliances between workers and employers. In the early 1970s in Sweden, for example, white-collar unions, including public-sector unions, formed an organization for independent wage bargaining (Flucher 1991) that paved the way toward decentralized wage bargaining in the 1980s and 1990s. Public-sector expansion, accompanied by a growing productivity gap between the manufacturing and public-service sectors, pla- ces two major sectoral actors of coordinated wage bargaining in completely different posi- tions: (1) manufacturing sectors are forced to accept wage constraints that result from inten- sified competition in the global market and the coordinated wage-bargaining system, and (2) sheltered public-service sectors enjoy wage increases based on their strong bargain- ing capacity (Iversen 1999). Workers in com- petitive manufacturing industries are likely to perceive that they are relatively deprived of their right to secure higher wages and benefits, relative to workers in the public sector, because the public sector’s high wages reduce the real wage in the private sector (because wages in the public sector are drawn from taxpayers in the private sector). Being increas- ingly dissatisfied with the lack of remunera- tion for their international competitiveness, private manufacturing-sector workers put pressure on their union leaders to leave the coordinated wage bargaining.4 To summarize, public-sector expansion accompanied by productivity gaps between sectors will lead to a weakening of traditional coordinated wage-bargaining institutions, because employers and workers in the manufacturing sector will withdraw their sup- port (due to their increased discontent with the public-sector’s expansion and strength, the concomitant tax burden, and their own desires for wage flexibility and higher wages).5 The Stage II column in Figure 1 summarizes these processes. Stage III. Increasing Productivity Gap and Increasing Income Inequality We argue that the public-service expansion strategy effectively reduced income inequal- ity in advanced industrial economies only until the 1980s; since the 1990s, it has failed to deliver its promised goals. This striking difference across time is due to growing pro- ductivity gaps between sectors, the concomi- tant emergence of sectoral conflicts and cross-class alliances in the 1980s, and the rearrangement of the economic-political sol- idarity structure between the public and 104 American Sociological Review 76(1) private sectors in the 1990s and afterward. In this section, we describe how a growing productivity gap nullifies the economic and political/institutional links between public-sector expansion and distributional outcomes. First, an increasing productivity gap sets limits on the public sector’s employment capacity and its contribution to total employ- ment. As the productivity gap between sectors grows, manufacturing sectors will shed increasingly more labor; the public- or private-service sectors should absorb the redundant labor force. However, most pub- lic-sector jobs are concentrated in administra- tion or delivery of public services, while redundant workers likely have specific skills that are not easily transferrable across firms or industries (Estevez-Abe, Iversen, and Sos- kice 2001; Hall and Soskice 2001). This struc- tural imbalance, or mismatch in skills between sectors (Jackman and Roper 1987; Layard, Nickell, and Jackman 1991; Turvey 1977), makes it difficult for unemployed workers to find alternative jobs, even in expanding public-service sectors. With a lack of jobs in the private-service sector (which is also due to the development of the public-service sector), redundant workers become long- term unemployed and rely on welfare state transfers.6 This increasing financial burden on welfare states contributes to governmen- tal budget crises,7 which eventually makes it difficult for governments to behave as gen- erous employers for redundant workers and their own employees.8 We therefore expect that an increasing productivity gap sets lim- its on the public sector’s employment capac- ity and its contribution to total employment (and its virtuous effects on distributional outcomes). Second, a public-sector employment strat- egy may foster inter-sectoral conflicts and cross-class alliances more severely in an econ- omy with large productivity gaps between sectors. In highly competitive private manufacturing industries, unions and employ- ers will achieve high productivity growth. They will have greater incentive to bargain at the firm or industry level, rather than the national level, so that their co-investment in highly productive organizational routines and firm- or industry-specific skills can be more directly rewarded on the basis of their own performance criteria. These unions and employers will prefer independent firm- or industry-based bargaining over centralized wage bargaining, so that they do not have to tolerate lower wages than (they believe) they deserve or the high wages that public-sector workers earn relative to their low productivity. Employers in the highly competitive and productive manufacturing or high-tech sectors will also have greater incentives to avoid tra- ditional collective wage-bargaining and to establish their own wage and benefit struc- tures to enhance their employees’ commit- ment levels (Pontusson and Swenson 1996).9 In addition, some employers at the highest levels of productivity and competitiveness can afford to pay for their employees’ inten- sive investment in firm- or industry-level skills without being concerned about wage levels. Therefore, at Stage III in Figure 1, both workers and employers in private manufacturing sectors will walk away from traditional solidaristic wage policy and form alliances based on industry- or firm-specific skill investment (Esteves-Abe et al. 2001; Hall and Soskice 2001). In addition, left-wing governments will feel constrained by new structural limits and thus be more likely to relinquish their long- held policy priority—equality—in favor of budget restraint. For incumbent governments, pushing down wages or allowing pay differen- tiation in the public sector is politically less costly than reducing generous social transfers. Lowering pay for the public sector applies only to a small segment of the population with whom governments can bargain directly (e.g., part-time female employees in public- service jobs), while existing social transfers (e.g., social insurance) benefit large segments of the population. Because voters will be dis- pleased with losing benefits (Brooks and Lee et al. 105 Manza 2007; Pierson 1996), politicians are more likely to cut and differentiate pay for public-sector workers than to reduce existing social welfare programs. During budget crises, left-wing governments will voluntarily cut back spending on wages for public-sector employees and ‘‘increase pay differentiation in the public sector to reduce budget deficits’’ (Swenson 1991:385).10 As the productivity gap widens and sectoral conflicts increase, manufacturing sectors begin industry- or firm-level wage bargaining with requests for high wage increases, and public sectors are forced to cut wages or differentiate their wage scales. In this way, the (negative) effect of public-service expansion on income inequality disappears in some advanced industrial economies. Fundamental struc- tural changes weaken traditional coordi- nated wage-bargaining institutions and fos- ter wage flexibility in the manufacturing and public sectors.11 To summarize, increasing productivity gaps transform the traditional fabric of left- wing governance via two mechanisms— decreasing total employment and weakening coordinated wage-bargaining institutions —and thereby change the proposed negative relationship between public-sector employ- ment and income inequality, at least to a lesser or non-negative relationship at the highest lev- els of the productivity gap.12 This leads to the main hypothesis of this study: Hypothesis 2: The size of the negative effect of public-service expansion on income inequality will diminish and eventually evaporate as the productivity gap between the private manufacturing and public- service sectors increases. DATA Dependent Variable Our dependent variable is the Gini coeffi- cient of post-tax, post-transfer (disposable) income inequality.13 Previous studies using OECD wage inequality data (e.g., Rueda and Pontusson 2000; Wallerstein 1999) can- not address an overall picture of income dis- tribution in a society because the data not only ‘‘fail to capture the distributive effects of unemployment, underemployment, and labor force exit’’ (Kenworthy and Pontusson 2005:452) or the effects of total employment increases, but they also fail to consider income from self-employment and other sources such as property (e.g., interest and dividends).14 In addition, wage inequality data do not take into account welfare states’ progressive taxation and social transfers, which are an important element of variations we will explain in this study. We ultimately concur with Kenworthy’s (2010:411) claim that ‘‘the distribution of disposable income among households is what researchers and policy makers should be most interested in understanding.’’ We draw the post-tax and post-transfer income inequality data from the World Income Inequality Database (WIID) version 2.0c built by World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University (UNU-WIDER 2008a). The UNU-WIDER WIID database version 2 repla- ces WIID1 by adding ‘‘the new data of Dein- inger &amp; Squire (2004), the unit record data of the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), the Transmonee data by UNICEF/ICDC, [and] Central Statistical Offices and research stud- ies’’ (UNU-WIDER 2008b:8). The database aims to maximize longitudinal and cross-sec- tional comparability by increasing the preci- sion of the definitions underlying the inequal- ity estimates and by updating the documentation of data sources. Reflecting the purpose of this study and the recommen- dations of UNU-WIDER, we define and select quality estimates of income inequality as fol- lows: (1) estimates scored 1 (the highest qual- ity) in the quality rating of WIID2; (2) esti- mates based only on disposable income or disposable monetary income; and (3) esti- mates with the income sharing unit being household or family.15 With respect to (1), 106 American Sociological Review 76(1) WIID2 rates the quality of a data-point highest when the underlying concepts are known and the quality of the income concept and survey can be judged (for more specific criteria, see UNU-WIDER [2008b:13–14]). Regarding (2), we include only disposable income, not only because it fully takes into consideration welfare state efforts (i.e., delivery of social services mainly through public-sector employ- ment as well as taxation and transfers), but also because it maximizes the sample size, as countries more frequently report income data on the basis of disposable income.16 Main Independent Variables Public-sector employment rate captures wel- fare states’ efforts as employers to achieve full employment and equality. This variable plays the role of igniter of sectoral conflicts, depending on the size of the productivity gap between sectors. We calculate it as the size of general government employment as a per- centage of the total population age 15 to 64 years.17 We draw general government employment data primarily from the OECD (2009a). The data include ‘‘those employed in all departments, establishments and other bodies of central, state and local govern- ments, which engage in such activities as administration, defense, health, educational and social services and the promotion of eco- nomic growth. . . . Included are social secu- rity schemes in respect of large sections of the community, imposed, controlled or financed by government non-profit institu- tions entirely or mainly financed and con- trolled by general government’’(OECD 1986:541). Although this measure does not include individuals employed in state-owned companies, it embraces all other employees in health, education, public administration, the legal system, and social welfare activi- ties. Over-time variations of this measure are predominantly driven by welfare- state-related sectors. We use Scharpf and Schmidt’s (2000) data on a supplementary basis for the country-years not reported in the OECD electronic database. Sectoral labor productivity difference measures structural imbalance between sec- tors within a national economy. We hypothe- size that the productivity gap between sectors will play the role of a conditional factor, by which public-service-sector expansion will have different effects on income inequality. We define this variable as the rate of labor productivity of the manufacturing sector and of the community, social, and personal- service sectors. We compute sectoral produc- tivity as the ratio of value added in a sector to the employment size in the sector.18 We assume these measures will largely capture the labor–productivity gap between the private manufacturing sector and the public-service sector, because ‘‘community, social and personal services (ISIC 75-99) include mainly non-market activities such as public administration, education, and health’’ (OECD 2006:36)19 and the welfare state is the key employer for the bulk of the labor force in these sectors. This measure ‘‘reflects the joint influence of changes in capital, as well as technical, organizational efficiency change within and between firms, the influ- ence of economies of scale, varying degrees of capacity utilization and measurement errors’’ (OECD 2001:15). Data on employ- ment and value added by sectors are from the OECD STAN database (2005b), which uses ‘‘a standard industry list (ISIC Rev. 3) for all countries to facilitate international comparisons.’’ Control Variables: Internal Development Model and Labor Market Structural Changes Based on Kuznets (1955) and Nielsen and Alderson (1995), we introduce three meas- ures to capture the effects of labor force com- position and shift on income inequality. The first two measures, agricultural labor force and sector dualism, represent a structural Lee et al. 107 shift from traditional to industrial society. We expect the former to be negatively asso- ciated with income inequality, because a greater share of agricultural employment typically leads to more equal income distri- bution (Nielsen 1994; Nielsen and Alderson 1995). We measure agricultural employment as the size of employment in agriculture as reported in the OECD (2005b). We calculate sector dualism by the formula jp–Lj, where p is the proportion of the labor force in agricul- ture and L is agriculture’s share of GDP. This measure captures differences in average income between sectors (Nielsen 1994). We draw all estimates of p and L from the OECD (2005b). We expect sector dualism to affect income inequality positively. We introduce the third measure, labor force in financial sector, to capture the effects of labor force composition on inequality in postindustrial, finance-dominant economies (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990; Li, Squire, and Zou 1998). We expect that the greater the size of the financial labor force, the higher income inequality will be. Controlling for this variable is essential because the recent upturn in income inequality is often attributed to the financial sector’s explosive growth and their ‘‘over-paid’’ CEOs and employees. We mea- sure financial labor force as the size of employment in the financial sector as a per- centage of total employment. Employment data are from the OECD (2005b). We expect the unemployment rate to increase income inequality. With rapid dein- dustrialization, high unemployment will be concentrated in low-skill jobs because employers are less likely to lay off more skilled workers. Therefore, high unemploy- ment will disproportionally affect the unskilled, low-paid working class and contrib- ute to higher income inequality. We measure the unemployment rate as the size of total unemployment as a percentage of the total labor force as reported in the OECD (2008). Female labor force participation rate may either reduce or increase income inequality. Some scholars contend that a higher female presence in the labor market captures the ris- ing share of female-led households, which will lead to higher inequality (especially in the United States) (Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997). Other researchers, however, note that higher rates of female participation serves as a proxy for women-friendly social and labor- market policies and therefore will be nega- tively associated with inequality (Rueda and Pontusson 2000). We calculate this measure as the size of the female labor force as a per- centage of the female population age 15 to 64 years. We draw data from Huber and col- leagues (2004) and the OECD (2005a).20 Control Variables: Internal Political and Institutional Factors We control for two political variables: left party share and Christian democratic party share in government cabinets, both of which prove to have negative effects on post-tax and post-transfer reduction in inequality (Bradley et al. 2003). We code these varia- bles as 1 when a single party forms the entire cabinet; when these parties have coalition partners in a cabinet, they are scored between 0 and 1 (a fraction of their share in the entire cabinet). We cumulate these scores from 1950 to the corresponding year of Gini index being used; data come from Swank (2009). We introduce a measure of welfare state effort, the welfare benefit generosity index (Scruggs 2004), which not only revises but updates Esping-Andersen’s (1990) decom- modification index. We also employ union density, measured as the size of net union members (i.e., total union members reported minus self-employed, retired, and unemployed members) as a ratio of the total dependent labor force, which includes employees and the total unemployed labor force. Data are from Golden and Wallerstein (2006) and Visser (2006). We expect all four variables to have negative effects on inequality (Bradley et al. 2003). Because they are highly correlated with each other (see the correlation coefficient 108 American Sociological Review 76(1) table in Part D of the online supplement) and with our main independent variable (i.e., pub- lic-sector employment), we introduce two political variables and two institutional varia- bles separately. Control Variables: Globalization We control for four measures of globaliza- tion: net migration rate, outward foreign direct investment, southern import penetra- tion, and capital market openness. We expect all of these variables to contribute to recent upward trends in inequality in advanced industrial countries. International migration should increase inequality by increasing the low-skill, low-wage labor force (Alderson and Nielsen 2002). We measure this by net migration rate, that is, the total number of immigrants minus the annual number of emi- grants, in the total population (per 1,000 peo- ple). We use population data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (Var- ious Years) to compute this variable. We also expect trade with developing countries, especially manufactured imports, to seriously lower domestic workers’ wages (Wood 1994). We measure southern import penetration as manufactured imports (in cur- rent U.S. dollars as a percentage of GDP) from countries other than the 23 advanced industrial countries. Import data are from OECD International Trade by Commodities Statistics (OECD 2009b).We define manufac- tured imports as Standard International Trade Classification (Revision 2) groups 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the statistics. Outward investment should affect inequal- ity positively because it decreases domestic demands for labor, especially in manufactur- ing industries. This contributes to deindustrial- ization, higher unemployment (Alderson and Nielsen 2002), and diminished union power. We calculate foreign direct investment as the size of direct investment abroad in a given year divided by the size of the total labor force (log base 10). Direct investment data are from the IMF’s Balance of Payments Yearbook (Various Years). Total labor force data come from Huber and colleagues (2004) and the OECD (2005a). We expect financial openness to worsen domestic distributional outcomes by increas- ing investment opportunities for high-income groups and limiting governments’ macroeco- nomic policy choices to fight for unemploy- ment (Huber and Stephens 2001; Mahler 2004). The variable is expressed as Chinn and Ito’s (2006, 2008) financial openness index, which measures a country’s degree of capital account openness. This index takes on higher values as a country is more open to cross-border capital transactions. METHODS The dataset is an unbalanced panel dataset that contains 239 observations for 16 advanced industrial countries over 33 years between 1971 and 2003. Under this panel structure, errors are likely to be correlated with each other within each unit. When these unmeasured time-invariant components are not systematically represented by appropriate methodological treatments, such as in ordi- nary least squares (OLS), they will transfer to the error term, causing heterogeneity bias and underestimated standard errors for regression coefficients (Greene 2000; Hsiao 1986; Stimson 1985). The most popular approaches employed for this data structure are the random effects model (REM) and the fixed effects model (FEM). The REM and the FEM differ from each other in many respects. The REM repre- sents the unmeasured time-invariant factors by systemizing the random error terms, ai (i = 1, 2,.,N; N = number of units), while the FEM achieves the same goal by systemiz- ing unit-specific intercepts with N – 1 indica- tor variables. The REM has an important advantage over the FEM: the REM can accommodate time-invariant and slowly time-varying institutional factors, while the Lee et al. 109 FEM cannot deal with such variables because of the perfect correlation between the time- invariant variables and the unit-specific indi- cator variables. Given that even a slowly time-varying covariate often loses its mean- ingful level of statistical significance in the FEM context, it may be highly problematic to employ the FEM for cross-national studies that aim to analyze historically time-invariant factors. In spite of this advantage, the REM does not have any safeguard in case the key assumption of the REM (i.e., the random effect error term, ai, is uncorrelated with the existing covariates) is violated. In such a case, the REM estimation will result in inconsistent parameter estimates (Greene 2000; Halaby 2004). The FEM, on the other hand, does not have the strict assumption, which allows regressors to be correlated with the country-specific indicator variables. As a result, in spite of its conservative (ineffi- cient) approach, the FEM tends to generate more consistent and unbiased estimates when researchers suspect there may be systematic correlations between existing covariates and unmeasured time-invariant components.21 Scholars typically find that income inequality data contain more variations between units than within units (Alderson and Nielsen 2002; Beckfield 2006). In this particular study, however, the proposed inter- action model hypothesizes that a public- sector-expansion strategy interacting with an emerging productivity gap between sectors will generate sectoral conflicts and struc- tural imbalance, leading to higher income inequality over time. Therefore, our sub- stantive logic is primarily dependent on within-unit variations. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each esti- mation strategy (including the potential vio- lation of the REM assumption), and more importantly, the implications of our theoret- ical framework relying on over-time varia- tions, we report the results from the FEM in the text and the results from the REM in the online supplement. RESULTS Descriptive Statistics Figure 2-1 shows income inequality trends (Gini based on household disposable income) in Nordic countries. The figure illustrates strikingly similar over-time trajectories of inequality: income inequality declined during the 1970s and 1980s in Denmark, Finland, and Norway (Sweden is the exception). After some stagnant years during the 1980s, how- ever, income inequality began to increase from the early 1990s onward in all four coun- tries. Public-sector employment steadily increased in all Nordic countries during the 1970s and 1980s; it then maintained consider- ably high levels compared with other coun- tries since the 1990s, with the exception of Finland (see Table 1). Although Sweden suf- fered a slight decline in the 1990s, it still maintains the largest public-sector among advanced industrial democracies. Productivity gaps between sectors are pronounced in Swe- den (1.89) and Finland (1.81), where produc- tivity in the manufacturing sector is roughly twice as high as that in the public-service sector. However, relatively low levels and growth rates of the productivity gap between sectors in Denmark suggest there might be less serious sectoral conflicts. Therefore, high levels of public-sector employment are not likely to contribute to serious declines in total employment or wage-setting institutions. The descriptive statistics in Nordic countries sug- gest there could be a high level of interactive effects between public-sector employment and productivity growth on income inequality. Income inequality trends in liberal coun- tries diverge (see Figure 2-2). New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States suffered substantial increases in inequality. In Canada, income inequality slightly decreased in the 1980s but has increased since the 1990s, although at a slow rate. In Australia in the 1990s, distributional outcomes improved slightly compared with the 1970s. With the exception of the United Kingdom, 110 American Sociological Review 76(1) which curtailed public-sector employment significantly in the 1980s through privatiza- tion, other liberal countries maintained rela- tively small (New Zealand \ 10) to moderate (United States, Canada, and Australia . 10) public sectors. The productivity gap increased most dramatically in Canada and Ireland, but other countries also experienced increased productivity gaps between sectors. Income inequality trajectories in continen- tal European countries are more diverse than those in Nordic countries. Figure 2-3 shows that Belgium and the Netherlands experienced slight increases, while inequality remained sta- ble (Italy) or decreased considerably (Austria) or slightly (France and Germany) in other countries. The size of the public sector in these countries went through neither substantial gains nor significant losses, but most countries experienced substantial increases in the productivity gap (overall, though, the produc- tivity gap in these countries remained narrow). In general, descriptive statistics for liberal and continental European countries suggest that in some of these countries (e.g., Belgium, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada), medium-sized public-sector employ- ment may have interacted with medium to high levels of the productivity gap. In these countries, although wage-bargaining institu- tions either functioned effectively (mainly at the industry level in continental Europe) or did not play a critical role in wage restraint (liberal countries), the descriptive trends sug- gest that structural imbalances and sectoral cleavages may have evolved and contributed to increased income inequality (mainly through employment and budget crises). Overall, descriptive results suggest that the proposed public sector–productivity gap 20 25 30 35 G in i C o ef fi ci en t 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 year Denmark Finland Norway Sweden 25 30 35 40 G in i C o ef fi ci en t 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 year Australia Canada Ireland New Zealand UK US 20 25 30 35 G in i C o ef fi ci en t 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 year Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Netherlands 2-1 Nordic Countries 2-2 Liberal Countries 2-3 Continental European Countries Figure 2. Over-Time Inequality Trajectories Lee et al. 111 interaction effect on distributional outcomes is most salient in some Nordic countries (i.e., Finland and Sweden), but it is also observ- able in some liberal countries (and Bel- gium). Next, our multivariate regression analyses test whether the proposed interac- tion effect contributes to the ineffectiveness of public-sector-expansion strategies in advanced industrial democracies. Multivariate Analyses In Model 1 of Table 2, we introduce public-sector employment in the presence of the simplest set of control variables: two period indicator variables and five indicator variables describing different income defini- tions. Model 1 shows that, as expected, public-sector employment has a strong nega- tive effect on income inequality. This sug- gests that a public-service-expansion strategy is generally effective in reducing income inequality. The period indicators are positive and highly significant, suggesting that inequality increased continuously over time during the past two decades, compared to the 1970s (i.e., 1971 to 1982). Models 2 to 4 tell a different story. We sep- arately tested the effect of public-sector employment on inequality by splitting the original sample into two groups, one covering 1971 to 1992 (N = 120) and the other 1993 to 2003 (N = 119). In Model 2, public-sector employment still has a very strong negative effect on inequality, but the effect becomes statistically nonsignificant in Model 3 when more recent data are tested.

Model 4 re-merges the split samples and introduces two interaction terms between pub- lic-sector employment and two period indica- tors, which turn out to be positive and signif- icant. The results suggest that the strong negative effects of public-sector employment on income inequality are significantly moder- ated for both the 1983 to 1992 and 1993 to 2003 periods; the larger size of the coefficient for the second interaction term (.262) relative to the first one (.151) suggests that the positive effects of the interaction term become stron- ger over time. Overall, results in Table 2 sup- port the baseline predictions of Hypotheses 1 and 2. Models 1 and 2 demonstrate that public-sector expansion was an effective pol- icy tool that achieved full employment and equality. Models 3 and 4, however, suggest that some fundamental structural changes encroached on the traditional basis of left- wing politics in advanced industrial democra- cies throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s, these changes dismantled the mechanism by which left-wing governments intervened in economies to achieve full employment and more equal income distribution. To investigate why the public-service- expansion strategy lost its effectiveness over time, Model 6 introduces an interaction vari- able between public-sector employment and the productivity gap. The interaction term tests Hypothesis 2, that is, sectoral conflicts Table 2.

Lee et al. 113 originating from growth in the productivity gap will change the proposed negative causal link between public-service expansion and income inequality into a lesser or non- negative one. Results in Model 6 lend credence to our theoretical prediction: the two main terms and the interaction term are highly significant and the signs of relevant variables are all con- sistent with our expectations. The highly sig- nificant, positive effect of the interaction term suggests that a public-service-expansion strategy is effective only when productivity gaps between the private-manufacturing and the public-service sectors are small. At this stage, coordinated wage bargaining flattens wage gaps between and within sectors, while formerly marginalized populations gain access to market income thanks to the high level of total employment sustained by pub- lic-sector expansion. However, when the pro- ductivity gap widens, public-service expan- sion leads to sectoral conflicts and to poorer employment performance. In turn, this even- tually leads to higher income inequality due to wage dispersion within sectors and employ- ment/budget crises.22 Figure 3-1 illustrates how the slopes of the government employment variable differ depending on the level of the productivity gap. When the rate measure of sectoral pro- ductivity difference is fixed at ‘‘K’’ for Model 6, the coefficient of public-sector employment is determined by (–1.55 1 .56 3 K). As the productivity gap changes from a low (–2 stan- dard deviations below the mean) to a high level (12 standard deviations above the mean), the public-sector employment coeffi- cient approaches from –1.55 to nearly zero (when K = 2.77). This suggests that, at the highest level of productivity gap between sec- tors, the negative effects of public-sector expansion on inequality completely evaporate (as shown in the second panel of 3-1).23 Figure 3-2 presents the marginal effect (Brambor, Clark, and Golder 2006) of pub- lic-sector employment on income inequality as productivity difference changes. The graph shows that the size of the marginal effect decreases continuously as productivity differ- ence increases. Ninety-five percent confi- dence intervals around the solid line suggest that the marginal effects of public-sector employment on income inequality are statisti- cally significant when the productivity differ- ence changes from 0 to 2.3 (without controls) or 1.8 (with controls). Within the range, the upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals remain below the zero line. The negative marginal effect disappears, how- ever, when the productivity difference changes between 2 and 3 for both graphs in Figure 3-2. Overall, the results support our key argu- ment that a fundamental structural change ren- dered the conventional left-wing strategy of public-sector expansion ineffective. Our find- ings show that in countries with high levels of sectoral productivity differences, public-sector expansion does not effectively reduce income inequality. The variables introduced in Models 7 to 11 in Table 3 test whether the proposed public sector–productivity gap model is robust in the presence of other domestic structural, institutional, political, and international fac- tors. Model 7 controls for five factors related to internal development and structural changes: labor force in agricultural sector, sector dualism, labor force in financial sector, unemployment rate, and female labor force participation rate. The results show that the main model is robust in the presence of these five variables. The next two models test whether the pro- posed interaction model survives after control- ling for political and institutional factors. Model 8 introduces two political partisan cab- inet effects—cumulative left party and Chris- tian Democratic party cabinet shares—that research has found to play critical roles in reducing income inequality in advanced industrial democracies (Bradley et al. 2003). The results show that the main model is not affected by the inclusion of these var- iables; both variables are (incorrectly) 114 American Sociological Review 76(1) positive-signed (presumably due to high multi-collinearity). We believe that the main term of public-sector employment (which also captures the effects of wage-set- ting level on income inequality) captures the egalitarian role of left-party incumbency or cabinet participation. Model 9 includes union density and the welfare benefit gener- osity index. The welfare generosity (decom- modification index) score captures the effects of more generous social benefits and entitlements on income inequality trends. As expected, welfare generosity has a strong negative effect on income inequal- ity, but the coefficients of our main interaction model are largely consistent and robust. This suggests that our public sector–productivity interaction model repre- sents independent causal effects on inequal- ity that cannot be captured by conventional welfare states’ redistributive effects. Insig- nificant effects of union density are largely attributable to its multi-collinearity with other variables (i.e., government employ- ment, the welfare generosity index, and female labor force participation).

Of these four global- ization variables, only financial openness is positive and significant. All three terms of the proposed public sector–productivity gap interaction model are still significant and robust in the presence of the four globalization factors. Model 11 drops cumulative left-party incumbency and union density (again due to multi-collinearity concerns), which were sta- tistically non-significant in previous models, but includes all other control variables. The results show that our main model remains intact in the presence of currently known pop- ular predictors of income inequality. CONCLUSIONS This study investigates the political- structural mechanism of increasing income inequality trends in advanced industrial democracies. By focusing on deep structural changes in an economy and their interaction with traditional class politics, we substantiate our claim that an increasing inter-sectoral productivity difference alters the negative relationship between public-sector expansion and income inequality. We proposed two important intervening the- oretical links between the public-sector expan- sion–sectoral productivity gap interaction model and income inequality: total employ- ment performance and the role of coordinated wage bargaining. First, we suggested that the role of public-service expansion in decreasing income inequality by providing job opportuni- ties for the economically and socially marginal- ized has been significantly diminished by an increasing inter-sectoral productivity gap and structural imbalance between sectors. Second, we argued that when increasing productivity differences arise between private- manufacturing and public-service sectors, a public-sector-expansion strategy could dis- rupt an important institutional mechanism of wage restraint—coordinated wage bargaining —that had undergirded the dominance of corpo- ratist politics after the postwar period (Cameron 1984; Garrett 1998; Hicks and Kenworthy 1998; Western 1997). Once the coordinated wage-setting institutions are weakened, wage flexibility in highly competitive sectors severely worsens distributional outcomes. We conclude that a decline in employment potential and wage coordination leads to increased income inequality. Our findings demonstrate that our public sector–sectoral productivity gap interac- tion model accounts for the variations in within-country income inequality over the past three decades. Overall, we revisited the conventional wis- dom stating that public-sector employment will decrease income inequality. This idea has been taken for granted as a formal, macro-economic formula for equality projects in many countries. We found that the effect of equality projects based on public-service expansion is conditional on a structural factor: the inter-sectoral productivity gap. In a sense, our findings are consonant with Block’s (1977) classic dictum that (welfare) state man- agers’ opportunities and capacity to rational- ize the economy and integrate (working-class) electorates through employment and redistri- bution will be structurally constrained and adjusted by the confidence of business com- munities. It is not a coincidence that public- sector reform projects become central policy agendas for both left- and right-wing parties in many advanced industrial countries (Garrett and Way 2000; Pontusson, Rueda, and Way 2002). Whereas the United States under Rea- gan and Britain under Thatcher provide clas- sic stories of the privatization of public firms, Britain’s Labour Party under Blair and Ger- many’s Christian Democratic Party add new examples of reform projects that aim to intro- duce greater competition and liberalization of public-service sectors. We are skeptical, how- ever, whether these right-wing and center-left governments’ renewed drive for privatization and liberalization of formerly state-owned firms and monopolies will ameliorate the Lee et al. 117 sectoral conflicts originating from the inter- sectoral productivity gap. As Iversen (2005) notes, reforms targeting telecommunications and postal services are not likely to affect social and community services—which con- stitute the majority of the public sector and are therefore responsible for the bulk of employment—and thus an inter-sectoral pro- ductivity gap (and sectoral conflicts) will per- sist and even increase in postindustrial economies. Our findings are not limited to the impres- sive strength of the public sector–productivity gap interaction model. The strong negative effect of welfare benefit generosity on inequality reconfirms the role of generous welfare regimes in fighting for equality through progressive taxation and generous social transfers (Alderson and Nielsen 2002; Bradley et al. 2003). This has been the single most important determinant for reducing inequality across advanced industrial democ- racies, even since the 1980s, when the pub- lic-sector employment strategy began to show its adverse effects in some liberal and social-democratic countries. Welfare states’ role in protecting citizens vulnerable to rapid technological innovations and intensified global competition through generous transfers and entitlements should not be discounted. If the public-sector-expansion strategy becomes increasingly ineffective in achieving egalitar- ian agendas, leftist and reformist governments may resort to more generous social spending in areas such as non-insurance assistance pro- grams (Pontusson et al. 2002) or job training programs (Boix 1998; Garrett 1998; Huber and Stephens 2001). Furthermore, these findings do not suggest the complete failure of the traditional equality project focusing on job creation in the public sector. The public-service-expansion strategy, although it recently resulted in worse macro- economic performance and distributional out- comes in some countries, has achieved its promise for gender equality (Huber and Ste- phens 2000), income equality, and full employment at a large scale for several decades. Despite the limitations of this strat- egy, for some liberal and continental Euro- pean countries in which public-sector employ- ment has not reached its limit, an increasing supply of human capital formation (Boix 1998) in such areas as childcare and preschool services, formal education, job training, and employment services through public employ- ment should remain a vital policy alternative for achieving ‘‘a high-employment and high- equality society’’ (Kenworthy 2008:279). As long as public-sector expansion has not ‘‘coincided with (too rapidly) increasing expo- sure to the global economy’’ (Garrett and Way 2000:289), it will remain one of the most attractive policy choices for reformist parties. In the same vein, when reformist gov- ernments are faced with incentives to buffer populations vulnerable to increasing global- ization (Rodrik 1997), policymakers should be aware that pursuing a public-service- expansion strategy could generate unintended consequences—that is, encroachment on their institutional bases. This study suggests that policymakers, under increasing structural con- straints, need to consider not only the positive effects of public-service expansion, such as expanding the electoral base to new sectors of the population, but also its negative effects, such as alienating traditional bases of support.

For example, in Sweden until the mid-1960s, Tjän- stemännens Centralorganisation-Swedish Confeder- ation of Professional Employees (TCO) and Sverigers Akademikes Centraloganisation-Swedish Confederation of Professional Association (SACO) accepted the rate of wage increase determined by bargaining between Landsorganisationen-Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) and Svenska arbetsgivareföreningen-Swedish Employer Associa- tion (SAF) as the reference point for their own rate of wage increase (Gourevitch et al. 1984). 118 American Sociological Review 76(1) 2. For similar points, see Hardiman (2002) for Ireland; Blais and colleagues (1990) for the United States; Langford (1996) for Canada; and Edgell and Duke (1986) for Britain. These authors note that cleav- ages in liberal countries between the public and pri- vate sectors grew on the basis of different employer–employee relationships, union strengths, political significance/influences, and attitudes toward taxation. 3. A reviewer pointed out that ‘‘an enormous increase in the scope of information technology’’ may bring about productivity growth in ‘‘record-keeping and routine administration,’’ which leads to questions about whether productivity growth in the public sector actually has been slow for the past few dec- ades. Our investigation of this matter shows that productivity in the public-service sector steadily increased along with the manufacturing sector until the 1970s, but its upward trend flattened out since the mid-1980s; the manufacturing sector maintained a stunningly steady growth pattern. The productiv- ity gap between the manufacturing and public sec- tors has greatly widened since the 1980s, especially in countries with highly competitive private manufacturing industries (for average and country- specific trends of sectoral productivity, see Part A in the online supplement [http://asr.sagepub.com/ supplemental]). 4. For instance, in 1983, Swedish Metal Workers (Metall) decided to make separate agreements with their employers outside the conventional LO- SAF bargaining (Iversen 1996). 5. In countries such as Canada and the United States (primarily in the 1980s), where wage bargaining institutions were not formalized, sectoral conflicts between the private and public sectors may have contributed to more frequent changes in the ruling party—from liberal to conservative—which, in turn, led to radical reductions in the welfare state and public-sector size in the interest of business and exacerbated distributional outcomes (Olsen 2002). Because this political process model (as an intervening mechanism) through partisan politics is not universally observable beyond liberal coun- tries (i.e., in continental European and Nordic coun- tries, right-wing parties did not necessarily reduce welfare states, and left-wing parties did not neces- sarily protect welfare states, during times of eco- nomic crisis), we do not pursue this causal path as our main explanatory model. 6. The unemployed involved in this structural mis- match are predominantly male workers who are not likely to take jobs in women-dominant public services. This gender-based division may have con- tributed to the increasing sectoral conflicts between the private and public sectors. 7. Many neoclassical economists contend that higher income and corporate taxes to expand the public sector results in less profits and investment and more redundant workers in private sectors (Fried- man 1979). In turn, this leads to bigger burdens for the public sector because redundant workers must be absorbed by the public sector or supported by welfare state transfers. These scholars argue that this inefficiency eventually leads to a combination of government budget crises, higher unemployment, and lower economic growth. 8. A reviewer pointed out that as relative prices in the fast-growth sector fall, consumers will buy more products from the fast-growth sector and fewer products from the slow-growth sector. The lack of demand for services and goods from the public sec- tor will eventually put governments under pressure to cut services or keep wages down. This mecha- nism of relative price–demand change may also contribute to governmental budget crises. 9. Under coordinated wage bargaining, firms in inter- nationally competitive manufacturing industries suffer a shortage of skilled labor and a serious decline in workers’ morale and commitment. For instance, Volvo and other leading firms with high productivity had severe absenteeism from the late 1970s (Pontusson 1992). The decline in high-skilled workers’ morale led employers in the high-tech, export-led industries to bring coordinated wage bar- gaining to an end (Ahlén 1989; Alexopoulos and Cohen 2004). 10. In this way, welfare states maintain all three policy goals—generous transfers, full employment, and budget restraint—but sacrifice the equality princi- ple, the most essential policy goal for left-wing gov- ernments (Iversen and Wren 1998). 11. Not all rich democracies follow this coordinated wage-bargaining route. Increases in income inequality in some rich democracies (e.g., liberal countries) are more attributable to the other causal route, the decline (or limit) in total employment capacity due to structural imbalance and govern- ment budget crises. 12. Tables S-B1 and S-B2 in the online supplement test the roles of two intervening theoretical links: coor- dinated wage bargaining and total employment capacity. Table S-B1 shows the significant moderat- ing effects of an increasing productivity gap on the linkage between public-sector employment and the level of wage bargaining and the linkage between public-sector employment and total employment capacity. Table S-B2 shows that both wage bargain- ing and total employment capacity have substantial negative effects on income inequality. 13. Our theoretical framework highlighting sectoral conflicts and ensuing wage flexibility within private Lee et al. 119 sectors requires a measure that is more sensitive to change near the middle of the income distribution than at the tails. Therefore, we use the Gini rather than other common measures of income inequality such as the decile9/decile1 ratio. 14. The former aspect is critically important because one important causal link between public-sector employment and income inequality is the activation of a formerly nonactive labor force, which is not likely to be captured in wage inequality data. In addition, the exclusion of non-wage-earner asset holders at the highest level of the income bracket is another crucial drawback of wage inequality data, given that the recent upward income inequal- ity trends in advanced industrial countries are attrib- utable to this group’s increasing share of wealth and income. 15. Out of a maximum 1,387 unbalanced observations for the 18 OECD countries, we selected 262 quality observations from 1970 to 2003 using a set of crite- ria for maximum coverage and consistency. After an additional reduction of the sample due to 23 cases missing values in the key independent varia- bles, our analyses include an unbalanced total of 239 observations on 16 OECD countries from 1971 to 2003 (see Part C in the online supplement for descriptive statistics of income inequality before and after the list-wise deletion). 16. We introduce several indicator variables for differ- ent income sharing units to provide a conservative safeguard against potential bias resulting from the unmeasured unit effects of different income sources and from measurement errors. (Some of these indi- cator variables are automatically dropped from regression analyses using Stata 10, due to high multi-collinearity.) Introducing indicator variables is a conservative strategy because they absorb the effects of the main independent variables of which causal mechanisms are correlated with the different definitions of income sources. To resolve remaining skepticism about the quality of WIDER data regard- ing its mixture of different sources of inequality data (Atkinson 2004; Atkinson and Brandolini 2001; Cameron 2010), we test our models on the subsample composed solely of cases with the same income definitions in terms of income sharing units and equivalence scale used (see Table S-B3 in the online supplement). The results show that our main model remains highly significant even with this smaller subsample (N = 181). 17. Because another conventional denominator—total labor force (or total employees)—is heavily influ- enced by female labor force participation (which tends to increase the numerator and denominator together), recent studies use working-age popula- tion as the denominator of total, sectoral, or govern- ment employment measures (see Huber and Stephens 2001; Iversen 2005; Scharpf and Schmidt 2000). With this denominator, public-sector size in continental European countries, in which women’s labor force participation is traditionally discouraged by culture and institutions, will be smaller than if we used total labor force or employees as the denominator. 18. Although employment size in the sector is not the most ideal measure of labor input, data with further adjustments made for part-time work and hours worked per worker are not available for all coun- tries and years (OECD 2006). Therefore, we use another OECD-recommended measure of industry- level labor productivity, value added per person employed in a sector (OECD 2001, 2006). 19. According to International Standard Industrial Clas- sification (ISIC Rev. 3), this sector includes public administration and defense; compulsory social security; primary, secondary, higher, or other edu- cation; health or social work activities; other com- munity, social, and personal service activities such as sewage and sanitation; membership organiza- tions; activities of private households with employed persons; and extraterritorial organizations and bodies. Not all of these activities (e.g., private households with employed persons) are necessarily considered the public sector, but we assume these personal household-related activities, if underesti- mated, represent a miniscule fraction of the entire amount of value added in the sector (e.g., .6 percent in the United States in 2000 or not even measured at all in many other countries, being recorded as 0). 20. We tested other variables as controls: natural popu- lation increase, secondary school enrollment, income per capita (and its squared term), govern- ment expenditures, government consumption, total government social expenditures, social security transfers (instead of welfare generosity), and the size of the elderly population (over 65 years). These are mostly statistically nonsignificant, and our main theoretical model is not affected by including these additional controls. 21. We conducted a Hausman test to see if REM and FEM produce any systematic differences in their estimates of coefficients. Our test for the full model (Model 11) rejects the null hypothesis that there is no systematic difference (Chi-square [dif = 15] = 105.63 and Prob [.Chi-square] = .000), which sug- gests that FEM should be preferred. However, as results in the text and Table S-B4 in the online sup- plement show, there are few substantial differences in the effects of the main theoretical model across the two estimation strategies. 22. Because all three terms are significant, some might think it would be possible to interpret public-sector employment as a conditional factor and treat the productivity gap–income inequality relationship as 120 American Sociological Review 76(1) the main causal link, but we do not develop such an interpretation. The productivity gap, when intro- duced alone in Model 5, is statistically nonsignifi- cant. Therefore, the negative (significant) coeffi- cients of the variable in the subsequent models should not be interpreted independently. They are significant only as a conditional factor that converts the effects of public-sector employment on income inequality from negative to less or non-negative; they merely contribute to the decreased size of the constant. 23. None of these minimum or maximum values are identified as influential outliers in our regression diagnostics based on Cook’s D, DFITS, Welsch’s W, or DFBETA (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 1980) (see Part E in the online supplement), which means the regression model fits these cases reasonably.
