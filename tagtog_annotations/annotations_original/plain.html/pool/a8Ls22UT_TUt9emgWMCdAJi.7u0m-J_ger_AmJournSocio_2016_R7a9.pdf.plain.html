          <p id="s1p1">A Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction1 Mads Meier Jæger University of Copenhagen Richard Breen Yale University The authors draw on Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduc- tion to develop a formal model of the pathways through which cul- tural capital acts to enhance children’s educational and socioeconomic success. The authors’ approach brings conceptual and empirical clarity to an important area of study. Their model describes how parents trans- mit cultural capital to their children and how children convert cultural capital into educational success. It also provides a behavioral framework for interpreting parental investments in cultural capital. The authors review results from existing empirical research on the role of cultural capital in education to demonstrate the usefulness of their model for in- terpretative purposes, and they use National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979—Children and Young Adults survey data to test some of its implications. INTRODUCTION Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of cultural capital and cultural reproduction is one of the most influential explanations in social stratification research of why inequalities in educational and socioeconomic outcomes persist over gen- erations. The theory outlines a complex system in which parents transmit cul- tural capital to children, children exploit their acquired cultural capital in the AJS Volume 121 Number 4 (January 2016): 1079–1115 1079 1Earlier versions of this article were presented at the RC28 Meeting at the University of Virginia, August 2012, and at research seminars at the University of Oxford, the Univer- sity of Turku, and the University of Copenhagen.

Despite the enormous popularity of the theory of cultural reproduction, we know surprisingly little about how cultural capital gets transferred from parents to children and whether it facilitates educational and socioeconomic success. The reasons for these limitations are twofold: a lack of clarity in Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction and, partly as a consequence of this, a large body of empirical research that provides inconclusive results. There is agreement among interpreters of Bourdieu that core concepts and mechanisms are ill defined in his writings on cultural reproduction ðLamont and Lareau 1988; Kingston 2001; van de Werfhorst 2010Þ. For example, Bourdieu provides no consistent explanation of what cultural capital is, how parents transmit it to children, and how it leads to educational success. The lack of theoretical clarity has had a detrimental impact on empirical re- search, which is characterized by highly diverse approaches to measuring cultural capital, piecemeal tests of the theory of cultural reproduction, and little attention to identifying the causal pathways through which cultural capital might lead to educational success ðKingston 2001; Sullivan 2002; Lareau andWeininger 2004; Goldthorpe 2007; Jæger 2011; Xu andHampden- Thompson 2012Þ. This article begins from the observation that the combination of a lack of clarity in the theory, together with limitations in empirical research that has sought to test it, warrants a new approach to analyzing cultural reproduction. We argue that if the theory of cultural reproduction is to remain a relevant explanation of intergenerational inequalities in educational and socioeco- nomic outcomes, it needs to provide a clear theoretical account of core con- cepts and mechanisms that can be tested empirically. Debates on the exact meaning of Bourdieu’s writings on cultural reproduction have been ongoing for decades ðDiMaggio 1982; Lamont and Lareau 1988; Mohr and DiMaggio 1995; Swartz 1997; Kingston 2001; van de Werfhorst 2010Þ with no sign of consensus, suggesting that effort might better be spent rethinking the core ideas of cultural reproduction rather than attempting to clarify Bourdieu’s original thoughts. In this article we present a formal model, expressed verbally, mathemat- ically, and diagrammatically, describing the process of cultural reproduction. Compared to previous research, the main benefit of our model is that it ex- search leading to the results presented in this article has received funding from the Euro- pean Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme ð½FP/2007-2013/ERC grant 312906Þ.

E-mail: mmj@soc.ku.dk American Journal of Sociology 1080 plicates and formalizes the different mechanisms through which cultural cap- ital leads to educational and socioeconomic success. In doing so, it presents an encompassing model of cultural reproduction that has been absent from the literature, that helps to organize and interpret results from existing re- search, and that may act as a starting point for future research that seeks to test cultural reproduction theory. Borrowing terminology from econom- ics, the model we present is structural: it attempts to describe all the relevant relationships and presents the behavioral assumptions needed to interpret its parameters. In our model, parents possess a stock of cultural capital that they transmit to children through active investments and through children’s exposure to cultural capital in the home. Children convert their acquired cultural capital into educational performance within the educational system, which leads to higher educational attainment and later socioeconomic suc- cess, thereby completing the process of social reproduction. In addition to presenting a formal model of cultural reproduction, our structural model provides a behavioral framework for interpreting the pa- rameters in this model. We do this to address Bourdieu’s lack of clarity about what motivates parents’ behavior. How do parents decide on how much of their cultural capital to invest in a child? How strong are parents’ beliefs that cultural capital will yield a return in the future? In order to provide answers to these questions, we build on the assumption that parents invest in chil- dren’s cultural capital in the hope that these investments will promote chil- dren’s educational and socioeconomic success. It is not clear from Bourdieu whether parents make cost-benefit calculations when attempting to trans- mit cultural capital to children or whether this process happens more or less unconsciously. We take the position that the best point of departure for ana- lyzing cultural reproduction is to assume that parents have beliefs and goals, and, given their limitations on time, money, and information, they act to achieve these goals. We are explicit about behavioral assumptions because these are crucial for interpreting not only our model but also the results of previous empirical research. Most research documents positive correlations between empirical indicators of cultural capital, such as how often parents take children to cultural events and children’s educational success. However, assumptions about what drives parental behavior are needed to interpret these correlations, and the lack of a clear behavioral framework in Bourdieu means that there is little agreement on how to do this ðe.g., Do these corre- lations arise from deliberate investments or from parents’ unconsciously re- peating behavior learned through socialization?Þ. Our structural model pro- vides a framework for analyzing how differences in resources and beliefs ðe.g., differences by race and socioeconomic group, which we discuss in detailÞ lead to different investments in cultural capital and to differences in educational outcomes. Thus, our model not only helps to organize results from previous research but also provides a framework for interpreting them. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1081 As a final contribution, our model also addresses two black boxes in the theory of cultural reproduction. Although Bourdieu argued that parents trans- mit cultural capital to children throughout childhood, he does not explain how the transmission takes place. Similarly, the way in which children con- vert cultural capital into educational achievements is underspecified.We pro- vide a dynamic account of both mechanisms. We draw on recent dynamic models of intergenerational transmissions ðTodd and Wolpin 2007; Cunha and Heckman 2008; Bisin and Verdier 2011Þ and treat childhood as a se- quence of time periods during which parents invest in transmitting cultural capital to children. In our model, parents may change their investments over time.Thismay be because of limitations on resources ðdue to events such as un- employment or illnessÞ, outcomes of past investments in cultural capital ðwhich may or may not have yielded a returnÞ, or investments in other child skills ðe.g., cognitive or social skillsÞ. We also provide a dynamic account of how children convert cultural capital into educational performance. In each time period the child converts his or her cultural capital into educational perfor- mance by affecting teachers’ perceptions of his or her academic ability, which leads to greater teacher inputs ðe.g., of attention and helpÞ and better perfor- mance. Thus, in addition to describing the outcome of cultural reproduction, we provide an account of the process of cultural reproduction. To demonstrate the usefulness of our model, we provide illustrative em- pirical evidence on the dynamic nature of cultural capital investments. We use longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979— Children and Young Adults ðNLSY-CYAÞ and estimate dynamic panel data models describing, first, how parents invest over time in transmitting their cultural capital to children and, second, how cultural capital affects educational performance. Our findings suggest that children accumulate cultural capital from parents and, furthermore, that cultural capital has a positive effect on educational performance. And althoughwe lack direct data on teacher inputs in children, the empirical results are consistent with our model. We also find that parents adjust their investments in cultural capital on the basis of what they believe to be the educational payoffs of past investments; a finding that is also consistent with our model. In summary, while we seek to provide a new conceptual framework for analyzing cultural reproduction, we do not claim to have captured every aspect of Bourdieu’s thoughts: our model builds on our interpretation of the theory of cultural reproduction. However, the model we propose is flexible, in the sense that it can be extended to cover more complex situations, key parameters can be modified in light of new theoretical or empirical insights, and the behavioral assumptions underlying our interpretation of mecha- nisms and parameters are open to modification. We hope, therefore, that it will stimulate research on the potentially complex ways in which cultural capital may facilitate educational and socioeconomic success. Furthermore, American Journal of Sociology 1082 because our model is expressed in mathematical terms, it is highly transpar- ent, so its empirical implications can readily be derived and tested. In the next section of the article we review the basic elements of Bourdieu’s theory. Then follows the development of our theory, first in static then in dy- namic form. Next we provide a review and reinterpretation of results from previous research to illustrate the usefulness of our approach, followed by empirical analyses that involve direct testing of the dynamic aspects of our model using the NLSY-CYA data. In the article’s conclusion we summarize our arguments and results and consider some of the ways in which our model could be extended. CULTURAL REPRODUCTION THEORY The theory of cultural reproduction provides an explanation of the inter- generational reproduction of socioeconomic position. Bourdieu argued that individuals and families possess resources in the form of different types of capital—economic, social, and cultural—that can be invested to generate more resources or converted from one type of capital into another ðBourdieu 1977a, 1986; Bourdieu and Passeron 1990Þ. Economic capital refers to all forms of economic resources ðincome, wealth, property, etc.Þ, while social capital re- fers to gainful social networks ðBourdieu 1986Þ. Although Bourdieu’s definition of cultural capital is far from clear ðLamont and Lareau 1988; Kingston 2001; van de Werfhorst 2010Þ, at the most gen- eral level it refers to familiarity with the dominant culture in a society. Lamont and Lareau ð1988, p. 156Þ proposed an influential definition of cultural capital as “widely shared, high-status cultural signals ðattitudes, preferences, formal knowledge, behaviors, goods and credentialsÞ used for social and cultural ex- clusion.”We follow this definition in the current article. As with economic and social capital, cultural capital is a resource that can be invested in order to promote one’s relative position within a social hierarchy populated by in- dividuals with different compositions and amounts of capital. Cultural capi- tal exists in three states—embodied ðlinguistic competence, mannerisms, cul- tural knowledge, etc.Þ, objectified ðcultural goods, paintings, books, etc.Þ, and institutionalized ðeducational credentials; Bourdieu 1977a, 1986; Bourdieu and Passeron 1990Þ—and it can contribute to social reproduction in all three states. According to Bourdieu, cultural reproduction is an important mecha- nism through which social reproduction takes place. Society is composed of different fields, that is, subsystems in which the different types of capital carry different weight ðBourdieu 1986Þ. Education is a major subfield, and one in which cultural capital is particularly important. Bourdieu argues that the educational system is biased toward valorizing cultural capital, ascribing positive qualities to individuals and families that possess it. This bias arises Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1083 from cultural capital being associated with high culture and social status, and it means that the embodied cultural capital that students put “on display” in school conveys an impression of academic brilliance that leads to favorable treatment by teachers and to educational success. Thus, cultural capital creates a false impression of academic brilliance that yields a real return in the form of educational success. Since families in advantaged socioeconomic positions tend to possess more cultural capital than those in less advantaged positions, and because children tend to inherit capital from parents, cultural capital con- tributes to social reproduction by increasing the likelihood of educational suc- cess ðinstitutionalized cultural capitalÞ and subsequent socioeconomic success ðbecause socioeconomic position in adulthood is heavily dependent on edu- cational credentialsÞ. Intergenerational Transmission of Cultural Capital We begin the presentation of our formal model with a simple version de- scribing the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital. We let C de- note the child’s cultural capital and subscripts c and P, respectively, the child and parents. For now we assume that there is only one child in the family. Cultural reproduction theory argues that parents possess a stock of cultural capital and furthermore that they transmit some of this to their child. Trans- mission of cultural capital takes place through two channels: parents actively investing in transmitting their cultural capital to their child ðe.g., by taking the child to the theater and by reading to the childÞ and the child passively acquir- ing cultural capital via exposure to objectified cultural capital in the home ðe.g., works of artÞ. The child’s acquisition of cultural capital also depends on family resources other than cultural capital ðe.g., parents’ socioeconomic re- sourcesÞ and on the child’s academic ability. We let S denote parents’ total stock of cultural capital and v the amount that they actively invest in the child. We thenwrite Cc 5 b1vp 1 b2Sp 1 b3Xp 1 b4Ac 1 Lc; ð1Þ which states that the child’s cultural capital depends on parents’ active in- vestments in transmitting their cultural capital to the child ðb1vpÞ and on the child’s passive exposure to cultural capital in the home ðb2SpÞ. The return ðin terms of the child’s cultural capitalÞ to parental investments in the child’s cultural capital is b1, and b2 is the “passive” rate of transfer of cultural capi- tal from parents to the child. The child’s cultural capital also depends on par- ents’ socioeconomic resources Xp, the child’s academic ability Ac ðwhich we assume to be constant over timeÞ, and luck L. The relative sizes of b1 and b2 are not clear from Bourdieu’s writings, but both are assumed to be greater than zero. Below, we review research that provides empirical estimates of b1 and b2. American Journal of Sociology 1084 Cultural Capital, Educational Success, and Social Reproduction In addition to accounting for parental transmission of cultural capital to children, cultural reproduction theory argues that children convert their ðembodiedÞ cultural capital into educational success ðinstitutionalized cul- tural capitalÞ, which in turn promotes socioeconomic success. Consequently, cultural capital is a means to an end. Bourdieu ð1986, p. 247Þ writes that cultural capital is “a symbolically and materially active, effective capital insofar as it is appropriated by agents and implemented.” He furthermore writes that “academic success is directly dependent upon cultural capital and on the inclination to invest in the academic market” ðBourdieu 1977a, p. 504Þ.2 It is not entirely clear from Bourdieu how children convert their embod- ied cultural capital into educational success. He argues that the educational system is intrinsically biased toward misconceiving cultural capital as aca- demic brilliance, and, as a consequence, children who possess cultural capi- tal use it to present an impression of brilliance that is rewarded by teachers ðBourdieu and Passeron 1990; Moore 2004Þ. The reason teachers miscon- ceive cultural capital as academic brilliance is that it signals familiarity with high culture and social status, and, as a consequence, teachers implicitly associate cultural capital with other desirable qualities ðGanzeboom 1982; Crook 1997Þ. Bourdieu uses the concept of the habitus to capture the ways in which children’s cultural capital, acquired from parents and manifested in values, tastes, and behaviors, helps to create such an impression ðBourdieu 1977bÞ. And although the impression of academic brilliance associated with cultural capital is false ðin the sense that, unlike economic capital, cultural capital has no intrinsic value other than that ascribed to itÞ, its consequences are real. Children who possess cultural capital are perceived as more aca- demically gifted than children who do not ðthus leading to better subjective evaluations by teachers and better gradesÞ. Moreover, they are treated in a more favorable way by teachers, which may lead to a better learning envi- ronment and so to better educational performance.3 Thus, it follows that the main channel through which embodied cultural capital is converted into in- stitutionalized cultural capital ðeducational credentialsÞ is through educa- tional performance. We now incorporate this idea into our model. Specifi- 2 In their influential paper, Lamont and Lareau ð1988, p. 154Þ interpret Bourdieu’s writ- ings as follows: “Indeed, they ½Bourdieu and Passeron argued that individuals’ social position and family background provide them with social and cultural resources which need to be actively ‘invested’ to yield social profits.” 3Bourdieu’s idea that teachers are inclined toward valorizing cultural capital has some empirical merit. For example, DiMaggio ð1982Þ cites research showing that although teachers are often recruited from the lower middle class, they are overrepresented among consumers of highbrow culture. In her qualitative study, Lareau ð2003, pp. 14–32Þ finds that teachers place high value on pupils’ cultural activities and actively promote such ac- tivities among their own children. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1085 cally, letting Ec denote final educational attainment, Pc educational perfor- mance, and U and J luck, we write Ec 5 h1Pc 1 h2Xp 1 h3Ac 1Uc; Pc 5 j1Cc 1 j2Ac 1 Jc: ð2Þ Equation ð2Þ states that final educational attainment depends on educa- tional performance, but furthermore that educational performance depends on the child’s cultural capital and on academic ability. Consequently, the pa- rameter j1 captures the “bonus” to educational performance from the im- pression of academic brilliance generated by cultural capital ðnet of the effect of actual ability AÞ. Cultural reproduction theory tells us that j1 &gt; 0. Fur- thermore, the parameter h1 captures the effect of educational performance on final educational attainment ðagain, net of actual academic abilityÞ, and we assume h1 &gt; 0. Note that the reason we use different letters across equa- tions to capture the luck component is that the factors that go into this com- ponent need not be the same across the different outcomes that the equations describe. The final stage in cultural reproduction theory is the link between edu- cational attainment ðinstitutionalized cultural capitalÞ and socioeconomic suc- cess. Letting Yc denote the child’s socioeconomic position in adulthood and Q luck, we write Yc 5 r1Ec 1 r2Xp 1 r3Ac 1 Qc: ð3Þ In this model cultural capital has no direct effect on socioeconomic success but nevertheless contributes to it by improving educational performance, which in turn facilitates educational success, which directly affects socio- economic position ðso we assume r1 &gt; 0Þ. A DYNAMIC MODEL OF CULTURAL REPRODUCTION The model presented above summarizes the main features of cultural repro- duction theory. Equation ð1Þ describes how parents transmit their cultural capital to the child, equation ð2Þ describes how cultural capital is converted into educational success, and equation ð3Þ describes how educational success is converted into socioeconomic success. These are the basic building blocks in the theory of cultural reproduction. Our model, however, and Bourdieu’s writings on cultural reproduction, does not describe the actual mechanisms that lead to the outcomes summarized in equations ð1Þ–ð3Þ. Building on re- cent models of intergenerational transmissions in economics ðTodd and Wolpin 2007; Cunha andHeckman 2008; Bisin and Verdier 2011Þ, we now extend our model to address two important black boxes in Bourdieu’s writ- ings: ð1Þ the mechanism through which parents invest in transmitting cultural American Journal of Sociology 1086 capital to the child and ð2Þ the mechanism through which the child converts cultural capital into educational success. A necessary condition for the theory of cultural reproduction to be con- sistent is that children acquire cultural capital from parents. In our model, we explicate this condition by assuming that b1 &gt; 0 and b2 &gt; 0. Bourdieu ð1986, p. 249Þ writes that “the initial accumulation of cultural capital, the precondition for the fast, easy accumulation of every kind of useful cul- tural capital, starts at the outset, without delay, without wasted time. . . . The accumulation period covers the whole period of socialization.” We take this formulation to suggest that children accumulate cultural capital through- out childhood and, furthermore, that parents actively seek to transmit their cultural capital to their child. We now extend our model to accommodate this idea. After the child’s birth, parents have a finite time horizon in which they can invest in her cultural capital ðand in other endowments that facilitate educational success, such as human capitalÞ. We assume that parents seek to transmit as much as possible of their cultural capital to the child, and they begin investing when the child is young ðbelow, we discuss parents’ invest- ment strategies in detailÞ. For the purposes of our model, we represent child- hood as divided into T time periods ðt 5 1, . . . , TÞ, beginning at birth and ending at the time the child leaves compulsory education ðaround age 16 in most countriesÞ.4 As described in equation ð2Þ, returns to cultural cap- ital are manifest in educational performance, in the form of grades, test scores, or placement in a prestigious educational track. This occurs because cultural capital conveys an impression of academic brilliance, leading to fa- vorable evaluations, more attention, and ultimately better performance ðcap- tured by the parameter j1 in eq. ½2Þ. However, equation ð2Þ is silent as to the mechanism through which cultural capital is converted into educational per- formance, and we now address that issue. We write Pct 5 a1Tt 1 a2Ac 1 a3Xpt 1Wct; Tt 5 J1Pct21 1 J2Cct 1 Vct; ð4Þ where Pct is educational performance at time t, Tt is teacher inputs ðeval- uations, attention, etc.Þ, Cct is the child’s cultural capital, A is academic ability, and Xpt is parental resources. Variables W and V capture the influence of luck and other unmeasured factors that affect performance and teacher in- puts, respectively. Equation ð4Þ states that cultural capital affects educational 4Parents may still transmit cultural capital to the child after age 16. However, we in- terpret Bourdieu as suggesting that the main thrust of parental investments in cultural capital takes place when the child is comparatively young. Also, it may be difficult for parents to transmit cultural capitalwhen the child has left the home, for example, to attend higher education. Instead, parents may rely on their economic or social capital. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1087 performance by improving teachers’ evaluations of the child ðvia J2Þ that, in turn, determine the inputs teachers provide to the child ðvia a1Þ. We expect J2 &gt; 0 ðmore cultural capital leads to higher teacher inputsÞ and a1 &gt; 0 ðhigher teacher inputs lead to better educational performanceÞ. Our model also states that teachers’ inputs in period t depend on the child’s educational per- formance in the previous period: teachers are not myopic, and they adjust their inputs in the child on the basis of her past educational performance ðso, we expect J1 &gt; 0Þ. Equation ð4Þ thus describes the mechanism through which embodied cultural capital is converted into educational performance. High educational performance during compulsory school leads to high edu- cational attainment ðeq. ½2Þ, which in turn leads to high socioeconomic sta- tus ðeq. ½3Þ, thus completing the process of social reproduction. Moving back in the causal chain, we now describe the mechanism through which parents invest in transmitting cultural capital to their child. Parents possess a stock of cultural capital, S. In each time period they actively in- vest amount v in their child. In addition, the child acquires cultural capital via passive exposure to cultural capital in the home. Finally, given the cu- mulative nature of cultural capital formation, the child’s stock of cultural capital at time t also depends on how much cultural capital she had in the previous period. Putting these components together, we write the process through which the child acquires cultural capital: Cct 5 g1Cct21 1 g2vpt 1 g3Sp 1 g4Xpt 1 g5Ac 1 Lct: ð5Þ Equation ð5Þ states that the child’s stock of cultural capital in period t depends on her stock in the previous period, her parents’ active invest- ments in the present period, her passive exposure to cultural capital in the home, and other factors. On the basis of cultural reproduction theory, we expect g1 &gt; 0, g2 &gt; 0, and g3 &gt; 0; that is, we expect the child to have more cultural capital in the present period if she had more cultural capital in the previous period and if parents invest more in cultural capital. Note that vt can be larger than S since parents may try to inculcate cultural capital in their child that they do not themselves possess, for example, by organizing suitable out-of-school activities. WHAT MOTIVATES PARENTS’ INVESTMENTS? In his writings, Bourdieu devotes little attention to describing what parents actually do to transmit their cultural capital to children. In relation to our model, this means that it is not clear from cultural reproduction theory how parents decide how much of their cultural capital to invest in each time pe- riod, and, consequently, the preferences and behaviors that generate the parameters a1, g1, g2, and g3 are unspecified. American Journal of Sociology 1088 We combine the two mechanisms described in equations ð4Þ and ð5Þ and propose a behavioral framework for interpreting the parameters in these equations. We assume that parents are utility maximizers who seek to transmit as much as possible of their cultural capital to the child, but they may differ in their beliefs about the returns to investments in cultural capital. We realize that this approach departs from a conventional interpretation of Bourdieu, but we find it more analytically meaningful than simply assuming that parents more or less unconsciously reproduce behaviors learned through socialization. Moreover, our approach is motivated by an influential body of empirical research that documents that, at least in the U.S. context, middle- class parents deliberately and strategically organize children’s time and lei- sure activities with the intent of cultivating their cognitive and social skills ðLareau 1989, 2003; Calarco 2014Þ.5 We begin by specifying a model for the different factors that determine the child’s educational performance. Putting together equations ð4Þ and ð5Þ yields the following expression for the child’s performance in time pe- riod t: Pct 5 a1½J1Pct21 1 J2Cct 1 Vt1 a2Ac 1 a3Xpt 1Wct 5 a1J1Pct21 1 a1J2½g1Ct21 1 g2vpt 1 g3Sp 1 g4Xpt 1 g5Ac 1 Lt 1 a2Ac 1 a3Xpt 1 a1Vct 1Wct 5 a1J1Pct21 1 a1J2g1Ct21 1 a1J2g2vpt 1 a1J2g3Sp 1 ða1J2g5 1 a2ÞAc 1 ða1J2g4 1 a3ÞXpt 1 a1J2Lct 1 a1Vct 1Wct 5m0Pct21 1m1Ct21 1m2vpt 1m3Sp 1m4Ac 1m5Xpt 1 εct: ð6Þ In this model, the child’s educational performance in time t depends on her performance in the previous period, her cultural capital, parents’ active invest- ments in cultural capital, passive exposure to cultural capital, academic 5Lareau ð2003, p. 238Þ summarizes some of her key findings as follows: “In these ½mid- dle class families, parents actively fostered and assessed their children’s talents, opinions, and skills. They scheduled their children for activities. They reasoned with them. They hovered over them and outside the home they did not hesitate to intervene on the chil- dren’s behalf. They made a sustained and deliberate effort to stimulate children’s devel- opment and to cultivate their cognitive and social skills.” Lareau also argues that the pro- pensity to invest in children, and beliefs about returns to investments, varies by social class background. Below, we discuss how our model accommodates this idea. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1089 ability, and parental resources, as well as a term capturing luck, εct.6 The weight of each component is captured by the parameter m ðm 5 0, . . . , 5Þ. No one knows the true values of the parametersm ði.e., the values that max- imize the child’s educational performanceÞ, but parents have beliefs about all of them originating in past experiences and socialization ðHaller 1982; Kerckhoff 1989Þ. Our model thus states that parents differ in the extent to which they believe that the child’s past performance, her cultural capital, parents’ own investments in cultural capital, and other factors affect their child’s educational performance. We believe these assumptions are in line with cultural reproduction theory. Given the available information and their beliefs about m, parents must choose how much of their stock of cultural capital ðSÞ they wish to invest ðvÞ in each time period. We assume that par- ents seek to maximize utility; that is, they wish to make the optimal in- vestment in each period given their beliefs and resources. We write the objective function that parents want to maximize in each time period: mPct 2 cðvptÞ: ð7Þ The objective function has two components that reflect the benefits and costs of investing cultural capital in the child’s educational performance. The parameter m captures altruism ðalthough all parents care about their child’s educational performance, some care more than othersÞ and parents’ beliefs about the importance of educational performance relative to other factors that might affect their child’s socioeconomic outcomes.7 The term cðvptÞ is a cost function: it captures the costs associated with investing in the child’s cultural capital. Costs principally include time and resources that could have been used for other purposes ðe.g., investments in other types of skillsÞ. How do parents decide howmuch of their cultural capital to invest in each time period? Bourdieu provides no answer to this question, and we need to make several assumptions in order to provide one. Our first assumption is that, given their beliefs about the values of m, parents choose the optimum investment, v*pt, by finding the value of vpt that maximizes the objective func- tion described in equation ð7Þ. In other words, we assume that parents choose whatever amount of investment they think will yield the highest return for a given cost. Our second assumption is that yccðvpÞ=yvp is greater than zero. This means that parents incur greater costs, the greater their active invest- ment in the child’s cultural capital, or, put differently, high investments are 6The error term in eq. ð6Þ is given by εct 5 a1J2Lt 1 a1Vt 1 Wt. 7Some families may use means other than education to promote social reproduction ðe.g., social connections or moneyÞ. Families may also invest in other types of skills, e.g., social skills, or simply in making their child happy. Our model focuses on parents’ in- vestments in cultural capital, and investments in other types of skills enter our model through the cost function that is described next. American Journal of Sociology 1090 more costly than low investments. Our third assumption is that parents’ rel- ative cost of investing in cultural capital decreases with the size of their overall stock of cultural capital, S. This means that it is less costly for parents who have a lot of cultural capital to invest in their child’s cultural capital compared with parents who have little cultural capital. Combining these assumptions, and letting the term hv capture our third assumption that the relative cost of investing in cultural capital decreases when the stock of cul- tural capital S increases ðand where h is smaller, the larger is the stock of parental cultural capitalÞ, the optimum investment at time t is v*pt 5 mm̂2t h : ð8Þ Here, m̂2t is parents’ belief at time t in the return ðin terms of the child’s educational performanceÞ to active investment in the child’s cultural cap- ital. Equation ð8Þ shows that the optimum investment at time t is given by the combination of parents’ beliefs about the returns to investing in cultural capital m̂2t and their altruism m weighted by the cost of making the invest- ment, which, as noted, is smaller for parents with a greater stock of cultural capital. In other words, the optimum investment is the one that reconciles parents’ expectations about which investment will generate the highest re- turn, how much they care about their child’s educational performance, and how costly it is for them to make the investment. It also follows from our model that yv*pt ySp &gt; 0; yv*pt ym &gt; 0; yv*pt ym̂2 &gt; 0; that is, parents invest more when they have a greater stock of cultural capital, when they care more about their child’s educational performance, and when they believe that investing in their child’s cultural capital has a bigger payoff in terms of educational performance. We believe these as- sumptions are consistent with Bourdieu’s idea that cultural capital is prin- cipally a means for those who possess cultural capital to promote social reproduction. Finally, we need to consider how parents’ beliefs about the returns to cultural capital, m̂2, evolve over time. Bourdieu does not provide any in- sights into how parents might change their beliefs about the usefulness of investments in cultural capital. Instead, we draw on research that suggests that parents use information on the outcomes of past investments to de- cide on current investments ðBehrman 1997; Ayalew 2005; Todd andWolpin 2007Þ. This research emphasizes that a feedback mechanism exists from the child’s behavior to parents’ beliefs and investments. Building on this re- search, we propose in our model that parents use new information about the child’s educational performance from grades and test scores to inform their Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1091 belief about the returns to investing in cultural capital. We implement this idea by assuming that parents update their belief according to the follow- ing rule: m̂2t 5 m̂2t21 11 p Pct21 2 Pct22 vt21 2 vt22    : ð9Þ Equation ð9Þ captures the idea that if increases ðdecreasesÞ in cultural capital investments, v, between one period and the next are associated with increases ðdecreasesÞ in educational performance ði.e., the sign of vt21 2 vt22 is the same as the sign of Pct21 2 Pct22Þ, then parents increase their belief about the size of m2, whereas, if they have opposite signs, their belief de- clines. In other words, if investing in cultural capital seems to pay off, par- ents strengthen their belief in the value of such investments; otherwise, their belief diminishes. The degree to which their belief increases or de- creases for a given change in performance, relative to a change in invest- ment, is captured by the adjustment parameter, p. Below, we provide il- lustrative empirical evidence that parents adjust their investments in cultural capital in light of the outcomes of past investments. Figure 1 provides a summary of the main parts of our dynamic model. For ease of presentation, we do not show either the “luck” ðor errorÞ terms of our equations or the effects of the X variables, and we show the underlying relationships at only two points in time. The notation in the figure is the same as in the equations. The underlying logic of the model is very straight- FIG. 1.—Dynamic model of cultural reproduction American Journal of Sociology 1092 forward. Parents’ investment in their child’s cultural capital helps to de- termine the child’s cultural capital. This influences teachers’ perceptions of ðand inputs inÞ the child, which, in turn, affects the child’s educational performance. The child’s educational performance leads parents to update their investment, and this new investment, together with existing cultural capital, shapes the child’s later cultural capital, which affects teacher per- ceptions, and so on. This process continues throughout the period of com- pulsory schooling, eventually leading to final educational attainment, which affects socioeconomic success. IMPLEMENTING OUR MODEL In the remainder of the article, we illustrate the usefulness of our model for past and future research on cultural reproduction. First, we argue that our model helps to organize results from previous research that has sought to test cultural reproduction theory. Second, we argue that our model can be used to improve interpretations of results from a wide range of research that uses cultural reproduction theory to explain persisting socioeconomic differences in educational success ðe.g., differences by race and social classÞ. Third, we use data from the NLSY-CYA to provide an illustrative test of the assump- tion in our model that the processes through which children accumulate cultural capital from parents and convert this capital into educational per- formance are dynamic. Organizing Previous Research We begin by using our theoretical model to organize previous empirical re- search on cultural capital and educational success. Table 1 summarizes the operational measures of cultural capital used in each study in our review ðdistinguishing indicators of highbrow culture, reading climate, educational resources, cultural communication, and extracurricular activitiesÞ, the main finding, and the country in which the study was conducted. The table shows that previous empirical research can be classified into three groups focusing on, respectively, ðaÞ the link between parents’ and children’s cultural capital, ðbÞ the direct effect of cultural capital on educational success, and ðcÞ the ways in which cultural capital is converted into educational success. From the perspective of our model, research that addresses the transmis- sion of cultural capital from parents to children seeks to identify the param- eters b1 and b2 in equation ð1Þ. This research includes indicators of parents’ active investments in cultural capital ðcultural activities, cultural communi- cation, etc.Þ and their passive cultural capital ðcultural objects, books, etc.Þ and relates these measures to children’s cultural capital. Most studies find that there is a positive correlation between parents’ cultural capital ðboth Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1093 T A B L E 1 S u m m a r y o f R e s u l t s f r o m P r e v i o u s R e s e a r c h S tu dy D im en si on of C ul tu ra l C ap it al M ai n R es u lt C ou n tr y T ra n sm is si on of cu lt u ra l ca p it al fr om p ar en ts to ch ild re n : K ra ay k am p ð2 00 3Þ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Research that addresses the direct effect of cultural capital on educational success ðwhich makes up the majority of existing empirical researchÞ ana- lyzes the effect of cultural capital on different measures of educational achieve- ment. In the terminology of our model, this research can be conceptualized as directly identifying j1 in equation ð2Þ ðthe positive effect of cultural cap- ital on educational performanceÞ or, if the outcome variable is final educa- tional attainment, indirectly identifying this effect through h1 ðthe effect of educational performance on final educational attainment that is attributable to cultural capitalÞ. Table 1 shows that most studies report a positive corre- lation between cultural capital and educational success, thereby suggesting that embodied cultural capital is converted into educational performance and attainment. Finally, research that addresses the effect of cultural capital on teachers’ perceptions of children deals with the mechanisms that lead to the expected positive sign of j1 in equation ð2Þ. After controlling for observable academic ability, some studies find that indicators of children’s cultural capital are positively correlated with teachers’ perceptions of children’s academic and social skills. This research corroborates the assumption in cultural repro- duction theory and in our model that the reason j1 is positive—even after taking children’s actual academic ability into account—is due to systematic misrecognition of cultural capital as academic ability. Our review of previous research on cultural capital and educational suc- cess from the perspective of our model shows that this research has ad- dressed, and found empirical support for, some of the core hypotheses in cultural reproduction theory. However, our review also highlights that the studies summarized in table 1 test parts of Bourdieu’s theory rather than the whole. To our knowledge, no research has attempted to analyze the theory of cultural reproduction in its structural form, that is, specifying and testing all the causal pathways through which cultural capital leads to educational and socioeconomic success. Again borrowing terminology from economics, all of the studies listed in table 1 are “reduced form” in the sense that they test only a subset of empirical implications of the theory of cultural repro- duction, in particular the implication that cultural capital has a direct posi- tive effect on educational success. And although this research has yielded important insights into the link between cultural capital and educational suc- cess, at present we have no empirical evidence on whether parental invest- ments in cultural capital in childhood actually lead to socioeconomic success in adulthood ði.e., to social reproductionÞ. An advantage of our structural model is that it could be used as a starting point for analyzing the entire Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1097 causal chain through which investments in cultural capital lead to social reproduction. Better Interpretations of Past Research In addition to organizing results from previous research, our model pro- vides a new framework for interpreting results from research that has used cultural reproduction theory to explain persisting socioeconomic differences in educational outcomes. In what follows, we use our model to reinterpret findings from three influential lines of research that have analyzed ðaÞ black- white differences in educational outcomes, ðbÞ social class differences in edu- cational outcomes, and ðcÞ institutional differences in returns to cultural capital. The objective of this section is to demonstrate that our model ac- commodates a wide range of proposed explanations of why cultural capital might account for socioeconomic differences in educational outcomes. Black-white differences.—Drawing on Bourdieu, several studies argue that black-white differences in educational attainment in the United States are partly mediated by cultural capital ðFarkas et al. 1990; Farkas 1996; Kalmijn and Kraaykamp 1996; Lareau and Horvat 1999; Roscigno and Ainsworth-Darnell 1999Þ. Explanations of why cultural capital mediates these differences build on empirical observations that blacks are ð1Þ less likely to participate in highbrow cultural activities than whites ðDiMaggio and Ostrower 1990; Kalmijn and Kraaykamp 1996Þ, ð2Þ less likely to orga- nize cultural trips or extracurricular activities for their children ðRoscigno and Ainsworth-Darnell 1999; Charles, Roscigno, and Torres 2007Þ, ð3Þmore mistrustful toward schooling ðLareau and Horvat 1999Þ, and ð4Þ less likely to convert cultural capital ðif possessedÞ into educational performance ðRos- cigno and Ainsworth-Darnell 1999Þ. Our model accommodates all of these explanations since black-white differences in educational attainment may arise if ð1Þ blacks possess less cultural capital than whites ði.e., they have dif- ferent values of S in eq. ½1Þ, ð2Þ they are less likely to invest this cultural cap- ital ði.e., even for a fixed S, v is lower among blacks than whitesÞ, ð3Þ they have weaker beliefs than whites that cultural capital yields a return ði.e., different values of m2 in eq. ½6Þ, or ð4Þ their actual rate of return to cul- tural capital is lower than that of whites ði.e., a lower value of j1 in eq. ½2 even for constantAÞ. In ourmodel, all of these factors lead to different levels of parental investment in cultural capital ðeq. ½8Þ and, in the end, different levels of educational attainment, as has been reported in empirical research. Social class differences.—Lareau and colleagues argue that cultural cap- ital mediates social class inequalities in educational success ðLareau 1987, 1989, 2003; Lareau and Horvat 1999; Calarco 2014Þ. The argument in this literature is that middle-class parents engage in concerted cultivation; that is, they organize children’s leisure time activities with the intention of in- American Journal of Sociology 1098 culcating skills and behaviors in children that promote future socioeco- nomic success. In addition to organizing activities outside the home,middle- class parents engage children in conversations and discussion, teaching them to be analytical, reasoning, and argumentative. Working-class parents, by contrast, are much less likely to engage in these activities and to find them useful. All these elements speak directly to our dynamic model of parental investments, which can be used to analyze how social class differences in child-rearing practices and investments lead to educational inequalities. Class differences in the stock of cultural capital are captured in different average values of S. Investments in cultural capital with extracurricular ac- tivities purchased in the market means, in our terms, that vt may exceed S. 8 That middle-class parents have stronger beliefs that cultural capital matters for educational success would be captured in higher values of m2, and this belief might be updated according to the rule described in equation ð9Þ. Lareau and colleagues also argue that middle-class families tend to be more involved than working-class parents in their children’s schooling, for example, by volunteering at school events or by requesting special treatment for their children. In our model, we may think of these practices as invest- ments over and above those made directly in the child’s cultural capital ðeq. ½5Þ that either affect teachers’ perceptions of the child ðresulting in a higher value of J2 in eq. ½4Þ or, if parents are successful in obtaining special treatment, lead to higher teacher inputs in the child ða higher value of a1 in eq. ½4Þ. Both strategies lead to higher educational performance in our model and help to explain how cultural capital may mediate social class differences in educational success. Institutional differences.—A final example of how our model can be used to improve the interpretation of results from previous research relates to DiMaggio’s ð1982Þ influential cultural mobility model. DiMaggio argued that cultural capital may be a means of upward mobility for children from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. The reason cultural capital is particularly beneficial for children from disadvantaged backgrounds is that they tend to populate educational settings in which there is little cultural capital, and, compared to children from more advantaged backgrounds, they face less competition when attempting to show off their cultural capi- tal. This model turns Bourdieu on his head by suggesting that returns to cultural capital, if possessed, are higher for those from less advantaged back- grounds than for those from more advantaged backgrounds ðDiMaggio 8The strategy of purchasing extra inputs ðextracurricular activities, tutoring, etc.Þ to supplement in-house investments in cultural capital is particularly relevant in many non-Western contexts. For example, research shows that in Japan and South Korea parents invest extensively in “shadow education” to promote children’s educational success ðYamamoto and Brinton 2010; Lee and Rouse 2011; Byun, Schofer, and Kim 2012Þ. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1099 1982; Aschaffenburg and Maas 1997; de Graaf, de Graaf, and Kraaykamp 2000Þ. DiMaggio’s model is inconsistent with Bourdieu’s ideas but can be accommodated within our model in which it implies, holding constant re- sources, investments, and beliefs ði.e., S, v, and m2Þ, that returns to cul- tural capital ðvia J2 and a1Þ are higher for children from disadvantaged so- cioeconomic backgrounds than for those from advantaged backgrounds. Our model does not address the question why returns to cultural capital might be different for children from different socioeconomic backgrounds, but it could be extended to include such factors. For example, variation in J2 and a1 by socioeconomic background could arise from differences across schooling environments in the mean level of cultural capital in these envi- ronments. In that case, returns might be higher in environments charac- terized by low levels of cultural capital because less cultural capital is needed to stand out relative to one’s peers. In our model we could capture this sce- nario by extending equation ð4Þ to include C̄, where C̄ is the mean level of cultural capital in the school or class context. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF CULTURAL REPRODUCTION We have argued that our model can be used to organize findings from re- search on cultural capital and to improve the interpretation of a diverse body of research that has used the theory of cultural reproduction to ac- count for socioeconomic differences in educational success. In this final sec- tion we provide empirical evidence on the dynamic nature of cultural capital investments. Our aim is to illustrate three aspects of our model that have not been addressed in previous research: ð1Þ parents invest continuously in children’s cultural capital, ð2Þ children’s cultural capital affects their edu- cational performance, and ð3Þ parents modify investments in cultural capi- tal in light of the outcomes of previous investments. We use longitudinal data from the NLSY-CYA and estimate empirical approximations of equation ð5Þ ðdescribing the process through which the child accumulates cultural capital over timeÞ and equation ð6Þ ðdescribing the process through which cultural capital is converted into educational performanceÞ. We also provide tentative empirical evidence that parents update their beliefs about returns to investments in cultural capital on the basis of the outcomes of past in- vestments ðas described by eq. ½9Þ. Data and Variables We use data from NLSY-CYA, a panel study conducted biannually be- tween 1986 and 2010, which collects information on all biological children of female participants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 ðsee CHRR 2006a, 2006bÞ. We use the NLSY-CYA because, unlike other American Journal of Sociology 1100 available data sets, it includes longitudinal information on cultural capital for NLSY 1979 mothers and for children age 10 and older. Our indicators of children’s cultural capital are mainly collected from children themselves, and, consequently, we focus on children 10–14 years old, for most of whom we have three observations. The NLSY-CYA also includes longitudinal information on children’s academic achievement and socioeconomic back- ground. Unfortunately, the NLSY-CYA does not include direct measures of teacher inputs in children, a point to which we return below. We include four types of variables to capture the core ingredients in our theoretical model. These variables measure ð1Þ the child’s cultural capital, ð2Þ parents’ cultural capital, ð3Þ the child’s educational performance, and ð4Þ socioeconomic background and demographic controls. Table A1 pre- sents detailed information and summary statistics for all variables included in the analyses. Child’s cultural capital.—Previous research has used empirical indica- tors of highbrow culture, reading behavior, extracurricular activities, cul- tural communication, and educational resources to capture different aspects of cultural capital ðsee table 1 for a summaryÞ. In the NLSY-CYA we are limited to including indicators of reading behavior when constructing a measure of the child’s cultural capital ðC in eqq. ½1, ½2, and ½4–½6Þ.9 Specifically, we construct a composite index that is composed from three items: ð1Þ the mother’s report of how much the child reads for enjoyment, ð2Þwhether the child reports that she typically reads a book ormagazine not assigned at school, and ð3Þ whether the child reports that she reads books or magazines for fun on a usual summer day. This index, which captures the child’s reading habits, is constructed by first rescaling the indicator of how much the child reads for enjoyment to lie in the range 0–1 and then summariz- ing the child’s total score on the three indicators included in the index. In the empirical analysis, we rescale the index to lie in the range 0–1. Parents’ cultural capital.—We construct two indicators of parents’ cul- tural capital. The first indicator, active cultural investments, is a composite index intended to capture how much parents actively invest in transmitting their cultural capital to the child ðv in eqq. ½1, ½5, and ½6Þ. It is made up of five items capturing ð1Þ how often in the last year a family member has taken the child to any type of museum, ð2Þ how often in the last year a family member has taken the child to any type of musical or theatrical perfor- mance, ð3Þ how many books the child has, ð4Þ whether the family encour- ages the child to start and keep doing hobbies, and ð5Þ whether the child gets special lessons or does extracurricular activities. The index, which com- 9Keeping this limitation in mind, we note that, among the different aspects of cultural capital that have been included in previous research, reading behavior is the aspect that has been found to be most strongly correlated with educational success ðe.g., de Graaf et al. 2000; Jæger 2009; Gaddis 2013Þ. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1101 bines indicators of highbrow cultural participation, reading climate, and ex- tracurricular activities, summarizes parents’ response to all five items, and it is rescaled to lie in the range 0–1. The second indicator, passive cultural cap- ital, is intended to capture the influence of cultural capital in the home, net of parents’ active investments ðS in eqq. ½1, ½5, and ½6Þ. We use two indi- cators to create this index: ð1Þ whether the family gets a daily newspaper and ð2Þ whether there is a musical instrument in the home that the child can use. The index summarizes parents’ responses to these two questions, and it is rescaled to lie in the range 0–1. Educational performance.—The NLSY-CYA includes two time-varying indicators of the child’s academic achievement, the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests ðPIATÞ in math and reading recognition. We use these measures as proxies for educational performance ðP in eqq. ½2–½4 and ½6Þ. We use percentile scores for each PIAT test, normed to children’s age. Controls.—We include a range of socioeconomic and demographic con- trol variables ðX in eqq. ½1–½6Þ, which are described in appendix table A1. Analytical Strategy We use linear dynamic panel data ðDPDÞ models to estimate approxima- tions of equations ð5Þ and ð6Þ in the theoretical model. DPD models are a variant of traditional panel regression models in which present values of the dependent variable are treated as dynamic in the sense that they may de- pend on past values of the dependent variable, as well as on present and past values of explanatory variables ðe.g., Arellano and Bond 1991; Arellano and Bover 1995; Blundell and Bond 1998Þ. The models we estimate are “reduced form” because they involve statistical estimation of relationships that are derived from our structural model. We interpret the empirical results in light of our underlying structural model that specifies the mech- anisms and behaviors that are assumed to generate these results. Like standard panel regression models, DPD models exploit longitudinal infor- mation in the panel data to control for the effect of unobserved individual characteristics that affect the outcomes of interest. We estimate the following reduced form DPD model for the child’s cul- tural capital ðeq. ½5Þ: Ci;t 5 ~g1Ci;t21 1 ~g2vi;t 1 ~g3Si;t 1 ~g4Xi;t 1 T 1 ui 1 e1i;t; ð10Þ where Ci,t is the child’s cultural capital ðreading behaviorÞ and where i in- dexes individuals ði5 1, . . . , NÞ and t indexes time ðt5 1986–2010Þ. The ~g are parameters to be estimated, and the tildes are used to indicate that these are our empirical estimates of the parameters of equation ð5Þ. The pa- American Journal of Sociology 1102 rameter ui is a child-specific effect that captures time-invariant unobserved characteristics that affect cultural capital.10 In this model the child’s cultural capital in period t depends on her cultural capital in the previous period ðthus capturing the idea that cultural capital accumulated in the past affects cultural capital in the presentÞ, parents’ active cultural investments and pas- sive cultural capital in the present period ðv and S, respectivelyÞ, and parents’ resources in the present period ðXÞ. The model also includes dummies for survey year T ð1986–2010Þ to capture time trends and an error term e1. We estimate the following reduced form DPD model for the child’s edu- cational performance ðeq. ½6Þ: Pi;t 5 ~m0Pi;t21 1 ~m1Ci;t21 1 ~m2vi;t 1 ~m3Si;t 1 ~m5Xi;t 1 T 1 ui 1 e2i;t; ð11Þ where the child’s performance on the PIAT math and reading recognition tests in period t, Pi,t, depends on her performance and cultural capital in the previous period, parents’ active investments in cultural capital and passive cultural capital in the home, and parents’ resources. We should note that this reduced form model is an incomplete representation of our structural model because we do not observe teacher inputs in the child in the NLSY- CYA data. Consequently, rather than estimating the effect of the child’s cultural capital on teacher inputs ðwhich is the “catalyst” through which cultural capital is assumed to be converted into educational performance in our modelÞ, we estimate ~m1, which captures the combined effect of J2 ðthe effect of cultural capital on teacher inputsÞ and a1 ðthe effect of teacher inputs on educational performanceÞ. Finally, we estimate reduced form DPD models to substantiate our as- sumption that parents adjust their investments in cultural capital in light of the outcomes of past investments ðdescribed in eqq. ½7–½9Þ. We esti- mate the following model: vi;t 5 ~t1vi;t21 1 ~t2vi;t22 1 ~t3Pi;t21 1 ~t4ðvi;t22  Pi;t21Þ1 ~t5Si;t 1 ~t6Xi;t 1 T 1 ui 1 e3i;t; ð12Þ where vi,t is parents’ active cultural investments in the child in period t. 11 Parents’ active cultural investment in period t depends on their investment in the previous period ðvi,t21Þ, their investment two periods ago ðvi,t22Þ, the 10Our theoretical model also includes academic ability, Ac ðeq. ½5Þ. We control indirectly for academic ability via ui, which, among other factors, also captures the effect of academic ability on cultural capital. 11Note that our indicators of parents’ investments in cultural capital cover the period when the child was 6–14 years old ðand in some cases 0–14 years old; see table A1Þ, which means that we have more repeated observations of parents’ investments than observations of children’s cultural capital. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1103 child’s educational performance in the previous period ðPi,t21Þ, and an in- teraction effect between parents’ investment two periods ago and the child’s educational performance in the previous period ðS, X, T, u, and e are the same as aboveÞ. The ~t are parameters to be estimated. The idea in this model is to test whether, as stipulated in equation ð9Þ, parents adjust their beliefs about the returns to cultural capital, and thus their active cultural investments in the present, on the basis of the outcomes of past investments. If parents adjust their investments, the coefficient on the interaction term, ~t4, should be positive. Parents know how much they invested two periods ago ðvi,t22Þ, they observed the outcome of this investment in the child’s edu- cational performance in the previous period ðPi,t21Þ, and if returns to past investments are positive, parents should update their beliefs so as to invest more in the present ðvi,tÞ. Thus, the coefficient on the interaction effect cap- tures the adjustment in parents’ active cultural investments in the present that follows from a combination of investments two periods ago and aca- demic performance one period ago. We estimate the parameters of the DPD models using the one-step system generalized method of moments estimator implemented in the Stata ado xtabond2 ðRoodman 2009Þ. Finally, because the NLSY-CYA includes several children from the same family, we adjust all standard errors for clustering of respondents within families. Results Table 2 presents results from reduced form DPD regressions of the child’s cultural capital and the child’s score on the PIAT math and reading rec- ognition tests. In all models, we use data on three observations for each child collected between age 10 and 14. Results from the DPD model for the child’s cultural capital are consis- tent with the predictions of our theoretical model. We find that the child’s cultural capital ðmeasured by reading habitsÞ in period t depends on her cultural capital in the previous period ð~g1 5 :29, P &lt; .001Þ, thus indicat- ing that the child accumulates cultural capital over time. Net of this cu- mulative effect, we also find a positive and statistically significant effect of parents’ active cultural investments in the present period on the child’s cultural capital ð~g2 5 :15, P &lt; .001Þ and a positive effect of parents’ passive cultural capital ð~g3 5 :04, P &lt; .01Þ. These results are in line with our argu- ment that the process through which the child accumulates cultural capital from parents is dynamic, and, moreover, parents’ active cultural investments and the child’s passive exposure to cultural capital both contribute to the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital. We now turn to the results for the child’s educational performance, as de- scribed in equation ð6Þ in our theoretical model. Table 2 shows results from American Journal of Sociology 1104 reduced form DPD regressions of the child’s math and reading ability on the child and parents’ cultural capital and on the controls. Results are very similar for the two measures of academic achievement. In addition to test scores in the present period depending on the test score in the previous period ðreflecting a cumulative effectÞ, math and reading ability in the present pe- rioddependonthechild’sculturalcapital in thepreviousperiod ð~m1math 5 4:52, ~m1reading 5 6:31; both P &lt; .001Þ and on parents’ active cultural investments in the present period ð~m2math 5 10:64, ~m2reading 5 8:42; both P &lt; .001Þ and passive cultural capital ð~m3math 5 4:66, ~m3reading 5 4:12; both P &lt; .001Þ. Keep- ing the limitations of the NLSY-CYA data in mind, we find that these em- pirical findings are consistent with our theoretical model. Since we do not observe teacher inputs, we interpret the positive effect of the child’s cultural capital on educational performance as capturing the outcome of a two-stage process in which cultural capital is converted into teacher inputs, which are then converted into educational performance. In this regard, our reduced form estimates capture the “rate of return” to cultural capital in terms of educational performance, as expressed in our model. Finally, table 3 presents results from reduced form DPD models of par- ents’ active cultural investments. In equation ð12Þ we stipulate that, in ad- dition to other factors, parents’ active cultural investments in the present depend on the outcomes of their investments two periods ago, manifested in the child’s educational performance one period ago.

Taken together with the positive interaction term, this suggests that parents’ investments American Journal of Sociology 1106 tent with the idea that parents update their beliefs about the returns to cultural capital on the basis of the outcomes of past investments. Naturally, more research, including direct testing, is needed to determine the extent to which parents adjust investments in cultural capital. DISCUSSION This article was motivated by what we regard as a discrepancy between the prominent position of the theory of cultural reproduction in social stratification research and its conceptual and empirical validity. There is widespread agreement that Bourdieu’s writings on cultural reproduction are unclear with regard to core concepts and mechanisms. We argue that this lack of clarity has had a detrimental impact on research on cultural reproduction, which is characterized by little consensus on how to con- ceptualize and measure cultural capital and how to interpret empirical corre- lations between cultural capital and educational success. At present, we are not convinced that the literature provides a credible answer to Bourdieu’s original question: Does cultural capital promote social reproduction? Instead of debating the exact meaning of Bourdieu’s original thoughts, we present a formal theoretical model of cultural reproduction that encap- sulates what we believe to be the core ideas in his theory. This structural model brings together Bourdieu’s ideas and may be used as a basis for or- ganizing and interpreting results from previous research and as a conceptual starting point for future research. Our model describes the three components that make up the theory of cultural reproduction: how parents transmit their cultural capital to children, how children convert cultural capital into edu- cational success, and how educational success promotes social reproduction. It extends Bourdieu’s ideas by describing the mechanism through which parents invest in their children’s cultural capital and the mechanism through which children convert cultural capital into educational performance. On the basis of a rational choice perspective, we also propose a flexible set of be- havioral assumptions on the part of parents, children, and institutions that enables us to interpret the parameters in our structural model. We use our theoretical model to interpret the results of existing empiri- cal research and use NLSY-CYA data to illustrate the dynamic nature of cultural capital investments and their implications for children’s educa- in their child’s cultural capital remain unchanged if she performs poorly. If, following low parental investment, the child performs well, parents reduce their investment further, per- haps because it seems to be unnecessary to their child’s educational success. But if, following relatively high parental investment, their child performs well, parents increase their sub- sequent investment because, as we argue, they interpret this to mean that investing in their child’s cultural capital pays off. Dynamic Model of Cultural Reproduction 1107 tional performance. Our literature review suggests that results from pre- vious research are mostly in line with cultural reproduction theory but also that research has yet to test the full implications of the theory and to iden- tify the specific mechanisms through which cultural capital may lead to edu- cational success. Results from our illustrative analysis of the NLSY-CYA data are consistent with the hypotheses that children accumulate cultural capital from parents, cultural capital has a positive effect on educational performance, and parents adjust their investments in cultural capital on the basis of the outcomes of past investments. We believe that the main contribution of this article is to propose a new direction for research that uses the concepts of cultural reproduction and cultural capital to explain persisting intergenerational inequalities in socio- economic outcomes. In our view, there is little doubt that the inequalities in socioeconomic outcomes that have been extensively documented in social stratification research are partly attributable to cultural factors in the family of origin. The challenge is how to conceptualize these cultural factors and the ways in which they operate and how to document their implications for patterns of intergenerational social mobility. We think Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction represents a starting point for such an investigation but is ultimately limited by its lack of clarity in several core dimensions. A key advantage of our model is that it can be extended to accommo- date a richer conceptual setup or new empirical insights. For example, our model assumes that parents have only one child. But how do parents allo- cate investments in cultural capital when they have more than one child? Related research shows that parents allocate resources to each child in the family on the basis of the expected costs and benefits of these allocations and on the basis of observable outcomes of past investments ðSteelman and Powell 1991; Behrman 1997; Ayalew 2005Þ. Lareau’s ð2003Þ qualitative study illustrates this point. In the Tallinger family—a white middle-class family with three boys—the parents allocate a disproportionate share of the fam- ily’s resources to the oldest son, Garrett, whom they believe is the most gifted among the three children. We could extend our model to accom- modate this situation by arguing that, when a family has more than one child and assuming that there is a limit on the family’s resources, invest- ment in children’s cultural capital ðgiven by vipt, where i indexes childrenÞ will be proportional to parents’ belief about each child’s m2 parameter. That is, parents will invest in proportion to how much return their investment is expected to yield, in terms of educational performance, for each child. Children who more effectively translate parental investments into educa- tional performance will receive greater investment than will their brother or sister whose performance is less sensitive to parental investment. Fu- ture research should explore whether this type of logic applies in multichild households. American Journal of Sociology 1108 Another extension of our model might be to incorporate heterogeneity in returns to cultural capital. Our model assumes that the return to cultural capital in the form of educational performance, j1 ðor, in the dynamic con- text, J2Þ, is the same for all children. Yet, it may be that j1 varies system- atically by institutional context or by socioeconomic factors. For example, Jæger ð2011Þ found that returns to highbrow cultural capital ðmeasured by frequency of going to museums and concertsÞ were higher for children from advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds than for those from less advan- taged backgrounds. He argued that this difference in the rate of return to highbrow cultural capital might be due to different institutionalizations of cultural capital across schooling environments: children from advantaged backgrounds tend to be in schooling environments that appreciate famil- iarity with highbrow culture, while those from less advantaged backgrounds tend not to be in these environments. In a similar vein, Leopold and Shavit ð2013Þ found that immigrants from the former Soviet Union in Israel receive a lower return to their cultural capital in Israeli schools than natives because they possess the “wrong” type of cultural capital that is not appreciated in mainstream education. In our model we could incorporate these types of heterogeneity by, for example, letting j1 in equation ð2Þ be a function of a set of institutional or social characteristics. Indeed, many extensions of our model are possible, and we hope that future research will extend, modify, and test the model presented in this article and, in that process, provide a richer understanding of the ways in which cultural capital may contribute to social reproduction.
