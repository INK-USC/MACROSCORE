Short Report Enhancing the Pace of Recovery Self-Distanced Analysis of Negative Experiences Reduces Blood Pressure Reactivity Özlem Ayduk1 and Ethan Kross2 1University of California, Berkeley, and 2Columbia University Recent work suggests that rumination plays a key role in medi- ating the relationship between stress and cardiovascular disease (Brosschot, Gerin, & Thayer, 2006). People engage in rumina- tion because they believe that understanding their feelings will improve their mood. However, these attempts often backfire, instead maintaining negative affect (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991) and delaying physiological recovery from negative events (Glynn, Christenfeld, & Gerin, 2002)—a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (McEwen, 1998). At first glance, these findings suggest that people should avoid focusing on their negative feelings. However, this prescription contradicts an alternative literature indicating that emotional processing facilitates coping (e.g., Pennebaker & Chung, 2007). Thus, a key question emerges: How can people analyze negative experiences without enhancing their vulnerability to cardiovas- cular disease? According to a recent proposal (Kross, Ayduk, & Mischel, 2005), whether people’s attempts to understand their negative feelings are adaptive depends on the type of self-perspective they adopt.Research results supported the prediction that analyz- ing feelings surrounding a negative experience from a self- distanced perspective (from an observer’s vantage point) leads people to display lower levels of negative affect and rumination than does analyzing such feelings from a self-immersed perspec- tive (from one’s own vantage point; Kross et al., 2005; also see Kross & Ayduk, in press). The current study extends these findings to cardiovascular reactivity. We predicted that participants who adopted a self- distanced perspective, compared with those who adopted a self- immersed perspective, would demonstrate smaller increases in blood pressure reactivity both when analyzing their feelings dur- ing the experiment and during a recovery period after the experiment was over. METHOD Ninety undergraduates (54.55% women; mean age 5 20.71, SD5 4.24) from diverse ethnic backgrounds were recruited for a study on mental imagery and physiological responses. They completed the study on a computer, which provided both written and oral instructions. Participants first sat quietly for 5 min for baseline measurements of blood pressure (i.e., baseline phase). Next, they were cued to recall an experience when they were angry and indicated that they had recalled an appropriate ex- perience by pressing the space bar (i.e., recall phase); the computer recorded their recall times. Then they were told, ‘‘Go back to the time and place of the conflict and see the scene in your mind’s eye.’’ They were then randomly assigned to one of two perspective conditions. In the self-immersed condition, participants were told, Relive the situation as if it were happening to you all over again . . . Reexperience the interaction as it progresses in your mind’s eye. In the self-distanced condition, participants were told, Take a few steps back . . . . Move away from the situation to a point where you can nowwatch the conflict froma distance . . . .Watch the conflict unfold as if it were happening all over again to the distant you. Replay the interaction as it progresses in your mind’s eye. Participants were given as much time as they needed to adopt these perspectives and indicated they had done this successfully by pressing the space bar; the computer recorded this time. Next, they were directed to analyze their feelings for 60 s from the perspective they adopted: As you continue to relive this conflict, try to understand the emotions that you [your distant self ] experienced as the conflict unfolded. Why did you [he/she] have those feelings? What were the underlying causes and reasons? The perspective-taking and analysis instructions together con- stituted the manipulation phase of the study.

Blood pressure was recorded throughout the experiment. Dependent Variables Participants’ ratings of the extent to which and the intensity with which they reexperienced their original feelings during the ex- periment were averaged to form an emotional-reactivity index (r 5 .76, p < .001; scale: 1–7, M 5 3.44, SD 5 1.44). Blood pressure was recorded using a Medwave continual blood pressure machine (St. Paul, MN). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was used as the main dependent variable. Covariates Because participants varied in how quickly they recalled an experience of anger (recall time), adopted a particular perspec- tive (perspective time), and completed the questionnaires (questionnaire time), we included these response times as covariates. Because imagery vividness—the composite of self- reported imagination ability and vividness of the recalled memory, r(88)5 .50, p< .001—and the self-reported resolution status of the recalled experience (69% resolved vs. 31% unre- solved) might have affected reactivity during the experiment, we also controlled for these variables. We observed no group differences in any covariate except for perspective time (self- distanced:M5 59.07 s, SD5 20.51; self-immersed:M5 45.94 s, SD 5 22.95), t(88) 5 2.84, p < .01, d 5 0.60. None of the covariates moderated the results reported in this article. Exclusions Six participants were excluded because they did not follow in- structions. Additionally, six extreme or biologically implausible blood pressure reactivity scores were excluded from analyses. Exclusions were not related to experimental condition, w2(1, N5 90)5 0.14, p5 .71. Some data could not be scored because of faulty sensors or noisy signals, so sample sizes for blood pressure indices vary. RESULTS Baseline MAP did not differ significantly between the two con- ditions, t(74) 5 1.40, p 5 .17. We therefore computed change scores by subtracting baseline MAP values fromMAP values for each study phase (i.e., recall, manipulation, recovery). Separate one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted on emotional reactivity and MAP reactivity scores from each study phase. Condition was the between-subjects predictor, and rel- evant covariates were included. The ANCOVA revealed that participants in the self-distanced group reported lower levels of emotional reactivity than partic- ipants in the self-immersed group. Because recall of the anger experience preceded the experimental manipulation, we ex- pected and found no difference between the two groups in MAP reactivity during recall (F < 1). In contrast, participants in the self-distanced group showed lower MAP reactivity than those in the self-immersed group during both the manipulation and the recovery phases of the experiment (see Table 1 for significant results). DISCUSSION A hallmark feature of rumination is that it delays physiological recovery (Gerin, Davidson, Christenfeld, Goyal, & Schwartz, 2006), which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (McEwen, 1998). Thus, the fact that analyzing experiences of anger from a self-distanced rather than a self-immersed per- spective led to lower reactivity may have important protective benefits for physical health. This study, to our knowledge, is the first to examine how the negative physiological consequences associated with rumination can be reduced without relying on distraction. Our finding on distancing as an alternative strategy is important because dis- traction, although effective at reducing short-termarousal, may be less useful for long-term coping (Kross & Ayduk, in press). A key challenge for future research will be to identify the boundary conditions that determine when distanced analysis is adaptive and when it is not. It is possible that under certain circumstances, alternative coping strategies (e.g., avoidance in the case of uncontrollable situations; emotional flooding and habituation in coping with fear and trauma) are more helpful than distancing.
