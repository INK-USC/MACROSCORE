Why Do Ethnic Groups rEbEl? new Data and Analysis by lArs-Erik cEDErmAn, AnDrEAs WimmEr, and briAn min* DEspitE its fundamental role in legitimizing the modern state system, nationalism has rarely been linked to the outbreak of po- litical violence in the recent literature on ethnic conflict and civil war. to a large extent, this is because the state is absent from many conven- tional theories of ethnic conflict. indeed, some studies analyze conflict between ethnic groups under conditions of state failure, thus making the absence of the state the very core of the causal argument. others assume that the state is ethnically neutral and try to relate ethnodemo- graphic measures, such as fractionalization and polarization, to civil war. in contrast to these approaches, we analyze the state as an institu- tion that is captured to different degrees by representatives of particular ethnic communities, and thus we conceive of ethnic wars as the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power. While our work relates to a rich research tradition that links the causes of such conflicts to the mobilization of ethnic minorities, it also goes beyond this tradition by introducing a new data set that addresses some of the shortcomings of this tradition. our analysis is based on the Ethnic power relations data set (epr), which covers all politically relevant ethnic groups and their access to power around the world from 1946 through 2005. this data set improves significantly on the widely used minorities at risk data set, which restricts its sample to mobilized *correspondence should be directed to lars-Erik cederman (lcederman@ethz.ch).

ABSTRACT Much of the quantitative literature on civil wars and ethnic conflict ignores the role of the state or treats it as a mere arena for political competition among ethnic groups. Other studies analyze how the state grants or withholds minority rights and faces ethnic protest and rebellion accordingly, while largely overlooking the ethnic power configurations at the state's center. Drawing on a new data set on Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) that identifies all politically relevant ethnic groups and their access to central state power around the world from 1946 through 2005, the authors analyze outbreaks of armed conflict as the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power. The findings indicate that representatives of ethnic groups are more likely to initiate conflict with the government (1) the more excluded from state power they are, especially if they have recently lost power, (2) the higher their mobilizational capacity, and (3) the more they have experienced conflict in the past. 88 world politics 1 complementing the current study, Wimmer, cederman, and min 2009 show that ethic conflict results from specific ethnopolitical configurations of power, rather than from ethnic diversity per se. they identify three particularly conflict-prone configurations: ethnocracies, states with a high number of power-sharing ethnic elites, and incohesive states with a short history of direct rule by the center. 2 posen 1993. 3 hardin 1995; de Figueiredo and Weingast 1999. minorities and thus largely overlooks the ethnopolitical constellation of power at the center. improved theory and data allow us to show that, contrary to the expectations held by many scholars of civil wars, competing ethno- nationalist claims over the state constitute the driving force behind many internal conflicts in the post–World War ii era. While we have analyzed this data set at the country level in another publication,1 we pursue a more disaggregated, group-level analysis here. We show that conflict with the government is more likely to erupt (1) the more repre- sentatives of an ethnic group are excluded from state power, especially if they experienced a loss of power in the recent past, (2) the higher their mobilizational capacity is, and (3) the more they have experi- enced conflict in the past. in view of these findings, we conclude that ethnonationalist struggles over access to state power are an important part of the dynamics leading to the outbreak of civil wars. the article is organized as follows. We first review the relevant con- flict literature and then develop the three main hypotheses that lie at the core of our theory. the following section introduces the epr data set. the main results are presented in the next section, followed by a brief sensitivity analysis and a concluding section. existing ApproAches to ethnicity And conflict: security dilemmA, ethnic frActionAlizAtion, And minority mobilizAtion in order to understand the conflicts that broke out in yugoslav and soviet successor states as well as in rwanda during the 1990s, some researchers have utilized ideas developed to study interstate relations during the cold war. most prominently, posen conceived of ethnic con- flict as a struggle between ethnic groups in the wake of state collapse.2 According to neorealist theory, ethnic groups face a security dilemma when the leviathan disappears and react with preemptive violence. these ideas were subsequently elaborated with the help of rational choice models.3 As a consequence of the assumption of state breakdown, however, this research tends to overlook the important role played by state actors ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Wars are more likely, so the argument goes, in states that are too weak to suppress rebellions or where natural resources invite warlords to enrich themselves by looting.4 research on the basis of this griev- ance hypothesis has undoubtedly helped to clarify the general condi- tions that are conducive to civil wars and insurgencies. however, the grievance hypothesis has not been tested with adequate data; rather, it has been tested with highly aggregated proxies that do not provide a direct measure of political inequality along ethnic lines and the re- sulting “grievances.” Fearon and laitin, for example, examine whether there is a statistical association between measures of a country’s “ethnic fractionalization” and civil war onset.5 some scholars have worked with measures of ethnic polarization that are loosely related to horowitz’s theory of ethnic conflict, again without explicit references to the state.6 others seek to operationalize the concept of ethnic domination but use a demographic proxy as well.7 We believe that efforts to grasp the propensity for ethnonationalist conflict with the help of macrolevel indices are problematic.8 First, they implicitly assume that the ethnic groups listed in the work of anthro- pologists and linguists are politically relevant.9 second, the macrolevel indices describe a country’s demography,10 which may or may not be related to the actual constellation of power at the state center.11 Quali- tative studies of ethnic conflict show that in such cases the state is not an ethnically neutral institution but is an active agent of political exclu- sion that generates these conflicts in the first place.12 ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

We note that the mAr-based literature has produced somewhat conflicting results regarding the question most relevant to this article: whether or not political disadvantage and discrimination increase the likelihood of ethnic rebellion. in fact, whereas some studies find that political disadvantage has an impact on the likelihood of armed rebel- lion and secession,21 others find that the degree of political exclusion has no effect on secessionism.22 the picture is even more mixed as re- gards the effect of political discrimination: while regan and norton, as well as Walter, find strong evidence that political discrimination in- creases rebellions and secessionist civil wars,23 Fox fails to find any clear relationship for the subset of ethnoreligious groups,24 and Gurr’s study of ethnonationalist rebellions in the 1980s even suggests that political discrimination is associated with less rather than more conflict.25 olzak aggregates mAr data on the country level and arrives at the conclusion 13 there is also a vast qualitative literature on minority mobilization and ethnonationalist violence; see brubaker and laitin 1998. 14 Gurr 1993a; Gurr 2002. 15 toft 2003. 16 tir and Jasinski 2008. 17 Walter 2006a; Jenne 2007. 18 cetinyan 2002; saideman 2002. 19 brancati 2006; Walter 2006b. 20 olzak 2006. 21 For example, Gurr 1993b; Walter 2006b. 22 saideman and Ayers 2000. 23 regan and norton 2005; Walter 2006b. 24 Fox 2000. 25 Gurr 1993b. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Finally, focusing on minorities con- flates the demographic concept of numerical domination with political exclusion. Accordingly, the mAr coding scheme does not fit countries with ruling minorities or complex coalitions of ethnically defined elites, as for example in nigeria, india, or chad, where ethnic conflict will be pursued in the name of excluded majorities (rather than minorities) or ethnic groups that share power (and are thus not “at risk”).27 in sum, much of the recent literature on ethnic conflict and civil wars fails to get the state’s role right. many approaches do not take ac- count of the state as an actor in conflict processes (as in the security di- lemma approach), fail to trace the ethnopolitical power constellations at the center of state power (as in the minority mobilization school), or try to capture ethnopolitical discontent through demographic proxies of diversity. these theoretical, sampling, and measurement problems hinder the development of precise and testable hypothesis about which mechanisms connect ethnonationalist politics to political violence. the following section addresses this task. theorizing ethnonAtionAlist conflict: Actor constellAtions, motives, And collective Action the classical sociological literature on nationalism offers a good start- ing point for understanding the logic of ethnonationalist conflict. 26 olzak 2006,124. 27 the mAr data set tries to address these limitations by including five “advantaged” minorities that benefit from political discrimination. mAr also comprises a series of “communal contenders” mostly in Africa, that is, groups that share power with others while at the same time mobilizing in protest or rebellion. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Adapting tilly’s model along the lines proposed by cederman and Girardin, we assume that polity members and challengers consist of ethnic groups and their leaders (including politically irrelevant groups 28 Gellner 1983. 29 Anderson 1991. 30 kedourie 1960; breuilly 1994; brubaker 1996; cederman 1997; Wimmer and min 2006. 31 For example, brass 1991; Wimmer 2002. 32 For example, hechter 2001. 33 For example, Weiner 1971. 34 For example, brubaker 1996. 35 For example, beissinger 2002; cederman 1997, chaps. 7, 8; hechter 2000; olzak 2006; Wim- mer 2002, chap. 3. 36 tilly 1978. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

We first study which groups will be more motivated to support a rebellion against ethnic domination by others. indeed, many aggrieved groups have not produced militant rebel organizations. We therefore have to identify those groups that perceive the government as particularly illegitimate and are therefore more inclined to support re- bellions. second, we consider a group’s organizational capacity to chal- lenge incumbent state power because high levels of motivation alone will not suffice to produce an armed organization willing to take on the government army. Finally, rather than constituting historical singulari- ties, political violence often leaves traces that put nationalist politics on a contentious track. We therefore need to identify such potential effects of path dependency. in the following, we consider the causal mechanisms associated with each of these three mechanisms in turn. most motivAted groups: excluded, downgrAded, And underrepresented to specify motives and identify the most motivated actors, we draw on Wimmer’s institutionalist approach to nationalism and ethnic poli- tics, which assumes that rulers in modern nation-states are no longer legitimized by the principles of dynastic succession, God’s grace, or civilizational progress but that they are expected to care for their own, ethnically defined people.39 political officeholders thus have institu- tional incentives to gain legitimacy by favoring coethnics over others when it comes to the distribution of public goods and government jobs. the expectation of ethnic preference works in the other direction as well, as voters prefer parties led by coethnics, delinquents hope for co- ethnic judges, and citizens prefer to be policed by coethnics. under the conditions of pervasive ethnic favoritism, political lead- ers and followers are driven by the strategic motive to avoid or even to overturn dominance by ethnic “others.” this motive is simultane- ously material, political, and symbolic: “adequate” or “just” representa- tion in a central government offers material advantages such as access 39 Wimmer 2002. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Especially in weak states with weakly developed civil societies, the state may be captured by particular ethnic elites and their constituencies, thus giving rise to one among other variants of the “weak state–strong society” constella- tion analyzed by midgal and others. 40 it follows that groups that lose out in this struggle for state power are more fertile breeding grounds for organizations that challenge the government. We postulate a direct relationship between the degree of state power and the likelihood that an armed rebellion will be instigated in the name of that particular group. the most excluded groups will thus be most likely to support armed organizations that challenge the gov- ernment. Given nationalist principles of political legitimacy, feelings of resentment will be widespread and can be channeled into successful col- lective action.41 We summarize this reasoning in a first hypothesis: —h1a. the probability of ethnonationalist conflict increases the more representatives of an ethnic group are excluded from central executive power. the exclusion mechanism also alerts us to the consequences of changes in power hierarchies. sociological theories of emotions sug- gest that negative emotions are especially likely to be aroused following loss of power and prestige.42 When the subjects blame others for their downgrading, anger and resentment increase the readiness to fight in order to change the situation.43 We postulate a similar mechanism at the level of collective organizations: leaders of ethnonationalist orga- nizations will be most likely to resort to violence if they have recently experienced a loss of relative power. they can channel the resentment of their constituencies and mobilize to “reverse a reversal.”44 this rea- soning leads to the following hypothesis: 40 migdal 1988; see also Jackman 1993. 41 petersen 2002. 42 kemper 1978. 43 turner and stets 2005, 217. 44 petersen 2002, 173. the mAr data set includes an indicator for “lost autonomy” that is associ- ated with rebellions; see Gurr 2000, 230; saideman and Ayres 2000; Walter 2006b. note, however, that our hypothesis concerns all types of status reversals, including exclusion or demotion that were not preceded by autonomous status. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Finally, the principle of ethnic representativity of modern nation- states is also violated if groups in power are “underrepresented” in com- parison with other power-sharing partners. When smaller groups wield more power than larger groups, representatives of the larger groups can portray the situation as unfair and stir up fear of ethnic domination among their constituents.45 thus, we have the next hypothesis. —h1c. the probability of ethnonationalist conflict increases if the ethnic group represented by a power-sharing partner is larger compared with that of more powerful coalition partners. mobilizAtionAl cApAcity: group size collective action theory tells us that group motivations are insufficient to produce political mobilization and violent contestation.46 the moti- vational forces described above are thus a necessary, but not a sufficient, cause for ethnic conflict. successful mobilization requires both motivation and organizational capacity.47 While neoclassical collective action theory in the olsonian tradition expects free riding in large groups, nationalists may overcome such dilemmas through intragroup monitoring, by relying on preexisting social networks, and by mobilizing identity-related co- operation norms.48 Following resource mobilization theory, we postulate that larger excluded groups are even more able to challenge a govern- ment because they can draw on their superior numbers to recruit fighters and have a larger potential resource pool to sustain an organizational infrastructure.49 As argued by cederman, buhaug, and rød, the politi- cal claims of larger ethnic groups also enjoy more legitimacy: given the principles of representativity that underlie the nation-state, the exclusion of large sections of the population from power is more scandalous than the exclusion of smaller groups, and minority-ruled states (ethnocracies) are among the least legitimate political regimes in the modern world.50 based on this argument, we postulate the next hypothesis. —h2. the probability of ethnonationalist conflict increases with the ethnic group’s relative demographic size. 45 For a general argument based on intergroup comparison, see horowitz 1985; and Gurr 2000. 46 mccarthy and Zald 1977; tilly 1978; tilly and tarrow 2006. 47 Gurr 2000. 48 hechter and okamoto 2001. Furthermore, free riding may be less problematic in many civil war situations because of the risks associated with nonparticipation; see kalyvas and kocher 2007. 49 mccarthy and Zald 1977; Denardo 1985. 50 cederman, buhaug, and rød 2009; see also cederman 1997, chap. 8; petersen 2002, 51. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

We postulate that past conflicts influence the likelihood of present conflict through three mechanisms. First, ethnonationalist activists at- tempt to glorify their group’s history through one-sided narratives that stress their own victories and attribute blame for military losses to trai- tors, weak-spirited leaders, or a ruthless enemy. this implies that leaders might not update their risk assessments and might take up arms again even when the chances of winning have not improved significantly.53 second, past experiences of traumatic violence may live on as a part of oral tradition or they may sometimes be perpetuated in official history textbooks and public rituals, nourishing calls for revenge.54 third, prior exposure to combat means that violence is no longer unthinkable but constitutes part of the accepted repertoire of action and may help create organizational structures and identities that can be reactivated at later points in history or even create a culture of violence.55 We express these three mechanisms of path dependency in our third main hypothesis. —h3. the probability of ethnonationalist conflict increases with the number of prior conflicts fought in the name of the same ethnic group. needless to say, this set of hypotheses does not exhaust the links be- tween ethnicity and internal conflict. properties of ethnic groups, such as concentrated settlement patterns,56 cohesive internal structure,57 and 51 beissinger 2002. 52 Wimmer and min 2006. 53 rydgren 2007. 54 kalyvas 2007. 55 laitin 1995; Waldman 2004.

Evaluating the theory calls for data that code access to executive power for representatives of different ethnic groups, as well as the conflicts in which they have been involved. meAsuring ethnic power relAtions the Ethnic power relations (epr) data set identifies all politically rel- evant ethnic groups and their access to state power in all years from 1946 to 2005.59 in collecting the data, we relied on the expert input of nearly one hundred students of ethnic politics to assess formal and informal degrees of political participation and exclusion along ethnic lines.60 in line with most other data sources on ethnic politics including mAr, the current data set takes ethnic groups as units of observation, rather than political organizations that claim to speak in their name.61 this data set improves significantly on previous efforts to code ethnic groups’ access to power, such as that of cederman and Girardin, who rely on static mea- sures of inclusion and limit their sample to Eurasia and north Africa.62 politicAlly relevAnt ethnic groups We define ethnicity as any subjectively experienced sense of commonal- ity based on the belief in common ancestry and shared culture.63 Differ- 58 the coding of transborder links among groups represented in epr is in progress. based on the greg data set, cederman, Girardin and Gleditsch 2009 find a size-dependent kin effect within Eur- asia. For a more general treatment of transnational factors of civil wars, see salehyan 2009. 59 the epr data set, which can be downloaded from http://dvn-iq.harvard.edu/dvn.dv/epr, is de- scribed fully with complete coding rules in min, cederman, and Wimmer 2009 and in an online appen- dix. the data set includes politically relevant ethnic groups in all 155 sovereign states with a population of at least one million and a surface area of at least five thousand square kilometers as of 2005. 60 the process of contacting and interacting with country experts took almost two years. once sufficient coding responses were available, workshops were held to decide on the final coding. We discussed each coding in light of comments from the experts present, as well as of information from additional data sources and the accumulating comparative knowledge of the project team itself. 61 the main reason for this methodological decision is that governmental and rebel organizations are much more prone to change (for example, through processes of fusion, fission, exit, and entry) than politically relevant ethnic groups, requiring more intricate organization-level data than are currently available (but see the preliminary efforts currently under way at mAr). recently efforts have been made to code nonstate actors in civil wars, but in such cases the focus is on rebel organizations and thus excludes political organizations in nonconflict cases; see, for example, cunningham, Gleditsch, and salehyan 2009. 62 cederman and Girardin 2007; buhaug, cederman, and rød 2008; though see cederman, bu- haug, and rød 2009 for a global analysis. 63 Weber 1978, 385–98. the following definition of ethnicity relies on Wimmer 2008. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

We classify an ethnic group as politically relevant if at least one political organization claims to rep- resent it in national politics or if its members are subjected to state-led political discrimination.65 Discrimination is defined as political exclu- sion directly targeted at an ethnic community—thus disregarding indi- rect discrimination based, for example, on educational disadvantage or discrimination in the labour or credit markets. the coding rules allow for the identification of countries or specific periods in which national politics was framed in nonethnic terms.66 to capture temporal changes in the set of politically relevant groups and their access to political power, the sample period from 1946 to 2005 was divided into subperiods, for which separate codings were provided. the next important step was to code the degree of access to power by the political leaders representing these various ethnic communities. coding Access to power the power-access coding is limited to executive power only.67 Depend- ing on a given country’s power constellations, executive power amounts to control over the presidency, the cabinet, and senior posts in the ad- ministration, including the army. Experts were encouraged to capture the most relevant dimension (for example, in a military dictatorship, power over the army, and in presidential systems, the presidency, and so on). We were interested primarily in major power shifts rather than day-to-day reorganizations of cabinets, limiting ourselves to absolute access to power irrespective of demographic underrepresentation or overrepresentation. All politically relevant ethnic groups were categorized according to (1) whether those who claimed to represent a group’s interest held full control of the executive branch with no meaningful participation 64 We thus include ethnolinguistic, ethnosomatic (or “racial”), and ethnoreligious groups in our definition of ethnicity, but we exclude tribes and clans that define community in genealogical terms, as well as regions that do not define commonality on the basis of shared ancestry. 65 it should be noted that political relevance does not equal violent conflict. Endogeneity is not a problem because only a tiny fraction of years with mobilized or discriminated groups were character- ized by conflict (0.45 percent); cf. posner 2004. 66 We did not distinguish between degrees of representativity of political actors who claim to speak in the name of an ethnic group; nor did we code the heterogeneity of political positions voiced by leaders claiming to represent the same community. cf. brubaker 2004. 67 this choice was made in order to limit the coding effort. legislative politics may also influence the likelihood of conflict through ethnic political parties and specific types of electoral institutions; see, for example, cohen 1997; brancati 2006; and birnir 2007. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Within each of these categories, coders were asked to differentiate between further subtypes. Absolute power in this case, the political elites that claim to represent an ethnic group do not significantly share power with other political leaders. there are two possibilities: —Monopoly. Elite members hold monopoly power in the executive to the exclusion of members other ethnic groups. —Dominance. Elite members of the group hold dominant power in the executive but there is some limited inclusion of “token” members of other groups. power-shAring regimes by power sharing, we mean any formal or informal arrangement that divides executive power among leaders who claim to represent particu- lar ethnic groups. Depending on the relative importance of the posi- tions controlled by group representatives, there are two possibilities: —Senior Partner. representatives participate as senior in a formal or informal power-sharing arrangement. —Junior Partner. representatives participate as junior partners in government. exclusion from centrAl power Finally, if political leaders who claim to represent a particular ethnic category are excluded from participation in central government, we dis- tinguish between four possibilities: —Regional Autonomy. Elite members of the group have no central power but some influence at the substate level, that is, one level below the central government. this may be the substate, the provincial, or the district (though not the local) level, depending on the vertical organiza- tion of the state. —Separatist Autonomy. A related case is when local governments controlled by representatives of an ethnic category have declared their territory to be independent from the central government. this category differs fundamentally from “regional autonomy” in that group represen- tatives have often excluded themselves from central state power. —Powerless. Elite representatives hold no political power at either the national or the regional level without being explicitly discriminated against. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Group members are subjected to active, inten- tional, and targeted discrimination, with the intent of excluding them from both regional and national power. such active discrimination can be either formal or informal. 68 conflict coding our coding of conflict is based upon the ucdp/prio Armed conflicts Dataset, which defines internal conflict as any armed and organized confrontation between government troops and rebel organizations or between army factions that reaches an annual battle death threshold of twenty-five.69 this definition excludes one-sided conflicts, such as massacres and genocides, as well as communal riots, pogroms, and other nonstate conflicts.70 For each conflict, we coded whether actors pursued ethnonationalist aims and whether they pursued secessionist objectives: Ethnic/Nonethnic Conflicts were distinguished by the aims of the armed organization on the one hand and their recruitment and alliance structures on the other hand. Ethnic aims include self-determination, more influence for one’s group over government, autonomy, and language and other cultural rights. regarding recruitment and alliance structures, we defined eth- nic wars as fought by armed organizations who predominantly recruit fighters among their leaders’ own ethnic group and who forge alliances on the basis of ethnic affiliation. For a conflict to be classified as ethnic, armed organizations must both explicitly pursue ethnonationalist aims and recruit fighters and forge alliances on the basis of ethnic affiliations. All ethnic conflicts were then linked to the politically relevant eth- nic group in the name of which an armed organization instigated the conflict. We looked at the aims and recruitment patterns of each armed organization separately. in some complex cases (as in Afghanistan, burma, chad, uganda, Angola, and Zaire), we disaggregated a conflict into several war fronts when different ethnic claims were made on the nongovernmental side. this was also necessary when the constellation of rebel organizations and the ethnic communities they represented changed dramatically over time.71 our data set includes 124 ethnic conflicts fought between 1946 and 2005. Given that some of these ethnic conflicts were fought by more 68 We did not include exclusion of noncitizens from power, as long as these noncitizens hold pass- ports of other states and are effectively able to return to their country of origin. 69 Gleditsch et al. 2002. 70 We drew primarily on version 3-2005b of the Acd data set, which provides two levels of conflict identification, a more general war id number, and a disaggregated sub-id. 71 to avoid endogeneity, the power-access coding always reflects the situation before conflict onset in years that feature both conflict outbreak and power-status changes. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Among these, 27 were fought by groups in power, 87 by power- less or discriminated groups, and 32 by autonomous groups. half of these conflicts reached the standard threshold of civil war (that is, more than one thousand battle deaths in a year). in addition, the data set in- cludes a distinction between secessionist and nonsecessionist conflict, to which we will return in our analysis of elite infighting. vAriAble definitions And dAtA sources Drawing on the epr data set, we test all three hypotheses by measuring power access (h1a,b,c), mobilizational capacity (h2), and prior con- flict (h3) for each politically relevant ethnic group in each year from 1946 to 2005. the Excluded variable is a dichotomous indicator that indicates whether representatives of an ethnic category are discriminated against, are powerless, or have regional or separatist autonomy (h1a). to pres- ent a more nuanced picture, we also use dummy variables referring to specific epr categories, that is, Junior Partner, Regional Autonomy, Sepa- ratist Autonomy, Powerless, and Discriminated. A Downgraded dummy variable identifies whether representatives of a group have experienced a decrease in power status during the previous two years (h1b), based on the epr power-status categories. in our analysis of elite infighting, we add the Underrepresented variable, which indicates whether a junior coalition partner represents a larger ethnic group than a senior partner (h1c). Furthermore, we evaluate group size with the logged variable Group Size, which uses the epr estimate of demographic group size as a pro- portion of the total population of the country’s politically relevant eth- nic groups (h2). in order to test the influence of prior conflict, we use a variable Past Conflict that counts the number of conflicts that have already been fought in the name of the same ethnic group since the beginning of the sample period (h3). Finally, Peace Years counts the number of peaceful years since the last conflict or the beginning of the sample period.72 in order to control for country-level characteristics, we use two con- trol variables throughout the article. based on extensive robustness analysis, hegre and sambanis conclude that variables measuring wealth and population size have a powerful effect on civil war onset.73 there- 72 Following beck, katz, and tucker 1998, this indicator is tested together with three cubic splines. 73 hegre and sambanis 2006. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

While several interpretations have been offered of the effects of income, our theory of ethnic politics expects that richer countries should have less conflict because they can afford to solve political con- flicts through redistribution.74 Although a country’s population size is usually significant in country-level studies of civil war onset, it is less clear what to expect here, especially since its robustness may simply reflect the fact that, all else equal, conflicts are more likely to occur in larger countries. dAtA AnAlysis We are now ready for a first evaluation of our three hypotheses relating to power access, mobilization capacity, and past conflict. the current section introduces statistical models that concern groups in all power- status categories, as well as more specific analysis of insurgencies in the name of excluded groups and infighting among power-sharing part- ners, since some of our causal mechanisms relate to specific actor types only. descriptive AnAlysis our data set is structured in a group-country-year format, with 29,519 unique observations, including all politically relevant ethnic groups. table 1 offers a first empirical assessment of the power-access hypoth- esis, h1. As expected, the frequency of conflict increases roughly with the degree of exclusion. Excluded groups are much more likely to ex- perience a rebellion in their name (0.66 percent) compared with groups in power (0.23 percent). A χ2-test confirms that this relationship is significant at p = 0.0001. With the exception of the category Regional Autonomy, which exhibits relatively less conflict than the power-sharing categories, the table also reveals that the conflict frequency falls steadily with increasing access from executive power. because Separatist Au- tonomy differs from the other excluded categories in that the group has chosen to “exclude itself ” from central state power, we list these at the end of the exclusion category.75 74 Wimmer, cederman, and min 2009; cf. sambanis 2004. 75 because all separatist groups get involved in violence at some point, the coding of regional versus separatist autonomy was verified case by case. removing the separatist cases from the data set makes no difference to our other findings. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

AnAlysis of All groups our main results are presented in table 2. using group-years as the unit of analysis, our analysis begins by including all politically relevant groups, except those that enjoyed monopoly or Dominant status and by definition could not be associated with conflict against the state (see the first two columns). in order to operationalize the basic power ac- cess hypothesis, h1a, model 1 uses the Excluded dummy variable to identify those groups that have no access to central power. based on this dichotomization, it is clear that rebellions in the name of excluded groups are much more likely than conflict in the name of included groups, thus supporting h1a. the Downgraded measure, which tests hypothesis h1b, is also strongly confirmed in this analysis. in this case, the corresponding binary variable has an even stronger effect than the static exclusion measure. turning to the test of the mobilization capac- ity hypothesis, h2, we also find solid evidence that, ceteris paribus, tAble 1 ethnic groups’ conflict propensity by cAtegory of power Access Group Years Years of Ethnic-Conflict Onset included Groups 11,622 27 0.23% monopolya 1,672 n/a n/a Dominanta 1,709 n/a n/a senior partner 2,884 9 0.31% Junior partner 5,357 18 0.34% Excluded Groups 17,897 119 0.66% regional Autonomy 5,433 13 0.24% powerless 7,482 45 0.60% Discriminated 4,506 42 0.93% separatist Autonomy 476 19 3.99% total 29,519 146 0.46% a no rebellion, by definition. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

As a way to compare the marginal effect of our key variables, we plot the difference that our main variables have on predicted conflict probabilities, holding other variables at their mean or modal values. Figure 2 displays the conflict propensities associated with included and excluded groups as a function of gdp per Capita. For both categories we observe an income effect, with higher risks of violent rebellion in coun- tries with lower incomes, in line with previous findings. however, it is notable that excluded groups across all income levels are three times more likely to initiate conflict against the state as compared with in- cluded groups that enjoy representation at the center. the substantive effects of exclusion are especially pronounced in poor countries, where the already high baseline risk of violence is compounded for excluded groups. our explanation is that in poor countries governments lack the resources necessary to co-opt leaders of protest movements that fuel resentment because of their exclusion from central government. since the central state is all-decisive in poor countries, groups that lack rep- resentation and are marginalized in the distribution of state resources, government jobs, and public goods may have greater motives to take up arms.76 While not plotted in the figure, our other key variables also have very large effects on the risk of conflict: a downgraded power sta- tus and prior conflict history increases the likelihood of a conflict by 5.3 and 2.4 times respectively in comparison with included groups. in a further effort to investigate h1a, model 2 introduces the more fine-grained power-access categories. it shows that the conflict-inducing impact of exclusion from state power represents more of a continuum than a dichotomy. According to our theory, conflict proneness should decrease gradually as the access of ethnic leaders to state power improves. indeed, this is what we find. the coefficients range from a low and in- significant 0.32 for junior partners up to a highly significant 1.67 for discriminated groups and 3.25 for separatists. the latter category is es- pecially conflict prone, not merely because of high motivation but also because separatism challenges the state to the highest possible degree, given that modern states are built on the principle of territorial sover- eignty. Again, hypotheses h1b, h2, and h3 are powerfully confirmed and the effect of the control variables remains virtually unchanged. 76 cf.

AnAlysis of excluded groups once we restrict our analysis to rebellions in the name of excluded groups, we are able to specify a clear-cut actor constellation based on a center-periphery logic. model 3 in table 2 presents the empirical results of this analysis. Given the focus on excluded groups, we find smaller differences among the power-status categories. however, both Discrim- ination and Separatist Autonomy can be statistically distinguished from the baseline category Regional Autonomy, thus supporting hypothesis h1a. A recent Downgraded power status among these excluded groups increases conflict propensity significantly, in line with h1b. compared with the general analysis, we find even more unambiguous evidence that large groups are more likely to experience conflict (h2). the in- fluence of Prior Conflict remains significant (h3). Finally, the control variables behave similarly to the results noted in models 1 and 2. figure 2 the effect of gdp per cApitA on ethnic groups’ conflict propensity a a shaded areas represent 95 percent confidence intervals. 5 10 20 30 GDp per capita in lagged 2000 Dollars (’000s) log scale pr ob ab ili ty o f E th ni c c on fli ct o ns et .01 .008 .006 .004 .002 0 Excluded Groups included Groups ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

AnAlysis of included groups Finally, we shift our attention from excluded to included groups. here we consider only cases of power sharing, that is, those that involve se- nior and junior partners of governing coalitions, because monopoly and dominant groups are directly identified with the government and thus by definition cannot challenge it. our goal therefore is to understand why some power-sharing partners initiate conflict against a govern- ment in which they are represented. Following our hypothesis h1b and h1c, we expect that underrepresented power-sharing partners as well as those who have experienced a downgrading in their power posi- tion will be more likely to take up arms against other members of the governing coalition. before discussing results, a cautionary remark is in order. As indi- cated in table 1, there are very few cases of conflict instigated in the name of groups in power, only 27 onsets in 8,241 group-years. this means that the results of the statistical evaluation are likely to be sensi- tive to the coding of this small number of conflict events. With this caveat in mind, we turn to model 4 in table 2. the results indicate that conflicts in the name of junior partner groups are not more frequent than those fought in the name of senior partners (h1a). however, the regression analysis suggests that a downgraded power status has an im- pact on conflict behavior, thus confirming h1b. We also get strong results for hypothesis h1c that relate to resentment caused by under- representation within governing coalitions. Group size has no influence on the dependent variable in contrast to the effect for excluded groups in models 1–3, suggesting that the mobilizational capacity argument does not hold for groups that already have access to the organizational apparatus of government. Furthermore, the path-dependency effect (h3) cannot be confirmed for the current subsample. Finally, we fail to find any significant effect for any of the control variables. Given the rarity of conflict among groups in power, it is appropriate to examine individual cases. in particular, it should be noted that the events influencing the coefficients on downgraded power status (h1b) ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Different organi- zations claim to represent the interests of an ethnic group, and if one organization participates in government, this does not prevent others from taking an oppositional stand to mount a rebellion in the name of “true” group interests. From a theoretical perspective, this outcome is not surprising because it is, after all, parties and their representatives that participate in government rather than ethnic groups. 77 baruah 1994. 78 chima 1994. 79 lund 2005. figure 3 the effect of excluded ethnic groups’ size on their conflict propensity a a shaded areas represent 95 percent confidence intervals. 0 20 40 60 80 100 size of Group (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 size of Group (%) pr ob ab ili ty o f E th ni c c on fli ct o ns et pr ob ab ili ty o f E th ni c c on fli ct o ns et Excluded a nd prior confl ict Exclud ed and Down graded Excluded Excluded .15 .1 .05 0 .15 .1 .05 0 ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

We find only two instances of conflicts within two years of a downgraded power status. After a long period of dominance by president Eyadéma, who favored his own kabré group in togo’s army and administration, he came under pressure to democ- ratize and had to agree to power sharing in 1991. Despite their status as senior partner, he and his entourage in the army became unhappy with the power-sharing arrangement and launched a coup later that same year. meanwhile, the 1984 coup in cameroon can be seen as a reaction to the shift of power from the Fulani-dominated regime of president Ahidjo to the government of biya, a beti politician.82 regarding conflicts driven by underrepresentation within the gov- erning coalition (h1c), the data point us to three potential cases, namely, the sara 1991 rebellion in chad, the hutu 1991 uprising in burundi, and shiite participation in the lebanese civil war in 1975. rather than being directly motivated by underrepresentation, the first of these three conflicts appears to be more related to long-term frustrations felt by the sara, who had dominated the state’s early history from indepen- dence in 1960 through 1978,83 and thus is in line with the downgrad- ing hypothesis (h1b).84 in the other two events, however, the conflict is indeed related to the underrepresentation mechanism. in 1991 reb- els who claimed to represent the hutu majority launched an armed struggle against the tutsi-dominated power-sharing arrangement.85 in lebanon, the shiite political elite were increasingly resentful that the maronites were overrepresented in the traditional consociational 80 kalyvas and sambanis 2005. 81 Wimmer, cederman, and min 2009. 82 mehler 1993. 83 Decalo 1980. 84 the Downgraded variable does not pick up this case because it is based on a two-year window. 85 lemarchand 1994. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

A similar argument can be made with respect to the failure of the power-sharing arrangement in lebanon in 1975, because shiite and sunni leaders had already mobilized their constituencies in the conflict against the maronite elite in 1958. in all three cases the past conflict variable thus picks up meaningful histori- cal processes. to sum up, the historical evidence in support of model 4 is strong, although the results are driven exclusively by nonsecessionist conflicts. the hypotheses relating to the downgrading and underrepresentation mechanisms (h1b,c) are tentatively supported by a case-by-case in- spection of the nonsecessionist cases of elite infighting. sensitivity AnAlysis table 3 presents robustness checks of our primary findings based on model 1 of table 2. We start by considering the robustness of model 1 to the inclusion of dummy variables that divide countries into six world regions, using the Western states as the reference category (see model 5). the regional coefficients for north Africa and the middle East, sub-saharan Africa, and Asia are positive and significant at the p = 0.10 level. more important, we do not detect any major differences in the effect of our main explanatory variables: exclusion, downgraded, group size, and conflict history remain powerful even after controlling for differences across world regions (see hypotheses 1–3). in contrast, the gdp variable loses some of its impact and is now significant at the p = 0.053 level. to further control for local-level factors, we introduce a model with country fixed effects (see model 6), allowing the constant to vary in- dependently for each state in which an ethnic conflict has occurred. this design captures time-invariant country-specific features that are not captured by our independent variables. the results confirm the ro- bustness of our main hypotheses, except h3.

For example, varying the two-year window used to calculate the Downgraded variable to one-, three-, four-, or five-year windows makes no substantive difference for our results. As discussed in the context of elite infighting, the coding of our dependent variable allows us to check whether our findings differ for secessionist and nonsecessionist conflicts. Whereas this is the case for elite infighting, all the main hypotheses hold robustly for seces- sionist and nonsecessionist conflicts fought in the name of excluded groups. Finally, our results are also robust to controls for regime type and time trends (results not shown). Democracies are no less likely than autocracies to experience ethnic conflict, contrary to the expectations of democratic civil peace theory. the relationship between anocracy and ethnic conflict is less clear and depends on whether anocracy is defined using the standard polity scores or based on alternative coding schemes.88 Given the long time frame of our study, we examined the potential effects of temporal and geopolitical trends by adding a cold war dummy, a calendar year variable, and decade fixed effects. none of these variables reduces the statistical or substantive significance of our main findings. conclusion in this article we have investigated the influence of ethnic power in- equality on civil war and found that exclusion and competition along ethnic lines are strongly associated with internal conflict. rather than continuing to debate whether or not ethnic diversity or polarization breeds conflict, quantitative researchers might want to try identifying 88 Vreeland 2008 reports that polity-based codings of regime type are endogenous to civil war and offers corrected regime variables. in our model, anocracies classified using standard polity scores are significantly more conflict prone than other regime types, but the significance disappears when using the Vreeland coding. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Also in keeping with our theoretical expectations, a loss of power in recent history or previous conflict further increases the likelihood of armed conflict. readers who are familiar with the qualitative scholarship on eth- nic conflict may not be surprised that representatives of ethnic groups with less access to power are more likely to challenge the government. however, this finding is far from trivial. indeed, the most widely cited articles in the recent civil war literature contend that ethnic diversity is unrelated to the likelihood of conflict and conclude that ethnicity thus does not matter for understanding war and peace.89 introduc- ing a stark opposition between matters of motivation and legitimacy (“grievances”), on the one hand, and factors related to the military and economic feasibility of insurgencies, on the other hand, these scholars argue that ethnic grievances are too ubiquitous to explain the rare event of civil war. Without denying the relevance of feasibility mechanisms, our findings show that ethnicity should not be discounted as an ex- planatory factor in the study of civil wars. We demonstrate empirically how the logics of contention and mobilization lead ethnically defined actors who are excluded from state power into armed conflict. roughly half of the conflicts fought since the second World War can be linked to this dynamic of ethnopolitical struggle for state power. how do our findings relate to existing research on ethnic conflict? As suggested above, past quantitative tests of how political exclusion and discrimination relate to the propensity of violence have produced con- flicting results. We argue that sample selection and data quality prob- lems are responsible for this inconclusiveness and believe that our new data set on ethnic power relations (epr) represents significant prog- ress by enabling more precise coding of political representation in state governments, including that of dominant majorities or power-sharing partners. since the epr data set is time sensitive, it also permits tracing changes in power access and determining whether such changes affect the conflict dynamic over time. on the basis of this improved data set, we are able to establish an unequivocal relationship between the degree of access to state power and the likelihood of armed rebellion. 89 Fearon and laitin 2003; collier and hoeffler 2004. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 09 99 02 19 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

First, despite our efforts to capture time-sensitive mechanisms, our focus has been mostly on structural conditions rather than on dynamic and strategic processes of contention and mobilization. second, we have not tried to explain changes in power structures and the political relevance of differ- ent ethnic categories but have treated these instead as exogenously given. third, due to limited data availability, we have refrained from analyzing the effects of cross-border relationships between ethnic kin, settlement patterns, and institutional factors relating to party systems and electoral institutions. indeed, this study is written as an invitation to fill these gaps by collecting more precise data on ethnic organizations, their mo- bilizational capacities and power resources, and their interactions with each other as well as with nonethnic organizations and governmental actors, inside or across state borders. ideally, such data would make it possible to develop a fully processual theory that will allow us to ana- lyze ethnic conflicts as a specific conjuncture in the ongoing struggle over state power between dynamically evolving sets of actors. references Anderson, benedict. 1991.
