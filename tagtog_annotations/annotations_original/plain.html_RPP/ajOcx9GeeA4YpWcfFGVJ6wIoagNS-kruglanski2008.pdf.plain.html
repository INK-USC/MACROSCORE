Kruglanski1 and Antonio Pierro2 1University of Maryland, College Park, and 2University of Rome ‘‘La Sapienza’’ ABSTRACT—A study examined the relation between indi- viduals’ circadian rhythm and their tendency to exhibit transference effects in social perception. Individuals tested at times of circadian mismatch (i.e., morning persons tested in the evening and evening persons tested in the morning) exhibited more pronounced transference effects than individuals tested at times of circadian match (i.e., morning persons tested in the morning and evening per- sons tested in the evening). These findings are compatible with the notion that transference effects represent every- day social-cognitive functioning related to activation of social schemata. Additionally, however, they suggest that transference effects are not the inevitable consequence of activating the significant other’s schema. Rather, such ef- fects might be particularly likely to occur when an indi- vidual’s mental resources are limited, as might be the case during circadian mismatches. This latter suggestion dif- fers from psychodynamic views of transference as exclu- sively a driven, energy-intensive phenomenon. The phenomenon of transference has been hailed as funda- mental to the process of dynamic psychotherapy (Ehrenreich, 1989; Freud, 1912/1958; Greenberg &amp; Mitchell, 1983; Horney, 1939, 1945; Luborsky &amp; Crits-Christoph, 1990; Sullivan, 1940, 1953). In Studies on Hysteria, Freud (1895/1955) depicted transference as uniquely tied to the analyst-patient relationship, reflecting amorous feelings that the patient may harbor toward the analyst and involving a transposition of affect from the patient’s old relationship onto the current relationship with the therapist. For Freud (e.g., 1910/1957, 1914/1958), transference represented a neurosis based on a mesalliance (false connection) between the patient’s memories of a past rela- tionship and the therapeutic context. Specifically, the content of a past wish was inappropriately linked with the person of the analyst. ‘‘As a result of this mesalliance . . . the same affect is produced which had forced the patient long before to repudiate the forbidden wish’’ (Freud, 1895/1955, p. 303). Transference neurosis, as Freud (1914/1958) labeled it, was considered an important ingredient of the psychoanalytic cure. Through the energy of the transferred affects, the patient was thought to remember forgotten, unconscious mental attitudes. At the same time, transference was also thought to reflect a powerful resistance to treatment (Freud, 1912/1958); that is, transforming the therapeutic relationship into one of personal affective in- volvement with the analyst was viewed as a means to escape the arduous and aversive process of analytic ‘‘working through.’’ Clinical views of transference have typically portrayed it as a forceful phenomenon likely to require considerable investment of mental resources. Whether representing a misguided chan- neling of libido (Freud, 1912/1958, p. 100), resistance to treat- ment (Freud, 1912/1958, p. 101), or the need for tenderness and connectedness with the other (Sullivan, 1953), the transference experience has generally been depicted as highly energetic and intense. For Jung (1968/1975), transference ‘‘intensity conforms to the significance of content projected. A strong [and] violent transference corresponds to a burning content: it contains something of importance, something of big value for the patient’’ (pp. 142–143). A very different, social-cognitive, interpretation of transfer- ence has been offered by Andersen and her colleagues (e.g., Andersen &amp; Berk, 1998; Andersen &amp; Chen, 2002; Andersen &amp; Cole, 1990). In their analysis, the transference phenome- non transcends the therapeutic context, and constitutes part and parcel of everyday social perception. Much like stereotypes, social categories, or schemata, mental representations of sig- nificant others may be activated from memory and applied to newly encountered individuals who resemble those significant others in some ways. In the same way that early behavioral information may activate a general person schema (e.g., of a Address correspondence to Arie W.

PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 296 Volume 19—Number 3Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at FRESNO PACIFIC UNIV on January 4, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from ‘‘kind,’’ ‘‘hostile,’’ or ‘‘honest’’ individual) and information about a social-category membership may activate a general stereotype (e.g., of an Asian, a woman, or a college professor), information about a new individual’s similarity to one’s significant other may activate the significant-other schema (e.g., a schema of one’s spouse or of a close friend). That schema may then be used to make further (often inaccurate) inferences about the newly en- countered person. In their program of research, Anderson and her colleagues have shown that ‘‘people use significant-other representations [to make] representation-consistent inferences about a newly encountered individual, . . . misremembering him or her in terms of qualities that he or she does not have, but rather are part of the significant-other representation’’ (Andersen &amp; Berk, 1998, p. 82). In Andersen’s conceptual paradigm, similarity of the new target to the significant other is of critical importance and has been operationally defined by the proportion of de- scriptors about the new target contained also in the significant other’s representation. In a typical study of this genre, partici- pants describe a significant other, read a description of a person who does or does not resemble their significant other (similarity condition vs. nonsimilarity condition), and then perform a rec- ognition memory task in which they rate their confidence that various statements were included in that description of the target person. The degree of transference is then inferred from the degree to which participants in the similarity condition falsely remember statements consistent with the significant other’s description more often than do participants in the non- similarity condition (e.g., Andersen, Glassman, Chen, &amp; Cole, 1995). In research by Andersen and her colleagues, transference is considered the immediate consequence of activation of the significant-other schema by features of the newly encountered person. But it is of interest to ask whether the occurrence of transference is invariable, or whether instead it may depend on the perceiver’s mental resources. Social-cognitive theory draws a relevant distinction between schema activation and schema use (cf. Higgins, 1996). An activated schema may or may not govern the perceiver’s impressions, depending on whether the perceiver possesses the necessary cognitive and motivational resources to go beyond the activated schema and seek further information pertinent to the requisite judgment (Brewer, 1988; Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990; Kruglanski, Pierro, Mannetti, Erb, &amp; Chun, 2007; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986). For instance, persuasion research has shown that the likelihood of an early ‘‘peripheral cue,’’ or heuristic, affecting attitudes in- creases when a resource-draining distraction is present (Petty, Wells, &amp; Brock, 1976), when cognitive load is present, or when processing motivation is low (Kruglanski et al., 2007; Pierro, Mannetti, Erb, Spiegel, &amp; Kruglanski, 2005). Social-categoriza- tion research has demonstrated that the likelihood of an indi- vidual basing impressions on activated race, gender, or age stereotypes increases if he or she lacks sufficient cognitive and motivational resources to continue processing less readily avail- able individuating information (Bodenhausen, 1990; Brewer, 1988; Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990). Thus, if transference is a special case of schema utilization, it too should be particularly pro- nounced under conditions in which the individual’s processing resources are meager. From this perspective, there appears to be an intriguing contrast between the social-cognitive view of transference and the prior psychodynamic conceptions. As noted earlier, the psychodynamic interpretation depicts transference as an intense, resource-demanding process. To the contrary, our sociocognitive analysis suggests that transference is more likely to occur when the individual’s energy resources are low, rather than abundant. In the present study, we operationally defined the amount of resources available to the individual in terms of the individual’s circadian cycle. It has long been recognized that some people prefer daytime activity (i.e., may be referred to colloquially as morning types), whereas others prefer nighttime activity (i.e., may be referred to as evening types; Freeman &amp; Hovland, 1934; Kleitman, 1939; Smith, Reilly, &amp; Midkiff, 1989). Many biolog- ical variables show a definite periodicity within a cycle length of 24 hr; these cyclical processes, called circadian rhythms, include body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and hormone levels. Through their effects on processing resources, circadian rhythmsmay influence social perceivers’ propensity to stereotype other individuals. In a study supporting this hy- pothesis, Bodenhausen (1990) demonstrated that subjects ex- hibited stereotypic biases in their judgment to a significantly greater extent at a nonoptimal time of day (i.e., in the morning for evening types and in the evening for morning types) than at an optimal time of day (i.e., in the evening for evening types and in the morning for morning types). In other words, stereo- typing was greater when individuals performed the task at the low point in their circadian cycle, which we refer to as a cir- cadianmismatch, than when they performed the task at the high point of their circadian cycle, which we refer to as a circadian match. The present research extended this logic to transference. We reasoned that if, essentially, transference reflects the misap- plication of an activated significant-other schema to a newly encountered individual, and if an activated schema is more likely to be misapplied in the absence, rather than the presence, of processing resources, then more pronounced transference effects should be observed under conditions of circadian mis- match than under conditions of circadian match. To investigate this possibility, we examined individuals characterized as morn- ing types or evening types both in the morning and in the evening. Additionally, we manipulated a new target person’s similarity to a significant other’s representation previously fur- nished by each participant. We hypothesized that participants’ tendency to falsely generalize the representation of their sig- nificant other to a similar new target would be more pronounced for morning types tested in the evening rather than the morning, Volume 19—Number 3 297 Arie W. Kruglanski and Antonio Pierro at FRESNO PACIFIC UNIV on January 4, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from and for evening types tested in the morning rather than the evening. METHOD Participants and Design Participants were 42 (30 female, 12 male) undergraduate stu- dents (mean age5 19 years) currently enrolled in a psychology course at The University of Rome ‘‘La Sapienza.’’ Following the procedure devised by Andersen and her colleagues (e.g., An- dersen &amp; Cole, 1990), the experiment proceeded in two phases for which participants received separate credits. During the first phase, participants completed the morningness scale described in the next section. Then, they carried out a feature-listing task. In the second phase, which occurred 2 weeks later, participants performed a learning trial and a recognition memory task. In this phase, participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (similarity present vs. similarity absent)  2 (circadian match vs. mis- match) research design. Phase 1 Assessing Morningness In the first phase of our study, morningness was assessed using an instrument developed by Smith et al. (1989). This 13-item composite scale distills the best items from two commonly known morningness scales, ones developed by Horne and Ost- berg (1976) and by Torsvall and Akerstedt (1980). A sample item is, ‘‘One hears about morning and evening types of people. Which one of these types do you consider yourself to be?’’ Re- sponses to this question are made on the following scale: 1 5 definitely an evening type, 25 more an evening than a morning type, 35 more a morning than an evening type, 45 definitely a morning type. A composite morningness score is computed by summing the participant’s responses to the items. Scores range from 13 (extreme evening type) to 55 (extreme morning type). Previous studies (e.g., Guthrie, Ash, &amp; Bendapudi, 1995) re- ported a reliability of .90 for this particular scale. In the present sample, reliability of the scale was satisfactory (a 5 .74). Feature-Listing Task Participants were asked to name, visualize, and describe a current or past significant other (i.e., a person ‘‘who is very important to them and has been for many years’’; Anderson &amp; Cole, 1990, p. 387). In order to do so, they generated a list of 20 descriptor statements (beginning with the prompt, ‘‘Generally, [name of person] ______________’’; cf. Andersen &amp; Baum, 1994) that uniquely characterized their significant other and distinguished him or her from other people. Participants sub- sequently rank-ordered the statements in order of importance or centrality as characterizing that person. They were then asked to select 12 traits that were either neutral or irrelevant to the person they visualized (‘‘neutral’’ was defined to imply neither a positive nor a negative valence). These traits were used in Phase 2 as filler items presented along with the target descriptors. After completing these tasks, participants were thanked for their participation and asked to sign up for an ostensibly unrelated study. Phase 2 Learning Trial and Recognition Memory Task Participants who showed up to take part in the ‘‘unrelated’’ study had been previously categorized as morning types or as evening types on the basis of a median split of the scores on the morn- ingness scale in Phase 1. They were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: match (i.e., those who participated in Phase 2 at the high point of their circadian cycle) and mismatch (i.e., those who participated at the low point of their circadian cycle). Match participants were defined as morning types at a morning session (8–9 a.m.) and as evening types at an evening session (7–8 p.m.). Nonmatch participants were defined as morning types at an evening session and as evening types at a morning session. Following their random assignment to the match or mismatch condition, participants were asked to appear for the study at designated times corresponding to their condition, and they all did so. When participants arrived at the designated session, 2 weeks following Phase 1, they were randomly assigned to the similar or the nonsimilar condition. In both conditions, participants were advised that they would perform a task with another person and that their interaction would be observed. Participants were further told that we would first give them information charac- terizing this other person, as we were interested in how having this information would affect the interaction. They were then given 3 min to study the information about their future inter- action partner. This constituted the learning trial. In the similar condition, the new individual was described using eight idiographic significant-other descriptors (those ranked 4–11 in Phase 1; those ranked 1–3 and 12–16 were later used to measure transference of the significant other’s charac- teristics) and six filler descriptors from the neutral list the par- ticipant generated in Phase 1. In the nonsimilar condition, the new individual was described using descriptors from another participant randomly selected without replacement. At that point, participants performed a recognition memory task in which 15 randomly ordered descriptor sentences were presented. They were told to indicate how many of these sen- tences had been included among the previously provided de- scriptions of the new person. Each descriptor sentence was evaluated on a scale ranging from 1 (I am confident that this descriptor was not presented ) to 4 (I am confident that this de- scriptor was presented ). Four of the descriptor sentences had actually been presented to the participant during the learning trial (2 significant-other descriptors and 2 filler items). Eight of the 11 remaining descriptors were the significant-other de- 298 Volume 19—Number 3 Circadian Mismatches and the Transference Effect at FRESNO PACIFIC UNIV on January 4, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from scriptors ranked 1 through 3 and 12 through 16 by that partici- pant. These 8 representation-consistent descriptors were used to determine whether transference occurred and whether the par- ticipant went beyond the information actually given about the target. Three descriptor items from the neutral-irrelevant list were also included, as filler items. Following prior transference studies, we computed the false alarm rate, a measure of recognition memory, as an indicator of transference. In this paradigm, the false alarm rate is the like- lihood of erroneously recognizing the similar (but not presented) descriptors, and it is operationally defined as the number of ‘‘yes’’ responses to new (i.e., not previously presented) experi- mental items. The false alarm rate is the primary indicator of transference of the old mental representation to the new person (Andersen &amp; Cole, 1990). Higher scores on this index represent a greater extent of transference. Manipulation Checks After the recognition memory task, participants indicated how similar the individual in Phase 2 seemed to the significant other they themselves had described in Phase 1, providing a rating on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all similar) to 9 (extremely similar). Participants also responded to two items intended to assess their perceived mental capacity at the time during which they were tested: ‘‘At this time it is difficult for me to carefully consider my answers to these questions,’’ and ‘‘At this time I feel mentally fatigued.’’ Responses to these questions were recorded on 7-point scales ranging from 1 (extremely false) to 7 (extremely true). These responses were highly intercorrelated, so we com- puted a composite score for perceived cognitive capacity by averaging the two responses (a5 .91). Finally, participants were thanked and fully debriefed. RESULTS Manipulation Check Perceived Similarity Results of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on participants’ similarity ratings yielded a significant effect of similarity condition, F(1, 40) 5 7.35, p &lt; .01. Perceived re- semblance between the future interaction partner and the sig- nificant other was greater in the similar condition (M5 5.0) than in the nonsimilar condition (M 5 3.91). This result indicates that our manipulation was successful. Perceived Cognitive Capacity Results of a one-way ANOVA performed on participants’ ratings of cognitive capacity yielded a significant effect of circadian matching, F(1, 40) 5 4.23, p &lt; .05, with lower perceived ca- pacity in the mismatch condition (M5 3.98) than in the match condition (M5 3.00). Again, this result attests to the efficacy of our manipulation. Transference A 2 (similarity condition: similar vs. nonsimilar) 2 (circadian matching: match vs. mismatch) ANOVA performed on the false alarm rate yielded a significant main effect of similarity condi- tion, F(1, 38)5 4.06, p&lt; .05. This finding was in the predicted direction, attesting to a greater degree of transference in the similar than in the nonsimilar condition, and replicates in an Italian context the findings of Andersen and her colleagues (e.g., Andersen &amp; Berk, 1998; Andersen &amp; Chen, 2002; Andersen &amp; Cole, 1990). Of greater importance, the hypothesized two-way interaction between similarity condition and circadianmatching was significant, F(1, 38) 5 9.47, p &lt; .01. The pertinent means are displayed in Figure 1. Simple tests on the patterns of the means underlying this in- teraction corroborated our predictions. In the mismatch condi- tion, the difference between the similar and nonsimilar conditions was significant, F(1, 19) 5 16.63, p &lt; .001, Msimilar 5 2.83, Mnonsimilar 5 1.81, whereas in the match condition, this differ- ence was nonsignificant, F(1, 19) 5 0.46, n.s., Msimilar 5 2.04, Mnonsimilar5 2.25. These results are consistent with the notion that transference effects are more pronounced during circadian mis- matches than during circadian matches. To check whether the effects of circadian matching were similar for morning and evening types, we included the morn- ingness factor in a 2 (similarity condition: similar vs. nonsimilar)  2 (circadian matching: match vs. mismatch)  2 (morning- ness: morning vs. evening type) ANOVA. The analysis yielded no two- or three-way interaction effects involving morningness, indicating that effects of circadian matching were similar for morning and evening types. In addition, results of two 2 (similarity condition: similar vs. nonsimilar)  2 (circadian matching: match vs. mismatch) ANOVAs performed separately for morning and evening types confirmed that the two-way interaction between similarity and circadian matching was similar for morning types, F(1, 14)5 3.52, p&lt; .08, and evening types, F(1, 20) 5 4.73, p &lt; .04. 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Match F al se A la rm s Mismatch Circadian Matching Nonsimilar Similar Fig. 1.

Kruglanski and Antonio Pierro at FRESNO PACIFIC UNIV on January 4, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from Andersen and Cole (1990) found that false alarm rates varied as a function of the descriptors’ prototypicality. Thus, we examined feature prototypicality in our data following the procedure of Andersen and Cole (1990, p. 395). We classified representation-consistent recognition-test items as highly pro- totypical (ranks 1–3) or moderately prototypical (ranks 12–16) and included this factor in a 2 (similarity condition: similar vs. nonsimilar)  2 (circadian matching: match vs. mismatch)  2 (prototypicality: highly vs. moderately prototypical) ANOVA. The analysis confirmed the significant main effect of similarity condition and the two-way interaction of similarity condi- tion and circadian matching reported earlier. In addition, the analysis yielded a significant main effect of prototypicality, F(1, 38) 5 4.97, p &lt; .03, with the false alarm rate being more pronounced for highly prototypical features (M5 2.36) than for moderately prototypical features (M 5 2.14), confirming An- dersen and Cole’s (1990) results. The analysis also yielded a two-way interaction of prototypicality and similarity condition, F(1, 38)5 5.93, p&lt; .02, with the difference in false alarm rates between these conditions being more pronounced for highly prototypical features (Msimilar5 2.73,Mnonsimilar5 2.01) than for moderately prototypical features (Msimilar 5 2.25, Mnonsimilar 5 2.04). Neither the two-way interaction between prototypicality and matching, F(1, 38) 5 1.47, n.s., nor the three-way inter- action of prototypicality, similarity condition, and matching, F(1, 38)5 0.08, n.s., was significant; thus, the effect of matching on transference was present for all descriptors. DISCUSSION The present results are consistent with the sociocognitive anal- ysis of the transference phenomenon as a special case of schema utilization. According to this interpretation, social schemata of various sorts provide relevant information for social judgments. Some schematamay be quickly activated frommemory by salient cues that may prime them. For instance, cues to an individual’s age, race, or gender are readily available to a perceiver who encounters that person; hence, they may activate the corre- sponding age, race, or gender schemata that provide an initial basis for social judgments. When the perceiver’s cognitive re- sources are sparse, he or she may discontinue further search for information and remain with the initially formed judgment, treating it as final. Such a judgment may be inaccurate when the initial schema provided misleading information inconsistent with available individuating evidence that the perceiver failed to consider. We extend this analysis to the transference phenomenon, assuming that it depends on activation of the significant other’s schema by features that a new target appears to share with the significant other. We assume that such schema activation occurs automatically upon the perceiver’s encounter with the target, and affords a basis for forming an impression about him or her. Where perceivers’ resources are limited, they may accept such impressions uncritically and ‘‘freeze’’ upon them (Kruglanski, 2004). As a result, perceivers may exhibit false memory effects of the kind thought to characterize transference. Our data pro- vide support for this possibility. Specifically, we found that individuals exhibit significantly more pronounced transference effects (as indexed by the false alarm measure) at times of circadian mismatch than at times of circadian match. We also have evidence that circadian mismatches produce greater perceived reduction in mental capability than do circadian matches. This suggests that, as seems to be the case with schema effects more generally, transference effects increase when individuals’ mental re- sources are scarce. The present findings deepen current understanding of trans- ference phenomena in two general senses. First, they cast doubt on the psychodynamic conceptions that emphasized the driven, energy-intensive nature of transference (e.g., Freud, 1912/1958; Sullivan, 1953). We found significant transference effects only under limited-resource conditions, that is, during circadian mismatches. We did not find transference effects during circa- dian matches, when individuals’ mental resources may have allowed them to examine the available information more criti- cally. Second, our results expand understanding of transference from a social-cognition perspective. Whereas prior social-cog- nitive findings may have suggested the inevitability of trans- ference once the significant-other schema has been activated, the present findings suggest that the activated schema may or may not be used, depending on the individual’s processing re- sources. The application or nonapplication of the schema, in turn, has implications for the likelihood of transference. Though the transference effect in the present study disap- peared when participants’ cognitive resources were plentiful (i.e., under circadian-match conditions), this does not imply that the availability of resources eliminates transference invariably. Whether or not it does may depend on the individual’s epistemic motivation. In our study, we assumed that cognitive resources would be utilized to serve the accuracy motivation. How- ever, resources could also be utilized (and in fact mobilized) by a motivation that increases the likelihood of freezing on an automatically activated schema or stereotype, such as the need for nonspecific cognitive closure (Kruglanski, 2004). In a recent set of studies supporting this notion (Pierro, Spina, &amp; Kruglanski, 2007), we found more pronounced transference effects among individuals high in dispositional need for closure than in those low in dispositional need for closure. Conceptually close to motivational forces assumed to be involved in trans- ference effects by psychoanalytic theorists (Freud, 1912/1958; Jung, 1968/1975; Sullivan, 1953), needs for various specific kinds of closure could also enhance transference effects, much as they may enhance freezing on alternative activated schemata. A promising avenue for future research will be to integrate the psychoanalytic and the social-cognitive approaches to under- standing the transference phenomenon. 300 Volume 19—Number 3 Circadian Mismatches and the Transference Effect at FRESNO PACIFIC UNIV on January 4, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from REFERENCES Andersen, S.M., &amp; Baum, A.
