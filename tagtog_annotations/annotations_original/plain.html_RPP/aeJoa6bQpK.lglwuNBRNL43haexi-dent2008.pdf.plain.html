          <p id="s1p1">Age of Acquisition and Word Frequency Effects in Picture Naming: A Dual-Task Investigation Kevin Dent University of Birmingham Robert A. Johnston University of Kent Glyn W. Humphreys University of Birmingham In 2 experiments, the authors explored age of acquisition (AoA) and word frequency (WF) effects in picture naming using the psychological refractory period paradigm. In Experiment 1, participants named a picture and then, a short time later, categorized 1 of 3 possible auditory tones as high, medium, or low. Both AoA (Experiment 1A) and WF (Experiment 1B) effects propagated onto tone discrimination reaction times (RTs), with the effects of AoA being stronger. In Experiment 2, the to-be-named picture followed the auditory tone by a varying interval. As the interval decreased, picture naming RTs increased. The relationship between the interval and AoA (Experiment 2A) was reliably underadditive; AoA effects were eliminated at the shortest interval. In contrast, WF (Experiment 2B) was additive with the effects of the interval. These results demonstrate an empirical dissociation between AoA and WF effects. AoA affects processing stages that precede those that are sensitive to WF. The implications for theories of picture naming are discussed. Keywords: age of acquisition, frequency, psychological refractory period, picture naming Normal adults know the names of many thousands of objects and yet can retrieve the name of a specific object in less than 1 s. In this article, we explore how our experience with objects and their names shapes our naming ability. In particular, we are con- cerned with two distinct kinds of experience: (a) the amount of experience one might have, as measured by the frequency of occurrence of a particular word in print, word frequency (WF), and (b) the time in life of our first experience with a word, its “age of acquisition” (AoA). How do each of these factors influence object name retrieval? Models of Picture Naming The task of naming a picture is deceptively simple, but under close scrutiny, it turns out to be rather complex. Current models hold that picture naming involves several distinct substages, in which qualitatively different forms of long-term knowledge are activated (Caramazza, 1997; Humphreys, Riddoch, &amp; Quinlan, 1988; Levelt, Roelofs, &amp; Meyer, 1999). Figure 1 illustrates a generic model of picture naming. First, an object must be recog- nized perceptually by activating appropriate visual descriptions in visual long-term memory. A stage of object comprehension then follows in which semantic information about an object is made available. Activated semantic knowledge then drives name re- trieval. The active semantic or conceptual content must be mapped onto linguistic units that can be expressed in the language. A single unique individuating label, which best captures the activated se- mantic content, is selected from a lexicon of possibilities; this stage of processing is often termed lexical retrieval. At this level of lexical retrieval, models diverge, with some (e.g. Levelt et al., 1999) maintaining a distinction between two word representa- tions—syntactically specified lemmas and phonologically speci- fied word forms—whereas others are satisfied with a single pho- nological specification (e.g., Caramazza, 1997; Humphreys et al., 1988). Lexical selection is thought to be a competitive process, with multiple lexical entries receiving activation from semantic representations; thus, especially early in processing, multiple can- didate lexical entries may compete for selection (see Levelt et al., 1999; Vitkovitch &amp; Humphreys, 1991). This competitive process of activation is likely to evolve over time as activation is passed within and between semantic and lexical levels of representation, until activation levels stabilize (see Humphreys, Lamote, &amp; Lloyd- Jones, 1995, for a specific example). For most theorists (e.g., Levelt et al., 1999, see also Levelt, 1989), once a semantic– linguistic mapping has been achieved by activating a lemma, this abstract representation must be translated into a specific response. Activation must be passed between the perception and response production architectures. For Levelt et al. (1999), a selection mechanism chooses the most active lemma and allows activation to pass to connected phonological word form representations Kevin Dent and Glyn Humphreys, Behavioural Brain Sciences Centre, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Robert Johnston, Department of Psychology, University of Kent, Kent, United Kingdom.

Once such a phonological representation of the word is activated, the individual constituent phonemes must be retrieved in order to assemble an articulatory response. In the context of such multi- stage models of picture naming, how are we to understand the influence of AoA and WF? WF and AoA: The Behavioral Data Early studies showed that whereas WF had a robust impact on picture naming (Oldfield &amp; Wingfield, 1965), it did not affect a range of other tasks: neither semantic classification (Wingfield, 1967) nor picture–picture or word–picture matching (Wingfield, 1968). More recent data also show that WF does not interact with contour deletion (A. S. Meyer, Sleiderink, &amp; Levelt, 1998). These findings lead naturally to the view that WF specifically affects lexical retrieval rather than earlier prelexical visual and semantic levels of processing (e.g., Griffin &amp; Bock, 1998; Jescheniak, &amp; Levelt, 1994). Unfortunately these earlier studies did not control for AoA. WF and AoA share a natural correlation; words that are high in frequency also tend to be acquired early in life. Barry, Morrison, and Ellis (1997) reported a correlation of .545 between WF and AoA. Carroll and White (1973b) were the first to disentangle the two variables, using regression techniques, and they showed that AoA is a more powerful predictor than WF of object naming latency. Subsequent studies have generated sets of items where AoA and WF are independently varied (Barry, Hirsh, Johnston, &amp; Williams, 2001; Bonin, Fayol, &amp; Chalard, 2001; Lambon Ralph &amp; Ehsan, 2006; Meschyan &amp; Hernandez, 2002). On the whole, in picture naming, AoA effects tend to be much larger than WF effects, and some investigators have failed to find significant WF effects once AoA is controlled. However, it is now widely ac- cepted that both AoA and WF affect picture naming latency (see R. A. Johnston &amp; Barry, 2006; Juhasz, 2005, for reviews, and Brysbaert &amp; Ghyselinck, 2006, for discussion of the relative size of the effects). Until recently, AoA and WF effects were assigned similar loci in the object processing system (Barry et al., 2001; Brown &amp; Watson, 1987; Gilhooly &amp; Watson, 1981). Initially, AoA was found not to influence episodic recognition (Gilhooly &amp; Gilhooly, 1979) or visual recognition thresholds for words (Gilhooly &amp; Logie, 1981). Additionally, negative results were reported for AoA effects on a semantic classification task (Morrison, Ellis, &amp; Quin- lan, 1992). This pattern of findings encouraged the view (e.g., Levelt et al., 1999; Miozzo &amp; Caramazza, 2003) that AoA and WF may be largely interchangeable, with the preferred label being merely a matter of terminological taste. However, more recent work with modern AoA ratings and WF counts have demonstrated AoA effects across a range of tasks not necessarily requiring lexical retrieval: visual duration thresholds for picture recognition (Dent, Catling, &amp; Johnston, 2007), object decisions (Holmes &amp; Ellis, 2006; Moore, Smith-Spark, &amp; Valen- tine, 2004; Vitkovitch &amp; Tyrell, 1995), word–picture matching (Catling &amp; Johnston, 2006a), and semantic decisions (Catling &amp; Johnston, 2006c; R. A. Johnston &amp; Barry, 2005). All of these data are consistent with the idea that AoA may have a rather wide- spread and ubiquitous influence on information processing. Al- though it is true that recent reassessments of the influence of psycholinguistic variables on prelexical levels of processing have been largely restricted to AoA and have neglected WF, the existing behavioral data are consistent with the proposal that AoA effects are more widespread than are WF effects. Whereas AoA seems to influence many stages of processing, WF may have a more re- stricted locus at exclusively lexical levels of name retrieval. The Cumulative Frequency Hypothesis AoA and WF both affect the total amount of experience we have with a word; early acquired and high-frequency words are both likely to be encountered more often over the course of the life span. This leads to the question of whether both effects have a common origin in the cumulative frequency or total number of exposures to a word. Carroll and White (1973b) considered the cumulative frequency hypothesis at the time research into AoA was beginning but rejected it on the basis that a measure of Articulation Phoneme retrieval Phonological word form Lemma Semantic processing Object recognition Early perceptual processing L ex ic al r et ri ev al</p>

A generic model of picture naming, illustrating major stages of processing. 283AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS cumulative frequency (AoA  WF) predicted picture naming time more poorly than did AoA. Subsequently, both Lewis, Gerhand, and Ellis (2001) and Zevin and Seidenberg (2002, 2004) have drawn attention to cumulative frequency as a possible explanation for AoA effects. One important prediction of the cumulative fre- quency hypothesis is that AoA effects should be somewhat larger in older participants, as the difference in cumulative frequency between early and late acquired items should grow as one ages. Two studies (Barry, Johnston, &amp; Wood, 2006; Morrison, Hirsh, Chappell, &amp; Ellis, 2002) both tested and rejected this prediction, by showing equivalent AoA effects in younger and older speakers. Certainly if both WF and AoA are really aspects of cumulative frequency, then the two effects would be expected to have com- mon loci in the word production system. AoA, WF, and Connectionist Models The recent trend for reassessments of the influence of AoA on prelexical processing stems largely from recent demonstrations of AoA effects in simple connectionist models (Ellis &amp; Lambon Ralph, 2000; Lambon Ralph &amp; Ehsan, 2006; Lewis, Chadwick, &amp; Ellis, 2002; Monaghan &amp; Ellis 2002b; Zevin &amp; Seidenberg, 2002, 2004). Simple networks that translate between pairs of patterns show strong order effects such that, because of greater degrees of plasticity early in training, pattern pairs entering training early are learned better than patterns entering later, even when cumulative frequency is controlled (see Ellis &amp; Lambon Ralph, 2000). Such connectionist models provide an integrated account of both AoA and WF effects in which the primary factor determining the relative importance of WF and AoA is the degree of regularity of the translation to be learned. In highly regular rule-governed domains, late-acquired patterns will be able to benefit from the structure laid down by earlier patterns, offsetting the disadvantage of reduced plasticity (Monaghan &amp; Ellis 2002b; Zevin &amp; Seiden- berg, 2002). In general, AoA effects will be reduced as regularity is increased and may even be absent in highly regular domains. Thus, such models predict a dissociation between AoA and WF such that WF effects may prevail without AoA in highly regular domains. In contrast, when the translations to be learned are completely arbitrary, as in picture naming, connectionist models predict effects of both WF and AoA. In fact, in the context of such models, it should be impossible to find effects of AoA without accompanying WF effects. Frequency-Dependent and Frequency-Independent AoA Effects Although the connectionist models described above account for some aspects of the data, they are less adequate in accounting for the absence of frequency effects on prelexical levels of processing. Other problematic data for connectionist models have been noted by Brysbaert and Ghyselinck (2006). For example, whereas AoA and WF tend to be of equal importance for word recognition, AoA effects are substantially more important than WF effects for pic- ture naming. When the same items are compared in picture and word naming contexts, AoA but not WF effects are much larger for picture naming than for word naming (e.g. Chalard, 2002). Ac- cording to Brysbaert and Ghyselinck (2006; see also Ghyselinck, Lewis, &amp; Brysbaert, 2004), connectionist models predict that WF and AoA should be of approximately equal importance regardless of stimulus type. Brysbaert and Ghyselinck (2006) thus proposed frequency-dependent and frequency-independent components of the AoA effect. Only the frequency-dependent component stems from general learning mechanisms, whereas the independent com- ponent stems from another source. Brysbaert and Ghyselinck (2006) suggested that the most likely locus for this frequency- independent AoA effect is at a semantic and/or a lexical (lemma selection) level of processing, where AoA modulates competition for selection between representations. When performance stresses these processes, AoA effects may occur without WF effects. Summary: Views of the AoA WF Relationship It is clear that several distinct views concerning the AoA WF relationship may be delineated. Some authors consider AoA and frequency to be largely interchangeable terms for the same under- lying lexical variable (Levelt et al., 1999; Miozzo &amp; Caramazza, 2003) or to be aspects of cumulative frequency (see Lewis et al., 2001; Zevin &amp; Seidenberg, 2002). Others suppose that WF and AoA effects result from general properties of learning mechanisms (e.g., Ellis &amp; Lambon Ralph, 2000). Models of this type allow for frequency effects without accompanying AoA effects in regular rule-governed domains (Zevin &amp; Seidenberg, 2002) but suggest that it should be difficult to find circumstances in which AoA effects occur without frequency effects. In contrast, yet other authors (Brysbaert &amp; Ghyselinck, 2006) have suggested the exis- tence of WF-independent AoA effects at certain stages of process- ing. Dual-Task Contingencies and the Psychological Refractory Period Paradigm Our principle aim in this study was to examine which stages of picture naming are influenced by AoA and which are influenced by WF, through exploring dual-task contingencies. When two simple stimuli are presented in close temporal succession, and both are used to elicit a motor response, then reaction times (RTs) to the second stimulus are delayed by an increasing amount as the temporal separation of the two stimuli decreases. This phenome- non is referred to as the psychological refractory period (PRP). This basic finding has long been established (e.g., Telford, 1931; Welford, 1952), and a good deal of effort has gone into providing a coherent theoretical account of why and how the PRP arises (see Pashler, 1994; Pashler &amp; Johnston, 1998, for reviews). This basic effect occurs even when the two stimuli are presented in different sensory modalities (e.g., vision and audition) and when responses are made with distinct effectors (e.g., button press and vocal responses; see Ferreira &amp; Pashler, 2002, for an example). When these conditions of nonoverlapping inputs and outputs prevail, there is little competition for relatively peripheral sensory and motor functions. We are concerned with PRP effects that emerge under these conditions. One account of PRP effects was originally developed by Wel- ford (1952, 1980) and elaborated more recently by Pashler (1989): the central bottleneck hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that there are certain processing stages that may not co-occur and therefore constitute a processing bottleneck. The PRP effect occurs because certain stages of a second task are suspended and must 284 DENT, JOHNSTON, AND HUMPHREYS await the completion of bottleneck stages in the first task. Figure 2 illustrates certain essential properties of the central bottleneck hypothesis. In Figure 2, only certain “central” stages of processing must operate serially; other “peripheral” stages may operate as normal and in parallel with any stage of a different task. Perceptual processing in one task may co-occur with any stage of processing in a second task, and similarly, response preparation and execution may operate in parallel with any stage of a second task. This central bottleneck model gives rise to two sets of clear and testable predictions. The first concerns how manipulations of pri- mary task difficulty will affect secondary task performance. Ac- cording to the central bottleneck model, only certain primary task manipulations should have consequences for secondary task per- formance. As illustrated in Figure 3, any manipulation in Task 1 that shifts the point in time at which central processing finishes will also shift the point in time at which central processing in Task 2 may begin, thereby altering Task 2 RT and the duration of the PRP effect. Both directly extending central processing for Task 1 and delaying its onset (by extending perceptual processing) should have consequences for Task 2 RT. McCann and Johnston (1989; cited in Pashler &amp; Johnston, 1998) showed that manipulating the difficulty of “precentral” stimulus processing in a letter identification task (Task 1) also lengthened a Task 2 tone classification task to a similar extent. Smith (1969) lengthened the duration of central processing by varying the num- ber of stimulus–response pairs and found propagation onto a second task. Ferreira and Pashler (2002) recently explored propagation from a primary picture naming task onto a secondary tone classification task. In a first experiment, pictures were presented in a sentence context. Those pictures that were less constrained by the preceding context and those that were lower in WF caused the greatest delays in both picture naming and tone classification RTs. In a second experiment, these authors considered the effects of superimposing irrelevant distractor words over the to-be-named pictures (picture– word interference). Pictures superimposed with semantically re- lated words were named more slowly than those superimposed with semantically unrelated words, and this effect propagated onto Task 2 to lengthen tone classification times. In contrast, a phono- logical relation between picture and word affected only Task 1 (picture naming) and not Task 2 (tone classification). The results of Ferreira and Pashler (2002) clearly demonstrate that not all manipulations of Task 1 difficulty have consequences for Task 2. There must be late peripheral stages of picture naming that proceed in parallel with central stages of processing in an unrelated tone classification task. Furthermore, given that phono- logical facilitation of picture naming is thought to arise at the stage of phoneme retrieval (see Levelt et al., 1999, for a review of supporting evidence), phoneme retrieval must be a postcentral stage of processing. The effects of semantic constraint, semantic modulation of picture word interference, and what Ferreira and Pashler termed WF (note that AoA was not controlled) must all have either central or precentral sites of action. In terms of models of speech production, these variables are likely to affect both semantic activation and lexical selection; thus, these levels of processing must be either central or precentral stages of processing and certainly cannot be postcentral. Additional predictions from the central bottleneck hypothesis concern how different manipulations of Task 2 difficulty affect Task 2 RT. These predictions are illustrated graphically in Figure 4. In the PRP situation, Task 2 central and postcentral processing must wait for the completion of Task 1 central processing. At short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), there is, thus, a discontinuity in Task 2 processing, a period of time during which precentral processing has completed but central processing has yet to com- mence. This period of time may be termed “cognitive slack.” As SOA further decreases, this period of slack increases. At such short SOAs, increases in Task 2 precentral processing duration that are smaller than the duration of the slack do not affect overall Task 2 RT. Under these circumstances, manipulations of Task 2 precen- tral difficulty are said to be absorbed into cognitive slack. The opportunity for such absorption increases as the duration of slack increases at shorter SOAs; thus, manipulations of Task 2 precentral processing are predicted to be underadditive with SOA. In con- trast, increases in the duration of Task 2 central and postcentral processing, occurring after Task 2 resumption, cannot be absorbed into cognitive slack and are predicted to be additive with SOA. These predictions have been confirmed by a number of authors (e.g., De Jong, 1993; Johnston, McCann, &amp; Remington, 1995; Pashler &amp; Johnston, 1989). Thus, manipulations of visual stimulus intensity, which ordinarily lengthen RT, cease to do so when a task is delayed in the PRP paradigm. Furthermore, numerous authors have shown that manipulations of Task 2 central processing, operationalized as response selection difficultly, are not absorbed into slack (see McCann &amp; Johnston, 1992; Pashler &amp; Johnston, 1989; Van Selst &amp; Jolicoeur, 1997). In the context of picture naming only, two studies to date have examined absorption into slack. Lawson, Humphreys, and Jolicoeur (2000) showed that plane rotations of a picture could be absorbed into cognitive slack. Thus, in the context of picture naming, early stages of object recognition are likely to be precentral. More recently, Dell’Acqua, Job, Peressotti, and Pascali (2007) examined the picture–word interference effect. Participants named pictures superimposed with semantically related words more slowly than those superimposed with unrelated words, at long SOAs. This effect of semantic relatedness was absorbed into cognitive slack, such that there was no effect at the shortest SOA. The results of Dell’Acqua et al. Task 1</p>

Stage A represents stimulus perceptual processing; Stage B represents central bottleneck stages; and Stage C represents post-bottleneck response initiation and execution. Because Stage B cannot operate simultaneously on two tasks, reducing stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) creates a delay as Task 2 waits for Stage B to complete in Task 1. 285AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS (2007) are especially interesting, suggesting that even relatively later stages of lexical access may in fact be precentral. Many authors agree that semantic inhibition in the picture–word inter- ference task, is likely to stem from competitive interactions during lexical (lemma) selection (see Levelt et al., 1999, for a review). When items are semantically related, the competition from the lemma activated by the irrelevant word is thought to be stronger. Given that this semantic competition is absorbed into cognitive slack, it must have a precentral locus, placing aspects of lemma retrieval at a precentral site. The Central Limitation? In the earlier PRP studies (e.g., Pashler, 1984, 1989), central processing was held to involve decisional and response selection stages. However, the number of processes that should also be considered central, in the sense that they cannot proceed in parallel with response selection in a simple choice RT task, has proliferated in recent years. Memory retrieval (Carrier &amp; Pashler 1995) and consolidation in STM (Dell’Acqua &amp; Jolicoeur, 2000; Jolicoeur, 1999; Jolicoeur &amp; Dell’Acqua, 1998; see also Jolicoeur, Tombu, Oriet, &amp; Stevanovski, 2002, for a review) both appear to require central processing. Thus, it seems that stages that constitute central bottlenecks may be somewhat general and certainly go beyond response selection. Rather than speaking of a bottleneck, then, certain authors (e.g., J. C. Johnston, McCann, &amp; Remington, 1995) prefer to speak in terms of “central attention” as a more general notion that does not imply a commitment to the idea of a serial stage structure or a strict bottleneck at one stage (see Navon &amp; Miller, 2002, and Tombu &amp; Jolicoeur, 2003, for detailed theoretical treatments). Again, a more radical argument is that there are no inherent capacity limitations in central processing but, rather, Panel A Task 1 baseline A</p>

Stage A represents stimulus perceptual processing; Stage B represents central bottleneck stages; and Stage C represents postbottleneck response initiation and execution. Panel A shows how extending postcentral stages of processing fails to propagate onto a second task. Panel B shows how extending central or precentral processing stages propagates onto a second task. 286 DENT, JOHNSTON, AND HUMPHREYS participants strategically impose bottlenecks in order to avoid interference and to comply with task demands (D. E. Meyer &amp; Kieras, 1997a, 1997b). According to this account, delays may occur at any stage of processing, depending on the fine grain of the temporal relations among tasks. Relevance for the Current Study We note that, although there is disagreement over why, and at what operational stage, processing may be delayed, all of the above approaches assume that differential patterns of delays can arise according to the particular arrangements of tasks. Pragmati- cally, this means that the PRP procedure can be used to try and tease apart how different variables (e.g., AoA and WF) impact on a task, such as picture naming. In particular, we can ask whether a variable operates before picture naming is suspended (on the addition of a second task), whether it lengthens the period of suspension, or whether it occurs after the task is resumed, as the point of suspension will be constant (with the same tasks being used in all cases). This can provide important information about the relations between the variables of interest. Throughout the article, we refer to a version of the central bottleneck model as a convenient framework to illustrate the logic of the experiments and to interpret the findings. We use the terminology of precentral, central, and postcentral to refer to those stages that respectively occur, before, during, or after the operation of a bottleneck requir- ing central attention. The aim of the current study was to assess the relative localiza- tion of WF and AoA effects on picture naming using the PRP procedure. In Experiment 1, we considered whether WF and AoA, when manipulated on a first task, propagate onto RT for a second task (tone classification) or, alternatively, whether the variable arises at such a peripheral stage of processing that it does not propagate. Irrespective of the precise account of the PRP effect, we assumed that only certain Task 1 manipulations would propagate onto Task 2, and those that do not must occur downstream of those that do. In Experiment 2, we presented picture naming as the second task and asked whether either WF or AoA affects process- ing at a sufficiently early stage to enable the effect to be absorbed into cognitive slack. Any variable that shows absorption into cognitive slack must be located upstream of any variable that is additive. The exact cause of such delay is immaterial. Experiment 1: Prioritizing Picture Naming Ferreira and Pashler (2002) reported effects of WF on a sec- ondary tone classification task, yet did not distinguish between WF and AoA. In Experiment 1 we assessed if both AoA and WF effects in a primary picture naming task propagate onto a second- ary tone discrimination task. As discussed above, any such prop- agation must arise from the extension of central or precentral stages of processing in the primary task. In contrast, failing to observe propagation would support a postcentral locus. Partici- pants were presented with two stimuli in rapid succession, first a picture that they had to name (Task 1); then 50, 150, or 900 ms later an auditory tone that they had to classify as high, medium, or low (Task 2). SOA values of 50, 150, and 900 ms were chosen following Ferreira and Pashler (2002), in order to create a range of levels of task overlap. In Experiment 1A, we varied AoA while holding frequency and all other relevant variables constant. In Experiment 1B, we varied WF while holding AoA and all other relevant variables constant. If these two variables both have wide- spread influences on picture processing (Ellis &amp; Lambon Ralph, 2000), then both effects should propagate onto Task 2 RTs. Method Participants In all of the experiments reported participants were staff and students of the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom, who participated in return for course credit or a payment of 3 pounds sterling (approximately 6 U.S. dollars). Experiment 1A. Data from 24 participants were analyzed. Data from an initial 5 participants were discarded and replaced, as more than 30% errors were made in at least one condition. There were 3 male and 21 female participants, of an average age of 19.29 years. Experiment 1B. The data from 36 participants were analyzed. Data were discarded from 2 initial participants who produced more than 30% errors in at least one condition. A third participant was excluded who showed strong evidence of response grouping at longer SOAs (markedly delayed picture naming times at the long- est SOA). A total of 6 male and 30 female participants, of average age 19.70 years, participated. Equipment Pictures were presented on the screen of an e-Mac microcom- puter. Tones were presented over a pair of headphones. A micro- phone (Sony ECM-MS-905), held by a stand in front of and to the right of participants, was used to record vocal responses. A Psy- Scope button box was used to provide accurate timing to the millisecond and to collect button-press responses. PsyScope soft- Task 1</p>

The diagram illustrates how extended precentral processing in Task 2 may be absorbed into the delay created by delaying Task 2. 287AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS ware (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, &amp; Provost, 1993) was used to control the experiment. Stimuli In both Experiments 1 and 2, two sets of critical images were selected from the set assembled by Szekely et al. (2003). The two sets of images varied only on the critical variable of interest while the following variables were held constant: picture–name agree- ment (the extent to which the picture is a good representation of the object in question), name agreement (percentage of participants giving the dominant name for the stimulus), familiarity (the degree to which a participant comes into contact with or thinks about an item), visual complexity, word length (number of letters), and WF (Experiment 1A) or AoA (Experiment 1B). Values for all of these variables, with the exception of WF, were taken from a data set we previously assembled in Birmingham, United Kingdom, which used a set of 31 participants to provide names and ratings under untimed conditions; in all cases, the variables were rated on a 7-point scale, and WFs were based on the lemma frequency taken from the Celex database (Baayen, Piepenbrock, &amp; van Rijn, 1993). We worked with both a combined measure of written and spoken frequency and a measure of written frequency. For the AoA ratings the scale adopted followed that used by Gilhooly and Logie (1980) and was composed of seven age bands, beginning with 0–2 and increasing 2 years at a time to 11–12 years of age, with the oldest response being 13 years or older. There is widespread agreement that AoA ratings collected with this procedure are valid measures of real word learning age (see, Carroll &amp; White, 1973a; Chalard, Bonin, Méot, Boyer, &amp; Fayol, 2003; De Moor, Ghyselinck, &amp; Brysbaert, 2000; Jorm, 1991; Morrison, Chappell, &amp; Ellis, 1997). An additional measure of name agreement, collected under timed conditions with computerized presentation of the stimuli, was obtained from a set of 25 Birmingham University undergraduates, and the current stimuli were also matched with respect to this measure. Tables 1 and 2 provide full details of the characteristics of the sets of items selected. The experimental items were also named after a delay by an independent group of 15 Birmingham University undergraduates (1,250-ms picture presentation, 1,250-ms delay, followed by the response). There was no significant effect of either AoA (409 ms early vs. 413 ms late) or WF (416 ms high vs. 414 ms low) on RTs, either by participants or by items (all Fs  1.3). With a sufficient delay, RTs should not be a reflection of online processing time for the pictures but should only reflect the time needed for (a) the participant to begin articulation given a preselected phonological/ articulatory representation and (b) the time for the voice key to detect the sound (Barry et al., 2001; Ellis &amp; Morrison, 1998). We can thus be confident that our experimental items do not differ either in terms of the difficulty of articulation or their acoustic detectability. In each experiment, there were 60 experimental pictures, 30 in Set A (high frequency or early acquired) and 30 in Set B (low frequency or late acquired). High-frequency pictures had names with Celex lemma frequencies of at least 20, and low-frequency pictures had names with frequencies of 19 or less. Early acquired pictures had AoA ratings of 2.93 and less, and late acquired pictures had ratings of at least 2.97. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests indicated that there were no statistically signifi- cant differences between lists A and B on any of the relevant variables. The names of the pictures used are shown in the Ap- pendix. There was some degree of overlap in terms of the pictures used in each experiment. All pictures were simple black-and-white line drawings, measuring a maximum of 300  300 pixels. Stimuli for the tone task were high-, medium-, and low-pitched pure tones (1,200, 500, and 180 Hz, respectively), 285 ms in duration. Design The two sets of critical images (Sets A and B) were further divided into three distinct lists such that there was no statistically significant difference between lists on any of the relevant variables mentioned above.

Each of the sublists forming Sets A and B were assigned to a particular SOA condition, for each participant. The assignment of sublist to SOA was coun- terbalanced over participants such that, overall, each item appeared in each SOA condition equally often. Procedure Participants were tested individually in a small laboratory in the presence of the experimenter who delivered verbal instructions and recorded picture naming accuracy. Participants were introduced to each component task before completing practice with both tasks together. The picture naming task was introduced first, and par- ticipants completed 8 practice trials, with a set of pictures not used in the main experiment but selected to reflect the same range of difficulty presented by the pictures in the main experiment. Par- ticipants were then introduced to the tone task. First, they under- went a tone familiarization phase. They initially viewed the name of the tone on the computer screen, and then they heard the corresponding tone (they were not required to make any response). They completed 30 familiarization trials; for the first 12 trials, tones were presented in a predictable sequence of low to high, but for the remaining 18 trials, they were presented in a random order. Following the familiarization phase, participants undertook 36 practice trials with the tone classification task. A warning signal appeared on the screen; then participants listened to a tone over headphones and classified the tone as quickly but as accurately as possible by making a button press on a button box. The mapping between button and tone was regular. The responses low, medium, and high were assigned to buttons in a left-to-right sequence. Following the practice sequence, participants were introduced to the dual task. Participants were informed that the picture would always appear before the tone would be played. They were instructed to try to make each response as quickly but as accurately as possible. Participants were also encouraged to try to perform each task as close to the same time as possible and to attempt to complete each task as if it were the only task they were doing. The participants were explicitly instructed to avoid allowing the first task to delay the second. These instructions were given to attempt to encourage participants to do as much parallel processing as possible. The trial sequence commenced with the onset of a fixation point, which was visible for 500 ms before being replaced by the picture. The presentation of the picture was terminated by the detection of a vocal response by the voice key. Either 50, 150, or 900 ms after the onset of the picture, participants heard either a high-, medium-, or low-pitched tone played over headphones. They classified this tone as high, medium, or low by pressing one of three buttons on the button box. After the participant had made two responses, and the experimenter had recorded any problems or errors, the next trial was initiated. Participants first completed a sequence of 20 practice trials using pictures not seen elsewhere in the experiment and selected to provide a similar level of difficulty as the experi- mental items. They then completed 60 experimental trials with the experimental items presented in random order. Results The mean percentage of errors for each task at each level of SOA is shown in Table 3 (Experiment 1A) and Table 4 (Experi- ment 1B). The mean RTs for each task at each level of SOA are presented in Figure 5 (Experiment 1A) and Figure 6 (Experiment 1B). For each constituent task in each experiment, we analyzed both accuracy and RT using a two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), with AoA (early, late)  SOA (50, 150, 900) in Experiment 1A and WF (high, low)  SOA (50, 150, 900) in Experiment 1B. Analyses were conducted both by participants (F1) and by items (F2); SOA was a repeated measures variable in all analyses, whereas WF and AoA were repeated measures variables in the participants analyses but between-items variables in the items analyses. Effect size, partial eta squared (p 2), is also reported for the by participants main effects of WF and AoA and their interactions with SOA, for the RT analyses, where significant. Experiment 1A: AoA Picture naming: Accuracy. The analysis of accuracy revealed no significant effects. Picture naming: RT. In the picture naming task, 7.20% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: environ- mental triggering of the voice key (0.35%), failures to trigger the voice key or dysfluent responses (0.35%), and incorrect picture naming responses (6.50%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the relevant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (4.86%). The total exclusion rate was thus 12.06%. There was a significant effect of AoA, F1(1, 23)  18.12, MSE  13,035.82, p  .0005, and F2(1, 58)  12.93, MSE  28,403.87, p  .001, p 2  .44, in which early pictures were named more quickly than late ones. However, there was no significant effect of SOA and no interaction (all Fs  1.2). Tone classification: Accuracy. In the tone classification task, no effects or interactions reached significance. Tone classification: RT. In the tone task, 14.80% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: incorrect tone classification responses (8.70%) and incorrect picture naming re- sponses (6.10%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 Table 3 Mean Percentage Error as a Function of Age of Acquisition and Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) in Experiment 1A Tone SOA (ms) Age of acquisition Early Late Picture naming 50 7.64 7.13 150 5.42 9.17 900 3.75 5.46 Tone classification 50 9.58 9.58 150 7.92 9.58 900 5.00 10.42 289AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS standard deviations from the relevant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (2.55%).

There was also a significant main effect of SOA, F1(2, 46)  87.46, MSE  25,193.17, p  .00001, F2(2, 116)  178.61, MSE  15,340.33, p  .00001. RTs increased as SOA decreased. The interaction between these two factors was nonsignificant (Fs  1.3). Experiment 1B: WF Picture naming: Accuracy.

No other effects or interactions approached significance (Fs  1). Picture naming: RT. In the picture naming task, 4.3% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: environ- mental triggering of the voice key (0.28%), failures to trigger the voice key or dysfluent responses (0.74%), and incorrect picture naming responses (3.28%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the relevant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (4.5%). The total exclusion rate was thus 9.8%. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of word frequency, F1(1, 35)  15.36, MSE  4,713.22, p  .0005, and F2(1, 58)  4.44, MSE  21,610.42, p  .05, p 2  .31. Pictures with high- frequency names were named more quickly than those with low- frequency names, but there was no effect of SOA and no interaction. Tone classification: Accuracy. There was a significant effect of SOA, F1(2, 70)  5.16, MSE  .006, p  .01, and F2(2, 116)  4.992, MSE  0.05, p  .01. No other effects or interactions reached significance. Tone classification: RT. In the tone task, 10.23% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: incorrect tone classification responses (7.36%) and incorrect picture naming re- sponses (2.87%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the relevant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (2.8%). Thus, the total exclusion rate was 13.03%. There was a significant main effect of SOA, F1(2, 70)  208.46, MSE  20,675.47, p  .00001, and F2(2, 116)  429.18, MSE  8,693.98, p  .00001. Although the main effect of frequency was significant by participants, F1(1, 35)  5.83, MSE  6,508.15, p  .05, it failed to reach significance by items, F2(1, 58)  2.44, MSE  28,765.21, p  .12, p 2  .14.

Discussion The results of Experiments 1A and 1B showed effects of both AoA and WF on picture naming times. Early-acquired and high- frequency items were named more quickly than were their late- acquired or low-frequency counterparts. These effects occurred even though AoA was controlled when WF was manipulated and WF was controlled when AoA was manipulated, indicating that each effect can occur independently of variation in the other variable. These findings argue against the once popular view that all frequency effects in picture naming are really AoA in disguise (Morrison et al., 1992). However, the relative importance of AoA and frequency was not the main concern of this study; rather, we were interested in the relative localization of the variables in the processes underlying picture naming. To address this question, we assessed the effects of each variable on a secondary tone discrimination task. Both Experiments 1A and 1B clearly showed that tone discrimination was slower (and less accurate in Experiment 1B) in the face of a competing primary picture naming task, demonstrating that pro- cesses and/or resources were shared by the two tasks, that is, we successfully induced a PRP effect. In particular, tone discrimina- tion was unable to proceed at full efficiency in the face of a competing picture naming task; in contrast, picture naming was largely unaffected by the presence of the tone task. These results replicate the pattern of findings reported by Ferreira and Pashler (2002) for these same two tasks. The results are consistent with the idea that the higher priority picture naming task gains access to overlapping processes and/or resources before the tone task. As a result, the tone task must wait or proceed at a markedly reduced rate until the completion of certain Task 1 stages releases the critical processes and/or resources to enable Task 2 to resume at full efficiency. The results also clearly showed that AoA not only affected the primary picture naming task but also the secondary tone discrimination task. There was a greater delay in tone discrim- ination when participants produced a late-acquired picture name relative to when they produced an early-acquired name. The effects of WF also propagated onto the tone task RT. However, the pattern of results was a little different from that observed with AoA. With AoA, effects on the tone task were found at all SOAs, including the longest (900 ms); in contrast, WF effects were found only at the shortest SOAs and not at the longer (900 ms) SOA. It may be that WF propagates less fully than AoA onto the tone task, as part of the WF effect is located at later stages of processing subsequent to any bottleneck or suspension of a stage in the task. However, we cannot rule out that these differences between AoA and WF arise for relatively mundane reasons; overall, mean nam- ing latency is shorter in the WF experiment, and the WF effect is smaller overall, creating less opportunity for Task 2 propagation. We conclude that both WF and AoA have consequences for Task 2 performance. These findings rule out a locus for either variable as occurring exclusively after the Task 1 stage, which causes the Task 2 delay. In applying a central bottleneck model, it follows that neither variable is confined to operate at postcentral stages of processing. 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 50 150 900 SOA (ms) Picture High Picture Low Tone High Tone Low Figure 6. Means and standard errors for Experiment 1B. Reaction time is plotted as a function of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) for each level of word frequency in each task. 291AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS Ferreira and Pashler (2002) showed that facilitation from a phonologically related distractor in a picture naming task did not propagate onto a secondary tone discrimination task, supporting the idea that phoneme retrieval occurs after any resource- demanding bottleneck. These results have implications for the interpretation of the present data, suggesting that neither AoA nor WF are exclusively localized at the level of phoneme retrieval. The results from Experiment 1 are useful in indicating that AoA and WF effects are not confined to a late stage of phoneme retrieval in picture naming, but the results are less clear about where these effects are localized. Task 2 propagation is equally compatible with a locus at or before the process(es) and/or re- sources shared between the two tasks. In Experiment 2, we went on to apply locus of cognitive slack logic to determine whether AoA and WF affect the duration of central bottleneck or precentral stages of processing. Experiment 2: Prioritizing Tone Discrimination Ferreira and Pashler (2002) favored the view that the effect of WF / AoA they found had a central locus; however, it is important to note that this conclusion is not forced by their data. The Task 2 propagation these authors observed could equally arise from ex- tensions of precentral processing stages, which would also delay the eventual end point of central stages of picture naming. In Experiments 2A and 2B, we asked whether AoA and WF effects on picture naming could be absorbed into the cognitive slack created by delaying Task 2 in the PRP procedure. Again we used SOAs of 50, 150, and 900 ms. At 900 ms there should be very little task overlap and both effects should be fully expressed; reducing SOA to 150 and 50 ms should increase the amount of cognitive slack and permit absorption of any precentral Task 2 effects. If either effect stems from a processing stage that precedes the dual-task bottleneck, then there should be an underadditive inter- action with SOA. Method Participants Experiment 2A. A total of 24 participants were included in the analysis. Four participants initially tested failed to achieve a min- imum of 70 % correct in all conditions in both tasks and thus were replaced by 4 new participants. There were 9 male and 15 female participants of average age 21.79 years. Experiment 2B. A total of 42 participants were included in the analysis. Three were excluded because they failed to produce a minimum of 70% accuracy in all conditions of both tasks. One additional participant was excluded because of strong evidence of grouping responses at the shortest SOA (markedly delayed tone classification times at the shortest SOAs). Data were replaced for these 4 participants. Of the sample, there were 12 male and 30 female participants, of average age 20.05 years. Materials and Equipment, Design, and Procedure The materials, equipment, and design were the same as in Experiment 1. The same procedure as used in Experiment 1 was followed; however, in Experiment 2, it was the tone that occurred first following the fixation point, and the picture followed 50, 150, or 900 ms after the onset of the tone. Results The mean percentage of errors for each task at each level of SOA is shown in Table 5 (Experiment 2A) and Table 6 (Experi- ment 2B). Mean RTs for each task at each level of SOA are presented in Figure 7 (Experiment 2A) and Figure 8 (Experiment 2B). For each constituent task in each experiment, both accuracy and RT were analyzed with a two-factor ANOVA, with AoA (early, late)  SOA (50, 150, 900) for Experiment 2A, and WF (high, low)  SOA (50, 150, 900) for Experiment 2B. Analyses were conducted both by participants (F1) and by items (F2). SOA was a repeated measures variable in all analyses, whereas WF and AoA were repeated measures variables in the participants analyses but between-items variables in the items analyses. Effect size, partial eta squared (p 2), is also reported for the by participants main effects of WF and AoA and, for the RT analyses, their interactions with SOA where significant. All trials in which the picture naming response preceded the tone response were excluded from analysis, as we were interested in the effect of delaying picture naming (see below). Experiment 2A: AoA Picture naming: Accuracy. The effect of SOA was significant, F1(2, 46)  2.76, MSE  0.005, p  .05, F2(2, 116)  4.25, MSE  0.005, p  .05, but SOA did not interact with AoA (both Fs  1). Picture naming: RT. In the picture naming task, 12.7% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: misor- dered responses (picture name given before the tone response, 3.20%), environmental triggering of the voice key (0.40%), fail- ures to trigger the voice key or dysfluent responses (0.28%), incorrect picture naming responses (5.50%), and incorrect tone responses (3.30%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the relevant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (3.06%). The total exclusion rate was thus 15.76%.

Planned contrasts assessed the AoA effect at each of the three levels of SOA. The AoA effect was significant at both an SOA of 900 ms, F1(1, 23)  16.90, MSE  4,103.98, p  .0005, and F2(1, 58)  5.53, MSE  12,471.62, p  .01, and an SOA of 150 ms, F1(1, 23)  5.53, MSE  8,633.9, p  .05, F2(1, 58)  5.72, MSE  81,510.71, p  .05. At the 50-ms SOA, there was clearly no significant effect of AoA (both Fs  1). Picture naming slowed as SOA decreased. Additionally, AoA was reliably underadditive with the effects of SOA; as SOA decreased, the effects of AoA diminished, and there was no significant effect at the shortest SOA. Tone classification: Accuracy. There were no significant ef- fects or interactions. Tone classification: RT. In the tone task, 7.20% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: misordered responses (picture name given before the tone response, 3.20%), incorrect tone classification responses (4.00%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the rele- vant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (4.7%). Thus, the total exclusion rate was 11.90%. The analysis of the tone task RTs revealed no significant main effects or interactions. Experiment 2B: Word Frequency Picture naming: Accuracy. By participants and by items, there were no significant main effects or interactions (all Fs  1). Picture naming: RT. In the picture naming task, 10.68% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: misor- dered responses (picture name given before the tone response, 1.47%), environmental triggering of the voice key (0.28%), fail- ures to trigger the voice key or dysfluent responses (0.87%), incorrect picture-naming responses (4.76%), incorrect tone re- sponses (3.30%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the relevant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (3.30%). The total exclusion rate was thus 13.98%. In the picture naming task, there was a significant main effect of word frequency, F1(1, 41)  42.38, MSE  5,750.99, p  .00001, and F2(1, 58)  9.06, MSE  16,130.61, p  .005, p 2  .5, and a significant main effect of SOA, F1(2, 82)  178.71, MSE  19,229.65, p  .00001, F2(2, 116)  295.88, MSE  7,795.85, p  .00001, but no interaction (both Fs  1).

The effect was significant at the 50-ms SOA, F1(1, 41)  11.96, MSE  6,731.61, p  .0005, and F2(1, 58)  5.60, MSE  1,002.48, p  .05. At the 150-ms SOA, the effect was significant by participants, F1(1, 41)  8.42, MSE  7,716.40, p  .005, but just failed to reach significance by items, F2(1, 58)  3.35, MSE  10,697.86, p  .072. At the 900-ms SOA, the effect was significant both by participants, F1(1, 41)  48.26, MSE  2,074.50, p  .00001, and by items, F2(1, 58)  5.06, MSE  11,021.97, p  .05. Pictures with low-frequency names were named more slowly than their high-frequency counterparts. Responses were also in- creasingly delayed as SOA decreased; the frequency effect re- mained at all SOAs and was not absorbed into the delay. Tone classification: Accuracy. No effects were evident by participants (F1  1.4) or by items (F2  1.3). Tone classification: RT. In the tone task, 5.90% of the RTs were removed prior to the identification of outliers: misordered responses (picture name given before the tone response, 1.50%) and incorrect tone classification responses (4.40%). Outliers were identified as RTs more than 2 standard deviations from the rele- vant cell mean of the relevant participant and were excluded from analysis (4.36%). Thus, the total exclusion rate was 10.26%. There was a significant main effect of SOA by participants, F1(2, 82)  5.53, MSE  6464.32, p  .01, and by items, F2(2, 116)  3.25, MSE  6,743.94, p  .05. There was a small increase in RT as SOA decreases. Discussion The results of Experiments 2A and 2B again demonstrated a substantial PRP effect. There was substantial interference between picture naming and an unrelated tone classification task. In this case, because the tone stimulus occurred first and had attentional priority, the picture naming task was delayed, with the extent of the delay increasing (and accuracy in Experiment 2A decreasing) as the temporal overlap increased. Assuming that critical compo- nents of the picture naming task were put on hold until critical stages of the tone task were completed, the data indicate that the amount of waiting time for Task 2 increases as SOA decreases. Stages of Task 2 occurring before these critical stages, which may operate in parallel with critical stages of Task 1, may expand to fill this slack time. Will the delay caused by our experimental vari- ables show such absorption into cognitive slack? The answer to this question differs starkly for AoA and WF. Experiment 2B showed that WF was strictly additive with SOA. WF effects were undiminished by increasing Task 2 waiting time. This indicates that WF operates to lengthen a process in Task 2 that constitutes a bottleneck. WF cannot operate on an earlier stage unless it would be absorbed into cognitive slack, nor can it lie exclusively beyond any bottleneck, or else it would not show any Task 2 propagation in Experiment 1B. Thus, it is most likely that WF operates to lengthen precisely those stages of picture naming that cannot operate in parallel with critical Task 1 stages. The situation is rather different for AoA, which bears a clear underadditive relation to SOA. AoA effects were reduced as SOA became shorter, such that at the shortest SOA (50 ms), there was absolutely no effect of AoA. It follows that AoA must operate before those critical stages that are halted while awaiting critical Task 1 processing to complete. Given sufficient delay, the diffi- culty created by late, as compared with early, items is absorbed into cognitive slack. Notably, given that the whole of the AoA effect is absorbed into slack, the effect in its entirety must lie precentrally. The results of Experiments 2A and 2B in combination show that AoA and frequency are clearly dissociable, affecting distinct stages of processing. Whereas AoA operates on stages of process- 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 50 150 900 SOA (ms) Picture High Picture Low Tone High Tone Low Figure 8.

Reaction time is plotted as a function of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) for each level of word frequency (WF) in each task. 294 DENT, JOHNSTON, AND HUMPHREYS ing prior to any bottleneck within the task, WF directly extends the duration of the bottleneck. In the General Discussion, we attempt to integrate these insights into both current theories of AoA and WF effects and current models of picture naming. General Discussion In two experiments, we used psychological refractory period logic to assess the relative loci at which AoA and WF operate in a picture naming task. In Experiments 1A and 1B, we established that both variables propagate onto Task 2 RTs. This indicates that neither variable can be exclusively localized at output stages of processing. In Experiments 2A and 2B, we further established that, when picture naming was performed as the second of two tasks, AoA, but not WF, showed absorption into cognitive slack. This indicates that AoA must be localized earlier in processing than WF. In particular, whereas AoA operates before those stages that are halted under dual-task conditions, WF must directly lengthen the stage(s) of picture naming that constitute a bottleneck. Cer- tainly this dissociation of AoA and WF has grave consequences for any theory that attributes these effects to a single common cause and, as such, must rule out the cumulative frequency hypothesis and cause problems for current connectionist accounts of these effects (Ellis &amp; Lambon Ralph, 2000). Next, we explore how our findings fit in with existing studies concerned with localizing AoA and WF effects in the context of models of picture naming (see Figure 1). Localizing AoA and WF in Models of Picture Naming First, we clarify what is theoretically possible with regard to central attention and picture naming in general. There are no a priori grounds for supposing that picture naming involves central attention at all; it could be subserved by a domain-specific linguis- tic module that operates automatically to produce an output, given a picture (or conceptual representation) as input. Indeed, previous authors (e.g., Bock, 1982; Levelt, 1989) have argued, that lexical access proper is largely automatic, requiring attentional supervi- sion only at the very latest stages, after a phonological represen- tation has been assembled. The results of Ferreira and Pashler (2002) showed that picture naming does require central attention and allowed the locus of stages of picture naming requiring central attention to be con- strained in the following way. Central attention must be engaged before phonological assembly (unless phonological facilitation would propagate onto Task 2) but cannot be engaged before lemma selection (otherwise semantic inhibition would not propa- gate onto Task 2). Thus, with reference to Figure 1, possible sites for the operation of central attention in picture naming include some or all of the following: (a) lemma selection, (b) the trans- mission of information between lemma and word form represen- tations, and (c) word form selection. What the data of Ferreira and Pashler (2002) do not show is that central attention is required for lemma selection. The effects of semantic constraint and semantic relatedness for Task 2 under PRP conditions, reported by Ferreira and Pashler (2002), need not arise from the lengthening of central processing but could equally arise from the lengthening of precentral processing (see Figure 3). Thus, whereas central attention cannot operate before lemma selection, it could very well operate after this stage, perhaps affecting only word form selection. Indeed, as noted in the introduction, Dell’Acqua et al. (2007) have found that the semantic interference effect on picture naming can be completely absorbed into slack at the shortest SOA in a PRP situation. If we assume that the semantic interference effect arises as a result of lexical competition amongst competing lemmas (see Levelt et al., 1999), then this competition could be precentral. AoA Our data provide difficulties for any theory attributing AoA effects to the late stage of phonological assembly (e.g., Brown &amp; Watson, 1987). Given that AoA is a precentral variable, and phonological assembly is a postcentral process, AoA cannot affect phonological assembly. As such, our results add to the growing body of evidence (e.g., Catling &amp; Johnston, 2006b; Monaghan &amp; Ellis, 2002a) arguing against AoA effects on phonological assem- bly. The most straightforward localization for AoA would be exclu- sively at stages of object recognition. However, although there are demonstrations of AoA effects on perceptual processing (Dent et al., 2007; Moore et al., 2004), other data indicate that perceptual aspects of object recognition cannot be the exclusive locus of the effect. Catling and Johnston (2005) demonstrated large AoA ef- fects in a category–noun generation task, in which no objects were presented: participants were given a category label (e.g., fruit) and a letter (e.g. “s”) and were asked to give a category exemplar beginning with that letter (e.g., strawberry). An alternative would be to additionally localize AoA to stages of semantic activation (e.g. Brysbaert, Van Wijnendaele, &amp; De Deyne, 2000). However, there is good evidence to suggest that AoA also modulates the difficulty of lemma selection. First, Belke, Brysbaert, Meyer, and Ghyselinck (2005) found that the detrimental effect on naming of blocking pictures by category was greater for late- than for early- acquired names. Because this semantic interference effect likely arises at lemma selection (Belke et al., 2005), this result supports the idea of AoA effects on lemma selection. Second, Barry et al. (2001) demonstrated that the prior reading of an object’s name some minutes earlier, a procedure thought to specifically speed lexical access, reduced the AoA effect, again supporting a lexical selection locus for AoA effects. There may then be AoA effects both on object recognition processes (e.g., Dent et al., 2007; Moore et al., 2004) and also on later processes of semantic activation and lexical selection (Barry et al., 2001; Belke et al., 2005; Catling &amp; Johnston, 2005; see also Funnell, Hughes, &amp; Woodcock, 2006, for developmental evi- dence). Several authors have recently suggested that AoA might affect the structure of the semantic system, with early acquired concepts having a pivotal role, acting as central hubs to which many other concepts are connected (e.g., Ghyselinck, Custers, &amp; Brysbaert, 2004; Steyvers &amp; Tenenbaum, 2005). Certainly such a locus would be expected to affect lexical selection, as most models suppose that semantic activation and lemma selection are closely interconnected, with multiple semantically related competitors be- ing available early during competition (see Vitkovitch &amp; Hum- phreys, 1991; Vitkovitch, Humphreys, &amp; Lloyd-Jones, 1993; Vit- kovitch, &amp; Tyrell, 1995), and activation being passed interactively between semantic and lexical levels of processing (e.g. Levelt et 295AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS al., 1999). Another possibility is that AoA affects the process of transforming or categorizing activated semantic knowledge in terms of lexical concepts, a process that would also be expected to have consequences for lemma selection. In any case, as a conse- quence of influencing semantic representations, AoA may have implications for lemma selection (see also Belke et al., 2005, for expression of this view). The observation that AoA is a precentral variable and that it affects lemma selection implies that lemma selection is a precen- tral process. We note that previous authors have implemented lexical selection in terms of interactive activation and competition models, where lexical competition unfolds automatically over time, without requiring attentional supervision from any kind of monitoring device (e.g. Humphreys, Lamote, &amp; Lloyd-Jones, 1995). Returning to the theoretical options for localizing central attention in picture naming specified above, only lemma–word form transmission and word form selection remain as viable sites for the operation of central attention, and thus for the localization of WF effects. Following Levelt et al. (1999), once a winning lemma has been selected, only this lemma is permitted to pass activation to, and thus retrieve, an associated phonological word form. For Levelt et al. (1999), this second bridging mechanism plays a special role in spanning the gap between perception and production systems, granting access to the production architecture. This mechanism allows activation to flow between a single lemma and its phono- logical word form representation, blocking activation flow from all other lemmas. Researchers in other domains (e.g., visual selective attention) have noted the importance of selection mechanisms in controlling access to action production systems (e.g., Allport, 1987; Neumann, 1987); the speech production system may be one such system. We suggest that it is this bridging mechanism that constitutes a central bottleneck, requiring central attention. To clarify, what we wish to claim is that central attention is involved in the process of maintaining a temporary activation flow between a single selected lemma and its phonological word form, until a single word form is selected. Thus, the duration for which central attention must remain engaged will be affected by the difficulty of retrieving the word form from a particular activated lemma. The initial transmission of information between the se- mantic system and lemma representations, during which lemmas accrue activation, while not requiring central attention, is sensitive to AoA, such that early-acquired lemmas accrue activation at a greater rate than the later-acquired ones. This view is illustrated in Figure 9. One other feature of the data that warrants explanation is the specific pattern of underadditivity between AoA and SOA ob- served in Experiment 2A. Despite a large delay in picture naming time (300 ms), the effect of AoA is still present at an SOA of 150 ms. Given that the full effect of AoA at the longest SOA (900 ms) is only 100 ms, the 300 ms of slack at the 150-ms SOA should be sufficient to absorb the AoA effect. Several theoretical options can account for this pattern of findings. The first option is that not all of the PRP delay constitutes “cognitive slack,” that is, there may be nonspecific dual task costs, or even scheduling costs, that contribute to the PRP delay, leading the delay to overestimate the amount of slack in the system. The second theoretical option is to adopt a limited resources view, suggesting (following Navon &amp; Miller, 2002; Tombu &amp; Jolicoeur, 2003) that different stages might require different amounts of central attention. It could be that, rather than lexical activation being strongly automatic, it may require some processing resources and thus may proceed less and less efficiently as SOA is reduced and overlap increases. This would mean that the duration of what we have termed precentral stages might actually increase as SOA decreases, thus failing to absorb into slack at moderate SOAs. A third possibility drawn from D. E. Meyer and Keiras (1997a, 1997b) is that the point of task suspension may be variable and may change with SOA such that at very short SOAs, Task 2 suspension might occur somewhat later, creating the opportunity for even later “central” processing to be absorbed into slack but only at the very shortest SOA (we return to this idea later). A fourth alternative requires us to revise our simple model of the PRP effect, which assumes only a single bottleneck. It may be the case that multiple aspects of picture naming recruit central attention. If central attention is already engaged by a first task, these first central stages then need to wait when a second task is undertaken. However, if these central stages are sufficiently early and the SOA is sufficiently short, the first call for central attention in Task 2 might occur before the first central demands in Task 1. Thus, these early central stages of a second task may be completed in parallel with Task 2 precentral stages, but only given a sufficiently short SOA. Clearly, further research is needed to more fully understand the complexities of dual-task interference with picture naming. Currently, we prefer the simplest hypothesis that AoA affects precentral stages of processing and that effects occur at medium SOAs because nonspecific dual-task costs give a misleading impression of the amount of slack in the system. WF Our data also provide strong constraints on the localization of WF effects. The effects of WF occur sufficiently late that they are not absorbed into cognitive slack (Experiment 2B) but sufficiently early that they show propagation onto a second task (Experiment 1B). Given that WF shows no significant absorption into cognitive slack, the entirety of the effect must be localized after AoA, which shows complete absorption. In stark contrast to the results with AoA, and despite large amounts of cognitive slack, WF exhibits absolutely no absorption, showing an effect that is undiminished across the SOAs, persisting even at the shortest SOA (50 ms). Because earlier we localized AoA to visual object recognition and the resolution of competition during lemma selection, we conclude that WF must affect later processing stages. Furthermore, at least part of the effect of WF must occur prior to phoneme selection, as this stage of processing is likely to be postcentral (Ferreira &amp; Pashler, 2002). In terms of the model of lexical selection devel- oped to account for our AoA findings, WF appears to affect the efficiency of selection of the phonological word form (see also Jescheniak &amp; Levelt, 1994). Our argument that WF affects relatively late stages of process- ing, after those affected by AoA, fits well with the existing literature. In the context of object naming, other earlier studies have shown that frequency does not affect visual and semantic stages of object processing (Wingfield, 1967, 1968), but it does affect later stages of name retrieval (Jescheniak &amp; Levelt, 1994). Jescheniak and Levelt proposed that WF affects the resting level of activation of word form representations, in a phonological output 296 DENT, JOHNSTON, AND HUMPHREYS lexicon, and our data are broadly consistent with such a localiza- tion. The central bridging mechanism must remain engaged longer, in order to pass activation between lemma and form representa- tions, when the resting level of activation in the form system is lower. The conclusions of Jescheniak and Levelt (1994) were based largely on the findings of frequency inheritance effects for homophones, where processing efficiency was found to be driven by the frequency of the word form rather than the specific concept. Recently, however, these inheritance effects have been challenged (Caramazza, Costa, Miozzo, &amp; Bi, 2001). Thus, in the current context, the connections or transmission efficiency between lemma and phonological form representations re-emerge as viable loci for WF effects (see also Barry et al., 1997; Humphreys, Lamote, &amp; Lloyd-Jones, 1995; and Vitkovitch, &amp; Humphreys, 1991, for ac- counts of WF along these lines). Notably, the current data argue that the selection of such word form representations can constitute a processing bottleneck. Alternative Models of Lexical Access In the introduction, we noted that not all theorists are enthusi- astic about the notion of an abstract lemma representation (see Caramazza, 1997, for a critique of the notion of the lemma). Several models exist (e.g., Caramazza, 1997; Humphreys et al., 1988), in which semantic representations are linked directly to word form representations without mediation by lemmas. A com- prehensive discussion of the relative merits of each approach is beyond the scope of this article. However, if we assume such a model, the changes to our account of the data, would be largely terminological in nature. What we have referred to as lemma representations, become part of the semantic system, and might be appropriately referred to as lexical concepts. We would then say that AoA affects the selection of a conceptual representation, or the process of categorization, in terms of a lexical concept for the target. However, in all other aspects, the account would remain largely unchanged. AoA, WF, and Connectionist Models Currently, the dominant view is that AoA effects in adult object naming arise from basic properties of the ways in which neural networks learn (Ellis &amp; Lambon Ralph 2000). Such models predict correlated effects of both AoA and WF in picture naming. How- ever, our results reveal that certain earlier stages of processing in L ex ic al r et ri ev al</p>

A graphical representation of the relationships between age of acquisition (AoA), word frequency (WF), and central attention in the context of a generic model of picture naming 297AGE OF ACQUISITION AND WORD FREQUENCY EFFECTS picture naming are sensitive to AoA but not WF (Experiments 2A and 2B) but that some later attention-demanding stages of process- ing, are sensitive to WF but not to AoA (AoA shows complete absorption into slack in Experiment 2A, whereas WF shows no absorption in Experiment 2B but does propagate to a second task in Experiment 1B). This dissociation between WF and AoA gen- erates problems for connectionist accounts. Our results are in broad agreement with the framework articu- lated by Brysbaert and Ghyselinck (2006; see also Belke et al., 2005), who suggested that the much larger and more robust effects of AoA than WF on picture naming required a frequency- independent AoA effect. Here, too, we document a frequency- independent AoA effect, which we localize to visual object rec- ognition and lexical selection. Brysbaert and Ghyselinck take the very existence of frequency-independent AoA effects to be a major challenge to connectionist accounts of these effects. Certainly, to account for the current data, more sophisticated connectionist models of AoA and WF will need to be developed. Measurement Issues Although our finding that WF does not influence certain stages of processing is problematic for connectionist accounts of our findings, it is important to consider what WF norms measure. Whereas it may be true that word frequency, as measured here, is unimportant for visual and semantic processing, this does not mean that frequency in general is unimportant. Connectionist models predict effects of the frequency of repetition of the specific trans- lations involved. WF norms may well be good indicators of the frequency of perception of written forms of words and the pro- duction of their phonology, but there is no guarantee that WF norms provide good indexes of the frequency with which we recognize objects or undertake semantic processing of objects (especially given that familiarity is explicitly controlled). There- fore, perhaps we should not be surprised that word frequency fails to influence visual and semantic levels of processing. Given that WF norms specifically measure linguistic experience, perhaps it should not be surprising that we find WF effects specifically on linguistic stages of processing, that is, word perception (Monsell, Doyle, &amp; Haggard, 1989) and production (Griffin &amp; Bock, 1998; Jescheniak, &amp; Levelt, 1994). Bottlenecks, Strategies, and Resources In the introduction, we noted several distinct accounts of the PRP phenomenon: strict structural bottleneck (Pashler, 1984, 1989), resource (Navon &amp; Miller, 2002; Tombu &amp; Jolicoeur, 2003), and strategy (D. E. Meyer &amp; Kieras, 1997a, 1997b). All of these models predict that Task 2 is suspended at some point, and all models hold that variables can propagate onto Task 2 and others will be absorbed into slack. However, one important consideration is the point of Task 2 suspension and how the stages associated with any suspension should be characterized. In some accounts, these stages correspond to the processes underlying response selection. For others, it is not so much the mental oper- ation that is important but the kind of demands made—and indeed a whole plethora of operations may require “central attention” (J. C. Johnston, McCann, &amp; Remington, 1995). For the strategy view, neither the operation involved nor the demands made are of primary importance. Depending on the fine grain of the relations between tasks and the motivations of the participants, different stages may or may not be suspended. Notably, under some cir- cumstances, suspension may occur very late in processing, allow- ing for even the most demanding of central operations to be absorbed into slack. We note that if one adopts a strategic framework, it is no longer necessary to cast suspended stages as “central” and stages permit- ting absorption into slack as “precentral.” Thus, variables showing absorption into slack could be affecting central stages of process- ing, potentially forcing a reformulation of which stages do and do not require central attention. Many studies have shown that ma- nipulations of response selection difficulty are in fact not absorbed into slack. Indeed the study used by D. E. Meyer and Kieras (1997a, 1997b) to justify this assertion (Karlin &amp; Kestenbaum, 1968) has since failed to replicate (Van Selst &amp; Jolicoeur, 1997). Thus, in contrast to the claims of D. E. Meyer and Kieras, it does appear that extensions of some stages cannot be absorbed into slack. We report that WF, a variable previously localized to the selec- tion of phonological word forms, also affects suspended stages of processing but that AoA, a variable thought to influence visual and lexicosemantic processing, affects Task 2 stages that are not sus- pended. These findings are consistent with the idea that the stages that are suspended can legitimately be linked to response selection, at least in this task. In the context of picture naming, selection of a unique response in terms of a phonological word form constitutes a bottleneck. We note that the existence of a bottleneck at the stage of word form retrieval is consistent with current models of speech production (see Levelt et al., 1999). Conclusions Independent effects of both AoA and WF may be observed in picture naming. Neither effect operates exclusively at late stages of phonological assembly. AoA operates earlier than WF. Whereas AoA affects the efficiency of object recognition, semantic activa- tion, and lemma selection, only WF directly affects the efficiency of phonological word form selection. We suggest that dominant connectionist accounts of AoA and WF will require modification to account for the data reported. References Allport, D. A. (1987).
