          <p id="s1p1">Stereotypes and Retrieval-Provoked Illusory Source Recollections Chad S. Dodson, James Darragh, and Allison Williams University of Virginia When expectations and stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they spontaneously create distorted and illusory recollections that are consistent with these expectations. Participants studied doctor (physician)- related and lawyer-related statements that were presented by 2 different people. When informed, on a subsequent source memory test, (i.e., of who presented what) that one of the study sources was actually a doctor and the other source was a lawyer, there was a strong tendency to attribute the test items in a stereotype-consistent manner. In 3 experiments, participants frequently reported recollecting specific details, such as via “remember” judgments, to justify their stereotype-consistent but incorrect responses. These experiments rule out explanations involving either the misattribution of strong familiarity or differences in the bias to making remember responses as accounts for the illusory source attributions. Instead, the illusory recollections are consistent with the notion that recollective experience is manufac- tured from both the information in the memory trace and information in the retrieval environment, such as an individual’s expectations, stereotypes, and general knowledge. Keywords: source memory, stereotypes, remember, recollection, false memory Over the past 30 years, there has been much interest in the influence of stereotypes on memory. Early stereotype studies sug- gested that when stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they distort recollections of earlier events. For instance, when individuals were told at the time of a recognition test that a previously described character, Betty K., was now living either a heterosexual or a lesbian lifestyle, individuals were likely to incorrectly recognize novel statements that were consistent with their expectations or schema about the designated lifestyle (Snyder &amp; Uranowitz, 1978; see also Dooling &amp; Christiaansen, 1977; Sulin &amp; Dooling, 1974). However, rather than stemming from distorted recollections, sub- sequent studies noted that the foregoing false alarm results in the Betty K. study likely arose from schema-consistent guessing or response biases (Bellezza &amp; Bower, 1981; Clark &amp; Woll, 1981). A large amount of cognitive and social psychological research suggests that when stereotypes are provided at retrieval, they affect memory performance primarily through decision or guessing pro- cesses (e.g., Bayen, Nakamura, Dupuis, &amp; Yang, 2000; Hirt, McDonald, &amp; Markman, 1998; Marsh, Cook &amp; Hicks, 2006; Mather, Johnson, &amp; De Leonardis, 1999; Sherman &amp; Bessenoff, 1999). Consider, for example, the influence of stereotypes on source monitoring, that is, on people’s ability to identify the origin of a test item. In a typical procedure, participants see two different individuals present equivalent numbers of doctor (physician)-like (e.g., how long have you had the fever?), lawyer-like (e.g., you face a fine of $500), and neutral (e.g., I love to play tennis) sentences (e.g., Bayen et al, 2000; Hicks &amp; Cockman, 2003). When told during the memory test that one source was actually a doctor and the other source was a lawyer, participants showed good source identification performance for statements that were consistent with the source’s profession and poor performance for statements that were inconsistent with the source’s profession. Essentially, source attributions were biased in favor of responding in a stereotype-consistent manner and against responding in a stereotype-inconsistent manner. Recently, similar patterns of bi- ased memory performance have been observed with stereotypes involving gender, sexual orientation, and race (Marsh et al., 2006; B. K. Payne, Jacoby, &amp; Lambert, 2004). These results are consistent with Johnson, Hashtroudi, and Lind- say’s (1993) source monitoring framework (SMF). The process of identifying the origin of a memory is influenced by various deci- sion processes that are used to assess the kind, amount, and likely source of remembered information (e.g., Dodson &amp; Johnson, 1996; Hicks &amp; Cockman, 2003; Mather et al., 1999; Spaniol &amp; Bayen, 2002). Stereotypes, like other background knowledge, influence how remembered information is evaluated and weighted, so that individuals are biased to respond in a stereotype-consistent man- ner. Building on the SMF, Bayen and colleagues proposed a probability matching account of the influence of stereotypes on performance (e.g., Spaniol &amp; Bayen, 2002). Specifically, when participants fail to recollect source-identifying information about a test item, they guess a source by responding in a way that matches their sense of the likelihood or probability that the test item is associated with a particular source (e.g., “I can’t remember who presented this item, but I know that Jane’s a doctor. Therefore, she likely presented this doctor-like sentence”), thus producing stereotype-biased performance (Spaniol &amp; Bayen, 2002; see Dod- son &amp; Johnson, 1996, for a related view). Researchers within social psychology have reached similar con- clusions about the influence of stereotypes and expectations on behavior. For instance, Ross and Conway (1986) proposed that in the absence of memory for specific details about past beliefs, individuals infer a past belief on the basis of their current beliefs and their expectations about the stability of this belief across time Chad S.

Moreover, the notion that stereotypes and expec- tancies dominate performance when individuals fail to recollect specific details has been supported by a number of studies that have degraded people’s ability to remember past events or to engage in controlled processes during retrieval (e.g., Cook, Marsh, &amp; Hicks, 2003; Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000; Sherman &amp; Bes- senoff, 1999). In sum, a prominent view within cognitive and social psychology is that when expectations and stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they influence performance by altering par- ticipants’ decision strategies and response biases. We, however, are investigating a different hypothesis about why stereotypes influence performance. According to our retrieval ex- pectation account, stereotypes and expectations increase the like- lihood that participants falsely recollect information that is con- sistent with the stereotype. Our hypothesis draws on Tulving’s (1983) notion of synergistic ecphory. Recollective experience, according to this view, is not just a product of information that has been activated from the memory trace. Instead, the experience of recollection is assembled from activated trace information and from information in the retrieval cue and retrieval environment. Consequently, illusory recollections may occur when information in the retrieval cue is incorporated into the recollective experience. Support for our retrieval expectation hypothesis comes from Hicks and Cockman (2003), who observed that when individuals re- sponded incorrectly, but in a stereotype-consistent manner, they generally assigned high levels of confidence to their errors, con- trary to the expectation that if individuals had been guessing, then they would have assigned low confidence to their responses. The hypothesis that recollective experience is a constructive activity that is, to some degree, independent of what was encoded is consistent with the thinking of other theorists (e.g., Brainerd, Payne, Wright, &amp; Reyna, 2003; Higham &amp; Vokey, 2004; Johnson et al., 1993; Lindsay &amp; Kelley, 1996; Schacter et al., 1998; Whittlesea, 2004). For example, Lindsay and Kelley (1996) pro- posed that “a person’s knowledge and beliefs are another source of thoughts and images coming fluently to mind during attempts to remember, as illustrated in numerous experiments demonstrating schema- or script-based intrusions in recall and recognition” (p. 208). Similarly, Whittlesea (2004) suggested that subjective feel- ings of remembering or of familiarity depend in part on expecta- tions about what should be remembered in a particular situation. Moreover, illusory recollections have been documented as contrib- uting to memory errors in a variety of different paradigms (e.g., Chan &amp; McDermott, 2006; Hannigan &amp; Reinitz, 2001; Higham &amp; Vokey, 2004; Johnson &amp; Raye, 1981; Lampinen, Copeland, &amp; Neuschatz, 2001; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995; Zaragoza &amp; Lane, 1994). In the eyewitness testimony paradigm, much evidence shows that partici- pants can actually remember having seen an object that was only suggested to them (e.g., Frost, 2000; Lindsay, 1990; Zaragoza &amp; Lane, 1994). In the DRM paradigm, participants will often claim to recollect specific details about encountering a nonpresented item that happens to be similar to what was studied, such as remembering whether it was presented by a woman or a man (e.g., D. G. Payne, Elie, Blackwell, &amp; Neuschatz, 1996; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). Moreover, brain imaging data indicate that true and false memories are sometimes associated with comparable amounts of activity in the same sensory areas, suggesting that they evoke similar subjective experiences (e.g., Schacter &amp; Slotnick, 2004). The foregoing pattern of data is consistent with a key tenet of Johnson and colleagues’ SMF that both illusory and true memories are sometimes associated with comparably vivid mental experiences (e.g., Johnson et al., 1993; Mitchell &amp; Johnson, 2000; see also Schacter, Norman, &amp; Koutstaal, 1998). The present research extends this notion of illusory recollections and constructive processes to the question of how stereotypes and expectations influence behavior when these stereotypes/ expectations have been activated at the time of retrieval, a question that has generally been answered in terms of guessing or decision processes. It is important to note that although the retrieval expec- tation account provides an alternative explanation of the influence of stereotypes, it is not exclusive with respect to the guessing account. That is, we believe that stereotypes affect behavior in multiple ways by influencing decision strategies as well as by creating stereotype-consistent illusory recollections. Experiment 1 Experiment 1 used the following procedure to investigate whether stereotypes create illusory recollections of past events that are consistent with the stereotype. As in the Bayen et al. (2000) and Hicks and Cockman (2003) studies, our participants studied equal numbers of doctor-related, lawyer-related, and neutral sen- tences that were presented by two different male sources, Tom and Bill. At the time of the source memory test, participants were told that one source was a doctor and the other source was a lawyer. In addition, however, we manipulated the format of the source mem- ory test across participants. Half of the participants initially made an “old–new” judgment and, for items judged old, participants then identified whether Tom or Bill was the source of the item. This procedure is comparable to the typical source test format. For the remaining participants, however, the format of the source memory test differed after they made their initial old–new judg- ment. For items judged old, these participants then made a source judgment about who presented it during the study phase or they responded that they could not remember the source (i.e., Tom, Bill, or don’t know). Critically, these participants were directed to select Tom or Bill only if they vividly remembered the source that presented the item during the study phase. We used instructions similar to those used to guide participants to make a “remember” response in the remember–know paradigm (e.g., Gardiner &amp; Java, 1993; Tulving, 1985). If participants did not experience a vivid recollection, they were told to respond “don’t know.” Above all, participants were instructed not to guess the source. A similar don’t know procedure has been used by others to increase the likelihood that a source attribution is based on a convincing sense of remembering and not on a guess (e.g., Gallo &amp; Roediger, 2003; Lampinen, Neuschatz, &amp; Payne, 1999; Macrae, Schloerscheidt, Bodenhausen, &amp; Milne, 2002; D. G. Payne et al., 1996; Roediger, McDermott, Pisoni, &amp; Gallo, 2004). We expected the standard source test to replicate existing stud- ies and show stereotype-biased performance. This test, however, is unable to discriminate between the guessing and illusory recollec- tion accounts because both processes can yield the same pattern of results. Participants can select an incorrect, but stereotype- consistent, source because they fail to recollect source information and guess in a stereotype-consistent manner. Alternatively, partic- ipants may select the incorrect source because they experience an 461STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS illusory and false recollection. The standard test confounds both of these processes. The modified source test was designed to separate the contributions of guessing and illusory recollections to performance. The guessing hypothesis predicts that there should be no subjective experience of recollection that is associated with incorrect responses. Participants should respond don’t know rather than guess Tom or Bill under the modified test instructions. Responding with don’t know instead of guessing a source greatly reduces or eliminates the pattern of biased source attributions, whereby correctly remembering the source is superior for the stereotype-consistent over the stereotype-inconsistent items. By contrast, the retrieval expectation hypothesis assumes that errors in this paradigm can be recollection based. When participants fail to select the correct source, they will likely choose the incorrect source rather than respond don’t know. In sum, the guessing hypoth- esis predicts an interaction between the test condition (i.e., the stan- dard test format vs. the modified test format) and the degree of match between the profession of the source and the content of the test statement. The retrieval expectation hypothesis, by contrast, predicts no such interaction. Method Participants Sixty-four undergraduate students from the University of Vir- ginia participated in this experiment in exchange for course credit. The participants were randomly assigned to either the modified source test condition (i.e., the source test contains a don’t know response option) or the standard source test condition (i.e., the source test does not contain a don’t know response option). Design and Materials The stimulus material, adopted from Bayen et al. (2000), consisted of 192 sentences that were presented visually only. The sentences were divided into three categories on the basis of their content: 64 doctor-related items, 64 lawyer-related items, and 64 profession- neutral items. Within each category, there were 32 target sentences (e.g. “Do you have any food allergies?”) and 32 distractor sentences that were identical to the targets, except for the modification of one or two words (e.g. “Do you have any drug allergies?”). During the study session, 96 items (i.e., 32 target sentences from each category) were presented simultaneously with a color photo of one of two middle-aged Caucasian male faces, labeled Bill or Tom. Each source was paired with 16 sentences from each of the three categories. An additional 6 filler items at the beginning and the end of the study phase were included so as to reduce primacy and recency effects. The test phase consisted of 48 studied items intermixed with 48 distractor items (i.e., new items). Sixteen studied items were from each category, with an equal number associated with the sources Bill and Tom. Moreover, the new distractor items included 16 doctor sentences, 16 lawyer sentences, and 16 neutral sentences. There were an additional 6 practice items at the beginning of the test, which were used to demonstrate the task to participants. All study and test items were presented in a random order, with the constraint that no more than 3 items of a particular type could appear consecutively. The experimental program was created with E-prime Version 1.1 (2002), and the sentences and photos were presented on a 17-in. (43.2-cm) monitor. Finally, across participants, we counter- balanced (a) assignment of sentences to the target and distractor conditions and (b) assignment of sentences to both sources. Procedure The study items were presented in an incidental manner. Partici- pants were told that they would see a series of sentences, and each would be associated with a person, Bill or Tom, represented by the individual’s picture. They were asked to rate how easily they could imagine the source, either Bill or Tom, saying the sentence. Re- sponses were made on a keyboard with a 5-point Likert scale to identify the difficulty of imagining the sentences. No mention was made of the subsequent memory test. Presentation proceeded at the rate of one sentence every 3.5 s, and participants were asked to make their imageability response before this time elapsed. After viewing the study items, participants were told about the surprise source memory test. However, before the test began, they were informed that it would be helpful for them to know that one speaker was, in fact, a lawyer, and the other was a doctor. Partic- ipants were told that the test would consist of studied sentences as well as new sentences that had not been encountered earlier. All test items appeared visually at the top of the screen, with either the old–new question (i.e., “Was this sentence presented by one of the sources earlier?”) or the source question (i.e., “Who originally presented this statement. Was it Bill or Tom?”) appearing 3 cm below the test item. Pictures of the two sources were shown underneath the source question in the center of the screen with their name and assigned profession (e.g., “Bill, lawyer”) below the corresponding picture. In the standard source test condition, participants first deter- mined whether the sentence was old (a previously presented item) or new. For test items receiving a response of old, participants then identified whether the sentence had been paired earlier with Bill or with Tom during the study phase. In the modified source test condition, participants also first determined whether the sentence was old or new. For items receiving a response of old, participants decided whether the item was presented earlier by Bill or by Tom or whether they could not remember (i.e., don’t know). During the test instructions, participants were told that it was important for them to respond Bill or Tom only if they vividly recollected the source presenting the item during the study phase. Moreover, participants were warned not to guess and to select don’t know if they could not distinctly remember who presented the item during the study phase. For every test item, the following reminder not to guess appeared at the bottom of the screen, “It’s important that you don’t guess. Only respond ‘Tom’ or ‘Bill’ if you specifically remember one of them presenting the statement, otherwise respond ‘don’t know’.” In sum, the modified source test and standard source test conditions were identical in every respect except for the don’t know option and its associated instructions. In both condi- tions, participants progressed through the test at their own pace. Results and Discussion For all of the analyses we used partial eta squared (2) as a measure of effect size. 462 DODSON, DARRAGH, AND WILLIAMS Table 1 presents the conditional source scores (CSIM) for the studied items on the modified and the standard source tests. CSIM scores were computed by determining the rate at which individuals attributed an item to the correct source when they made an attribution to Tom or Bill (e.g., Murnane &amp; Bayen, 1996). On the modified test, this source score ignored responses of don’t know and was based only on the proportion of responses of Bill or Tom that were correct. In order to verify that we replicated Bayen et al. (2000) and Hicks and Cockman (2003), we first analyzed the source scores from the stan- dard source test condition. A 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer- like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of statement type, F(2, 62)  18.49, MSE  .03, p  .001, 2  .37; a significant interaction, F(2, 62)  20.52, MSE  .112, p  .001, 2  .40; and no significant effect of source (F  1). As in previous studies, we observed that source identification rates were higher for neutral statements than for either doctor-related or lawyer-related statements. Critically, however, we replicated the Statement Type  Source interaction, whereby participants showed better source identification performance when there was a match (.75) than when there was a mismatch (.38) between the profession of the source and the statement (e.g., the doctor saying doctor-like rather than lawyer-like statements). Moreover, we further analyzed the data from the standard source test with the identical multinomial model that was used by Bayen et al. (2000). A four parameter, two-high-threshold model fit the data from each item type condition, G 2(2)s  2.22, G 2(2)critical  5.99. The two notable assumptions of this model are that item recognition is equivalent for items from both sources and that source memory is equal for both sources. Thus, this model ex- plains the foregoing differences in conditional source scores in terms of different biases to guess one source over the other. The g parameter in the model refers to the probability of guessing doctor, with 1 – g referring to the probability of guessing lawyer. A value of .5, for instance, corresponds to an equivalent bias of guessing doctor or lawyer. As Bayen et al. observed, there were significant differences across the three different statement types in the bias to respond with a particular source. We found that the bias to respond doctor was significantly greater for the doctor-like statements (g  .71) than for the neutral statements (g  .47), which was signifi- cantly different from the bias for the lawyer-like statements (g  .27), all G2(1)s  37.81, p’s  .0001. Analyses of the remaining parameter values showed no significant differences in source memory (d parameter) between the doctor-related (.26) and lawyer-related (.13) items, although each was significantly lower than source memory for the neutral items (.61), G2(1)s  9.42, ps  .01. Lastly, item recognition (D parameter) of the different item types differed significantly across types, G 2(1)s  9.47, ps  .01, and exhibited the following pattern: neutral (.55)  doctor- related (.37)  lawyer-related (.24). Overall, we replicated Bayen et al. (2000) in nearly every respect. At first glance, it may appear odd that the neutral items are better recognized than the profession statements, particularly as repeated exposure to the doctor and lawyer themes should produce strong memories for the gist of these items. However, all previous studies using these kinds of materials have observed better mem- ory for the neutral items (Bayen et al., 2000; Hicks &amp; Cockman, 2003). There are a variety of reasons for this effect. First, increased memory for the neutral items may reflect an atypicality effect (e.g., Lampinen et al., 2001). As most of the studied items are related to the doctor and lawyer themes, items that violate these themes may be especially salient and memorable.1 Alternatively, as Bayen et al. (2000) noted, the neutral statements may be especially memo- rable because of some other characteristic about these items. We turn now to our central question, To what extent does the particular test format (i.e., standard vs. modified) affect source iden- tification performance when there is either a match or a mismatch between the content of the statement and the profession of the source? To answer this question, we compared source identification perfor- mance (i.e., the proportion of attributions to Tom and Bill that are correct) on the standard and the modified source tests. Note that on the modified test, this source score ignores responses of don’t know and is based only on the proportion of Bill or Tom responses that are correct. This means that on both tests, that score is computed in the same way: the proportion of correct attributions to Bill or Tom given a response of Bill or Tom. A 2 (test condition: standard vs. modi- fied)  3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the conditional source scores yielded a significant effect of test condition, F(1, 50)  9.48, MSE  .11, p  .01, 2  .16, indicating that performance was better overall on the modified test than on the standard test. There was also a significant effect of statement type, F(2, 100)  22.10, MSE  .05, p  .001, 2  .30, reflecting better source identification performance for the neutral statements than for the doctor-related or lawyer-related statements. Finally, there was a significant statement type by source inter- action, F(2, 100)  18.70, MSE  .12, p  .001, 2  .27, whereby performance was superior when the profession of the source and the statement type matched than when they mis- matched. Critically, however, the test condition manipulation did not interact with any of the other factors (all Fs  1.24). Thus, in contrast to the predictions of the guessing hypothesis, the oppor- tunity to respond don’t know did not significantly reduce the magnitude of the match–mismatch effect in the modified source test condition as compared with the standard source test condition. 1 We thank Chuck Brainerd for making this point. Table 1 Source Identification Scores on the Standard and Modified Source Tests Item type/ Source Source test Standard Modified Doctor-related Doctor .76 (.04) .79 (.08) Lawyer .39 (.06) .51 (.09) Lawyer-related Doctor .36 (.06) .59 (.11) Lawyer .75 (.04) .77 (.07) Neutral Doctor .72 (.04) .86 (.04) Lawyer .74 (.03) .90 (.02) Note. The modified test includes the option of responding “don’t know,” whereas the standard test does not include this option. Parentheses contain the standard error of the mean. 463STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS However, the data from the mismatch conditions (i.e., doctor- related items presented by the lawyer source and lawyer-related items presented by the doctor source) across both test formats suggest that a mixture of decision processes and illusory recollec- tions contributed to performance. Table 1 clearly shows that the conditional source scores on the standard test in the mismatch conditions (.39 and .36) were significantly below chance, where chance was 50%, i.e., t(31)  2.39, p  .05. On the modified test, performance in the mismatch conditions was no different from chance. Thus, the modified test appears to have allowed partici- pants to use the don’t know option to filter out guessing biases that would otherwise produce below-chance performance. At the same time, however, chance performance in the mismatch condition on the modified test appears to have been caused by illusory recol- lections that are consistent with the stereotype. Turning to the data from the modified source test, we further investigated whether stereotype information at retrieval creates illu- sory recollections. The left-hand column of data in Table 2 presents the proportion of all old responses (i.e., recognized items) that were attributed to the incorrect source. Recall that we admonished partic- ipants not to guess but to respond with a particular source only when they vividly remembered this source presenting the item during the study phase. Therefore, these incorrect source attributions are presum- ably based on recollective experience. A 3 (statement type: doctor- like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the rate of incorrect source attributions revealed a signif- icant effect of statement type, F(2, 62)  8.07, MSE  .038, p  .01, 2  .21, and a significant statement type by source interaction, F(2, 62)  8.57, MSE  .084, p  .01, 2  .22. False recollections were much more frequent when there was a mismatch between the content of the statement and the profession of the source (.30) than when there was either a match (.09), t(31)  3.13, p  .01, or a neutral statement (.08), t(31)  3.52, p  .01. In line with the illusory recollection account, stereotypes at retrieval appear to create subjectively compel- ling, yet illusory, recollections that are consistent with the stereotype. Lastly, we examined the proportion of items judged old that were then assigned a response of don’t know, as shown in the right column of Table 2. A 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the proportion of don’t know responses yielded no significant effects (all Fs  2.25). Participants responded don’t know at nearly identical rates when the lawyer-related statements were presented by either the lawyer or the doctor. Similarly, there were compa- rable don’t know rates to doctor-related statements that were presented by the doctor and by the lawyer. In sum, participants receiving the modified source test used the don’t know option nearly 40% of the time for profession state- ments that were recognized as old and substantially improved overall source identification rates for these items—relative to participants receiving the standard test—by filtering out guesses. Nevertheless, participants were unable to use the don’t know response to significantly reduce the magnitude of biased source identification rates to test items in which the content of the state- ment either matched or mismatched the profession of the source. In fact, when there was a mismatch between the statement and the profession of the source, participants were equally likely to select the correct and the incorrect source on the modified test even though they were continually warned to base source identification judgments only on the presence of recollective details. Overall, then, the foregoing results indicate that stereotypes create false recollections and also influence guessing processes. Experiment 2 Experiment 1 indicates that illusory recollections about the origin of a statement can be created by providing stereotype information at the time of retrieval. However, the conclusions from Experiment 1 depend on the assumption that the don’t know option captures all of the guessing responses. If a participant forgets to use the don’t know response and, instead, guesses a source, then this assumption is invalidated. Although participants used the don’t know response roughly 40% of the time to improve source identification performance on the modified test, this is in no way proof that all guessing responses have been eradicated from con- tributing to source attributions on this test. Therefore, we con- ducted another experiment with a combined source memory and remember–know procedure to examine the influence of stereotype information on illusory recollections. A number of studies have examined the basis of participants’ source attributions by requiring them to identify whether the source judgment was based either on the conscious recollection of specific details about initially encountering the item during the study phase (i.e., a remember judgment) or on a sense of familiarity and recogni- tion that the item was encountered before, but in the absence of remembering any specific details about this encounter (i.e., a know judgment; e.g., Dewhurst &amp; Hitch, 1999; Hicks, Marsh, &amp; Ritschel, 2002; Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2006; Perfect, Mayes, Downes, &amp; Van Eijk, 1996). For example, Meiser and Bröder (2002) observed that if participants correctly retrieved one attribute about a past event, such as correctly retrieving a word’s location, they were much more likely to retrieve the event’s other attribute (e.g., the word’s particular font) for source attributions accompanied with re- member states than for those accompanied with know states (see also Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2006). For our purposes, the remember–know source paradigm is use- ful in two ways. First, in contrast to Experiment 1, where we inferred that the absence of a don’t know response indicated a judgment based on recollective details, here we directly tested this inference by requiring participants to make a conscious assessment of the memorial basis of each source attribution (i.e., by providing Table 2 Proportion of Recognized Items That Are Either Assigned to the Incorrect Source or Are Given a Response of “Don’t Know” Item type/ Source Modified source test Incorrect Don’t know Doctor-related Doctor .09 (.03) .39 (.06) Lawyer .32 (.06) .34 (.05) Lawyer-related Doctor .29 (.07) .42 (.07) Lawyer .10 (.03) .43 (.07) Neutral Doctor .09 (.02) .33 (.06) Lawyer .07 (.02) .24 (.05) Note.

Second, this paradigm allowed us to test predictions of prevailing social and cognitive psychological theory against those of the retrieval expectation account about the influence of stereotypes. Many social psychological theories assume an inverse relation- ship between the influence of stereotypes and the availability or use of individuating information (e.g., Kunda &amp; Thagard, 1996; Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000; Spears &amp; Haslam, 1997). It is thought that stereotype information is likely to influence behavior when an individual fails to use, or does not have access to, individuating information about a particular person or object. Many cognitive theories also assume that general knowledge and expectations about the world, such as stereotypes, are likely to influence behavior when individuals fail to recollect specific in- formation about the past (e.g., Bayen et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 1993; Mather et al., 1999). Both theoretical accounts assume that the process of recollection will reduce the frequency of systematic errors that are caused by stereotypes and general knowledge. With respect to the remember–know source paradigm, the fore- going assumption about an inverse relationship between recollec- tion and stereotypes means that stereotypes should have less of an effect on performance when source attributions are based on the presence of memory for specific details (remember judgments) than on their absence (know judgments). For instance, consider a situation whereby an individual does not remember specific details about who presented an item and responds exclusively on the basis of guessing the source whose profession corresponds with the statement, such as attributing all of the doctor-related statements to the source who is a doctor. Because the doctor source presented equal numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related statements, this strategy of guessing in a stereotype-consistent manner in- creases performance for the doctor-related items that this source presented and decreases performance for the lawyer-related items that this source presented, thus producing a large difference in performance between the match and mismatch conditions. If, however, participants respond on the basis of remembering spe- cific details about encountering the item, then they essentially can use recollection to counteract the deleterious influence of stereo- types and boost performance in the mismatch condition. There are two different sets of predictions that are made by standard cognitive and social accounts and the retrieval expecta- tion account about the influence of stereotypes on performance. According to standard accounts if recollection accurately reflects past experience, then it should minimize differences in source identification performance between the conditions when the pro- fession of the source either matches or mismatches the content of the statement. Put another way, source attributions that are based on know responses should be associated with larger differences in performance between the match and mismatch conditions, as com- pared with source attributions that are based on remember re- sponses. By contrast, the retrieval expectation account assumes that the process of recollection cannot reliably counteract the influence of stereotypes because recollection is an imperfect pro- cess that is sometimes distorted by, and made consistent with, stereotype information. Therefore, this account predicts that ste- reotypes in the match and mismatch conditions will influence source attributions that are accompanied by remember judgments just as much as they influences source attributions that are accom- panied by know judgments. More importantly, the standard account and the retrieval expec- tation account make different predictions about the subjective experience that accompanies erroneous source attributions. Ac- cording to the standard account, when participants fail to recollect source-identifying information, they use stereotypes to guess a particular source. Guessing is associated with an absence of rec- ollective experience. Therefore, in terms of remember and know phenomenology, participants should give primarily know re- sponses to incorrect source attributions, regardless of whether the attributions are stereotype consistent or stereotype inconsistent. By contrast, the retrieval expectation account predicts that participants will tend to search for and activate expectation-consistent infor- mation. This will predispose participants to experience expectation-consistent illusory recollections and, consequently, to make more false remember responses to erroneous source attribu- tions that are stereotype consistent than to erroneous source attri- butions that are stereotype inconsistent. However, we acknowl- edge that other accounts, such as fuzzy trace theory, also predict increased false remember responses for stereotype-consistent source attributions. We distinguish between these alternative ac- counts in Experiment 3. Method Participants Eighteen undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment. Design and Materials We modified the design from Experiment 1 slightly, primarily by doubling the number of test items that were encountered at encoding and by including the remember–know test instructions. The stimuli were similar to those used in Experiment 1 and consisted of 144 sentences randomly divided into three sets of 48 sentences, with each set containing 16 doctor-related, 16 lawyer- related, and 16 neutral items. The three sets of items were coun- terbalanced and rotated across three conditions: (a) items presented by Bill, (b) items presented by Tom, and (c) new items that were not presented during the study phase. Additionally, half of the participants were told during the test that Bill was a doctor and Tom was a lawyer, and the remaining participants were told the opposite. The study phase thus consisted of 96 sentences: one set of 48 sentences presented by Bill and the other set of 48 sentences presented by Tom. These items were presented at a 5-s rate and in a quasi-random order with no more than three consecutive items presented by the same source. Six additional filler sentences were included at the beginning and at the end of the study phase to reduce primacy and recency effects. The test consisted of 144 sentences (96 old items and 48 new items), with an additional 6 practice items at the beginning of the test that were used to demonstrate the task to participants. All other details about the study and test phase were identical to Experiment 1. Procedure We used the same study instructions that were used in Experi- ment 1. Before beginning the memory test, participants were informed that one source was a doctor and the other source was a 465STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS lawyer, as in Experiment 1. Participants then completed the source memory test in which they determined whether the test sentence was presented by Bill or by Tom during the encoding phase or was a new sentence that had not been encountered earlier. Following responses of Bill or Tom, participants then made a remember or a know judgment as a basis for their source attribution (e.g., Ra- jaram, 1993; Rotello, Macmillan, &amp; Reeder, 2004). That is, par- ticipants were told that a remember judgment: should occur when their memory of who originally presented the statement is accompanied by a conscious recollection of its prior occurrence. To remember is the ability to become consciously aware again of some aspect or aspects of what happened or what was experienced at the time the sentence was presented, such as aspects of the physical appearance of the sentence and the accompanying picture of Bill or Tom, or of what you were thinking when you saw the sentence. In other words the remembered statement should bring back to mind either a particular visual image or something more personal from the time of study or something about its appearance, or position in the study sequence. By contrast, participants were told that a know judgment: should occur when they recognize that the sentence was in the study phase but they cannot consciously recollect anything about its actual occurrence or what happened, or what was experienced at the time of its occurrence. To know means that you know you encountered the sentence before and it is familiar, but you have no specific recollective associations about it. All participants indicated that they understood the distinction between remember and know responses. Results and Discussion Table 3 presents the conditional source scores for the studied items overall and broken down in terms of source scores for remember judgments and for know judgments. The overall scores replicate the basic findings from Experiment 1. A 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the overall scores revealed a significant main effect of statement type, F(2, 34)  38.20, MSE .02, p  .001, 2  .69, reflecting higher source identification rates for neutral statements than for either doctor-related or lawyer-related statements. There was also a significant interaction, F(2, 34)  7.30, MSE .06, p  .01, 2  .30, and no significant effect of source (F  1). As in Experiment 1, participants showed better source identification performance when there was a match (.71) than when there was a mismatch (.48) between the profession of the source and the statement (e.g., the doctor presenting doctor-like rather than lawyer-like statements). Evidence for the occurrence of illusory recollections comes from an examination of source identification scores that are asso- ciated with remember and know responses, as shown in Table 3. Prevailing theory predicts that if recollecting specific details about who presented the statement counteracts and minimizes the influ- ence of stereotypes, then source identification performance that is based on remember judgments should be less influenced by whether there is a match or a mismatch between the source and the statement. In other words, this view predicts a smaller difference in source accuracy between the match and mismatch conditions when source attributions are based on remember responses than when these attributions are based on know responses. We performed a 2 (remember–know)  3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the source scores, which yielded a significant effect of remember—know judgment, F(1, 14)  20.80, MSE .04, p  .001, 2  .60, replicating previous findings of better source identification performance for judgments accompanied by remember responses than by know response (e.g., Dewhurst &amp; Hitch, 1999).2 The ANOVA also yielded a significant effect of statement type, F(2, 28)  16.46, MSE .06, p  .001, 2  .54, and a significant interaction between statement type and source, F(2, 28)  6.63, MSE .12, p  .01, 2  .32, which were qualified by a significant three-way interaction, F(2, 28)  7.47, MSE .05, p  .01, 2  .35. As seen in Table 3, the three-way interaction reflects differences in source identification perfor- mance in the match and mismatch conditions when participants responded on the basis of either remember or know judgments. To examine the three-way interaction, we analyzed source iden- tification performance in the match and mismatch conditions as a function of remember and know responses. This 2 (match vs. mismatch)  2 (remember vs. know) ANOVA yielded significant effects of match–mismatch, F(1, 15)  8.45, MSE .10, p  .01, 2  .36, and remember–know judgment, F(1, 15)  10.69, MSE  .02, p  .01, 2  .42, as well as a significant interaction, F(1, 15)  10.51, MSE  .03, p  .01, 2  .41. There are much greater differences in source accuracy between the match and mismatch conditions when source attributions are based on re- member judgments than when they are based on know judgments. Contrary to the predictions of the prevailing cognitive–social ac- count, source judgments that are based on remembering specific details do not counteract the influence of stereotypes or minimize differences in performance between the match and mismatch con- ditions. 2 The degrees of freedom for this ANOVA are reduced because 3 participants did not give either a remember or a know response to an item type from one of the sources.

(2000). This model fit the data from each item type condition, all G2(2)s  2.29, G2(2)critical  5.99. As in Experiment 1 and as observed by Bayen et al. (2000), there were significant differences across the three different statement types in the bias parameter to respond with a particular source. The bias to provide a doctor response was significantly greater for the doctor- like statements (g  .64) than for the neutral statements (g  .49), which was significantly different from the bias for the lawyer-like statements (g  .34), all G2(1)s  8.01, ps  .01. Analyses of the remaining parameter values showed no significant differences in source memory (d parameter) between the doctor-related (.25) and lawyer-related (.22) items, although each was significantly lower than source memory for the neutral items (.75), G2(1)s  40.75, ps  .001. Lastly, item recognition (D parameter) of the different item types was no different for doctor-related (.56) and lawyer- related (.58) items, and each was significantly lower than item recognition for the neutral items (.75), G2(1)s  21.88, ps  .001. We replicated the basic results from Experiment 1 as well as the results of Bayen et al. (2000). Thus, there is nothing unusual either about our stimuli or about including the remember–know judg- ment in our source memory test. Overall, then, the modeling analysis suggests that there is no actual difference in source memory—as measured by the d param- eter—that would account for better source identification perfor- mance when there was a match than when there was a mismatch between the profession of the source and the statement. Instead, this analysis suggests that there were very strong biases to respond with the source that matches the content of the statement. For instance, in the absence of remembering source-identifying infor- mation, a bias to provide a doctor response to doctor-like state- ments would inflate source identification performance when the doctor happened to be the correct source and reduce performance when it was not the correct source. However, one problem with this foregoing modeling analysis is that it confounds the influence of guessing and illusory recollec- tion processes because both processes can contribute to source identification errors. In other words, current multinomial models assume that source identification errors are due to guessing biases when participants fail to remember information about who pre- sented the item. By contrast, an alternative explanation is that participants falsely recollect illusory information that then serves as the basis for their source identification error. From the stand- point of our retrieval expectation account, the observed differences in the foregoing bias (g) parameter are due to the influence of some mixture of guessing and illusory recollection processes. To distin- guish between these two perspectives, it is necessary to examine the subjective state that is associated with erroneous source iden- tifications. Subjective Experience of Correct and Incorrect Source Attributions To answer the question about whether erroneous source- monitoring judgments are based on either wrong guesses or illu- sory recollections, we investigated participants’ phenomenological state when they made correct and incorrect source attributions. If all incorrect source attributions are based on guessing biases when participants fail to remember source-identifying information, then there should be similar phenomenological states that are associated with incorrect source attributions made in either a schema- consistent manner (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to doctor-related items) or a schema-inconsistent manner (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to lawyer-related items). By contrast, if illusory recollections are the basis of erro- neous but schema-consistent source attributions, then there should be higher rates of remember judgments that are given to schema- consistent than to schema-inconsistent attributions. Table 4 shows the proportion of doctor and lawyer responses that were assigned remember judgments. Because all doctor and lawyer attributions must be accompanied by either a remember or a know response, the proportion of responses in Table 4, given a know judgment, is easily computed by subtracting the score from 1. Figure 1 presents the rate of remember and know judgments for correct and incorrect source attributions that are made in either a schema-consistent or a schema-inconsistent manner. What is strik- ing about the pattern of data in Figure 1 and in Table 4 is that when participants make incorrect source attributions, they are much more likely to give remember judgments to schema-consistent than to schema-inconsistent attributions. In fact, Figure 1 shows that the phenomenological experience that is associated with incorrect attributions that are schema-consistent is nearly identical to the experience that is associated with correct source attributions that are schema-consistent. This foregoing pattern of data was confirmed by a 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer)  2 (accuracy: correct vs. incorrect) ANOVA of the proportion of source attributions assigned remember judgments.3 This analysis yielded significant effects of statement type, F(2, 30)  7.61, MSE .084, p  .01, 2  .34, and accuracy, F(1, 15)  22.73, MSE  .077, p  .001, 2  .60, reflecting higher rates of remember judgments to the neutral statement type and to correct responses, respectively. There was also a Statement Type  Source interaction, F(2, 30)  4.24, MSE .051, p  .05, 2  .22, reflecting higher rates of remember responses when the content of the statement type mismatched rather than matched the profession of the source. Most importantly, there was a three-way interaction, F(2, 30)  7.68, MSE .066, p  .01, 2  .34. As is clear from Figure 1, the three-way interaction is fueled by two aspects of the data. First, when participants make incorrect source attributions, they report remembering information as a basis for more than twice as many of the schema-consistent (55%) than schema-inconsistent (26%) attributions, t(15)  3.61, p  .01. Second, when participants make correct source attributions, there are no differences in the rate of remember judgments to schema- consistent (58%) and schema-inconsistent (52%) attributions, t(15)  1.57. Moreover, the subjective experience of incorrect, but schema-consistent, source attributions is nearly identical to the 3 Two individuals did not assign remember responses to incorrect re- sponses to an item, hence, the reduced degrees of freedom. 467STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS subjective experience that is associated with correct attributions that are schema-consistent. For instance, as shown in Table 3, where the boldface scores refer to correct responses, there is no significant difference in the rate of remember judgments to lawyer- related items that were either correctly (58%) or incorrectly (59%) attributed to the lawyer source, t(15)  0.5. The same pattern holds for the rate of remember judgments assigned to doctor-related items that were either correctly (59%) or incorrectly (51%) attrib- uted to the doctor source, t(15)  1.16. One potential explanation of the difference in subjective expe- rience for the schema-consistent and schema-inconsistent incorrect source attributions is that participants use a more lenient criterion for making remember judgments to schema-consistent items than to schema-inconsistent items. If this were the case, however, then when participants falsely recognize new items as having been encountered during the study phase, they should make more re- member judgments to schema-consistent attributions (e.g., re- sponding with the source who is a doctor to doctor-related items) than to schema-inconsistent attributions (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to lawyer-related items). As is visible in the right-hand portion of Figure 1, this was not the case. In fact, the opposite pattern was true when making source attributions to new items: Participants gave a higher proportion of remember re- sponses to schema-inconsistent attributions (21%) than to schema- 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Schema- Consistent Schema- Inconsistent Schema- Consistent Schema- Inconsistent Schema- Consistent Schema- Inconsistent Correct Source Attributions Incorrect Source Attributions Incorrect Source Attributions Studied Items New Items R a te o f R e m e m b e r a n d K n o w J u d g m e n ts</p>

In sum, it is not the case that all incorrect source attributions are driven by (a) failing to remember individuating information and (b) guessing in a schema-consistent manner. Instead, a substantial amount of incorrect but stereotype-consistent source attributions are based on illusory recollections. Simply being told the profes- sion of the two sources at the time of retrieval spontaneously creates distorted and stereotype-consistent recollections about who presented a statement. This means that recollecting specific details about past events cannot counteract or minimize the influence of stereotypes in this paradigm because these recollected details may themselves be distorted by the stereotype. Experiment 3 Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that illusory recollections about the origin of a statement can be created by providing stereotype information at retrieval that draws on well-learned semantic cate- gories about doctors and lawyers. There are a variety of different explanations for the occurrence of illusory recollections. In other paradigms, misattribution of strong familiarity is a plausible explanation for illusory recollec- tions (i.e., false remember responses). For instance, in the Deese– Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm, participants tend to give high rates of remember responses to new words (e.g., sleep) that appear familiar because they are semantically related to what was studied (e.g., tired, dream, pillow, rest; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). More recently, Chan and McDermott (2006) observed a similar effect when participants make pragmatic inference errors. For instance, after hearing that a “flimsy shelf weakened under the weight of the books,” participants later often incorrectly recognize that they had heard the word broke and give high levels of remember responses to this false recognition. Drawing on the signal detection account of Wixted and Stretch (2004; see also Donaldson, 1996), Chan and McDermott suggested that the high rates of false remember responses may be due to the misattribution of strong familiarity. According to Wixted and Stretch (2004), participants make remember and know responses on the basis of a single dimension of memory strength, which is based on the overall amount of information that is provided by separate remem- ber and familiarity processes. Consequently, a remember response can be due to the presence of (a) a large amount of remember information and little familiarity information, (b) a large amount of familiarity information and little remember information, or (c) a large amount of both kinds of information. Thus, from this point of view, in both the DRM and pragmatic-inference paradigms, the strong familiarity that is associated with the semantically related lure items on the test may account for erroneous remember re- sponses. This misattribution of strong familiarity account, however, can- not easily explain the false remember responses in the present paradigm. In contrast to the foregoing paradigms in which partic- ipants incorrectly endorse new words as old, in our paradigm participants must attribute items that are already recognized as old to one source or the other and give a remember or know response as a basis for this source attribution. To explain the high levels of false remember responses to erroneous source attributions, the misattribution of familiarity account must predict that items are more familiar when participants respond in a schema-consistent manner than when they respond in a schema-inconsistent manner (e.g., higher familiarity when incorrectly providing a doctor re- sponse to the doctor-related items than when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the lawyer-related items). There was no support for this prediction. If there had been differences in famil- iarity between the items, then this would have produced differ- ences in item recognition. However, recognition rates—as mea- sured by the D parameter, which is equivalent to a corrected recognition score—were no different for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items when they were presented by either a mis- matching or matching source. Yet, despite the absence of these memory differences, there were strong differences in the pattern of illusory recollections. Thus, there is no support for a misattribution of familiarity account of these data. By contrast, fuzzy trace theory provides a compelling explana- tion for our results (e.g., Brainerd, Wright, Reyna, &amp; Mojardin, 2001; 2003). According to this theory, the encoding phase pro- duces two representations for each item: a verbatim representation captures the sensory and perceptual details about the item (e.g., visual information about the face of the source with which it is associated), whereas a gist representation captures the meaning of the item. In the present paradigm, repeated exposure to the doctor- related and lawyer-related items will create very strong gist rep- resentations for the meaning of these two themes. Fuzzy trace theory suggests that phantom (i.e., illusory) recollections can occur in the following manner. First, the theory predicts that the rapid disintegration of verbatim traces will leave behind fragments of information that are no longer bound together, such as a memory for the picture of the doctor source that is unconnected to the statement with which it was initially paired. The second critical prediction about the construction of phantom recollections is that strong gist memories will redintegrate verbatim fragments to pro- duce gist-consistent recollective experiences. For instance, en- countering a lawyer-related statement on the test will activate a strong gist memory for this theme, which will then attract and incorporate unconnected verbatim fragments about the lawyer source so as to construct a schema-consistent illusory source recollection. Overall, then, fuzzy trace theory easily explains the presence of false remember responses to erroneous source attributions with the mechanism that strong gist traces produce schema (i.e., gist)- consistent illusory source recollections. Moreover, it explains the absence of differences in item recognition—and presumably, fa- miliarity—with the assumption that the strength of the gist traces for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items is unaffected by whether they were presented by the doctor source or the lawyer source. Experiment 3 tests fuzzy trace theory and our retrieval expec- tation account. To distinguish between these two accounts, we modified the paradigm in Experiment 2 and created another ex- 4 Given the low false alarm rate to new items, 4 individuals did not produce a false alarm to either one or both types of new item. 469STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS pectation about the likely source of the statements that is indepen- dent of the expectations associated with the gist of the statements. In this experiment, we used the identical materials and proce- dure from Experiment 2 but manipulated the proportion of items presented by the two sources. The neutral proportion condition replicated Experiment 2 and included equal amounts of the doctor- related and lawyer-related items from each source. By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, only 25% of the items that each source presents were stereotype consistent and 75% were stereotype inconsistent. For example, 25% of the items that the doctor source presented were doctor-related and 75% of the items were lawyer-related. Thus, in each proportion condition, partici- pants encountered equivalent numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related items. The only difference between the proportion conditions was how these items were distributed between the two sources. Previous studies show that manipulating the proportion of items that are presented from one source or another changes participants’ expectations about the origin of a memory (e.g., Cook et al., 2003; Dodson &amp; Johnson, 1996). Experiment 3 allowed us to test different predictions of fuzzy trace theory and the retrieval expectation account. According to fuzzy trace theory, illusory (phantom) recollections are created when strong gist traces attract unconnected verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent illusory recollections. From our interpre- tation of this theory, there does not appear to be a mechanism whereby gist traces would attract verbatim fragments that are inconsistent with the meaning of the gist trace. In other words, gist-consistent illusory recollections should always be more likely than gist-inconsistent illusory recollections. Therefore, fuzzy trace theory predicts that the proportion manipulation will have no effect on the pattern of false remember responses. That is, in both the neutral proportion and conflicting proportion conditions, the pat- tern of false remember responses should be schema (i.e., gist)- consistent and correspond to the pattern of false remember re- sponses in Experiment 2. By contrast, the retrieval expectation account predicts that false remember responses are created by any relevant expectation that is prominent during the act of retrieval. Thus, this account predicts that the conflicting proportion condition will completely reverse the pattern of false remember responses that is observed in the neutral proportion condition. Specifically, the neutral proportion condition should produce schema-consistent false remember re- sponses—as it did in Experiment 2—but the conflicting proportion condition should produce schema-inconsistent false remember re- sponses. This outcome would indicate that the illusory recollec- tions that are stereotype-based can be completely reversed by another overriding set of expectations. In short, fuzzy trace theory and the retrieval expectation account make opposite predictions about the pattern of false remember responses in the conflicting proportion condition: Fuzzy trace theory predicts that they will be schema consistent, whereas the retrieval expectation account predicts that they will be proportion consistent and, thus, schema inconsistent. One remaining crucial aspect of this experiment concerns the remember instructions. The definition of remember in the instruc- tions from Experiment 2 (which are the standard instructions in the literature) is sufficiently broad that it is possible that idiosyncratic, but non–source-specifying, details might be recollected and lead to a remember response. For instance, upon seeing a particular test item, participants may not remember any source-identifying details about who presented the item during the study phase, but they may vividly remember how they felt when they saw the item or that their stomach grumbled, which might then contribute to a remem- ber response. To eliminate the possibility of these source-irrelevant and noncriterial remember judgments, we used a definition of remember that is similar to the manner in which we instructed participants to make a response of Tom or Bill in Experiment 1. We instructed participants to give remember responses only when they were aware of specific details that identified one source or the other as the origin of the test item. Method Participants Forty-eight undergraduate students from the University of Vir- ginia participated in this experiment, with 24 participants in each of the two conditions. Design and Materials Except for the noted differences, the overall design and mate- rials were identical to those used in Experiment 2. The stimuli consisted of 96 sentences, with 48 containing doctor-related infor- mation and 48 containing lawyer-related information. There were no neutral statements in this experiment. Each group of 48 sen- tences was divided into six subgroups (i.e., with 8 sentences per subgroup) that served to counterbalance the statements across: (a) the doctor, lawyer, and new sources and (b) the two proportion conditions. During the encoding phase, participants were presented with 64 statements. In the neutral proportion condition, 32 of these statements were presented by the stereotype-consistent source and 32 statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent source (e.g., the doctor source presented 16 of the doctor-related items and 16 of the lawyer-related items). By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, 48 of the profession statements were pre- sented by the stereotype-inconsistent source and 16 statements were presented by the consistent source (e.g., the doctor source presented 24 of the lawyer-related items and 8 of the doctor-related items, and the lawyer source presented 24 of the doctor-related items and 8 of the lawyer-related items). The test contained all 96 statements (64 old items and 32 new items). All other details were identical to the those presented in the Method section of Experi- ment 2. Procedure During the study phase, as in the preceding experiments, par- ticipants were told that they would see sentences that were asso- ciated with the name and picture of one of two men, Tom and Bill. Participants rated how easily they could imagine the pictured person saying the associated sentence. Participants were not in- formed of either the impending memory test or the proportion of doctor-related and lawyer-related sentences that were presented by the two sources. During the test phase, as in the previous experi- ments, participants were told that it might be helpful to know that one source is actually a doctor and the other source is actually a lawyer. In addition, participants in the conflicting proportion con- dition were informed about the proportion manipulation. They 470 DODSON, DARRAGH, AND WILLIAMS were told that they might have noticed that “Tom presented most of the lawyer-related statements and Bill presented most of the doctor-related statements.” Finally, as in the prior experiments, the name, photo, and assigned profession (e.g., Tom, doctor) of each source were shown throughout the test. The format of the memory test was identical to the format used in Experiment 2. Participants responded either Tom, Bill, or new to each test item and, contingent on a response of either Tom or Bill, participants identified the basis of their source identification by giving a remember or know response. However, we changed the instructions slightly for giving a remember response. We directed participants to make remember responses in instances in which their memory of who originally presented the statement is accompanied by a conscious recollection of its prior occurrence in the list of studied statements. Remember is the ability to become consciously aware again of some aspect of how the sentence was presented, such as aspects of the physical appearance of the sentence and the accompa- nying picture of Bill or Tom. In other words the “remembered” answer should bring back to mind a particular visual image or recol- lective details of the statement and its presenter. By contrast, participants were directed to give know judgments when “you recognize that the sentence was in the study set but you cannot consciously recollect anything about its actual occurrence and how it was presented.” Results and Discussion Table 5 presents the conditional source scores for the studied items overall and broken down in terms of source scores for remember judgments and for know judgments. We first examined the overall source scores without regard to whether they were based on remember or know responses. A 2 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like)  2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer)  2 (proportion: neutral vs. conflicting) ANOVA revealed a significant three-way interaction, F(1, 46)  19.90, MSE .229, p  .001, 2  .30, and no other significant effects (all Fs  1.25). The three-way interaction is easily visible in the left column of data in the table. The neutral proportion condition shows the standard match–mismatch effect that was observed in Experiments 1 and 2: Source scores were higher when the profession of the source and the content of the statement matched (.75) than when they mis- matched (.44), F(1, 46)  5.03, p  .05, 2  .10. By contrast, the conflicting proportion condition showed the exact opposite pat- tern: Source scores were higher when there was a mismatch (.77) than when there was a match (.46) between the profession of the source and the content of the statement, F(1, 46)  4.92, p  .05, 2  .10. These results show that the stereotype-based match– mismatch effect can be reversed easily by changing expectations about the likelihood that a particular source is associated with a particular kind of content. We next examined source identification performance that is associated with remember and know responses when there is either a match or a mismatch between the content of the statement and the profession of the source. A 2 (remember vs. know)  2 (match vs. mismatch)  2 (proportion: neutral vs. conflicting) ANOVA of the source scores showed a significant effect of remember–know, reflecting higher overall performance for remember responses than for know responses, F(1, 44)  21.03, MSE .045, p  .001, 2  .32.5 There was also a significant interaction between the match–mismatch and proportion manipulations, F(1, 44)  20.94, MSE  .218, p  .001, 2  .32, indicating, as in the prior analysis, that the match–mismatch effect was reversed in the conflicting proportion condition. There were no other significant effects (all Fs  1). One key point about this analysis is that even when participants claimed to be responding on the basis of remem- bering specific source-identifying details, they were still just as influenced by the match–mismatch manipulation as when they were responding in the absence of remembering source informa- tion (i.e., know judgments). Multinomial Analysis of Source Attributions As we did in the prior experiments, we also analyzed the source attribution data with multinomial models. To focus the comparison on the difference between the neutral proportion condition and the conflicting proportion condition, we constructed a single model for each proportion condition. As seen in Table 6, the best-fitting model for each proportion condition consisted of separate source bias (g) parameters and separate item recognition (D) parameters for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items. Each model also con- tained a single source discrimination (d) parameter, and a single false alarm guessing (b) parameter for both item types. Both models pro- 5 Two participants in the neutral proportion condition never used either a remember or a know response for any of the items, which accounts for the reduced degrees of freedom in this analysis.

In the neutral proportion condition, each source presented equal amounts of doctor-related and lawyer-related items. In the conflicting proportion condition, each source presented 75% of the items that are stereotype inconsistent (e.g., doctor source presented 75% of the lawyer- related items). Parentheses contain the standard error of the mean. 471STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS vided adequate fits to the data, both G2(6)s  9.76, G2(6)critical  12.59. As in Experiment 2, within the neutral proportion condition, the bias to provide a doctor response was significantly greater for the doctor-related statements (g  .67) than for the lawyer-related state- ments (g  .28), G2(1)  134.26, p  .00001. However, there was no difference in source discrimination for the two different item types (i.e., d  .30 for both statement types). The conflicting condition showed a similar effect: no difference in source discrimination for the two different item types (i.e., d  .36 for both statement types) but a stronger bias to give a doctor response for the lawyer-like statements (g  .70) than for the doctor-like statements (g  .27), G2(1)  132.49, p  .00001. Most importantly, when comparing the neutral proportion con- dition against the conflicting proportion condition, the only differ- ence occurred with the source bias (g) parameter. The tendency to respond in a schema-consistent manner in the neutral condition was completely reversed in the conflicting condition. For instance, the bias to give a doctor response to the doctor-related items was significantly stronger in the neutral proportion condition (g  .67) than in the conflicting proportion condition (g  .27), G2(1)  135.63, p  .00001. Likewise, there was a much weaker bias to give a doctor response to the lawyer-like statements in the neutral condition (g  .28) than in the conflicting condition (.70), G2(1)  142.89, p  .00001. By contrast, there was no difference between the neutral and conflicting proportion conditions for any of the other parameters, all G2(1)s  1. Overall, then, the results are as expected. Manipulating the proportion of items that are presented by one source or the other had no effect on either item recognition or source discrimination, but it had a massive effect on the bias to respond with one source or the other. However, the key question that this analysis cannot answer is how is the proportion manipulation producing this change in the bias parameter? In other words, do the large changes in the bias parameter across the two proportion conditions reflect changes in illusory recollections, changes in strategic guessing, or some combination of these two processes? Subjective Experience of Correct and Incorrect Source Attributions The fundamental point of this experiment concerns the subjec- tive experience for erroneous source attributions in the neutral proportion and conflicting proportion conditions. If illusory recol- lections are caused either by well-learned semantic categories or by the capacity of strong gist traces to attract gist-consistent verbatim details, then we should observe a similar pattern of false remember responses in both proportion conditions: higher rates of false remember judgments to incorrect source attributions that are schema-consistent than to those that are schema-inconsistent. By contrast, if illusory recollections are influenced by expectations about the likelihood of a particular source presenting a particular kind of item, then we should observe higher schema-consistent false remember responses in the neutral proportion condition but higher schema-inconsistent (i.e., proportion consistent) false re- member responses in the conflicting proportion condition. A 2 (response: stereotype consistent vs. stereotype inconsis- tent)  2 (correct vs. incorrect)  2 (proportion: neutral vs. conflicting) ANOVA of the proportion of source attributions that were assigned remember judgments produced a significant effect of correct–incorrect responses, F(1, 37)  14.69, MSE .066, p  .001, 2  .28, with higher rates of remember judgments for correct than for incorrect responses.6 There was also a three-way interaction, F(1, 37)  17.03, MSE  .033, p  .001, 2  .32, but no other significant effects (all Fs  1.13). The three-way interaction is visible in Figure 2. As seen in the top half of Figure 2, when participants make correct source attri- butions, there are no differences in the two proportion conditions in the subjective state of remembering that are associated with source attributions that are either schema consistent or schema inconsistent (both ts  1.74, ps  .28). By contrast, as shown in the bottom half of Figure 2, when participants make incorrect source attributions, there are very different patterns of false re- member responses in the two proportion conditions. In the neutral proportion condition (i.e., each source presents equal numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related items), when participants make incorrect source attributions, they are more often in a subjective state of remembering when these attributions are schema consis- tent (.42) than when they are schema inconsistent (.30), t(18)  3.44, p  .01. However, the exact opposite pattern is visible in the conflicting proportion condition. Here, when participants make incorrect source attributions, they give higher rates of remember responses to schema-inconsistent attributions (.52) than to schema- consistent attributions (.32), t(19)  2.23, p  .05. These data exactly fit the predictions of our retrieval expectation account. Overall, then, the proportion manipulation selectively affects the phenomenological experience that is associated with incorrect source attributions. Critically, and consistent with the predictions of our retrieval expectation account, the false remember responses correspond to the expectations established by the proportion ma- nipulation. For erroneous source attributions in the conflicting proportion condition, there are higher rates of false remember responses to schema-inconsistent attributions than to the schema- 6 Four participants in the conflicting proportion condition and 5 individ- uals in the neutral proportion condition made either no incorrect or no correct responses for a particular item.

In the neutral proportion condition, each source presents equal amounts of doctor-related and lawyer-related items, whereas in the conflicting proportion condition, each source presents 75% of the items that are schema inconsistent (e.g., the doctor source presents 75% of the lawyer-related items). Vertical lines indicate the standard error of the mean. 473STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS consistent attributions, whereas the opposite pattern occurs in the neutral proportion condition. Can a criterion account explain these differences in subjective states? For example, in the neutral proportion condition, are par- ticipants generally more likely to assign remember judgments to stereotype-consistent attributions than to stereotype-inconsistent attributions? We investigated this question, as we did in Experi- ment 2, by examining how often participants give remember judgments to the doctor-related new items and lawyer-related new items that are falsely recognized and are attributed to either the doctor or the lawyer source. In the neutral proportion condition, there were no significant differences in the proportion of remem- ber judgments that were assigned to new items that were falsely attributed to either a stereotype-consistent (.32) or a stereotype- inconsistent (.47) source, t(13)  1.44.7 As in Experiment 2, the trend is in a direction that is opposite the predictions of the criterion account: Participants more often gave remember judg- ments to new items that were attributed to the stereotype- inconsistent source than to new items attributed to the stereotype- consistent source. Similarly, in the conflicting proportion condition, there were no significant differences in the proportion of remember judgments that were assigned to new items that were falsely attributed to either a stereotype-consistent (.33) or a stereotype-inconsistent (.39) source, t(12)  1.8 Overall, then, as we observed in Experiment 2, there is no support for a lenient- criterion explanation of the pattern of illusory recollections. There is an alternative interpretation of Experiment 3 that is con- sistent with fuzzy trace theory. This interpretation assumes that two different kinds of gist representations are created in this experiment. An item-gist representation refers to the meaning of the doctor-related and lawyer-related items. By contrast, a source-gist representation refers to the meaning or characteristics of the two sources that are derived from the proportion of items that each source presents. For instance, in the conflicting proportion condition, participants may develop gist representations about the fact that one source tended to present doctor-related materials and the other source tended to present lawyer-related material. If this source-gist representation is suffi- ciently strong to produce illusory/phantom recollections, then fuzzy trace theory may be able to explain these results. Specifically, fuzzy trace theory would argue that in the conflicting proportion condition, the source-gist representation produces phantom recollections that, in turn, contribute to a higher rate of false remember responses to the schema-inconsistent attributions than to the schema-consistent attri- butions. However, because there are two different kinds of gist rep- resentations that potentially produce opposite patterns of behavior, what remains to be specified in fuzzy trace theory is how it is that one kind of gist representation can dominate performance over another kind of gist representation. In sum, this experiment shows that expectations that are estab- lished on the fly from noting the frequency that a kind of statement was presented from a particular person are sufficient to produce illusory recollections. General Discussion In these experiments, participants initially studied two people presenting lawyer-related (e.g., “you face a fine”), doctor-related (e.g., “you have a fever”), and profession-neutral sentences. When participants were told, on a subsequent memory test, that one person was actually a doctor and the other was a lawyer, there was a strong tendency to remember and attribute the test items in a stereotype-consistent manner, such as incorrectly responding that the doctor presented the majority of the doctor-related sentences. One of the essential questions of this article is whether guessing processes or illusory recollections are the basis for these erroneous source attributions. The standard explanation of this kind of data is that expectations and stereotypes alter an individual’s strategy for evaluating remembered information so that individuals are prone to guess in a stereotype-consistent manner, particularly when they fail to recollect specific information about who initially presented the item. We show that this standard account is incorrect. When stereo- types and expectations are activated at retrieval, they create illu- sory recollections, which make a vital contribution to source attributions. In both Experiment 2 and in the neutral proportion condition of Experiment 3, participants often reported “remember- ing” specific details to justify incorrect source attributions that were made to the stereotype-consistent source (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to doctor-related items). By contrast, participants in these conditions frequently used know responses to justify erroneous source attributions that were made to the stereotype-inconsistent source. It is worth noting that our studies differ from typical investigations of schemas, stereotypes, and expectations in that we only activated the profession stereo- type at retrieval, whereas in most studies the stereotype, schema, or expectation is present at encoding. Thus, we have shown how retrieval conditions can produce illusory recollections. These experiments rule out a number of alternative explanations for the occurrence of illusory recollections. Both Experiments 2 and 3 show that a lenient-criterion account for making false remember responses is not a viable explanation of the data. This lenient criterion account suggests that participants are more likely to make remember judgments when responding in a stereotype-consistent manner than when responding in a stereotype-inconsistent manner. Thus, this ac- count predicts that when participants falsely recognize new items, they should give more remember judgments to stereotype-consistent attributions than to stereotype-inconsistent attributions. This was not the case. In both Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, there were no differences in the rate at which participants gave remember judgments to new items that were attributed to the stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent sources. Another potential explanation of the false remember responses is that they are a byproduct of the misattribution of strong famil- iarity, which has served as a plausible account in other paradigms (e.g., Chan &amp; McDermott, 2006). In the present paradigm, in order to explain the high levels of false remember responses to errone- ous, but stereotype-consistent, source attributions, the misattribu- tion of familiarity account must predict higher levels of familiarity for these items than for items that elicit erroneous but stereotype- inconsistent source attributions. Higher levels of familiarity would contribute to higher recognition rates. But, there were no differ- ences in recognition rates for the doctor-related and lawyer-related 7 Given the low false alarm rates to the new items, there were 10 participants who did not produce a false alarm to either the doctor-related new items or the lawyer-related new items. 8 Given the low false alarm rates to the new items, there were 11 participants who did not produce a false alarm to either the doctor-related new items or the lawyer-related new items. 474 DODSON, DARRAGH, AND WILLIAMS items when they were presented by either a stereotype-consistent or a stereotype-inconsistent source. Therefore, there is no support for an explanation of the false remember responses that is based on the misattribution of strong familiarity. Fuzzy trace theory has successfully explained the occurrence of illusory recollections in a variety of different paradigms. This theory predicts that phantom (i.e., illusory) recollections are cre- ated when strong gist traces attract and incorporate unconnected verbatim fragments into a gist-consistent illusory recollection (e.g., Brainerd et al., 2001; 2003). This theory easily explains the stereotype-consistent false remember data from Experiments 1 and 2. Repeated exposure to the doctor-related and lawyer-related items creates strong gist memories for these two themes, which then attract stereotype-consistent contextual details about these items, thus explaining why participants report remembering details to justify erroneous source attributions. Experiment 3, however, suggests that illusory recollections in this paradigm may not be caused by strong gist traces or by well-learned schemas about items. This experiment created an expectation about the likely source of items by manipulating the proportion of profession items that were presented by each source. In the neutral proportion condition, each source presented equal amounts of the doctor-related and lawyer-related items, whereas in the conflicting proportion condition, each source presented 75% of the items that were stereotype inconsistent and conflicted with the profession of the source (e.g., the doctor source presented 75% of the lawyer-related items). We observed that in the neutral propor- tion condition, the false remember responses were primarily ste- reotype consistent, as in Experiment 2. By contrast, in the conflicting-proportion condition, the false remember responses were primarily stereotype inconsistent but proportion consistent. Even though participants had built up equivalently strong gist traces for the themes of the items in the two proportion conditions, there were opposite patterns of illusory recollections in these two conditions. However, our interpretation assumes that participants do not form gist representations about the proportion of items that each source presents. If they do, and if these source gist represen- tations are sufficiently strong, then fuzzy trace theory may be able to explain these results. Overall, then, the data suggest that any expectation that is salient during the act of retrieval is sufficient to create illusory recollections that are consistent with this expectation. In Experiments 1 and 2, the salient expectation was established by the individual’s general knowl- edge about doctors and lawyers. By contrast, in Experiment 3, the expectation was created by the likelihood that a particular item was associated with a particular source. More generally, these results suggest that any set of preconceptions is sufficient to make an indi- vidual vulnerable to recollecting—rightly or wrongly—specific de- tails that are consistent with these expectations. However, it is important to emphasize that if expectations alone were all that mattered, then we should have observed the same pattern of results for source attributions to new items that were falsely recognized as old as we did for erroneous source attribu- tions to old items. This was not the case. In both Experiments 2 and 3, the false remember responses for source attributions to new items were not affected by either the schema-expectations manip- ulation or the proportion manipulation. Consequently, the mecha- nism that is contributing to illusory recollections is not purely a retrieval phenomenon. Instead, a preexisting memory trace appears to be a requirement. Although the exact mechanism remains to be specified, we suggest that expectations during retrieval influence the specification of the retrieval cue so that participants tend to seek out and activate expectation-confirming information, which is combined with activated information from the memory trace to produce an expectation-consistent illusory recollection. Our account has much in common with the accessibility account of B. K. Payne et al. (2004). Using a similar paradigm, Payne et al. observed a pattern of biased memory performance involving racial stereotypes. Their participants read a list of stereotypically Black and White names. Each category of names was associated in equal amounts with either a stereotypically Black or White occupation. On a subsequent memory test, when given the name as a cue to remember the associated occupation, participants showed a clear pattern of stereotypically related memory errors: Incorrect re- sponses were more likely to be stereotype consistent than stereo- type inconsistent. Payne et al. used a multinomial model, derived from Jacoby’s (1991) process dissociation approach, to explain the pattern of performance. They observed that stereotypes selectively affected the accessibility bias parameter of their model. Impor- tantly, their bias parameter does not reflect strategic guessing but rather measures an unconscious accessibility to stereotype infor- mation. B. K. Payne et al. (2004) suggested that stereotypes increase the likelihood of information coming “to mind not be- cause of prior exposure but because it is related to other informa- tion organized within a stereotype schema” (p. 55). We also suggest that stereotypes and expectations bring information to mind, which produces an illusory recollection. The crucial difference between our expectation account and B. K. Payne et al. (2004) accessibility account depends, in part, on how each account characterizes the phenomenal characteristics of the expectation-consistent information that is brought to mind. Payne et al. suggested that this information is unconscious and implicitly biases performance, which, these authors suggest, is why it is difficult to consciously oppose the influence of these biases. By contrast, we suggest that this information is consciously accessible and is phenom- enally similar to veridical recollections, which is why our participants had difficulty in Experiment 1 “gating out” incorrect responses so as to reduce the impact of stereotypes (i.e., they had trouble distinguish- ing correct from incorrect recollections). However, the strongest ev- idence for the conscious accessibility of this expectation-consistent information is that it causes participants to justify erroneous source attributions on the basis of a conscious recollection (e.g., in Experi- ments 2 and 3, the higher false remember responses for incorrect, but schema-consistent, source attributions than for schema-inconsistent source attributions). The occurrence of stereotype-provoked illusory recollections shows that there is not always an inverse relationship between the influence of stereotypes and the process of recollecting specific individuating information, contrary to many social psychological theories (e.g., Kunda &amp; Thagard, 1996; Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000; Spears &amp; Haslam, 1997). In other words, recollection cannot always combat the influence of stereotypes when recollection itself is a process that is vulnerable to distortion. A full accounting of the effects of stereotypes, expectations, and general knowledge on performance requires the roles of both illusory recollections and strategic guessing processes. Although Experiments 2 and 3 indicate that there is not an inverse relation- ship between the influences of stereotypes and recollection (i.e., 475STEREOTYPES AND ILLUSORY RECOLLECTIONS recollection did not counteract the influence of stereotypes), there is much evidence documenting an inverse relationship between recollection and strategic guessing processes (e.g., Collins, War- nock, Aiello &amp; Miller, 1975; Dodson &amp; Schacter, 2002; Hicks &amp; Marsh, 1999; Johnson, Raye, Foley, &amp; Foley, 1981; Schacter, Israel, &amp; Racine, 1999). For instance, individuals can use a deci- sion strategy—the distinctiveness heuristic—to reject false mem- ories when they fail to recollect expected information about a test item (e.g., Dodson &amp; Schacter, 2002; Gallo, Weiss, &amp; Schacter, 2004; Schacter et al., 1999). Stereotypes can fuel a similar infer- ential decision process so that participants guess in a stereotype- consistent manner when they fail to remember specific informa- tion. The SMF is perhaps the best model of the interplay between decision processes and recollective experience (e.g., Johnson et al., 1993). According to this framework, individuals can flexibly weight recollective information and other decision processes de- pending on the rememberer’s goals and knowledge (e.g., if we happened to be participants in the paradigm in this article, then we would be hesitant to weight heavily recollective information given the occurrence of illusory recollections). In other words, the SMF predicts that although there is often an inverse relationship be- tween recollective experience and the use of strategic guessing processes—given the typically higher diagnostic value of the former than the latter—this will not always be the case, particu- larly in situations where individuals are made aware of the unre- liability of their recollections. One final implication of these results concerns multinomial models of source monitoring (e.g., Batchelder &amp; Riefer, 1990, 1999). All multinomial models of source monitoring, including those of one of the present study authors (e.g., Dodson, Holland, &amp; Shimamura, 1998; Dodson &amp; Shimamura, 2000), assume that erroneous source attributions are based entirely on the influence of guessing biases when participants fail to recollect source information. We have shown that this assumption is incorrect. Thus, a question of paramount importance for multinomial modelers of source memory is whether it is possible to develop a model that can separate the influence of illusory recollections from guessing processes. Conclusion These experiments show that we are trapped by our experiences and expectations so that we tend to falsely recollect details that support our preconceptions. As long as we are prone to misre- membering the past on the basis of the perspective of the present, then there are problematic implications for minimizing the influ- ence of stereotypes. When presented with new information at retrieval about who was a doctor and who was a lawyer, partici- pants spontaneously misrecollected that the wrong person pre- sented a statement when the statement was consistent with expec- tations about what a doctor or a lawyer would say. These results suggest that other stereotypes, such as those about race and gender, also will create subjectively compelling and yet illusory recollec- tions that are consistent with the stereotype. However, the diffi- culty of distinguishing true recollections from false recollections will serve to maintain the influence of stereotypes. In other words, the influence of illusory recollections cannot be easily combated by using counter stereotypical decision processes, as we natural- ly—and sometimes wrongly—infer that what we are recollecting is a faithful reflection of the past.
