          <p id="s1p1">Short Report Genes and Popularity Evidence of an Evocative Gene-Environment Correlation S. Alexandra Burt Michigan State University Extant research on gene-environment interplay centers almost exclusively on environmental moderation of genetic expression (G  E interaction). However, there is another key source of gene-environment interplay: gene-environment correlation (rGE). Such correlations are defined as nonrandom environmental ex- posure, such that individuals elicit (i.e., evocative rGE) or select (i.e., active rGE) experiences consistent with their genotypes (Plomin, DeFries, &amp; Loehlin, 1977; Scarr &amp; McCartney, 1983). Though rGE is acknowledged to be a fundamental component of gene-environment interplay (Rutter &amp; Silberg, 2002) on theoretical grounds, the difficulty of disambiguating character- istics of the individual from his or her experiences has stymied empirical support for rGE. Indeed, no study (see Jaffee &amp; Price, 2007) has yet directly evaluated the core proposition of evoca- tive rGE: Are particular social experiences evoked by one’s genotype? The aim of the current study was to do just this via a novel design combining molecular genetics and social psy- chology experimental techniques. METHOD Two samples of undergraduate men (average age5 19) at a large Midwestern research university participated in this study. Sample 1 consisted of 132men in 32 groups; 127 of themenwere included in analyses (5 were excluded because they had little usable DNA or their DNA did not amplify). These participants were representative of the area’s ethnic composition; 80% were European American. Sample 2 consisted of 88 European American men who participated in 23 groups; 82 of these men were included in analyses (6 were excluded because of DNA issues). Each group, consisting of 3 to 5 previously unacquainted individuals, completed party-planning and brain-teaser tasks (intended primarily to promote interactions among group members). After 45 to 60 min, participants adjourned to indi- vidual rooms to complete sociometric rankings (on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 meaning ‘‘I liked this person best’’; ratings were reverse-scored prior to analysis) and ratings (on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 meaning ‘‘strongly dislike relative to other people I know’’) of each group member. The two-way random-effects social relations model (SRM; Kenny, 1994) was used to analyze the sociometric data. The SRM estimates, among other things, what are referred to as partner effects. Partner effects index each participant’s general tendency to be liked by other group members irrespective of that participant’s own tendency to like others. This model thus al- lowed me to disambiguate each participant’s social preferences from those of others, so that I could explicitly capture the evocative component of peer selection (hereafter referred to as ‘‘popularity’’). Analyses focused on a polymorphism within the promoter region of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor gene (-G1438A, also known as rs6311). The serotonergic system has been robustly tied to social selection in ambiguous social settings (see Insel &amp; Winslow, 1998). For example, in a randomized, double-blind design, Knutson et al. (1998) administered a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a placebo to normal volunteers for 4 weeks. Socially affiliative behaviors increased in the group re- ceiving the SSRI and had a correlation of .65 with plasma SSRI levels. As the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, including -G1438A, has been associated with SSRI response (Choi, Kang, Ham, Jeong, &amp; Lee, 2005; Kato et al., 2006), it seemed plausible that -G1438A is involved in social status. DNA was obtained via Oragene (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) saliva collection kits. -G1438Awas analyzed on an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system using TaqMan Universal PCR Mas- ter Mix and assays, according to Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) protocols. Allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both samples, w2(1,Ns5 127 and 82)&lt; 1.1, n.s. FINDINGS In both samples, rankings and ratings contained significant partner effects (which accounted for 14–24% of the variance in the rankings and ratings).

PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 112 Volume 19—Number 2Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at UNIV OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ on April 4, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from consensus within groups concerning each member’s popularity. Partner effects for ratings and rankings were highly correlated (r 5 .82, p &lt; .001) and were therefore averaged to indicate popularity in subsequent analyses. -G1438A was significantly associated with popularity (see Table 1), accounting for 5 to 8% of its variance. Critically, the association found in Sample 1 was largely replicated in Sample 2,1 which suggests that the effect is robust to sampling variation. Such findings are consistent with those of prior studies linking serotonergic activity to social status in ambiguous social settings (Insel &amp; Winslow, 1998; Knutson et al., 1998). To my knowledge, however, the current study is the first to extend these results to the molecular genetic level of analysis. These new findings offer the most direct evi- dence to date of an evocative rGE whereby individuals’ genes predispose them to particular social outcomes. It is important to note that these findings apply only to first impressions. It is unclear how they map onto actual friendships. The specific behaviors mediating the observed association also remain unidentified. As it is not biologically feasible for -G1438A to code directly for other individuals’ social prefer- ences, future research should identify the socially relevant be- haviors driving this association. Also, the results suggest a nonlinear or dominant effect of the G allele in Sample 1, and a linear or dose-response effect in Sample 2. Future research should clarify whether one or two G alleles are necessary for the effect. Finally, this study examined only one polymorphism in two small samples of adolescent males. Future research should examine other polymorphisms in larger samples that include females. Despite these limitations, the current results suggest that individuals’ genes predispose them not only to particular be- haviors, but also to the social consequences of their behaviors. These findings highlight the pervasive (if indirect) role of ge- netic influences on the human experience. Though the current study does not address the long-term consequences of these evocative experiences, one would expect them to moderate the future expression of genetic influences. Put differently, rGE effects are likely to underlie (and perhaps confound) any Ge- notype  Peer interactions. Thus, researchers should consider rGE when attempting to investigate G  E.

Popularity was z-scored (M 5 0.0, SD 5 1.0) in each sample. Analyses were conducted using both linear correlations and multiple regression with two contrast codes (to explicitly test linearity and nonlinearity of the genotypic effect). 1In Sample 1, the variance explained increased from 4% (square of the Pearson correlation) to 8% when the analysis allowed for nonlinearity. By contrast, R2 remained unchanged in Sample 2 (5% for correlation, 5% for contrast codes), though only the correlation was statistically significant (likely because estimating more than one parameter attenuates power in small sam- ples).
