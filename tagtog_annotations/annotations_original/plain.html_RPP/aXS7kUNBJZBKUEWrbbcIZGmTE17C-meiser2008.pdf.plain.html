Stochastic dependence between the retrieval of different context attributes, which formed the empirical criterion of binding, was observed for remem- bered items but not for known items. Experiment 1 showed that the qualitative difference in the stochastic relation holds even if quantitative source-memory performance is equated for items with remember and know judgments. Experiment 2 generalized the findings to context information from different modalities, and Experiment 3 ruled out a spurious stochastic dependence due to interindividual differences. Supporting recent dual-process models of remember–know judgments, the findings show that remember and know judgments differ with respect to binding processes that correspond to episodic recollection. Keywords: binding, remember–know paradigm, multidimensional source memory, multinomial model- ing Recognition of an event from the past as “old” may be based on experienced familiarity with the event or on conscious recollection of the event’s prior occurrence. The distinction between familiarity and recol- lection forms the core assumption of several dual-process models of recognition memory (Gardiner, 1988; Jacoby, 1991; Jacoby, Kelley, &amp; McElree, 1999; Mandler, 1980; Tulving, 1985; Yonelinas, 1994; see Yonelinas, 2002, for an overview). According to these models, familiarity is based on item-specific memory strength, whereas recollection includes the retrieval of details of the learning situation. The theoretical distinction between familiarity and recollection has gained support in numerous studies using a variety of methodological approaches. For example, investigations of the time course of familiarity-based and recollection-based memory judgments showed that the influence of familiarity precedes that of recollection and that memory errors triggered by early familiarity can be corrected by subsequent recollection (Dosher, 1984; Gronlund &amp; Ratcliff, 1989; McElree, Dolan, &amp; Jacoby, 1999; Yonelinas &amp; Jacoby, 1994). Further evidence for the distinct roles of familiarity and recollection has stemmed from dissociations between recollection-based and familiarity-based responses by experimental manipulations (e.g., Dewhurst &amp; Anderson, 1999; Gardiner, Gawlik, &amp; Richardson-Klavehn, 1994; Jacoby, 1996; Mäntylä &amp; Raudsepp, 1996; Rajaram, 1993; Ra- jaram &amp; Geraci, 2000; Toth, Reingold, &amp; Jacoby, 1994) or quasi- experimental analyses of different age groups (Jennings &amp; Jacoby, 1993) and amnesic patients (e.g., Huppert &amp; Piercy, 1978; Knowlton &amp; Squire, 1995; Yonelinas, Kroll, Dobbins, Lazzara, &amp; Knight, 1998). The distinction between recollection and familiarity was also substantiated in studies of brain activity using event-related poten- tials (Curran, 2000; Mecklinger, 2000; Rugg, Schloerscheidt, &amp; Mark, 1998) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (Brewer, Zhao, Desmond, Glover, &amp; Gabrieli, 1998; Eldridge, Knowlton, Furmanski, Bookheimer, &amp; Engel, 2000; Henson, Rugg, Shallice, Josephs, &amp; Dolan, 1999; Yonelinas, Otten, Shaw, &amp; Rugg, 2005). These studies revealed a differential time course and topographic distribution of brain activity corresponding to familiarity and rec- ollection, with a specific involvement of the hippocampus and prefrontal regions in the creation and retrieval of memories that comprise the recollection of episodic details. Moreover, it has been shown that different regions in the medial temporal lobe are related to recollection and familiarity and that these regions can indepen- dently contribute to recognition memory (Aggleton &amp; Brown, 1999; Ranganath et al., 2003). In line with this functional differ- entiation of the medial temporal lobe, patients with lesions of the hippocampus show selective impairments of recollection, whereas patients with lesions that extend to regions surrounding the hip- pocampus, including the parahippocampus and perirhinal cortex, also show deficits in familiarity (Yonelinas et al., 2002). Cognitive Processes Underlying Remember and Know Judgments A commonly used approach to assess whether an event is recognized on the basis of conscious recollection or familiarity is the remember–know paradigm (Gardiner, 1988; Gardiner &amp; Java, Thorsten Meiser and Kerstin Weißer, Department of Psychology, Jena University, Jena, Germany; Christine Sattler, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Science, Leipzig, Germany. This research was supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungs- gemeinschaft to Thorsten Meiser (DFG, ME 1918/1).

In this paradigm, participants decide whether items were presented in a previous learning list (response old) or not (response new). For those items that are judged old, participants also indicate whether recognition of the item is ac- companied by the conscious recollection of the item’s prior oc- currence (remember judgment) or whether recognition relies on familiarity-based knowing that the item occurred without con- scious recollection of the encoding episode (know judgment). Although several studies demonstrated experimental dissocia- tions between the rates of remember and know responses (e.g., Dewhurst &amp; Anderson, 1999; Gardiner, 1988; Gardiner et al., 1994; Rajaram, 1993) and different patterns of brain activity as correlates of remember and know judgments (e.g., Eldridge et al., 2000; Henson et al., 1999), there is an ongoing debate whether remember–know judgments actually reflect different memory pro- cesses and, thus, to which extent they can be taken as valid indicators of recollection and familiarity. Several authors have argued that a unidimensional model of memory strength may provide an appropriate account of remember–know judgments that is more parsimonious than a model with two distinct memory processes (Donaldson, 1996; Hirshman &amp; Henzler, 1998; Inoue &amp; Bellezza, 1998). The unidimensional strength model is specified in the framework of signal-detection theory with two response crite- ria, one for the decision to respond know rather than new and the other for the decision to respond remember rather than know. According to this model, remember responses indicate stronger memories than do know responses, but no difference in the under- lying cognitive processes is assumed for remember and know judgments. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that the unidi- mensional signal-detection theory model is sufficient to capture dissociations between observed rates of remember and know re- sponses (Dunn, 2004; Hirshman &amp; Master, 1997), which had previously been interpreted as evidence for distinct cognitive pro- cesses underlying the states of remembering and knowing (e.g., Gardiner, 1988; M. A. Wheeler, Stuss, &amp; Tulving, 1997). The power of the unidimensional memory-strength model to explain data from the remember–know paradigm challenges the view that remember and know judgments reflect different memory processes corresponding to conscious recollection and familiarity. Recently, more integrative models were proposed that maintain the core dual-process assumption but abandoned the interpretation that remember and know judgments are direct indicators of recollection and familiarity (Rotello, Macmillan, &amp; Reeder, 2004; Wixted, 2007; Wixted &amp; Stretch, 2004). These models assume two con- tinuous memory dimensions, one for global memory strength or familiarity and the other for specific memory strength or recollec- tion, but the models differ with respect to the mapping of the two memory dimensions onto the remember and know response cate- gories. While Rotello et al. (2004) specified an additive relation of global and specific memory strength for old–new discrimination but a subtractive relation of specific minus global memory strength for remember–know judgments, Wixted (2007; Wixted &amp; Stretch, 2004) proposed an additive linear combination of recollection and familiarity for old–new decisions as well as remember–know judgments. In either case, these models imply that remember and know judgments reflect mixtures of recollection and familiarity rather than process-pure indicators of different cognitive states. In the face of the ongoing debate concerning the nature of remember– know judgments, the present research investigates whether remember and know responses reflect distinct cognitive processes that correspond to conscious recollection and familiarity. As elaborated in the following section, recollection is intimately tied to the associative binding of episodic features of an event and its context into a conjunctive memory representation. We therefore analyze whether remember–know judgments mirror the critical distinction between recollection and familiarity in terms of asso- ciative binding. Our experiments thereby aim to shed new light on the cognitive processes underlying remember–know judgments and to test the competing theoretical models of unidimensional memory strength and dual processes. Conscious Recollection and Binding Building on the convergent evidence that familiarity and recollection are separable components of recognition memory as summarized above, conscious recollection can be conceptualized as comprising various per- ceptual features of an event and its learning context that are bound in a coherent episodic memory representation (M. A. Wheeler et al., 1997; Yonelinas, 2002). The relation between binding processes and conscious recollection was corroborated by behavioral findings which showed that binding of multiple pieces of information involves attention-demanding cognitive processes that also form the basis of conscious recollection. For example, the rate of conjunction errors (i.e., false recognition of recom- binations of features from different items) was demonstrated to increase under cognitive load (Reinitz, Morrissey, &amp; Demb, 1994; Treisman &amp; Schmidt, 1982; M. E. Wheeler &amp; Treisman, 2002) and for compound stimuli that are processed simultaneously in working memory (Reinitz &amp; Hannigan, 2001, 2004), indicating that the integration of multiple features of a stimulus into a coherent memory representation relies on attentional resources. Attention-demanding processes of binding multiple item and context attributes into a joint representation were further presumed to form the basis of explicit as opposed to implicit memory (Groh-Bordin, Zimmer, &amp; Mecklinger, 2005; Metcalfe, 2002; Metcalfe, Cottrell, &amp; Mencl, 1992) and of context-dependent recognition (Murnane, Phelps, &amp; Malmberg, 1999). Together, this line of research suggests that feature binding draws on resource-demanding processes that are also engaged in episodic memory and conscious recollection (e.g., Gardiner &amp; Parkin, 1990; Jacoby, 1996). Inasmuch as familiarity is evoked by more auto- matic processes, in contrast, familiarity should not rely on attention- demanding feature binding and coherent memory representations of co- occurring item and context features. The notion that feature binding is a distinctive characteristic of conscious recollection as opposed to familiarity-based recognition has further gained support in studies from the cognitive neurosciences, which revealed increased brain activation associated with conscious recollection in regions that are specialized for the integration of sensory information from different brain areas. In particular, event- related imaging studies showed that the experience of conscious recollection is related to increased activity of prefrontal regions and the hippocampus (e.g., Eldridge et al., 2000; Henson et al., 1999; Ranganath et al., 2003; Yonelinas et al., 2005; see Rugg &amp; Henson, 2002, for an overview). Other studies have demonstrated that the frontal lobes are essentially involved in the integration and mainte- nance of multimodal information in working memory (Prabhakaran, Narayanan, Zhao, &amp; Gabrieli, 2000) and that the hippocampus serves 33BINDING AND REMEMBERING the specialized function of binding multiple pieces of information into conjunctive long-term memory representations of episodic events (Broadbent, Clark, Zola, &amp; Squire, 2002; O’Reilly &amp; Rudy, 2001; Rudy &amp; O’Reilly, 2001; Shimamura, 2002). Similar conclusions can be drawn from neuropsychological studies, which showed that am- nesic patients with lesions of the hippocampus suffer from a selective memory impairment for the combination of fragments of compound stimuli whereas memory for the individual fragments is largely pre- served (Kroll, Knight, Metcalfe, Wolf, &amp; Tulving, 1996; Reinitz, Verfaellie, &amp; Milberg, 1996). In particular, the amnesics’ memory deficit was most pronounced for combinations that contained different sorts of information, like combinations of words with temporal order or combinations of visual with acoustic information, whereas only minor memory deficits were observed for combinations of same-sort information, like combinations of different words or different voices (Mayes et al., 2001; Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997). These findings have supported the conceptualization of the hippocampal memory system as integrating information from different cortical regions and sensory modalities (Eichenbaum &amp; Cohen, 2001). The observed in- crease in frontal lobe and hippocampus activity in the case of con- scious recollection therefore suggests that recollection is closely re- lated to feature binding in memory and, especially, to the binding of features from different modalities. In the present research, the established theoretical and empirical link between binding and conscious recollection was taken as criterion in examining the cognitive processes underlying remember– know judgments. Although remember– know judg- ments cannot be expected to be process-pure measures of latent cognitive processes, they can be interpreted as indicators of pre- dominantly recollection-based and predominantly familiarity- based recognition if they reliably differentiate between memories that entail the binding of episodic features within and across modalities and memories that do not entail binding. Assessment of Binding by Multidimensional Source Memory To analyze the relation between remember judgments and bind- ing, we combined the remember–know paradigm with a source- memory task. Source memory contains memory for the conditions under which an event was encountered, like the physical and social context of the event or the internal state of the perceiver at encoding (Johnson, Hashtroudi, &amp; Lindsay, 1993; Mitchell &amp; Johnson, 2000). Source memory has therefore been taken as an index of successful binding of item and context information, over and above memory for the item and for the context attribute alone (Chalfonte &amp; Johnson, 1996; Mather et al., 2006; Mitchell, John- son, Raye, &amp; D’Esposito, 2000). Recently, the analysis of binding processes was extended to multidimensional source memory, which includes the retrieval of different context attributes of an event in memory (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2007; Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005). Multidimensional source-memory tests allow not only the assessment of source memory for each of two dimensions of context information, but they also afford an analysis of the stochastic relation between the retrieval of two context features as an empirical criterion of binding. Stochastic depen- dence of the kind that one context feature is more likely to be retrieved if the other feature is also retrieved, as compared with the retrieval of one feature alone, signals that the item and the two context features are bound into a coherent memory representation that preserves the configuration of co-occurring attributes and facilitates the joint retrieval of context features. If there is stochas- tic independence, such that the probability of retrieving one con- text feature does not vary depending on whether the other feature is retrieved, the context attributes are not bound into an integrated episodic memory trace that would increase the likelihood of their joint retrieval relative to their separate retrieval. The combination of the remember–know paradigm with a mul- tidimensional source-memory task thus allows one to test whether feature binding is a distinctive characteristic of events that receive a remember judgment as opposed to events that receive a know judgment. If remember and know judgments reflect predominantly recollection-based and familiarity-based recognition, respectively, the retrieval of two context features should be stochastically de- pendent in the case of remember judgments and stochastically independent in the case of know judgments. These predictions were initially confirmed in experiments that extended a multidi- mensional source memory test by remember–know judgments (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2007; Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005). In these experiments, words were presented at different locations and in different sizes, and source memory for size was significantly better in conjunction with source memory for location than it was without source memory for location. Importantly, this stochastic dependence was observed only for words that received a remember judgment, whereas there was no stochastic depen- dence between source memory for location and source memory for size in the case of know judgments. Goals of the Present Research The finding that the stochastic relation in multidimensional source memory is a function of remember–know judgments, with stochastically dependent retrieval of context attributes in the case of remember responses but independent retrieval in the case of know responses, fits the view that remember and know judgments reflect different cognitive processes corresponding to recollection and familiarity. This interpretation is not unequivocal, however, because the finding could also be subsumed under the memory- strength model of remember–know judgments. Assuming that remember judgments reflect stronger memories than do know judgments and that source memory is positively correlated with the strength of item recognition (DeCarlo, 2003), source memory should be better for items with remember than for those with know judgments. In line with this prediction of the memory-strength account, the studies that combined the remember–know paradigm with a multidimensional source-memory task found substantial source memory for context features in the case of remember judgments and considerably poorer source memory in the case of know items (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2007; Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005; see also Dudukovic &amp; Knowlton, 2006; Perfect, Mayes, Downes, &amp; van Eijk, 1996). Given the different overall levels of source memory for items with remember and know judgments, the differential stochastic relation in multidimen- sional source memory for items with remember and know judg- ments could reflect an implication of different memory strengths rather than a difference in cognitive processes. That is, while 34 MEISER, SATTLER, AND WEIßER remember judgments are presumably based on strong memories that afford sufficient source memory to exhibit an existing sto- chastic dependence, the stochastic independence in the case of know items could be an artifact due to a nearby floor effect in source memory, such that the probability of retrieving a context attribute of the weakly recognized know items is too low to show any effect of retrieving another attribute. To be sure, the memory-strength account only predicts better source memory for two context features in the case of remember judgments, which does not necessarily imply stochastic depen- dence for remember judgments and independence for know judg- ments. Due to the risk of a floor effect in the case of know responses, however, the difference in the stochastic relation might still be a manifestation of a difference between stronger and weaker memories, rather than of different cognitive processes underlying remember and know judgments. To convincingly de- cide between the two interpretations, one should ideally analyze the stochastic relation in multidimensional source memory in a situation where the overall level of source memory is equated between remember and know judgments. If the stochastic depen- dence for remember judgments and the stochastic independence for know judgments persist under conditions of equal source- memory performance, then the interpretation in terms of a floor effect due to different memory strengths can be ruled out, and an interpretation in terms of distinct memory processes seems war- ranted. This goal was pursued in Experiment 1, in which we equated source memory for items with remember and know judg- ments by a manipulation of source discriminability. Building on Experiment 1, Experiments 2 and 3 analyzed the presumed binding processes among multiple context features of remembered items in more detail. For this purpose, we maintained the visuospatial context dimension of item location and used an acoustic attribute as a second context dimension, which replaced the visuospatial attribute of item size that was used in Experiment 1 and in earlier research (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2007; Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005). The new combination of a visuo- spatial and an acoustic context dimension allowed us to investigate binding processes across different sensory modalities as a function of remember–know judgments. The analysis of cross-modal bind- ing links this line of research immediately to findings in the cognitive neurosciences, which suggest that the hippocampus with its specialized function of creating and reinstating conjunctive representations from different sensory areas (e.g., Eichenbaum &amp; Cohen, 2001) is crucially involved in conscious recollection (El- dridge et al., 2000; Henson et al., 1999; Ranganath et al., 2003; Yonelinas et al., 2005). A stochastic dependence in the retrieval of visuospatial and acoustic context information in the case of re- member judgments together with a stochastic independence in the case of know judgments would therefore provide further evidence that remember and know judgments are associated with distinct cognitive processes that correspond to recollection and familiarity. Moreover, the source dimensions used in Experiments 2 and 3 are clearly related to external attributes of the encoding context rather than to internal stimulus features of the target items (see Ecker, Zimmer, &amp; Groh-Bordin, in press; Mulligan, 2004), and the use of context attributes from different sensory modalities pre- cludes that stochastically dependent retrieval reflects a holistic perception and storage of the pictorial scene at encoding (see Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997). In Experiment 3, we also addressed the possibility of a spurious stochastic dependence due to interindividual differ- ences. The experiments thereby aimed at a comprehensive inves- tigation of binding processes among multiple context attributes of an event in memory as a distinctive characteristic of remember versus know judgments. Experiment 1 The first experiment analyzed the stochastic relation in multi- dimensional source memory for items with remember–know judg- ments in an experimental design that equated overall source- memory performance between remember and know judgments. To equate source memory, we compared remember and know items from conditions that differed with respect to source discriminabil- ity. While the sources were rather dissimilar on both dimensions in one condition, they were more similar in the other condition, which should lead to a decrease in source memory (e.g., Bayen, Murnane, &amp; Erdfelder, 1996; Johnson, De Leonardis, Hashtroudi, &amp; Ferguson, 1995). In this design, we compared remember items from the similar-source condition with know items from the dissimilar-source condition to cancel out the usual source-memory advantage of remember items relative to know items. If equal source memory is accomplished, an observed difference in the stochastic relation of multidimensional source memory as a func- tion of remember–know judgments can be interpreted as a differ- ence of cognitive processes in terms of contextual binding rather than as the consequence of a floor effect in the case of know items due to poor memory strength. Method Participants. A sample of 104 students at Jena University participated in Experiment 1 and received a compensation of 5€. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two experi- mental conditions, with 52 participants assigned to the similar- source condition and 52 participants assigned to the dissimilar- source condition. Materials. Random sets of 80 target items and 40 distracters were drawn from a word pool for each participant anew. The word pool contained 167 German nouns of four to seven letters with high values in concreteness and imageability according to word norms. Design and procedure. During the learning phase, the 80 target items were presented on a computer screen for 3 s each, with a 1 s pause of blank screen between adjacent items. Each item was displayed at one of two locations and in one of two font sizes. Half of the items were presented at an upper location and the other half at a lower location. The two locations were 6.5 cm apart in the similar-source condition (i.e., about 3.2 cm above and below the center of the screen) and 13 cm apart in the dissimilar-source condition (i.e., about 6.5 cm above and below the center of the screen). At each location, half of the items were presented in a small font and the other half in a large font. The difference in letter height between the two fonts was 0.6 cm in the similar-source condition (i.e., letter heights of 1.1 cm and 1.7 cm) and 1.2 cm in the dissimilar-source condition (i.e., letter heights of 0.8 cm and 2.0 cm). To balance the context attributes of location (upper vs. lower) and size (small vs. large) across the learning phase, the 35BINDING AND REMEMBERING presentation sequence was divided into five blocks of 16 items, including 4 items from each combination of location and size in random order. After the learning phase, participants worked through a filler task of figural reasoning problems for 12 minutes. In the memory test, the target items and distracters were dis- played in random sequence at a new location and in an interme- diate font size. For each item, participants decided in a first step whether it had been presented in the learning phase and thus was old or whether it had not been presented and thus was new. If an item was classified old, participants made a remember–know judgment in a second step. The instructions explained that remem- bering means a conscious and maybe vivid recollection of a word’s prior occurrence, whereas knowing means recognition of a word without such a recollective experience. Importantly, the instructions for the remember–know distinction avoided any ref- erence to the retrieval of perceptual details, like location or size of item presentation, to preclude a confound between remember judgments and source memory (see Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002, Ex- periment 2, for details). Following the remember–know judgment, a source judgment with respect to location and font size was required in a third step, in which participants chose one of the four combinations of the upper or lower location with the smaller or larger font. All responses in the memory test were entered by mouse clicks on response boxes on the computer screen. Results and Discussion Table 1 provides a summary of the proportions of remember and know responses to target items and distracters in the two experi- mental conditions. The responses in the source-memory test for location and size were analyzed with a multinomial source- monitoring model for two dimensions of context information (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002). This model extends multinomial models of unidimensional source memory (e.g., Batchelder &amp; Riefer, 1990; Bayen et al., 1996) by providing simultaneous measures of memory performance for both context dimensions and by allowing a straightforward test of stochastic dependence in multidimen- sional source memory. The remember–know distinction was cap- tured by specifying separate source-memory parameters for items with a remember judgment and for items with a know judgment (see Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002, Experiment 2; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2007) so that the stochastic relation between source memory for location and size could be analyzed as a function of the remember– know distinction. With these specifications, the multinomial model contained memory and guessing parameters for item recognition, remember–know judgments, and source assignments on the di- mensions of location and size. Figure 1 illustrates the model as a processing-tree diagram. Each branch of the diagram represents a combination of cogni- tive processes that leads to an observed response to target items from location i, i{upper, lower}, and size j, j{small, large}, or to new distracter items. As is usually the case in complex multi- nomial models (see Batchelder &amp; Riefer, 1999, for an overview), a given response can be produced by different combinations of cognitive processes, so that several branches of the tree diagram terminate in the same observed response category (see right-hand side of Figure 1). The model thus specifies the probability of a response category as the sum of all branches that lead to the given category, where each branch is characterized as the product of its model parameters. The model equations that specify the probabil- ities of the response categories in terms of the model parameters are presented in Meiser and Bröder (2002). When the model is applied to empirical data, the model parameters are estimated in a way that minimizes the differences between the observed relative frequencies and the expected probabilities of the response catego- ries (Hu &amp; Batchelder, 1994). We now turn to the model param- eters in Figure 1, which denote the probabilities of cognitive states that are involved in the multidimensional source-memory task with remember–know judgments. If a target item is recognized as old, which happens with probability D, it is judged as remembered with probability R and as known with the complementary probability 1 – R. Depending on the remember–know judgment, the item’s location can be re- trieved with probability dlocR for remember items and dlocK for know items. If the location is retrieved, the item’s size is retrieved jointly with location with probability dsizeR for remember items and dsizeK for know items. If the location cannot be retrieved, which happens with probability 1 – dlocR or 1 – dlocK, respectively, the item’s size is retrieved without location with probability esizeR for remember items and esizeK for know items. Recognized target items whose location or size cannot be retrieved are assigned to the source attributes on the basis of guessing processes, which are reflected by the parameters alocR, a|upper sizeR, a|lower sizeR for re- member items and alocK, a|upper sizeK, a|lower sizeK for know items, thereby disentangling source-memory accuracy from response ten- dencies. If a target item is not recognized as old, which occurs with probability 1 – D, it can nevertheless be judged old on grounds of guessing with probability b. Items that are not recognized but guessed to be old are judged as remembered or known with probability R* and 1 – R*, respectively, and they are assigned to a location and size with the corresponding guessing probabilities glocR, g|upper sizeR, g|lower sizeR and glocK, g|upper sizeK, g|lower sizeK. By allowing for guessed old responses in terms of the parameters b and R*, the model disentangles the memory parameters for true remember and know judgments from guessing processes that refer to unrecognized items. This statistical correction is used as an alternative to capturing guessing processes with an additional guessing response category in the remember–know paradigm (e.g., Gardiner, Ramponi, &amp; Richardson-Klavehn, 2002; Gardiner, Richardson-Klavehn, &amp; Ramponi, 1997).

For definitions of parameters, see Table 2. 37BINDING AND REMEMBERING Finally, distracter items can successfully be recognized as new with probability D. If a distracter is not recognized as new, with probability 1 – D, it can be judged old with a remember or know response and with an assignment to a location and size on the basis of the same guessing processes that guide the responses to unrec- ognized target items. Table 2 provides an overview of the param- eter definitions in the multinomial model. The model parameters were estimated with the program HMMtree (Stahl &amp; Klauer, 2007) on the basis of the observed response frequencies in the source-memory test (see Appendix A).1 Because a preliminary analysis had revealed that recognition of items presented in large font was better than recognition of items presented in small font in the dissimilar-source condition, separate D parameters were included for the two font sizes.2 Overall model fit was assessed with the likelihood-ratio statistic G2, which is asymptotically chi square distributed (see Batchelder &amp; Riefer, 1999). The multinomial model with the above specifi- cations yielded an excellent fit to the observed frequency data in the similar-source condition, G2(17)  20.66, p  .242; and in the dissimilar-source condition, G2(17)  15.11, p  .588. The pa- rameter estimates and their 95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 3. Given the good model fit, we could test further hypotheses in terms of the model parameters. Our main goal was to analyze the stochastic relation of source memory for location and size as a function of remember–know judgments in a situation that cancelled out the usual difference in source-memory performance between remember and know items. Because the parameter dsize denotes the probability of source memory for size in conjunction with source memory for location, whereas esize denotes the probability of source memory for size in the absence of source memory for location, an inequality of the kind dsize  esize indicates a stochastic dependence, such that size is more likely to be retrieved jointly with location than individu- ally. Taking stochastic dependence as an indication of contextual binding that forms a unique correlate of conscious recollection, an empirical inequality dsizeR  esizeR for items with a remember response together with an equality dsizeK  esizeK for items with a know response would support the view that binding processes differentiate between remember and know judgments. To elimi- nate the source-memory advantage for remember items, we fo- cused the analysis on the source-memory parameters for remember items from the similar-source condition and the source-memory parameters for know items from the dissimilar-source condition. Because source memory is generally poorer in the case of similar sources (Bayen et al., 1996; Johnson et al., 1995), we expected that the similar-source condition would reduce source memory for remember items to the level of know items in the dissimilar-source condition. In that case, a difference in the stochastic relation of source memory between remember and know items could not be caused by a floor effect or any other consequence of different levels of source memory and quantitative memory strength. The estimates of the source-memory parameters for remember items from the similar-source condition and for know items from the dissimilar-source condition are displayed in Figure 2. Statisti- cal parameter comparisons were conducted with the conditional likelihood-ratio statistic G2 (see Batchelder &amp; Riefer, 1999). First of all, a joint comparison of the parameters dlocR, dsizeR, and esizeR with the parameters dlocK, dsizeK, and esizeK in Figure 2 indicated that there was no significant difference in overall source memory between remember and know items, G2(3)  3.77, p  .288. Individual parameter comparisons also showed no difference between remember and know judgments in source memory for location (i.e., dloc), G2(1)  1.25, p  .264; source memory for size given retrieval of location (i.e., dsize), G2(1)  1.16, p  .281; or source memory for size without retrieval of location (i.e., esize), G2(1)  2.64, p  .105. These results confirm that the manipulation of source similarity eliminated the quantitative dif- ference in source memory for items with remember and know judgments. To test whether the qualitative difference in the sto- chastic relation prevails in the face of the quantitative equality, we compared the parameters dsize and esize separately for remember and know items. For remember items, dsizeR was significantly larger than esizeR, G2(1)  4.96, p  .026. In contrast, there was no difference between dsizeK and esizeK for know items, G2(1)  1 Note that a simple assignment of the response frequencies in Appendix A to single branches in Figure 1 is not possible because each response category can be produced by different combinations of cognitive states that are represented by branches of model parameters. To illustrate, take the response frequency of correctly assigning target items that were presented at the upper location and in small font size to the sources upper and small together with a remember judgment (i.e., n  130 in the similar-source condition). The multinomial model decomposes this frequency into suc- cessful item recognition together with successful source memory for both attributes (i.e., first branch of Figure 1), successful item recognition with source memory for only one attribute and guessing for the other attribute (i.e., second and fourth branch), successful item recognition with guessing for both attributes (i.e., sixth branch), and item guessing together with source guessing for both attributes (i.e., nineteenth branch). The expected frequency of the response category is therefore derived by the sum of these five branches, with each branch denoting a product of estimated model parameters. The same rationale applies to the other response frequencies in Appendix A. 2 As shown elsewhere (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002), the equality of recog- nition memory D for target items across the four source combinations of location and size can be explored by means of a test of stochastic inde- pendence in the 4  2 frequency table of source combination and old–new response. Stochastic independence held in the similar-source condition, G2(3)  2.95, p  .400; but was significantly violated in the dissimilar- source condition, G2(3)  15.52, p  .001. If a log-linear interaction term between font size and old–new response was included in the dissimilar- source condition, the model fit increased considerably, G2(1)  11.63, p  .001; and the resulting model could be maintained, G2(2)  3.90, p  .143. The results thus showed that recognition performance differed as a function of font size in the dissimilar-source condition. To take this difference into account and to use equivalent models of analysis for both conditions of Experiment 1, separate D parameters for items presented in small font and for items presented in large font were specified in the multinomial model for each experimental condition. To ensure identifi- ability of the model parameters (see Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002, for details), the D parameter for the detection of distracters as new was set equal to the D parameter for the recognition of targets presented in small font size. The alternative specification of setting D for distracters equal to D for targets presented in large font size did not lead to any substantial changes in the results. Although the two-high threshold specification of item recognition that is inherent in the multinomial model is a simplifying assumption, it provides a good approximation for all practical purposes (Bayen et al., 1996; Snodgrass &amp; Corwin, 1988). 38 MEISER, SATTLER, AND WEIßER 0.00, p  .961. Equivalent results were obtained when the order of the two source dimensions was reversed in the multinomial mod- el.3 Given that overall source-memory performance was success- fully equated, the selective stochastic dependence in source mem- ory for location and size in the case of remember responses lends strong support to the interpretation that remember and know judg- ments differ in the involvement of contextual binding processes.4 We also analyzed the stochastic relation in source memory for remember and know items within each experimental condition. In the dissimilar-source condition, the stochastic independence for know items (see above) was accompanied by a significantly larger dsizeR than esizeR parameter for remember items, G2(1)  16.59, p  .001. The data thus showed stochastic dependence for remem- ber items and stochastic independence for know items, but this qualitative difference was confounded with an overall difference in source-memory performance, G2(3)  15.92, p  .001. As can be seen in Table 3, dlocR tended to be larger than dlocK, G2(1)  3.25, p  .072; and dsizeR was significantly larger than dsizeK, G2(1)  6.68, p  .010; whereas esizeR and esizeK did not differ, G2(1)  0.34, p  .561. The dissimilar-source condition thereby closely resembled earlier findings (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002). In the similar-source condition, the stochastic dependence for remember responses (see above) was accompanied by stochastic independence for know responses, as revealed by a nonsignificant difference between the parameters dsizeK and esizeK, G2(1)  0.89, p  .345. Nonetheless, the numerical estimates in Table 3 suggest that the difference between dsizeK and esizeK is very similar to the difference between dsizeR and esizeR, so that source memory for location and size could indeed be stochastically dependent for both remember and know items. Note, however, that the estimate of dsizeK cannot be interpreted because its confidence interval covers the whole range from 0.00 to 1.00. As dsizeK is weighted by dlocK (see Figure 1), dsizeK cannot be estimated reliably if dlocK is very small. The small empirical value of dlocK  .13 in the similar-source condition thus made the parameter dsizeK numeri- cally indeterminate, as indicated by the confidence interval. To show that stochastic independence holds for know items if dsizeK is determined, we collected data from a new sample of 52 partici- pants with a slightly modified design in which we combined the dissimilar locations with the similar font sizes. The use of dissim- ilar locations led to increased source-memory parameters for lo- cation as compared with the similar locations, with dlocR  .46 (confidence interval [CI]  .42, .51) and dlocK  .32 (CI  .24, .39). As a result, the parameters dsizeK and esizeK for the similar font sizes could be estimated more reliably and showed almost identical numerical values, with dsizeK  .11 (CI  .00, .35) and esizeK  .16 (CI  .03, .30). The two values did not differ from each other, G2(1)  0.08, p  .784, confirming that stochastic independence holds for know items. The new sample also con- firmed the stochastic dependence for remember items, with a larger parameter estimate of dsizeR  .34 (CI  .23, .44) than esizeR  .04 (CI  .00, .14), G2(1)  10.46, p  .001. Experiment 1 thus replicated the differential stochastic rela- tion in multidimensional source memory as a function of remember– know judgments. In particular, the experiment showed that the qualitative difference of stochastically depen- dent source memory in the case of remember judgments and stochastically independent source memory in the case of know judgments remains if the quantitative difference in source- memory performance is eliminated. This result rules out that the differential stochastic relation is induced by a floor effect or other artifacts that may arise as a consequence of different memory strengths of items with remember and know responses. Experiment 1 therefore corroborates the hypothesis that the 3 Because the response format in the memory test of the present exper- iment did not imply a specific sequence of source-memory decisions for location and size, the order in which the two source dimensions are specified in the multinomial model is arbitrary. Following the previous analyses in Meiser and Bröder (2002), we first tested for stochastic depen- dence by specifying the probability of retrieving size conditionally on the retrieval of location (i.e., dsize) versus nonretrieval of location (i.e., esize). We also ran analogous analyses with size as the first source dimension and location as the second source dimension, so that the probability of retriev- ing location was specified conditionally on the retrieval versus nonretrieval of size. These analyses revealed equivalent results, with a significant stochastic dependency between source memory for size and location for remember items from the similar-source condition, G2(1)  4.90, p  .027; and stochastic independence for know items from the dissimilar- source condition, G2(1)  0.01, p  .933. 4 To show that the differential stochastic relation in source memory for remember and know items is not a specific outcome of the statistical analysis with the multinomial source-monitoring model, we also analyzed the data with a more traditional index of source-memory performance, that is, the conditional source-identification measure (Murnane &amp; Bayen, 1996). For this purpose, we computed the proportion of target items that were attributed to the correct size among the target items with a remember response in the similar-source condition. This proportion was computed separately for items that were also attributed to the correct location and for items that were attributed to the wrong location. Analogously, we com- puted the proportion of target items with a know response that were attributed to the correct size in the dissimilar-source condition, depending on whether the items were also attributed to the correct location or not. These indices were subjected to a 2 (remember vs. know judgment)  2 (correct vs. incorrect location response) analysis of variance with repeated measures on the last factor. Note that remember–know judgment formed a between-subjects factor because the remember and know items were taken from the similar-source and dissimilar-source condition, respectively. The analysis showed no main effect of remember–know judgment, F(1, 101)  1, confirming that the manipulation of source similarity eliminated any difference in overall source-memory performance between remember and know items. There was also no significant main effect of location response, F(1, 101)  1.06, p  .306. However, the interaction was significant, F(1, 101)  5.82, p  .018; indicating that in the case of remember judgments the proportion of size identification was larger if location was also iden- tified (.60) than if location was not identified (.52), t(51)2.30, p  .025; whereas in the case of know judgments the proportion of size identification did not depend on the identification (.56) or nonidentification (.59) of location, t(50)1.04, p  .302. Equivalent results were obtained when source identification of location was analyzed depending on source iden- tification of size. The traditional source-identification indices thus yielded the same conclusions as the parameters of the multinomial model in Figure 2, namely that stochastic dependence in multidimensional source memory is observed exclusively for remember items even if any difference in quantitative source memory between remember and know items is cancelled out. Since the multinomial model allows the analysis of multi- dimensional source memory as a function of remember and know judg- ments disentangled from guessing biases in recognition, remember–know responses, and source attributions, however, we report only the results of the multinomial analysis in the text. 39BINDING AND REMEMBERING memory processes underlying remember and know judgments differ in the involvement of binding processes among various episodic context attributes. Of course, the present results do not refute the possibility that within each condition of Experiment 1 remember judgments reflect stronger memories than do know judgments according to a unidimensional strength model of remember– know responses (Donaldson, 1996; Hirshman &amp; Henzler, 1998; Inoue &amp; Bellezza, 1998). In fact, it has been shown that remember and know classifications vary as a function of the study and test conditions (Bodner &amp; Lindsay, 2003; McCabe &amp; Balota, 2007), so that the remember responses in the similar-source condition can be interpreted as stronger memories relative to this condi- tion, whereas the know responses in the dissimilar-source con- dition can be taken as weaker memories relative to that condi- tion. Following the unidimensional memory-strength account, Experiment 1 would thus show that the relatively stronger memories in the similar condition differ from the relatively weaker memories in the dissimilar condition in terms of the stochastic association of context attribute retrieval. Important for the present comparison across the two conditions (see Figure 2), however, is that overall source-memory performance was equivalent for remember judgments in the similar-source condition and know judgments in the dissimilar-source condi- tion. The crucial difference in the stochastic relation of multi- dimensional source memory was therefore not confounded with a difference in the strength of source memory. Given the equality of overall source memory for remember and know judgments in the cross-condition analysis, the data did not indicate a difference in memory strength that could easily explain the different stochastic relation. Strictly speaking, how- ever, this does not imply that remember and know judgments from the two conditions could not have differed in aspects of memory strength other than source memory for location and size. It thus remains an interesting goal for future research to further elucidate whether the differential stochastic relation reflects a difference in relative item-specific memory strength of remember and know judgments that does not affect source memory per se or whether the differential stochastic relation is due to qualitatively different memory processes underlying remember and know responses. Aside from the main focus on remember and know judgments with equal source-memory performance, the analyses within each condition of source discriminability confirmed previous results and allowed a closer inspection of the stochastic relation in multidimensional source memory. The nature of the stochas- tic dependence was such that the conditional probability of retrieving the size of remember items given retrieval of location was larger than the conditional probabilities of retrieving size alone for remember items and of retrieving size for know items irrespective of retrieval or nonretrieval of location. This spe- cific increase in joint source memory for both context attributes of remember items can be demonstrated by a set of planned comparisons that are summarized in Table 4. There was no difference between source memory for the size of remember items in the absence of source memory for location (i.e., esizeR) and source memory for the size of know items in the presence or absence of source memory for location (i.e., dsizeK and esizeK) because these parameters could be restricted to one parameter c without a significant deterioration of model fit. In contrast, source memory for the size of remember items in the presence of source memory for location (i.e., dsizeR) was significantly enhanced, because constraining this parameter to the joint pa- rameter c led to a substantial decrease in model fit. This pattern of results was found within each experimental condition and thus indicated that remember judgments were related to a spe- cific increase in conjoint source memory for both context attributes but not to a general increase of source memory per se, even if source-memory performance was not equated across the different conditions of source discriminability.

In previous studies (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002; Meiser &amp; Sattler, 2007; Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005) and in the present Experiment 1, the visuospatial attributes of location and size were used to analyze the stochastic relation in multidimen- sional source memory for remember and know items. Since these context attributes belong to the same sensory modality, it is conceivable that a dependence in source memory might reflect the spontaneous integration of attributes into a holistic visuospatial impression at early stages of perception (see Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997). Furthermore, source memory for font size can be regarded as memory for a stimulus feature of the target word itself and thus as part of item memory, which differs from memory for external attributes in the sensitivity to experimental manipulations (Mulligan, 2004) and in electrophysiological brain activity (Ecker et al., in press). Hence, stochastic depen- dence between source memory for location and size might reveal perceptual processes or binding of context and item information rather than binding processes among contextual features in memory that preserve the configuration of co- occurring attributes of the encoding episode. We therefore combined the visuospatial source dimension of horizontal location with the acoustic source dimension of voice in Experiment 2, such that target words were read out in a male or female voice while they appeared on the left or on the right of the screen. Because location and voice form external source attributes that cannot be integrated into a holistic visuospatial impression during perception, a selective stochastic dependence of source memory in the case of remember judgments can be interpreted in terms of binding processes among visuospatial and acoustic context attributes in memory. Since conscious recollection is associated with the activation of brain areas that are essential for the creation and reinstatement of conjunctive memory representations with details from different sensory channels (Eldridge et al., 2000; Henson et al., 1999; Ranganath et al., 2003; Yonelinas et al., 2005), the expected relation between remember judgments and the binding of visuospatial location and acoustic voice would provide strong support for the notion that remember judgments are characterized by cog- nitive processes that also underlie recollection.

A new sample of 86 students at Jena University volunteered in Experiment 2.5 Students of psychology received course credit, and students from other departments were paid for their participation. Materials. Random sets of 48 target items and 48 distracters were drawn for each participant anew from the same word pool that was used in Experiment 1. For the acoustic presentation of the stimuli, the words were digitally recorded in 16-bit wave files by one male and one female speaker. The duration of the wave files was limited to a maximum of 2 s to synchronize the acoustic and the visual word presentation. Design and procedure. The design and procedure of Experi- ment 2 were identical to those of Experiment 1 with the following exceptions: The 48 target items were presented in constant size (i.e., letter height of 0.6 cm). Half of the items appeared in the center of the left part of the computer screen and the other half in the center of the right part. One second after the onset of the visual display, the acoustic presentation started and the target words were presented via headphones in one of two voices. At each location, half of the items were presented in a male voice and the other half in a female voice. After 3 s of visual display, the computer screen turned blank for 1 s before the next trial began. To balance the context attributes of location (left vs. right) and voice (male vs. female) across the learning phase, the sequence of target items was divided into four blocks of 12 items, with 3 items from each combination of location and voice in random order. Following the learning phase, participants worked through fig- ural reasoning problems for 10 minutes before the memory test commenced. The source-monitoring test employed the procedure of Experiment 1 for the source dimensions of horizontal location and voice. Results and Discussion The mean proportions of remember and know responses to target and distracter items are displayed in Table 1. The multino- mial source-monitoring model (see Figure 1) with location and voice as source dimensions provided an excellent fit to the ob- served frequencies in the memory test (see Appendix B), G2(18)  15.22, p  .647. The estimated model parameters and their 95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 3. To analyze the stochastic relation between source memory for the visuospatial attribute of location and the acoustic attribute of voice, we tested whether source memory for voice is increased if location is also retrieved as compared with source memory for voice without retrieval of location. Because we expected a sto- chastic dependence for remember items but not for know items, our predictions can be specified in terms of the multinomial source-memory parameters as dvoiceR  evoiceR and dvoiceK  evoiceK. The estimated source-memory parameters are displayed in Figure 3. For remember items, the parameter of source memory for voice given that location was retrieved (i.e., dvoiceR) significantly exceeded the parameter of source memory for voice given that location was not retrieved (i.e., evoiceR), G2(1)  8.20, p  .004. For know items, source memory for voice did not vary depending on the retrieval (i.e., dvoiceK) or nonretrieval (i.e., evoiceK) of location, G2(1)  0.06, p  .809. Equivalent results were ob- tained when the dimensions were reversed in the model, so that source memory for location was specified conditional on source memory for voice. The results are perfectly consistent with the assumption that remember judgments are functionally related to binding processes in memory that involve context information from different sensory modalities. The qualitative difference concerning the stochastic relation was accompanied by a quantitative overall difference in the level of source memory for location and voice between remember and know items, G2(3)  35.70, p  .001. Individual parameter comparisons revealed a difference in source memory for location (i.e., dloc), G2(1)  17.09, p  .001; and in source memory for voice given location retrieval (i.e., dvoice), G2(1)  4.54, p  .033, but not in source memory for voice in the absence of location retrieval (i.e., evoice), G2(1)  0.51, p  .476. Because Experi- ment 1 had shown that the differential stochastic relation prevails if source-memory performance is equated for remember and know items, the differences in the level of source memory that were observed in Experiment 2 do not jeopardize the interpretation of the selective stochastic dependence for remember items. More- over, the planned comparisons in Table 4 again showed that remember judgments were associated with a specific increase in joint source memory for voice and location rather than with a general increase of source memory for voice per se. The results of Experiment 2 generalized the findings of Exper- iment 1 in showing stochastic dependence in multidimensional source memory for remember judgments, and stochastic indepen- dence for know judgments, regardless of the specific source di- 5 Because the number of target items was reduced from 80 to 48 in Experiment 2, we increased sample size from 52 participants in each condition of Experiment 1 to 86 participants in Experiment 2. The larger sample size allowed us to estimate the parameters of the multinomial model with similar precision, and to perform model tests with similar statistical test power as for Experiment 1, despite the smaller number of target items. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Similar-Source Condition Dissimilar-Source Condition d locR d sizeR e sizeR d locK d sizeK e sizeK Figure 2.

For definitions of parameters, see Table 2. 42 MEISER, SATTLER, AND WEIßER mensions used in an experiment. Since the source dimensions in Experiment 2 defined external context attributes that pertain to different sensory modalities, they could not simply be connected as item and source information nor automatically be integrated into a holistic percept. The selective stochastic dependence in source memory for location and voice therefore suggests that binding processes in memory concerning context information across dif- ferent sensory modalities form a unique characteristic of remember as opposed to know judgments. Experiment 3 Experiment 3 combined the consideration of differences in source-memory performance from Experiment 1 with context di- mensions of different modalities from Experiment 2. In contrast to Experiment 1, differences in source memory were not induced by experimental manipulation, but natural differences were taken into account by creating stratified subsamples. The analysis of multi- dimensional source memory in subsamples of different memory performance allowed us to test the competing models of remember–know judgments further and to rule out a spurious stochastic dependence due to interindividual differences. If memory models are applied to frequency data that are aggre- gated across individual participants, heterogeneity in memory per- formance can cause spurious correlations among memory param- eters. Such spurious correlations reflect the fact that some participants have better memory for several aspects of a task than have other participants, and they must not be interpreted as de- pendencies among memory processes on the level of individual items. Spurious correlations may occur, for example, between source memory for different context attributes in multinomial models or between item recognition and source memory in signal- detection analyses that use aggregate frequency data (e.g., De- Carlo, 2003). Although a stochastic dependence in multidimen- sional source memory for remember items has also been shown with statistical procedures that do not rely on aggregate data (Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005; see also Footnote 4), we wanted to make sure that the stochastic dependence indicated by the multinomial source-monitoring model does not mirror a spurious correlation due to interindividual differences. For this purpose, we replicated the results of Experiment 2 with a larger sample that allowed the creation and analysis of homogeneous subsamples. Method Participants. A sample of 205 students at Jena University who had not participated in the other experiments volunteered in Ex- periment 3 for course credit or payment. Design and procedure. Like in Experiment 1, participants were presented with 80 target words during the learning phase. The target items varied with respect to the source attributes of location (left vs. right) and voice (male vs. female) that were taken from Experiment 2. Otherwise, the procedures of the learning phase, the filler interval, and the memory test were identical to those of Experiment 1.

For remember judgments, source mem- ory for voice was larger if location was retrieved (i.e., dvoiceR) than if location was not retrieved (i.e., evoiceR), G2(1)  36.15, p  .001. For know judgments, in contrast, source memory for voice was not affected by the retrieval (i.e., dvoiceK) or nonretrieval (i.e., evoiceK) of location, G2(1)  1.38, p  .240. Although the estimate of the parameter dvoiceK (.29) was descriptively larger than the estimate of evoiceK (.15), the nonsignificant parameter comparison supports the previous findings of stochastically inde- pendent source memory in the case of know judgments (see the General Discussion for a joint analysis across experiments). That is, due to the large sample size of Experiment 3, the source- memory parameters were estimated with high precision, resulting in smaller confidence intervals than those in the other experiments. As a consequence, the widths of the confidence intervals of the parameters dvoiceK and evoiceK for know responses in Experiment 3 were comparable with those of the confidence intervals of the parameters dDim2R and eDim2R for remember responses in the other experiments (see Table 3), so that the significant differences for remember judgments in Experiments 1 and 2 and the nonsignifi- cant difference for know judgments in Experiment 3 were based on similar statistical power. The selective stochastic dependence in Experiment 3 again materialized in a specific increase of source memory for the voice of remember items given retrieval of loca- tion, as revealed by the planned comparisons in Table 4. To define subsamples of participants on the basis of source- memory performance, we first assessed each participant’s source memory for location and voice. For this purpose, the individual response frequencies were analyzed with a multinomial model of unidimensional source memory (Bayen et al., 1996, Model 4) for the context attributes of location (collapsed across voice) and voice (collapsed across location).6 The resulting estimates of source memory for location and voice yielded a correlation of r  .36, p  .001, across participants. The correlation shows that the risk of a spurious stochastic dependence in source retrieval due to interindividual differences may be very real. With the individual estimates of source-memory performance, we created more homo- geneous subsamples to analyze the stochastic relation in multidi- mensional source memory without the risk of a spurious correla- tion. Participants were divided into tercentiles of low, medium, and high source memory separately for location and voice, and the tercentiles were crossed to generate nine subsamples with similar- source memory on either context dimension. The full multinomial model of multidimensional source memory with remember–know judgments (see Figure 1) was then applied to each subsample. In the three subsamples with low source memory for location, the parameter dlocK converged to zero, so that the parameter dvoiceK was not identified. Likewise, in the subsamples with low source memory for voice, the parameters dvoiceR, evoiceR, dvoiceK, and evoiceK approached zero. Because of these estimation problems and obvious floor effects, we focused on the four subsamples with at least medium source memory for both context attributes. To make sure that the risk of a spurious correlation is mini- mized, we computed the correlation of the individual source- memory estimates for location and voice within the four sub- samples. The correlation ranged from r  –.135 ( p  .438) in the sample with high source memory on both dimensions to r  .041 ( p  .854) in the sample with high source memory for location and medium source memory for voice, with the other two in between. Hence, there was no indication of a positive correlation between source memory for the two attributes within the sub- samples, so that the multinomial analysis was not prone to a spurious stochastic dependence. Because of the limited size of the subsamples, which varied between 22 and 35 participants, we confined the analysis of the stochastic relation in multidimensional source memory to the planned comparisons that provide a direct and powerful test of the selective increase of source memory for voice given retrieval of location in the case of remember items. Figure 4 displays the joint parameter c, which combines source memory for voice without retrieval of location for remember items and source memory for voice irrespective of location retrieval for know items, and the parameter dvoiceR for the four subsamples. As can be seen in the figure, dvoiceR was consistently larger than c. Table 4 reveals that the difference between dvoiceR and c was significant in three of the four subsamples, while the restrictions evoiceR  dvoiceK  evoiceK of the joint parameter c held in every single case. Experiment 3 thus replicated the crucial finding that remember judgments are related to a stochastic dependence in source mem- ory for context attributes from different sensory modalities, and it ruled out that stochastic dependence simply mirrors heterogeneity of source-memory performance across participants. The results lend strong support to the view that remember judgments differ from know judgments in contextual binding processes that take place on the level of individual items. Moreover, the selective stochastic dependence for remember items was shown on different levels of source-memory performance. For example, while the parameter c in the subsample with high source memory on both dimensions closely matched the parameter dvoiceR in the sub- sample with high source memory for location and medium source memory for voice (see Figure 4), both samples confirmed the stochastic independence for know judgments implied by c  evoiceR  dvoiceK  evoiceK and the stochastic dependence for remember judgments implied by dvoiceR  c. Paralleling Experi- ment 1, these findings show that the differential stochastic relation in multidimensional source memory for remember and know items does not result from floor effects concerning dvoiceK and evoiceK or from other consequences of different memory strength. 6 In the individual analyses, we collapsed across one context dimension and across the remember–know distinction to allow for reliable parameter estimates of source memory for location and voice in the face of only 120 observations per participant (i.e., responses to 80 targets and 40 distract- ers). Moreover, to avoid problems and biases in parameter estimation due to zero frequencies, we added a constant of .01 to each cell frequency. A power analysis with the program G*POWER3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) showed that the goodness-of-fit test for the unidimensional source-memory model had a statistical power of 1 –   .85 to detect model deviations of medium size w  .30 with a conventional significance level of   .05 despite the small number of observations. The proportion of individual analyses that exceeded the critical value of G2(2)  5.99 was .049 for location and .054 for voice, indicating that model violations fell in the expected range of statistical error. 44 MEISER, SATTLER, AND WEIßER General Discussion The present research built on earlier findings that remember judgments are associated with stochastically dependent retrieval of source attributes, and know judgments with stochastically inde- pendent retrieval of source attributes, to investigate the cognitive processes underlying remember–know judgments. While the dif- ferential stochastic relation has originally been interpreted as an indication of specific contextual binding processes in the case of remember judgments (Meiser &amp; Bröder, 2002), the memory- strength account of remember– know judgments (Donaldson, 1996; Dunn, 2004; Hirshman &amp; Master, 1997; Inoue &amp; Bellezza, 1998) could explain the result in terms of generally stronger memories for remember than know judgments, which lead to good source memory for remember items that allows for stochastic dependence but lead to poor source memory for know items that conceals any dependence due to floor effects. The demonstration of a differential stochastic relation in multidimensional source memory under conditions of equal source-memory performance for items with remember and know responses in Experiment 1 showed that the qualitative difference in the stochastic relation can hardly be accounted for by quantitative differences in memory strength between remember and know judgments. The generaliza- tion to source memory for context attributes of different modalities in Experiment 2 linked the finding of selective stochastic depen- dence in the case of remember judgments to research on binding processes and conscious recollection in the cognitive neuro- sciences, which had indicated that recollection involves the hip- pocampus and other brain regions that integrate preprocessed information from different sensory areas. Experiment 3 replicated the differential stochastic dependence in source memory for re- member and know items on different levels of source memory and with attributes from different modalities, and it safeguarded the interpretation against a spurious correlation due to heterogeneity in the aggregate response frequencies. In addition to the analysis of each individual experiment, the present research affords a meta-analytic analysis of eight indepen- dent samples to examine the consistency of stochastic indepen- dence in source memory for know judgments and stochastic de- pendence for remember judgments. Under the null hypothesis of stochastic independence, one would expect a probability of .50 that the parameter of source memory for one attribute given retrieval of another attribute (i.e., dDim2) is larger than the parameter of source memory for one attribute without retrieval of the other attribute (i.e., eDim2). In other words, although the two parameters can hardly be expected to be exactly identical in any empirical data set, the direction of their difference should be totally unsystematic. In fact, for items with a know judgment, the difference was in the direction of dDim2  eDim2 in four out of eight samples (i.e., similar-source and dissimilar-source conditions of Experiment 1; location medium-voice high and location high-voice medium sub- samples of Experiment 3) and in the direction of dDim2  eDim2 in the remaining four samples (i.e., replication of Experiment 1 with dissimilar locations and similar font sizes; Experiment 2; location medium-voice medium and location high-voice high subsamples of Experiment 3). For items with a remember judgment, in con- trast, the observed difference was in the direction of dDim2  eDim2 for all eight samples. According to a one-tailed binomial sign test, the observed number of samples with dDim2  eDim2 in the case of know judgments nicely conforms to the null hypothesis that dDim2 exceeds eDim2 with a 50% chance ( p  .637), whereas the null hypothesis is clearly rejected in the case of remember judgments ( p  .004). The binomial test thus confirmed the consistency of our findings across the different samples on the basis of the direction of the parameter difference, irrespective of the size of the individual differences. Although the present results provide strong evidence that re- member judgments differ from know judgments by binding pro- cesses that lead to a stochastically dependent retrieval of context attributes, two alternative interpretations have to be addressed that might threaten our conclusions. First, one could argue that the observed stochastic dependence results from fluctuations of atten- tion during encoding, so that some items are well attended and thus well recognized together with their context attributes whereas other items are poorly attended and poorly recognized without retrieval of context attributes. Although this interpretation can explain a general stochastic dependence in source memory across all items, it does not account for the selective stochastic depen- 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Voice Medium Voice High c d voiceR c d voiceR 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Voice Medium Voice High c d voiceR c d voiceR Location Medium Location High Figure 4.

For definitions of parameters, see Table 2. 45BINDING AND REMEMBERING dence in the case of remember items. Given that all remember items should have been well attended and well recognized, this explanation does not capture the stochastic dependence within the set of remember items, nor can it accommodate the stochastic dependence for remember judgments in combination with the stochastic independence for know judgments on comparable levels of source memory. Second, one could imagine that stochastic dependence for remember items is driven by some participants interpreting remember responses as including source memory for the two context attributes that are prompted in the source-memory test. After all, participants work through a whole series of test items in which remember–know judgments are followed by source decisions, so that they may come to respond remember whenever they can retrieve the source attributes and know otherwise. This interpretation was ruled out in another set of experiments, in which participants gave remember–know judgments in a first test phase that was followed by a multidimensional source-memory test in an unexpected second test phase (Meiser, 2007). Despite the separate test phases, the selective stochastic dependence was replicated for items that received a remember response in the first phase. Be- cause the alternative interpretations are rejected on theoretical and empirical grounds, the observed stochastic dependence can be taken as an indicator of binding processes in episodic memory, either in terms of cuing during the retrieval of mutually associated context attributes (Tulving &amp; Thomson, 1973) or in terms of joint retrieval from conjunctive memory representations of item and context information (Starns &amp; Hicks, 2005; Vogt &amp; Bröder, 2007). Since the present experiments yield consistent support for a functional relation between remember judgments and the binding of multiple details of context information into a coherent memory representation, they have immediate implications for the compet- ing models of remember–know judgments. While the results are hard to reconcile with the unidimensional strength account of remember–know judgments, they agree with the original dual- process assumption that remember and know judgments rely on different cognitive mechanisms (Gardiner, 1988; Tulving, 1985; M. A. Wheeler et al., 1997). In particular, our data suggest that remember judgments are distinctly characterized by contextual binding processes that preserve the specific configuration of con- text attributes within and across sensory modalities, whereas know responses may involve residual memory for less integrated context information. This pattern fits nicely into more recent dual-process models of remember–know judgments, which specify the inter- play of recollection and familiarity as quantitative memory dimen- sions that jointly give rise to the experience of remembering and knowing. Concerning the model proposed by Rotello et al. (2004), our findings support the notion that remember and know judg- ments differ in the specificity of context memory, such that re- member judgments entail more specific and integrated memory for episodic details, but not in the absolute presence versus absence of context memory. From the perspective of Wixted’s (2007; Wixted &amp; Stretch, 2004) summation model of recollection and familiarity, our findings match the assumption that remember responses reflect a mixture of high-strength familiarity and conscious recollection. In fact, the view that remember judgments include items that are high in familiarity but lack recollection as well as items that are consciously recollected together with a configuration of episodic context attributes provides an elegant and parsimonious account of the stochastic dependence in multidimensional source memory for remember items. To the extent that the probability of recollection is very low for know responses according to the summation model, it also accommodates the stochastic independence in source mem- ory for know items whose recognition is predominantly based on familiarity only. Hence, although remember–know responses can- not be regarded as process-pure reflections of recollection and familiarity, our findings concur with quantitative dual-process models and provide strong evidence for the assumption that dif- ferent mixtures of cognitive processes underlie remember and know judgments.
