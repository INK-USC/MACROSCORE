Medin Northwestern University ABSTRACT—Children’s acquisition of fundamental biologi- cal concepts (LIVING THING, ANIMAL, PLANT) is shaped by the way these concepts are named. In English, but not Indo- nesian, the name ‘‘animal’’ is polysemous: One sense in- cludes all animate objects, and the other excludes humans. Because names highlight object categories, if the samename (‘‘animal’’) points to two different, hierarchically related biological concepts, children should have difficulty settling on the scope of that term and its close neighbors (e.g., ‘‘alive’’). Experiments with 4- to 9-year-old English- and Indonesian-speaking children revealed that ‘‘alive’’ poses unique interpretive challenges, especially for English- speaking children. When asked to identify entities that are ‘‘alive,’’ older Indonesian-speaking children selected both plants and animals, but their English-speaking counter- parts tended to exclude plants,which suggests that theymay have misaligned ‘‘alive’’ with one of the ‘‘animal’’ senses. This work underscores the importance of considering lan- guage and cultural factors in studying the acquisition of fundamental concepts about the biological world. A considerable amount of research has focused on ‘‘folkbio- logical’’ knowledge, or people’s everyday knowledge about living things. This work has revealed that an appreciation of the fundamental concept LIVING THING1 (including plants and animals) is a late and laborious developmental achievement. Piaget (1937/1954) noted that young children mistakenly attribute life status to inanimate objects that appear to move on their own (e.g., clouds, bicycles). He interpreted this ‘‘childhood animism’’ as a reflection of children’s inchoate grasp of concepts, including ANIMAL and LIVING THING. More recent evidence indicates that even 10-year-olds have difficulty understanding the scope of LIVING THING (Hatano et al., 1993). In this article, we take a fresh look at children’s apparent difficulty establishing the concepts ANIMAL, PLANT, and LIVING THING. To identify the antecedents to 10-year-olds’ well-docu- mented difficulties understanding these concepts, we examine the developmental trajectories of children from 4 to 9 years of age. We propose that the way in which these concepts are named within a given language shapes their acquisition. We pursue this proposal by comparing children speaking English and Indone- sian, a pair of languages with intriguing differences in the names for key biological concepts. Our focus on naming is motivated by extensive documentation that names, and nouns in particular, serve as a catalyst in object categorization from infancy (see Waxman &amp; Lidz, 2006, for a review) through adulthood (Goss, 1961). By 12 months of age, children use names as invitations to form categories (Waxman &amp; Markow, 1995). Infants’ ability to form an object category (e.g., ANIMAL) when presented with a set of disparate exemplars (e.g., a dog, a horse, and a duck) improves dramatically when these ex- emplars are introduced with the same name. For infants as young as 9months old, this facilitative effect is specific to words (and not tones), and by the age of 14months, it is specific to nouns (and not adjectives or verbs; Balaban&amp;Waxman, 1997;Waxman&amp;Booth, 2001). If naming supports object categorization in infants and young children, then the names children learn for biological en- tities should influence their categorization of those entities. There is also evidence suggesting that at least some basic folkbiological concepts (e.g., ANIMAL) emerge early, and well in Address correspondence to Florencia K.

Infants are especially interested in animate objects and are captivated by animate properties, in- cluding faces, eyes, and autonomous, biological motion (Ber- tenthal, 1993; Johnson, Slaughter, &amp; Carey, 1998; Poulin- Dubois &amp; Shultz, 1990). Infants distinguish between animate and inanimate objects (Woodward, Sommerville, &amp; Guajardo, 2001) and between agents and nonagents (Leslie, 1994). Per- haps not surprisingly, then, notions of animacy are evident in preschoolers’ reasoning (Gelman, 1990). If names serve as invitations to form categories, then the names that children hear for biological entities should bolster any concepts for such entities that young children may have already discovered (e.g., ANIMAL) and should support the ac- quisition of related concepts they have yet to discover. Decades of ethnobiological research provide insights into how biological entities are named across diverse languages (Berlin, 1992), and the evidence is surprising. The overarching concept LIVING THING rarely, if ever, is named with a single, dedicated noun. Reference to this concept is almost always accomplished by means of a phrase (e.g., living thing in English). Thus, although in principle a dedicated name could support the acquisition of this abstract concept, this support rarely is present. In contrast, most languages name the concept ANIMAL. This, coupled with an early appreciation of animacy, likely supports the early acqui- sition of ANIMAL. There is, however, one potentially important complicating factor (see Fig. 1). In many languages, including English, the name ‘‘animal’’ is polysemous: It can refer to all animate objects (ANIMALinclusive), but can also refer to themore restrictive concept that excludes humans (ANIMALcontrastive). This polysemy could have adverse consequences: If nouns support the formation of object categories, and if the same name ‘‘animal’’ points to two different, but hierarchically related concepts, then it should be difficult for children to settle on its meaning. This is a testable hypothesis, because this polysemy is not universal. In Indonesian, for example, ‘‘animal’’ refers only to the more restrictive ANIMALcontrastive concept (see Fig. 1). The ANIMALinclusive concept is unnamed. Neither a dedicated noun nor a commonly used phrase is associated with this unnamed concept. To test this hypothesis, we recruited children acquiring either Indonesian or English in monolingual households in Jakarta and Chicago, respectively. The children in the two cities were re- cruited from urban elementary schools that served families of comparable relative socioeconomic status. Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, is a diverse city with a rich mixture of cultural practices and serves as the center for political and economic activity. Both majority- and minority-culture children were included (children from Native- and Chinese-Indonesian families in Jakarta and children from families of European and non-European descent in Chicago). No detectable differences in task performance were associated with this variable. In preliminary experimentation, we asked whether children’s interpretations of ‘‘animal’’ accord with those of adults in the same linguistic community. We presented 95 English-speaking 6- and 9-year-olds and 102 Indonesian-speaking 6- and 9-year- English</p>

Medin at SETON HALL UNIV on March 30, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from olds with a photograph of a human, asking, ‘‘Could you call this an ‘animal’?’’ (‘‘Mungkinkah ini ‘hewan’?’’ in Indonesian). The children’s responses mirrored those of adult speakers. Indonesian-speaking children overwhelmingly endorsed the ANIMALcontrastive interpretation, with only 3% asserting that a human could be included in the category named ‘‘animal.’’ English-speaking children endorsed the ANIMALinclusive inter- pretation significantly more often (26%) than the Indonesian children. In another preliminary study, we examined whether children’s categorization of human and nonhuman animals mirrored their naming practices. We presented 60 English-speaking 6- and 9- year-olds and 65 Indonesian-speaking 6- and 9-year-olds with a set of cards depicting various living and nonliving things, and asked them to place ‘‘the kinds of things that belong together in the same pile.’’ Performance on this free-sorting task indeed reflected the children’s naming practices: Indonesian-speaking children were less likely than their English-speaking counter- parts to place a human with a nonhuman animal. Only 5% of the Indonesian-speaking 6- and 9-year-olds placed a human with a nonhuman animal, whereas 36% of the English-speaking 6- and 9-year-olds did so, w2(1, N 5 123) 5 17.89, p &lt; .001. These preliminary findings establish that children’s inter- pretation of ‘‘animal’’ accords with the naming practices of their ambient linguistic community, and that this interpretation is reflected in their performance in a free-sorting task. Children acquiring Indonesian are sensitive to one unambiguous inter- pretation of ‘‘animal,’’ but children acquiring English are sen- sitive to two interpretations (ANIMALcontrastive and ANIMALinclusive). These insights provided the foundation for a more detailed ex- perimental investigation. The main experiment was designed to address two issues. First, we wanted to know whether the difference between En- glish and Indonesian would persist in a more structured task that was specifically designed to tap into the overarching concept LIVING THING. Second, we considered the consequences of the polysemy of ‘‘animal’’ in English. Preliminary work had estab- lished that Indonesian-speaking children endorsed one mean- ing, almost exclusively applying the ANIMALcontrastive inter- pretation to ‘‘animal,’’ but that, in contrast, English-speaking children endorsed either the ANIMALcontrastive or the more abstract ANIMALinclusive interpretation. This observation, coupled with evidence that children favor a ‘‘one word–one concept’’ ap- proach in word learning (Markman &amp; Wachtel, 1988), suggests that English-speaking children should be open to aligning a word other than ‘‘animal’’ with the ANIMALinclusive concept, should a suitable candidate arise. An examination of parental input to English-speaking chil- dren suggests one such candidate. A recent analysis (Leddon, Waxman, &amp; Medin, 2007) of parent-child conversations in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000) revealed that English- speaking parents apply ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow’’ to all living things, but use ‘‘alive’’ more restrictedly, applying it almost solely to animals (human and nonhuman), and excluding plants. This usage offers English-speaking children an opportunity to (mis)align ‘‘alive’’ with ANIMALinclusive and thus to circumvent the polysemy of ‘‘animal.’’ Notice that if children adopt this inter- pretation, then when they are asked about ‘‘alive’’ (as in most experiments probing biological knowledge), they should ex- clude plants. Indeed, whenEnglish-speaking children are asked to sort objects on the basis of the predicate ‘‘alive,’’ they sys- tematically exclude plants (Carey, 1985; Opfer &amp; Siegler, 2004; Piaget, 1926/1929; Waxman, 2005). Moreover, in Japanese and Hebrew—two other languages in which the word for ANIMAL is polysemous—children also tend to deny that plants are alive (Hatano et al., 1993; Stavy &amp; Wax, 1989). If in attempting to resolve the polysemy of ‘‘animal,’’ English- speaking children (mis)align ‘‘alive’’ with the less-preferred ANIMALinclusive sense, then their tendency to include plants when sorting on the basis of ‘‘alive’’ should be attenuated relative to their tendency to include plants when sorting on the basis of other biological predicates. Moreover, this interpretive difficulty with ‘‘alive’’ should be more pronounced for English- than In- donesian-speaking children, as the latter presumably have no such polysemy to resolve. METHOD Participants Participants were 4-year-olds (56 American: mean age 5 4.52 years; 46 Indonesian: mean age 5 4.72 years), 6-year-olds (70 American: mean age 5 6.49 years; 46 Indonesian: mean age 5 6.28 years), and 9-year-olds (53 American: mean age 5 9.42 years; 48 Indonesian: mean age 5 9.08 years) from urban elementary schools in greater Chicago and Jakarta. At each age and site, approximately 53% of the children were girls. Materials Each of 17 items was depicted in a photograph presented on a laminated card measuring 8.5 in. by 5.5 in. (see Table 1).

To begin, the experimenter and child identified each photograph. The experimenter then shuffled the cards and initiated the sorting task, beginning with the predicate ‘‘alive.’’ Presenting the cards individually, she instructed the child to ‘‘put the ones that are ‘alive’ here’’ (indicating one side of the table) and ‘‘the ones that are not ‘alive’ here’’ (indicating the other side of the table). Next, she shuffled the cards and in- structed the child to sort them on the basis of one of the other predicates.When that sort was completed, she shuffled the cards and gave instructions for the third sort. The order in which ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow’’ were presented was counterbalanced across par- ticipants. Coding We assigned each child’s sort to one of the following patterns, permitting one error of omission and one of commission:  ANIMALinclusive: humans and nonhuman animals sorted to- gether, with plants and all others excluded  LIVING THING: all living things sorted together, with all others excluded  NATURAL KIND: all living things and natural kinds sorted to- gether, with others excluded  other: no discernible pattern RESULTS As Figure 2 shows, by the age of 6 years, English- and Indo- nesian-speaking children appreciate an overarching concept LIVING THING, as evidenced by their performance with the predicates ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow,’’ but their interpretation of ‘‘alive’’ follows a more protracted developmental trajectory. Consider first the predicates ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow.’’ Four-year-olds in both language communities produced a large proportion of ‘‘other’’ sorts, which suggests that they found this task difficult. Those who did produce a discernible pattern favored the LIVING THING pattern (or, in the case of Indonesian-speaking children sorting on ‘‘die,’’ the LIVING THING and ANIMALinclusive patterns). Among 6-year-olds, this pattern predominated, and by age 9, the majority of children produced it. Nonparametric analyses of the proportion of children producing each of the three patterns re- vealed that at each age and in each language community, the distribution differed significantly from expected chance values, w2s(1)&gt; 9.22, ps&lt; .01 (Ns for these tests ranged from 16 to 52). Thus, by the age of 6 years, most children appreciate a concept of living things and apply the biological predicates ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow’’ to this inclusive concept. A very different trajectory was observed for ‘‘alive.’’ Again, 4- year-olds produced a large proportion of ‘‘other’’ sorts. But an analysis of the distribution of the remaining patterns revealed that in both language communities, 4-year-olds who produced a discernible pattern favored the ANIMALinclusive pattern (excluding plants), w2(1, N5 33)5 18.82, p&lt; .001, for English-speaking children and w2(1, N 5 31) 5 12.78, p &lt; .01, for Indonesian- speaking children. Six-year-olds’ responses were distributed evenly among the three patterns, w2(1, N5 53)5 5.30, n.s., for English-speaking children and w2(1, N 5 34) 5 2.56, n.s., for Indonesian-speaking children; this suggests that children in both language communities have difficulty settling on the scope of this term. Among 9-year-olds, however, performance in the two language communities diverged: English-speaking children continued to distribute their responses evenly, w2(1, N5 51)5 2.26, n.s., but Indonesian-speaking children strongly favored the LIVING THING pattern, w2(1, N5 48)5 50.89, p &lt; .001. The ANIMALinclusive pattern (corresponding to a concept unnamed in their language) virtually vanished. DISCUSSION In the current work, we explored how the acquisition of bio- logical concepts is influenced by the naming practices of chil- dren’s linguistic communities. Preliminary evidence revealed that some English-speaking, but no Indonesian-speaking, children endorse two different meanings of ‘‘animal,’’ and that this difference is mirrored in children’s free sorting. More detailed experimental work revealed the conceptual consequences of the polysemy of ‘‘animal.’’ Although children from both language communities appreciated an abstract LIVING THING concept, as witnessed by their interpretation of ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow,’’ their interpretation of ‘‘alive’’ varied as a function of language. Indonesian-speaking 9-year-olds successfully ap- plied this term to LIVING THING. However, their English-speaking counterparts showed a persistent and pernicious difficulty, as would be expected if they had (mis)aligned ‘‘alive’’ with the ANIMALinclusive concept, and not the more abstract LIVING THING concept. This suggests that the term ‘‘alive’’ poses unique in- terpretive challenges for English-speaking children. These results open several avenues for future work. It will be important to learn more about how children represent the (often covert) ANIMALinclusive, or ANIMATE, concept. There is strong ev- idence that infants are sensitive to this concept, even in advance of language. What is less clear is the developmental fate of this concept for individuals who acquire languages, like Indonesian, in which the concept remains unnamed. This issue relates di- rectly to investigations concerning the role of language in pre- serving sensitivity to unnamed concepts (Hespos &amp; Spelke, 2004; Levinson, Kita, Haun, &amp; Rasch, 2002; Li &amp; Gleitman, 2002). It will also be important to discover how (and how deeply) representations of this concept are affected by language. Clearly, language does matter. English-speaking children, who are sensitive to the polysemy of ‘‘animal,’’ have difficulty in- terpreting the closely related predicate ‘‘alive.’’ Children who Volume 19—Number 4 317 Florencia K. Anggoro, Sandra R. Waxman, and Douglas L. Medin at SETON HALL UNIV on March 30, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from speak Indonesian, which has no such polysemy, establish the scope of the term ‘‘alive’’ more readily, and by 9 years of age overwhelmingly attribute life status to plants, as well as animate beings. Finally, it will be important to discover whether this difference is attributable to the polysemy of ‘‘animal’’ in English or the unnamed status of ANIMALinclusive in Indonesian. To answer this question, researchers will need to look to languages in which the ANIMATE node has a name and the name is not poly- semous. Czech appears to be one such language: ANIMALinclusive is named (živočich), and this name is distinct from that for ANI- MALcontrastive (zvı́ře).
