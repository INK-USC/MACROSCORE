Received June 3, 2008 Revision received May 26, 2009 Accepted June 11, 2009  Correction to Anderson and Shirako (2008) In the article “Are Individuals’ Reputations Related to Their History of Behavior?,” by Cameron Anderson and Aiwa Shirako (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2008, Vol. 94, No. 2, pp. 320–333), coefficient alpha reliabilities for the social connectedness variable were reported as .97 and .78 in Studies 2 and 3, respectively. Instead, they should have been reported as intraclass correlations (ICC) of .87 and .74, respectively. In the original reliability analyses, the authors included self-ratings of social connectedness and thus omitted participants from the analysis who did not provide a self-rating. Similarly, the authors included self-ratings when assessing the reliability of social connectedness in an unreported classroom sample (n  36) that was collected at the same time as the data reported in Study 2. In that unreported sample, they originally obtained a coefficient that was far below satisfactory levels, leading them to exclude that data set. However, after taking out the self-ratings in that unreported sample, the ICC was .82. Therefore, here we summarize the correlations reported in Study 2 for the unreported and included data sets combined (consistent with the combined analyses of the two classroom data sets in Study 1). The correlations in the combined data analyses still support the hypothesis that more socially connected individuals were more likely to develop reputations: social connectedness correlated with the total number of nominations received (r  .27, p  .05), firsthand reputations (r  .29, p  .05), and cooperative reputations (r  .27, p  .05), but not with secondhand reputations (r  .09, ns), or reputations for selfishness (r  .05, ns). Also, similar to the reported correlations in Study 2, in the combined sample individuals whose opponents had higher average social connectedness scores were not more likely to gain a reputation (r  .15, ns) or a secondhand reputation (r  .01, ns).
