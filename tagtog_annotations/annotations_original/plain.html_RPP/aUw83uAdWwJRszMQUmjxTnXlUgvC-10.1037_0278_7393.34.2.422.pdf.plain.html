Stolz and Derek Besner University of Waterloo Contrary to the received view that reading aloud reflects processes that are “automatic,” recent evidence suggests that some of these processes require a form of attention. This issue was investigated further by examining the effect of a prior presentation of exception words (words whose spelling–sound translation are atypical, such as pint as compared with mint, hint, or lint) and pseudohomophones (nonwords that sound identical to words, such as brane from brain) on reading aloud in the context of the psychological refractory period paradigm. For exception words, the joint effects of repetition and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) yielded an underadditive interaction on the time to read aloud, replicating previous work—a short SOA between Task 1 and Task 2 increased reaction time (RT) and reduced the magnitude of the repetition effect relative to the long SOA. For pseudohomophones, in contrast, the joint effects of repetition and SOA were additive on RT. These results provide converging evidence for the conclusion that (a) processing up to and including the orthographic input lexicon does not require central attention when reading aloud, whereas (b) translating lexical and sublexical spelling to sound requires the use of central attention. Keywords: attention, psychological refractory period paradigm, pseudohomophones, spelling-sound translation Supplemental materials: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.34.2.422.supp As the literature on basic processes in reading has grown more sophisticated, researchers have begun to examine how reading is affected by other cognitive processes. One such issue concerns the role of attention in reading. A small number of investigators have used the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm to inves- tigate whether one form of attention (central attention) plays a role in visual word recognition. The present article extends previous work on the role of central attention during the process of com- puting a phonological code from print. We start with a discussion of the PRP paradigm and how it can be used to determine whether or not central attention is needed for particular processes. PRP Paradigm Participants are presented with two tasks in succession. They are typically instructed to respond to both tasks quickly and accu- rately, but to respond to Task 1 first. The stimulus onset asyn- chrony (SOA) between the stimuli for Tasks 1 and 2 is varied such that participants are sometimes provided with ample time to pro- cess and respond to Task 1 before a Task 2 stimulus appears (the long SOA condition), and at other times a Task 2 stimulus appears before Task 1 can be completed (the short SOA condition). The standard finding is that as SOA decreases, the reaction time (RT) to Task 2 increases (Pashler, 1994). This increase in Task 2 RT is typically attributed, at least in part, to both tasks needing to use the same limited-capacity processing mechanism (central attention) at some point. When the processes associated with Task 2 are spec- ified, then the PRP paradigm can be used to make inferences about which specific ones do or do not require central attention. We discuss this issue using cognitive slack logic as developed by Pashler and colleagues (e.g., Pashler &amp; Johnston, 1989). When Task 1 and Task 2 overlap temporally and participants are instructed to respond to Task 1 first, Task 1 gains access to central attention before Task 2. Processes that require central attention in Task 2 are therefore postponed (see Figure 1). If a factor manipulated in Task 2 affects a process that occurs prior to this processing bottleneck, then this process can be undertaken during the time needed for the bottleneck to be cleared during Task 1 processing. The effect of this factor on RT will then decrease as the overlap between Task 1 and Task 2 increases (i.e., as SOA decreases). In essence, the effect of the manipulated factor in Task 2 is absorbed into the cognitive slack created by the later Task 2 processing having to wait until the bottleneck process being used by Task 1 is completed (see the upper part of Figure 1).

Thus, Task 2 processing that needs the central component begins at the same time, regardless of the difficulty of the early stage, resulting in no observable effect of the factor on Task 2 RT in the short SOA condition. In contrast, if a factor manipulated in Task 2 affects a process that occurs at or after the stage that requires central attention resources, then the impact of that factor will not change as the overlap between Task 1 and Task 2 increases. That is, the joint effects of this factor and SOA will be additive on RT (see Figure 1). In the figure, the manipulated factor is now portrayed as affecting the central processing stage of Task 2. Because the processing for this stage cannot be undertaken until Task 1 central processing is complete, the entire stage (including any effect of the manipulated factor) will be postponed until the bottleneck is free. Role of Central Attention in Reading Aloud Lexical Processing Following the logic outlined above, several studies have investi- gated the widely held view that lexical processing occurs without central attention by manipulating word frequency in both reading aloud and lexical decision tasks. For example, McCann, Remington, and Van Selst (2000) examined the effects of word frequency on the time to read words aloud in Task 2. They reported that word fre- quency and SOA had additive effects on RT in Task 2, suggesting that orthographic–lexical processing either uses central attention or occurs after some stage that uses central attention. However, Reynolds and Besner (2006) noted that although there was no significant interaction in the individual reading aloud experiments reported by McCann and colleagues (in which across the four experiments there was a total of five reports of statistical additivity), in each case the word frequency effect was smaller at the shortest SOA than at the longest SOA. Although the reduction in the word frequency effect was small (ap- proximately 5 ms) this underadditivity in five out of five comparisons is significant by a sign test. This suggests that there is a processing component associated with words that is able to proceed without requiring central attention. Sublexical Processing In order to assess whether sublexical spelling-to-sound transla- tion requires central attention during reading aloud, Reynolds and Besner (2006) manipulated nonword letter length and graphemic complexity in Task 2 of three PRP experiments (Task 1 was pitch discrimination) and framed their results in the context of the dual route cascaded model (DRC; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, &amp; Ziegler, 2001). In DRC the nonlexical route that is needed for reading nonwords aloud computes phonology serially, left to right across a letter string using a set of grapheme-to-phoneme conver- sion rules. A response is not initiated until all letters have been translated into phonology (at least for single-syllable letter strings). RT therefore increases as letter length increases, as observed in skilled human readers (Weekes, 1997). Similarly, as graphemic complexity increases (when the activation of a subsequent letter modifies the pronunciation of a previous letter, for example, the ph in streph) RT increases (Rastle &amp; Coltheart, 1998). Reynolds and Besner (2006) found that the effects of both of these factors were additive with SOA. Given cognitive slack logic this suggests that the operation of the nonlexical route either requires central atten- tion or occurs after a stage that requires central attention. Revisiting the Role of Attention in Lexical Processing In additional experiments, Reynolds and Besner (2006) manip- ulated neighborhood density in Task 2 in order to assess whether a lexical contribution to sublexical spelling-to-sound translation requires central attention. Neighborhood density (ND) refers to the number of words that can be created by changing a single letter in a letter string (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, &amp; Besner, 1977). The time to read aloud both words and nonwords decreases as ND Early Central LateTASK 1 TASK 2 Early Central Late Early Central Late Early Central Late Early Central Late Cognitive Slack time Factor affecting processing prior to the bottleneck ottleneck Factor affecting processing at or after the b Figure 1. An illustration of how (a) Task 2 manipulations that have their effect prior to the bottleneck are absorbed into the cognitive slack created when other processes in Task 2 are postponed due to Task 1 processing, and (b) Task 2 manipulations that affect processing at or after the bottleneck produce an effect. 423BRIEF REPORTS increases (e.g., McCann &amp; Besner, 1987) and is generally consid- ered to affect orthographic processing. However, recent evidence suggests that it actually reflects the number of words that can be created by changing a single phoneme and hence reflects phono- logical lexical processing (Mulatti, Reynolds, &amp; Besner, 2006). Reynolds and Besner (2006) observed additive effects of ND and SOA, suggesting that lexical processing as indexed by ND either uses central attention or occurs after an unspecified stage that uses central attention, and provides converging support for the idea that the effect of ND is relatively late in processing. Lexical Processing: The Effect of Repetition It is well known that RTs are shorter for repeated words than for new words in both reading aloud and lexical decision. Moreover, it is well established that this advantage persists over hundreds of intervening items, and that repetition benefits low-frequency words more than high-frequency words. These effects are all consistent with the idea that there is long-lasting activation in the lexical representations of the visual word recognition system (e.g., Morton, 1969; Scarborough, Cortese, &amp; Scarborough, 1977). The fact that repetition and stimulus quality interact when reading words aloud also suggests that at least some of this effect arises early in processing (Blais &amp; Besner, 2007). Reynolds and Besner (2006) examined the effect of long-lag (150 items) repetition priming for exception words when reading aloud in Task 2 of the PRP paradigm in order to assess whether orthographic– lexical activation and processes prior to that (feature and letter iden- tification) use central attention. They reported that the effect of rep- etition priming was reduced as the SOA between Task 1 and Task 2 decreased (an underadditive interaction). Following cognitive slack logic, Reynolds and Besner concluded that processing up to and including orthographic–lexical processing does not use central atten- tion, whereas later lexical processing (as indicated by additivity of ND and SOA) requires central attention. In summary, of the seven experiments reported by Reynolds and Besner (2006), repetition priming was the only manipulation whose effects produced an underadditive interaction with decreas- ing SOA. Given the cognitive slack logic discussed earlier, this result implies that some processes occur without using central attention. However, it is possible this interaction is specific to the repetition manipulation itself, rather than reflecting differences in the need for central attention between orthographic–lexical pro- cesses (which were associated with the underadditive interaction) and phonological recoding processes (which produced additive effects across SOAs in the other six experiments). A converging operation is to maintain the repetition manipulation (repeated vs. new letter strings) and vary the relative contributions of ortho- graphic and phonological lexical processing to the repetition prim- ing effect. If the underadditive interaction of repetition priming and decreasing SOA observed by Reynolds and Besner (2006) is attributable to the repetition manipulation per se, then this same interaction should be observed even when the repetition effect is primarily phonological, rather than orthographic. In contrast, if central attention is needed for both (a) sublexical phonological processing, as implied by the additive effects that nonword letter length and graphemic complexity have with SOA, and for (b) lexical phonological processing, as indexed by the additive effects of ND and SOA, then the effect of repetition will be additive with SOA when the effect is phonologically based. One way to discriminate between these two accounts is to use pseudowords (orthographically legal nonwords, for example, frolt) and exception words in the context of a PRP experiment. The problem with using such pseudowords, however, is that the locus of repetition effects for these stimuli is unclear. Some theorists have proposed that these effects arise from episodic memory (e.g., Feustel, Shiffrin, &amp; Salasoo, 1983), whereas others have suggested that it arises in gen- erating an articulatory code (a motor program; for example, see Seidenberg, Petersen, MacDonald, &amp; Plaut, 1996). It is thus likely that the repetition effect for such pseudowords arises from processing outside the specialized processes involved in reading aloud that we are interested in here. Stimuli that yield a repetition effect that can be clearly attributed to phonologically based lexical reading processes are necessary, and one such class of stimuli is pseudohomophones (nonwords that sound like real words; for example, froot sounds identical to fruit). There is substantial evidence that when pseudohomophones are read aloud, they benefit from activation of their word counterparts in the phonological output lexicon (Reynolds &amp; Besner, 2005). Pilot work in our lab also demonstrates that when read aloud, pseudohomophones are associated with a long-term rep- etition effect (lasting over a 150-item lag). Armed with these findings, we now consider the likely effects of the prior reading of exception words and pseudohomophones in the context of the PRP paradigm. First, we assume that the repe- tition effect for exception words arises from persisting activation in both orthographic and phonological lexicons. In contrast, the effect of repetition for pseudohomophones is argued to arise only from persisting activation in the phonological lexicon, because the orthographic lexicon contains no representations for pseudohomo- phones, given that they are spelled differently from their corre- sponding base words.1 This leads us to expect that, as in Reynolds and Besner (2006), the repetition priming effect for exception words will be underad- ditive with SOA because feature, letter, and orthographic–lexical processing can occur in the absence of central attention. We also 1 To be sure, there is at least one report of a large perceptual component to a repetition priming effect for nonwords that neither sound like nor are spelled like real words. Bowers (1996) reported an effect of repetition, with an average lag of 50 items, over two experiments. The critical manipulation was the level of shift in perceptual features between the lowercase and uppercase presentation. Critically, high-shift nonwords (e.g., RENG–reng) were more impaired during test compared with low-shift nonwords (e.g., CULP–culp) At first glance, Bowers’ result appears to conflict with the present result in the following way: If there is a perceptual component to a nonword repetition effect, then why didn’t the repetition effect for pseudohomophones in the present experiment also yield an underadditive interaction with SOA? In our view this question is likely premature, given that there are at least three obvious ways in which Bowers’ experiment differs from the present one. First, the tasks are very different (5-s exposure to each item in Bowers’ experiment and detailed processing of visual features). Second, the lags are very different (the average lag in Bowers’ experiment was 50 items, whereas it was 150 in the present experiment). Finally, the nonwords are quite different in that in Bowers’ experiment they neither were spelled like nor sounded like real words, whereas here they all sounded like real words but did not spell real words. To the extent that subjects pick up on this (consciously or unconsciously), it is likely to have an impact on how items were encoded. Any or all of these differences between experiments may be important. 424 BRIEF REPORTS expect to see, as in Reynolds and Besner, a small residual effect of repetition at the short SOA due to persisting activation in the phonological output lexicon. This residual effect at the short SOA arises because activating the phonological lexicon is bottlenecked, as evidenced by the additive effects of ND and SOA (Reynolds &amp; Besner, 2006). In contrast, repetition priming for pseudohomo- phones is expected to be additive with SOA because it arises from (a) the use of sublexical spelling–sound translation, which is bottlenecked by Task 1, followed by (b) activation in the phono- logical output lexicon that persists over a long lag. At the long SOA, we expect the repetition effect for exception words to be larger than that for pseudohomophones because there are two loci contributing to the effect of repetition for exception words (long-lag activation in both the orthographic and phonolog- ical lexicons), whereas there is only one locus for pseudohomo- phones (long-lag activation in the phonological lexicon) because there are no representations for pseudohomophones in the ortho- graphic lexicon. Additive effects of repetition and SOA for pseudohomophones would be consistent with the claim that the nonlexical routine (or its products) requires central attention. More generally, additive effects of these factors would again be inconsistent with the widespread view that spelling–sound translation is automatic in the sense of being impervious to interruptions from other processing, and that it does not require any form of attention. Method Participants Forty-eight native English speakers from the University of Wa- terloo were paid six dollars each to participate. Apparatus Stimulus presentation was controlled using a Pentium IV 2.0 gHz computer running E-prime 1.1 software (Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2001). Vocal responses were collected using a Plantronics LS1 microphone headset and a voice key assembly. Stimuli were displayed on a 17–in. ADI Microscan monitor. Key press responses for the tone task were collected via a QWERTY keyboard. Stimuli The stimulus set consisted of 100 pseudohomophones and the 100 exception words from Reynolds and Besner (2006), which can be found in the supplemental material. Items were rotated through repeat/novel and SOA conditions across subjects. Procedure Participants were assigned to a counterbalanced condition based on the order in which they arrived in the laboratory. Participants were tested individually and were seated approximately 50 cm from the screen. Part 1. Each participant received two blocks of trials, both containing the same 100 stimuli (50 exception words and 50 pseudohomophones) presented in a random order. Part 1 was preceded by eight practice trials to familiarize participants with the procedure. Each trial began with a cross () displayed in the middle of the screen, which the participants were instructed to fixate on. The fixation cross remained on screen for 500 ms and then was replaced by a blank screen. After 56 ms, a letter string, centered horizontally at fixation, was presented and remained on the screen until it was read aloud into the headset microphone. Participants were instructed to read aloud quickly while maintain- ing a high degree of accuracy. Part 2. Pilot work yielded a relatively large number of errors for new exception words when mixed together with pseudohomo- phones. We sought to minimize such errors here by blocking exception words and pseudohomophones (order counterbalanced across subjects) in Part 2. One block consisted of all 50 exception words repeated from Part 1, randomly intermixed with 50 new exception words; the other block consisted of all 50 pseudohomo- phones repeated from Part 1 intermixed with 50 new pseudohomo- phones. In both blocks, half of the items were presented at the short SOA and half at the long SOA, such that there were 25 items for each of the four conditions. Each block was preceded by 18 practice trials to familiarize participants with the procedure. Each trial in Part 2 began with a cross () displayed in the middle of the screen for 500 ms, which participants were instructed to fixate on. The fixation cross was then replaced by a blank screen, and 56 ms later either a high (1,500 Hz) or a low (500 Hz) 100-ms tone sounded. Either 50 ms or 1,500 ms following the onset of the tone, a letter string appeared at fixation in 18-point lowercase Courier New font. Participants were instructed to re- spond to the tone first, by pressing M for the high tone and N for the low tone, and then to read aloud the letter string. The letter string remained on the screen until a vocal response was detected. Participants were instructed to perform both tasks quickly and accurately. Results Only the data from Part 2 (the PRP data) were analyzed. Mean RTs and percentage errors for each condition can be seen in Table 1. RTs and errors for exception words and pseudohomophones were each fitted to linear mixed-effects models as outlined by Baayen (in press), with subject and items as crossed random effects. One advantage of using mixed effects models instead of traditional analyses of variance (ANOVAs) or hierarchical or multilevel models (in which items are assumed to be nested) is that it overcomes a lack of power associated with repeated observa- tions. For a formal specification and evaluation of this statistical method, see Baayen, Davidson and Bates (2007). We report ̂, the corresponding t value for RTs, and the z value for errors. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution of the parameters was used in the RT analysis to analyze significance and to calculate the 95% confidence intervals. We complete the spec- ification by reporting the standard deviation of the random effects. All analyses were computed in R, using the lme4 package (R Development Core Team, 2004). For the purpose of comparison, the subject and item ANOVAs are reported in the Appendix. Trials on which there was an error to Task 1 or Task 2 were removed prior to analysis, resulting in the removal of 6.9% of the RTs. An additional 3.9% were removed due to voice key failures. Remaining RTs were submitted to the outlier removal procedure advocated by Van Selst and Jolicœur (1994), resulting in removal 425BRIEF REPORTS of an additional 3.1% of RTs from Task 1 and 1.4% of RTs from Task 2. Exception Words Tone discrimination. There were no significant effects of rep- etition or SOA, nor was there an interaction. There were more Task 1 errors at the short SOA than at the long SOA, ̂  0.85, z  3.9, p  .05. There was no effect of repetition or interaction between the effects of SOA and repetition in the error data. The standard deviation of the random effect of word was estimated at 0.011, and the standard deviation of the random effect of subject was estimated at 0.016. Reading aloud. The 24-ms repetition effect at the long SOA reduced to 7 ms at the short SOA, ̂  18.69, t(4123)  2.21, p  .05. The standard deviation of the random effect of word was estimated at 29.6. In this model there were two random effects associated with subject. First, the standard deviation of the by- subject adjustments was estimated at 63.4. Additionally, subjects were differentially sensitive to SOA (log-likelihood ratio  26286, p  .0001), the standard deviation for the by-subject adjustments to the SOA coefficient was 132.5, and the correlation of the by-subject adjustment to intercept and SOA was 0.25. The residual standard deviation was 135.1. The 95% confidence interval for the interaction was 16 ms. There was a main effect of repetition in the error data, such that more errors were made to new words than to repeated ones, ̂  0.75, z  4.8, p  .05, and there was an effect of SOA, such that more errors were made when SOA was short, ̂  0.34, z  2.2, p  .05. The standard deviation of the random effect of word was estimated at 1.4, and the standard deviation of the random effect of subject was estimated at 0.66. Pseudohomophones Tone discrimination. There were no significant effects of rep- etition or SOA, nor was there an interaction. There was no effect of repetition in the error data. There were more Task 1 errors at the short SOA than at the long SOA, ̂  0.02, z  2.9, p  .05, but this effect did not interact with the effect of repetition. The standard deviation of the random effect of word was estimated at 0.00002, and the standard deviation of the random effect of subject was estimated at 0.052. Reading aloud. There were main effects of repetition, ̂  25.1, t(4123)  5.9, p  .001, and SOA, ̂  306.1, t(4123)  16.9, p  .001. The interaction did not approach significance. The standard deviation of the random effect of word was estimated at 28.2. In this model there were two random effects associated with subject: First, the standard deviation of the by-subject adjustments was estimated at 64.6. Second, subjects were differentially sensi- tive to SOA (log-likelihood ratio  26187, p  .0001), the standard deviation for the by-subject adjustments to the SOA coefficient was 125.1, and the correlation of the by-subject adjust- ment to intercept and SOA was 0.33. The residual standard devi- ation was 135.9, and the 95% confidence interval for the interac- tion was 17 ms. There was an effect of repetition in the error data, such that more errors were made to nonrepeated items than to repeated ones, ̂  0.57, z  3.4, p  .05. More errors were also made at the long than short SOA, ̂  0.48, z  2.9, p  .05. The interaction was not significant. The standard deviation of the random effect of word was estimated at 1.3, and the standard deviation of the random effect of subject was estimated at 0.81. Discussion This experiment examined the extent to which central attention is involved during the process of generating a phonological code in response to exception words and to pseudohomophones. Consis- tent with Reynolds and Besner (2006), the effect of repetition priming for exception words decreased as SOA decreased. Criti- cally, the effect of repetition for pseudohomophones was additive with SOA. Finally, the repetition effect for exception words was no larger than that for pseudohomophones at the long SOA, contrary to our expectations. Role of Central Attention in Reading Aloud The finding that the effect of repetition priming for exception words was reduced at the short SOA suggests, given cognitive slack logic, that orthographic processing (features, letters, and processing at the level of the orthographic input lexicon) occurs Table 1 Mean Reaction Times and Percentage Errors for Exception Words and Pseudohomophones (PHs) at a Short (50 ms) and a Long (1,500 ms) Stimulus Onset Asynchrony Task Reaction time Percentage error Words PHs Words PHs 50 ms 1,500 ms 50 ms 1,500 ms 50 ms 1,500 ms 50 ms 1,500 ms Task 1: Tone identification New 513 507 512 500 3.6 1.6 2.8 2.1 Repeated 520 510 508 500 3.7 1.4 3.4 1.5 Difference 7 3 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.6 0.6 Task 2: Reading aloud New 855 553 881 572 5.3 7.0 3.6 6.1 Repeated 848 529 854 549 3.2 3.5 2.5 2.7 Difference 7 24 27 23 2.1 3.5 1.1 3.4 426 BRIEF REPORTS without the need for central attention (see also Reynolds &amp; Besner, 2006). In contrast, the finding that the effect of repetition priming for pseudohomophones (which depends on prior sublexical pho- nological processing) was additive with SOA suggests, using cog- nitive slack logic, that such processing either uses central attention or occurs after some unspecified process that uses central attention. This conclusion is presumably unwelcome to those who assert that phonological processing in reading is “automatic” (see Reynolds &amp; Besner, 2006, for an extensive list of investigators who hold this view). Loci of Long-Lag Repetition Effects for Exception Words and Pseudohomophones The present findings also suggest that there are two loci for long-lag repetition priming effects in the context of reading aloud. The first locus is in the orthographic input lexicon. This repetition effect is arguably lexical in nature, given that it is unlikely that there is persisting activation of letters and features over this long lag. Had such long-lag activation of letters and features been possible, then one would have expected to also see an underaddi- tive interaction associated with pseudohomophones. The second locus for long-lag repetition is in the phonological output lexicon, given that pseudohomophones, which can activate representations for their real-word counterparts, also produced a repetition effect. This brings us to a remaining issue. If exception words activate lexical representations at both the orthographic and phonological levels, but pseudohomophones activate lexical representations only at the phonological level, then we ought to have observed two other findings. First, the repetition effect for exception words should have been larger than that for pseudohomophones at the long SOA, yet it was not. Moreover, there should have been some residual effect of repetition for exception words that was not absorbed into the cognitive slack at the short SOA. This is ex- pected on the grounds that lexical processing after the orthographic lexicon is bottlenecked, given Reynolds and Besner’s (2006) find- ing that ND (a lexical variable) had additive effects with SOA. There was no significant residual effect of repetition for exception words at the short SOA here—although there was in the Reynolds and Besner experiment. It is also the case that the effect of repetition for exception words in the Reynolds and Besner exper- iment was considerably larger (54 ms at the long SOA) than it was here (27 ms). We can only speculate that the present practice of mixing exception words with pseudohomophones in the first pre- sentation and then testing these items in blocked fashion was responsible for producing what is observed here, although why that would be the case is unclear. This issue merits further investiga- tion, but we contend that it leaves unchallenged our main inference from the results of the present experiment: The additivity of repetition priming and SOA for pseudohomophones arises because prior sublexical spelling–sound translation requires attention and is bottlenecked by Task 1 processing. Computational Models of Reading Aloud All computational accounts of reading aloud currently on the table, whether they are localist or distributed, assume differential processing of low-frequency exception words and pseudohomo- phones. Further, these models treat reading aloud as though it were accomplished by an autonomous system: Processing is initiated by the stimulus and unfolds without any demands on external re- sources or mechanisms. These models likely developed in this way for two reasons: (1) a widespread belief that reading single letter strings aloud is automatic for skilled readers and thus does not require any form of attention, and (2) there are few studies that have directly assessed the role of central attention in the context of reading aloud, despite a voluminous literature on “attention” per se (see Pashler, 1998). Given the present results and those reported by Reynolds and Besner (2006), computational models will need to make provisions for “external” processing mechanisms or resources. Two issues will need to be addressed in such implementations: where and how central attention plays a role in processing. We have addressed the where question here and proposed at least two loci. In the context of localist models such as DRC (Coltheart et al., 2001) and the connectionist dual process (CDP; Perry, Ziegler, &amp; Zorzi, 2007) these loci are (a) after activation in the orthographic input lexicon, and (b) after letter identification but prior to or at the point where sublexical translation takes place in the nonlexical route. In the class of PDP models, central attention must be in play following the orthographic level, both in the direct translation of orthography to phonology (needed for reading aloud nonwords) and either prior to semantic activation and/or following it, given that low- frequency exception words are typically read aloud via the orthog- raphy to semantics to phonology route (e.g., Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996). The answer to the how question remains unclear. Conclusions Whatever one’s theoretical predilections about the specific com- putations involved in spelling–sound translation, the present re- sults constrain such accounts in an important respect. Taken to- gether with the work by Reynolds and Besner (2006) they provide a converging counterweight to the received view that all the mental processes involved in reading aloud occur automatically2 in that no form of attention is needed and processing cannot be stopped for any amount of time. 2 There is, of course, one sense in which reading aloud is not automatic: processing can be stopped prior to actually producing an utterance (we don’t typically go around reading aloud things like stop signs).

Reaction times (RTs) and errors for exception words and pseudohomophones were analyzed with a pair of 2  2 analyses of variance in which repetition and SOA in Task 2 were repeated measures. As reported in the Results section, the RT data were submitted to an outlier removal procedure, and trials on which there was an error to Task 1 or Task 2 or a voice key failure were removed prior to analysis. Exception Words Tone Discrimination There were no significant effects of repetition (Fs  1) or SOA (Fs  1), nor was there any interaction (Fs  1) in the RT data. There was no significant effect of repetition (Fs  1) in the error data. There were more Task 1 errors at the short SOA than at the long SOA, F1(1, 47)  28.4, MSE  7.79, p .001; F2(1, 99)  11.6, MSE  15.9, p  .01. There was no interaction between the effects of SOA and repetition (F1  1), F2(1, 99)  1.5, MSE  20.1, p  .05, in the error data. Reading Aloud The 24-ms repetition effect at the long SOA reduced to 7 ms at the short SOA, F1(1, 47)  4.9, MSE  752, p  .05, although this interaction was not significant in the item analysis, F2(1, 99)  0.629, MSE  4,703, p  .430, despite being in the same direction (28 ms at the long SOA reduced to 17 ms at the short SOA). There was a main effect of repetition in the error data, such that more errors were made to new words than to repeated ones, F1(1, 47)  22.6, MSE  16.9, p  .001; F2(1, 99)  15.1, MSE  22.2, p  .001. There was no effect of SOA in the subjects’ error data, F1 (1, 47)  1.8, MSE  31.8, p  .05, but it was significant in the item analysis, F2(1, 99)  8.4, MSE  35.3, p  .01, and there was no interaction between repetition and SOA in the error data, F1(1, 47)  1.01, MSE  20.9, p  .05; F2(1, 99)  2.6, MSE  23.1, p  .05. Pseudohomophones Tone Discrimination There was no effect of repetition (Fs  1). There was no effect of SOA in the subject analysis (F1  1), but it was significant in the item analysis, F2(1, 99)  4.1, MSE  4,154, p  .046. There was no interaction (Fs  1) in the RT data. There was no effect of repetition (Fs  1) in the error data. There were more Task 1 errors at the short SOA than at the long SOA, F1(1, 47)  9.24, MSE  9.41, p  .01; F2(1, 99)  16.8, MSE  26.1, p  .001, but this effect did not interact with the effect of repetition, F1(1, 47)  1.7, MSE  9.69, p  .05; F2(1, 99)  0.039, MSE  19.2, p  .05. Reading Aloud There were main effects of repetition, F1(1, 47)  23.6, MSE  1,325, p  .001; F2(1, 99)  25.1, MSE  2,441, p  .001, and SOA, F1(1, 47)  270, MSE  16,676, p  .001; F2(1, 99)  3,284.9, MSE  2,929, p  .001. There was no interaction (Fs  1). There was an effect of repetition in the error data, such that more errors were made to nonrepeated items than to repeated ones, F1(1, 47)  12.2, MSE  13.46, p  .01; F2(1, 99)  19.9, MSE  37.2, p  .001. More errors were also made at the long than short SOA, F1(1, 47)  10.4, MSE  14.5, p  .01; F2(1, 99)  3.9, MSE  35.3, p  .05. The interaction was not significant, F1(1, 47)  2.04, MSE  11.9, p  .05; F2(1, 99)  1.3, MSE  33.4, p  .05.
