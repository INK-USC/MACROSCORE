An Examination of Secular Trends in Narcissism and Self-Enhancement Kali H. Trzesniewski,1 M. Brent Donnellan,2 and Richard W. Robins3 1The University of Western Ontario, 2Michigan State University, and 3University of California, Davis ABSTRACT—The present research investigated secular trends in narcissism and self-enhancement over the past three decades. Despite recent claims about the impact of the ‘‘self-esteem movement’’ on the current generation of young people, we found no evidence that college students’ scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory increased from the 1980s through 2007 (N 5 26,867), although we did find small changes in specific facets of narcissism. Similarly, we found no evidence that high school students’ level of self-enhancement, defined by the discrepancy between their perceived intelligence and their actual academic achievements, increased from 1976 to 2006 (N 5 410,527). These results cast doubt on the belief that today’s young people have increasingly inflated impres- sions of themselves compared with previous generations. All evidence suggests that narcissism is much more common in recent generations. —Twenge (2006, p. 69) I’ve been a professor at EmoryUniversity for the past twenty years, and I interrelatewith awide range of students.Whether they are going to be ministers or teachers or social scientists or lawyers or doctors, I don’t detect that this generation is any more committed to personal gain to the exclusion of benevolent causes than others have been in the past. —Former President Jimmy Carter, interviewed by Tom Brokaw (Brokaw, 2007, p. 58) Several decades ago, California State Congressman John Vasconcellos, who referred to himself as the ‘‘Johnny Appleseed of self-esteem,’’ spearheaded a movement to create school pro- grams designed to improve self-esteem (Mecca, Smelser, &amp; Vasconcellos, 1989). This movement came under attack almost immediately and continues to be attacked today (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, &amp; Vohs, 2003; Hewitt, 1998; Seligman, 1995; Twenge, 2006). Although well-designed self-esteem in- terventions can have positive effects on children’s outcomes (e.g., Haney &amp; Durlak, 1998; O’Mara, Marsh, Craven, &amp; Debus, 2006), the Vasconcellos-inspired school programs often lacked precise implementation and grounding in research. Many of these programs seemed to emphasize feeling good over achiev- ing, giving awards and good grades to all students even in the absence of real achievements. Similarly, American culture is stereotyped as being overly focused on seeking high self-esteem at all costs (e.g., Crocker&amp;Park, 2004;Heine, Lehman,Markus, &amp;Kitayama, 1999). As a result, there is widespread concern that the American ‘‘feel good culture’’ and the self-esteem programs it spawned have inadvertently produced a generation of young narcissists. Most notably, Twenge (2006) has characterized Americans born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s as ‘‘GenerationMe,’’ a label selected to capture their purported tendency to be more ego- tistical, entitled, and overconfident than previous generations, presumably because they grew up in this ‘‘culture of self-worth.’’ Media reports based on Twenge, Konrath, Foster, Campbell, and Bushman’s (in press) forthcoming analysis of generational changes in average scores on the Narcissistic Personality In- ventory (NPI; Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988) have further disseminated the idea that America’s youth are increasingly narcissistic (e.g., Address correspondence to Kali Trzesniewski, Department of Psy- chology, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada N6A 5C2, e-mail: k.trz@uwo.ca. PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Volume 19—Number 2 181Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at Mount Royal University on August 26, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from Associated Press, 2007). Coverage of this work has been wide- spread, appearing in high-profile media outlets such as the At- lantic Monthly, CBS News, and National Public Radio as well as in major newspapers such as the Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post. The purpose of this report is to examine the evidence for the claim that today’s young people are more self-centered and self- aggrandizing than young people of previous generations. We analyzed secular changes in narcissism using large samples of undergraduate students from northern California, the geo- graphic epicenter of the self-esteem movement. In addition, we examined secular changes in one prominent manifestation of narcissism, self-enhancement (i.e., the tendency to hold unre- alistically positive beliefs about the self), using data from the college-student samples and from the Monitoring the Future project (Johnston, Bachman, &amp;O’Malley, 2003), a large national probability study of high school seniors conducted annually since 1976. Why might narcissism and self-enhancement be increasing in recent generations? A number of social commentators have noted a shift in American culture from communitarian values and strong social ties toward an emphasis on individualism and the pursuit of one’s own needs (e.g., Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, &amp; Tipton, 1985; Lasch, 1979; Putnam, 2000).1 These social values are thought to shape individual personality char- acteristics. As noted by Lasch (1979), ‘‘Every society repro- duces its culture—its norms, its underlying assumptions, its modes of organizing experience—in the individual, in the form of personality’’ (p. 76). It is difficult to devise models that explain the processes through which broad societal trends affect per- sonality (Stewart &amp; Healy, 1989). However, identifying changes in personality associated with birth cohort is an important first step. Unfortunately, identifying cohort effects is empirically chal- lenging (e.g., Costa &amp; McCrae, 1982; Schaie, 1965).2 One ap- proach, pioneered by Twenge and her colleagues (Twenge, 2000; Twenge&amp;Campbell, 2001), is to conduct a cross-temporalmeta- analysis in which changes in average personality scores are examined as a function of date of data collection. Using this methodology, Twenge et al. (in press) found that the average NPI score has increased steadily in college students since the scale was first administered in 1982. Although this is an important application of meta-analytic techniques, the results are none- theless constrained by limitations in the sampling procedures used in the original studies. The college-student samples in- cluded in the meta-analysis were mostly small and perhaps subject to selection biases; thus, we believe that it is informative to examine secular trends in narcissism and self-enhancement in large samples of prescreening data and in a nationally rep- resentative sample. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that narcissism levels are increasing by comparing mean scores on the NPI using data collected on college students in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The NPI (Raskin &amp; Hall, 1979) was designed to assess personality characteristics associated with the clinical definition of narcissistic personality disorder in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. These attributes include a grandiose sense of importance, a preoccupation with power and success, exhibitionism, arro- gance, exploitativeness, and a sense of entitlement. The NPI is the most widely used and well-validated measure of subclinical levels of narcissism and has been shown to predict psycholo- gists’ ratings of narcissism (John &amp;Robins, 1994). Thus, the NPI provides one of the best ways to measure whether or not today’s college students exhibit more narcissistic tendencies than pre- vious generations. To complement our analysis of secular trends in the NPI, we also examined trends in self-enhancement, a construct that is associated with narcissism (John &amp; Robins, 1994; Paulhus, 1998). We operationalized self-enhancement as the discrepancy between participants’ ratings of their intelli- gence and more objective indicators of their intellectual ability (SAT scores and grade point average, or GPA). If young people have been getting more narcissistic over the past three decades, then the degree to which they overestimate their ability should have been increasing as well. METHOD Narcissism We used data drawn from mass testing sessions of introductory psychology students conducted at the University of California, Davis and Berkeley campuses, in 1996 and annually from 2002 to 2007. We restricted the analyses to the 25,849 students be- tween 18 and 24 years of age (Mdn 5 19, SD 5 1.40) who completed the 40-item forced-choice version of the NPI (alpha reliability ranged from .84 to .85 across years). We selected students who were of traditional college age to provide a cleaner test of the cohort-effect hypothesis. The sample was 66.3% fe- male; 39.7% were Asian American, 30.9% were Caucasian, 2.2% were African American, 9.4% were Hispanic, and 17.8% were of mixed or other races or did not state their ethnic back- ground. To extend our test of secular trends, we compared means from the 1990s and 2000s with means first published by Raskin and Terry (1988); these means were based on 1,018 participants (52.5% female) who completed the NPI between 1979 and 1985. 1However, a shift toward increasing individualism might not be unique to the 20th and 21st centuries. Historical research on the family has identified in- creases in individualism as far back as 17th-century England (see Cherlin, 1983). 2Differences between samples could represent an effect of time of mea- surement, rather than a cohort effect. For example, in the present case, indi- viduals of all ages assessed in the 1980s could have higher narcissism scores than individuals of all ages assessed in the 1990s or 2000s (e.g., because of something about the social milieu at the time of assessment). 182 Volume 19—Number 2 Secular Changes in Narcissism at Mount Royal University on August 26, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from Self-Enhancement To track secular trends in self-enhancement, we used data from two sources. First, in the mass testing sessions conducted at the University of California between 2003 and 2007 (self-enhancement data were not available in the 1996 and 2002 assessments), students were asked to ‘‘rate your intelligence compared to the general population,’’ using a scale ranging from 1 (bottom 5%) to 10 (top 5%). To gauge self-enhancement, we computed the degree to which self-perceived intelligence was higher than objective indicators of academic ability (SATscores and college GPA).3 Specifically, we conducted multiple re- gression analyses (using data from all assessment years, i.e., from 2003 through 2007) in which each indicator of ability was regressed on the self-ratings of intelligence and the unstan- dardized residuals were retained. Because the two resulting self- enhancement indices—one based on SAT scores and the other based on GPA—were almost perfectly correlated (r 5 .90), we computed a single combined index by entering both academic criteria simultaneously into a multiple regression predicting self-rated intelligence and then saving the unstandardized re- siduals. Positive values indicate self-enhancement (i.e., over- estimation by the self), and negative values indicate self- diminishment (i.e., underestimation by the self). Residual scores have been widely used to assess self-enhancement (John &amp; Robins, 1994; Paulhus, 1998; Robins &amp; John, 1997). In this sample, self-enhancement correlated .27 with NPI score, a finding consistent with previous research (e.g., Robins &amp; John, 1997). Second, we examined long-term trends in self-enhancement using data from the Monitoring the Future project (Johnston et al., 2003), a very large national probability study of high school seniors conducted annually since 1976 (total N across the 30 years used in these analyses5 410,527; 50.7% female; detailed information about the sample can be found on the Web at http:// www.monitoringthefuture.org/). Every year from 1976 to 2006, high school seniors were asked, ‘‘How intelligent do you think you are compared to others your own age?’’ This item was rated from 1 (far below average) to 7 ( far above average). To assess self-enhancement bias, we used an unstandardized residual score (computed via regression using data from all years) re- flecting the discrepancy between self-perceived intelligence and high school grades; standardized-test scores were not available in the Monitoring the Future data, but given the .90 correlation between self-enhancement based on grades and self- enhancement based on SAT scores in the University of Califor- nia data, it is unlikely that the secular trends would have been different if test scores had been used as a criterion instead of grades. Because of privacy issues associated with publicly available data, ethnicity was coded as White or non-White (83.4% White). RESULTS Secular Trends in Narcissism Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations by year of data collection for the full-scale NPI. Given the large sample sizes, we focus on effect sizes rather than significance levels. We discuss all effects that meet or surpass Cohen’s (1988) guideline of a small effect (i.e., an r of .10 or a d of 0.20). Year of data collection (from 1996 to 2007) was uncorrelated with full-scale NPI score (r5 .01).4 Given the lack of time trend in these data, we computed the average score on the NPI for all participants from 1996 through 2007 and compared this ag- gregate score to that reported by Raskin and Terry (1998). This comparison provides a direct test of the cohort hypothesis be- cause it compares Generation Me (i.e., members of our sample were all born after 1971) with previous generations (i.e., par- ticipants in Raskin and Terry’s study were all born before 1969). As Table 1 shows, there was a very small difference (d50.06) between NPI means computed in our data (Generation Me) and in Raskin and Terry’s original data. To further illustrate the ef- fects, we standardized all NPI scores from 1996 through 2007 to Raskin and Terry’s mean and standard deviation. These average standardized scores are plotted by year in Figure 1. As the figure shows, all of the means from 1996 through 2007 were slightly below Raskin and Terry’s average (e.g., the largest standardized difference was0.10, for scores in 2002, N5 3,117). Thus, we found no evidence for a secular increase in NPI scores among college students from the 1980s to the 2000s, and if anything, we found weak support for a secular decline.5 Gender, ethnicity, and age did not moderate the time trend (none of the interaction terms accounted for more than 0.1% of the variance), although we did find somemain effects. Men (M5 0.41) had higher narcissism scores than women (M5 0.37; d5 0.24), and Caucasians (M5 0.39) had higher narcissism scores than Asian Americans (M 5 0.34; d 5 0.29). Age was uncor- related with NPI scores in this age-restricted sample (r 5 .01). It is possible that specific aspects of narcissism have in- creased over time while others have decreased, producing no 3The SAT provides a good proxy for general intelligence. For example, Frey and Detterman (2004) found a correlation of .82 between SAT scores and a measure of g (or general intelligence) derived from the Armed Services Voca- tional Aptitude Battery in a large sample from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. 4The participant’s year of birth (range: 1972–1989) was also uncorrelated with NPI score (r 5 .01). 5Although these data come from multiple University of California campus- es—Raskin and Terry’s data from Berkeley and Santa Cruz, the 1996 data from Berkeley, and the 2002–2007 data from Davis—the campuses do not seem to vary systematically in mean levels of narcissism. For example, Ames, Rose, and Anderson (2006) recently reported a mean NPI score of 0.39 (SD 5 0.17) in a large prescreening sample of undergraduates at Berkeley (Study 1; N 5 776), and this mean is identical to Raskin and Terry’s mean, as well as to the mean NPI score in the most recent assessment at Davis.

Robins at Mount Royal University on August 26, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from aggregate change at the full-scale level. However, an examin- ation of time trends from 1996 to 2007 for NPI subscales created by Emmons (1987) and by Raskin and Terry (1988) provided no evidence for changes in specific aspects of narcissism (r 5 .01–.02 for correlations between subscale scores and year of data collection). Nonetheless, we found a few differences when comparing the subscale means for 1996 through 2007 with subscalemeans from 1979 through 1985 reported byRaskin and Terry. As Table 1 shows, scores on four subscales decreased (Authority, Exhibitionism, Superiority, and Vanity), and scores on three increased (Entitlement, Exploitiveness, and Self- Sufficiency), although the largest effect size was a decline of only a third of a standard deviation in Superiority. Secular Trends in Self-Enhancement We found no evidence that self-enhancement changed over time in either sample; the correlation (r) between self-enhancement and year of data collection was.02 and.03, respectively, for the University of California sample (2003–2007) and the Mon- itoring the Future sample (1976–2006).6 Moreover, neither gender nor ethnic group moderated the time trend (neither of the interaction terms accounted for more than 0.1% of the variance in either sample). Results were similar to those for narcissism in that men self-enhanced more than women in both the college sample (Ms 5 0.27 vs. 0.14, d 5 0.39) and the high school sample (Ms 5 0.19 vs. 0.18, d 5 0.36) and that Caucasian college students (M 5 0.22) reported higher levels of self-en- hancement than Asian college students (M50.24; d5 0.46). However, in the high school sample, non-Caucasians (M5 0.12) and Caucasians (M 5 0.00) did not differ in self-enhancement (d 5 0.12). DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to investigate secular changes in narcissism and self-enhancement using large samples of northern Californian college students and a nationally repre- sentative sample of high school students from theMonitoring the Future study. California is regarded as the home of the self-es- teem movement, so data from universities in this state are par- ticularly useful given recent claims about the negative impact of the culture of self-worth. Contrary to previous research and media reports, this study yielded no evidence that levels of narcissism have increased since Raskin and Terry (1988) first published their 40-item forced-choice version of the NPI. Likewise, we found no evidence that self-enhancement, defined as inflated perceptions of intelligence, has increased over the past 30 years. Thus, today’s youth seem to be no more narcis- sistic and self-aggrandizing than previous generations. Indeed, the means for the NPI from our sample closely re- semble the means from a large Internet sample (Foster, Camp- bell, &amp; Twenge, 2003). In the latter sample, the average NPI score for Americans ages 20 to 24 was 15.58 (N5 775; J. Foster, personal communication, April 5, 2007) and in our sample, the mean NPI score for students ages 20 to 24 was 15.23 (N 5 10,491). In addition, the mean reported by Foster et al. is very close to the average of 15.55 reported by Raskin and Terry (1988).

Why do our findings differ from those of Twenge et al. (in press)? First, our NPI results are based on large prescreening samples, and our self-enhancement findings are based on a na- tionally representative sample, whereas the findings of Twenge et al. are meta-analytic results based on aggregated data from comparatively small samples of college students (median N 5 126, range 5 24–1,182). Aggregating means from small conve- nience studies of college students might not be the best strategy for making inferences about birth cohorts because students choose to participate in studies on the basis of titles and de- scriptions that might appeal to their individual characteristics, including narcissism (e.g., Carnahan &amp; McFarland, 2007). In contrast, we used data from large mass testing sessions, which makes our NPI samples considerably larger than those of most individual studies of college students (our average annual sam- ple size was 3,692) and makes the possibility of selection effects less of a concern.Moreover, theMonitoring the Future results are based on a representative sampling of high school students, a sampling procedure that is particularly well suited for evaluating claims about secular increases in self-enhancement. Indeed, we believe that issues of sampling are paramount when making generalizations about entire birth cohorts. Re- searchers who are interested in making point estimates of par- ticular attitudes often pay careful attention to sampling procedures. Most college-student samples are generated using nonprobability sampling techniques. As noted by Pedhazur and Schmelkin (1991), ‘‘the incontrovertible fact is that, in non- probability sampling, it is not possible to estimate sampling errors. Therefore, validity of inferences to a population cannot be ascertained’’ (p. 321). To be sure, pooling together conve- nience samples of college students will never lead to estimates that can be defended as representative of an entire population of college students, let alone members of an entire birth cohort. That is, no amount of aggregation will circumvent the limitations of convenience sampling. A second reason why our results differ from those of Twenge et al. (in press) is that cross-temporal meta-analyses yield ecological coefficients (Robinson, 1950), which are calculated using summary statistics (e.g., sample means) rather than in- dividual data points. As Rosenthal, Rosnow, and Rubin (2000) noted, ‘‘correlations based on aggregated data (e.g., group means) can be dramatically larger or smaller (even in the op- posite direction) than correlations based on individual scores’’ (p. 2). We examined this issue by comparing the correlation between year of data collection and self-enhancement based on the full Monitoring the Future sample with the alerting corre- lation based on the mean self-enhancement score for each year (i.e., the data in Table 2). As reported in the Results section, the correlation based on the full sample was .03; in contrast, the alerting correlation was .57. Similarly, using the college-stu- dent data from 1996 to 2007, we compared the individual-level correlation between year of data collection and NPI score with the altering correlation for the mean scores reported in Table 1. The individual-level correlation was .01, whereas the alerting correlation was .40; likewise, the individual-level correlations ranged from .00 to .01 across Raskin and Terry’s (1988) NPI subscales, whereas the alerting correlations ranged from .41 (Superiority) to .82 (Exhibitionism).

Robins at Mount Royal University on August 26, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from differences are consistent with the methodological literature, which indicates that alerting correlations overestimate indi- vidual effects in most behavioral research (Robinson, 1950; Rosenthal et al., 2000). Thus, the cross-temporal meta-analytic approach may amplify effects that are trivial from a psycho- logical perspective. A third issue to consider is that the NPI measures multiple facets of narcissism (e.g., Emmons, 1987; Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988), and temporal changes at the facet level may not always map onto temporal changes in the full-scale score. Emmons (1987) showed that subscales of the NPI can have distinct ex- ternal correlates, some of which might be considered psycho- logically adaptive (e.g., see Bradlee &amp; Emmons, 1992). Similarly, Konrath, Bushman, and Campbell (2006) reported that the NPI Entitlement subscale is a better predictor of laboratory-based measures of aggression than the full scale is (see their footnote 1), which suggests that not all of the narcissistic tendencies assessed by the NPI are equally de- structive. The most important concern, however, is that because the NPI assesses a number of constructs, it is unclear how to precisely interpret any changes in the summary score. A secular change in the NPI might signal changes in socially toxic traits (e.g., entitlement), socially noxious traits (e.g., vanity), or simply relatively benign traits (e.g., leadership). Our results illustrate this point: The largest increase was found for the seemingly benign trait of self-sufficiency, and the largest decrease was found for the seemingly socially toxic trait of superiority. This study has several limitations. First, although we used large samples of college students to evaluate secular changes in narcissism, our large samples are not likely representative of the entire U.S. population of 18- to 24-year-olds. Indeed, stu- dents at 4-year colleges represent only 24% of the population ages 18 to 24 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005, Table A-5a). More- over, it is unknown how students in psychology courses differ in psychological characteristics from other college students. Nonetheless, these two concerns are mitigated to some extent by the fact that we also failed to find a secular trend in self- enhancement in a representative sample of high school students. Thus, we failed to find evidence of a secular trend in self- enhancement using both representative and convenience samples. Second, we did not have an ideal proxy measure for intelligence to assess self-enhancement in the high school sample. However, this concern is ameliorated by the fact that the results were similar to those based on SATscores in the college- student sample, which is not surprising because in the latter sample, the correlation between self-enhancement based on grades and self-enhancement based on test scores was .90. Thus, the strengths and limitations of our data sets are quite comple- mentary, and the results converge in showing few indications of secular change in self-enhancement. Finally, some of the findings we report are based on null re- sults. However, null results can be critical in science when they counter a predicted effect and when they are based on large samples, which rules out concerns of a lack of power to detect predicted effects. The lack of a clear trend toward increasing narcissism directly addresses recent claims of secular increases in narcissism that have received a great deal of attention in the media, as shown by Jimmy Carter’s response in Rolling Stone magazine. The degree of empirical support for claims of increasing narcissism among this generation of young American adults has important implications for how this generation is viewed by others and how young adults view themselves. We believe that great care needs to be exercised when making broad generalizations about cohort-related increases in narcis- sism. We were unable to find evidence that either narcissism or the closely related construct of self-enhancement has increased TABLE 2 Mean Self-Enhancement by Year of Data Collection Year N Mean (SD) 1976 14,277 0.06 (0.95) 1977 15,638 0.03 (0.97) 1978 15,877 0.00 (0.96) 1979 14,141 0.01 (0.96) 1980 14,056 0.07 (0.99) 1981 15,611 0.06 (0.99) 1982 15,704 0.04 (0.99) 1983 14,514 0.03 (0.99) 1984 14,026 0.03 (1.00) 1985 14,096 0.03 (1.00) 1986 13,631 0.03 (1.01) 1987 14,390 0.07 (1.01) 1988 14,571 0.06 (1.03) 1989 14,785 0.03 (1.04) 1990 11,285 0.03 (1.03) 1991 13,462 0.04 (1.04) 1992 13,845 0.01 (1.06) 1993 13,913 0.01 (1.06) 1994 13,096 0.02 (1.08) 1995 10,647 0.02 (1.06) 1996 11,917 0.05 (1.07) 1997 12,728 0.00 (1.09) 1998 12,627 0.01 (1.09) 1999 11,347 0.01 (1.09) 2000 10,218 0.02 (1.10) 2001 10,390 0.06 (1.09) 2002 10,258 0.08 (1.09) 2003 11,718 0.10 (1.08) 2004 11,957 0.11 (1.07) 2005 11,966 0.08 (1.09) 2006 13,836 0.08 (1.08) da — 0.06 (0.08 to 0.04) aThis row presents the standardized difference between the mean for 2004 through 2006 and the mean for 1976 through 1978.

Moreover, even if we had found evidence for a secular increase in narcissism, placing the blame on the self-esteem movement would seem to go well beyond the data, especially when there is evidence that well-designed and well-implemented self-esteem programs are effective interven- tions for youth with certain problems (Haney &amp; Durlak, 1998; O’Mara et al., 2006). Our view is that the research findings concerning generational differences should be based on well- established results and presented to the public with a good degree of caution given the inherent complexities involved in studying cohort effects.
