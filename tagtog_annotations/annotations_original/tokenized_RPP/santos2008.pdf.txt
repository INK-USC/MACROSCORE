Smile Does Categorization Affect Perceptual Processing in Autism ?
Andreia Santos,1 Cécilie Rondan,2 Delphine B. Rosset,1,3 David Da Fonseca,1,3 and Christine Deruelle1 1Mediterranean Institute of Cognitive Neurosciences , CNRS , Marseille , France ; 2Autism Resource Center , Centre Alpin de Diagnostic Précoce de l ’ Autisme , Grenoble , France ; and 3Autism Resource Center , Hôpital Sainte Marguerite , Marseille , France ABSTRACT—This study compared the influence of catego- rization on perceptual processing in adults with autistic spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and normal control partici- pants .
Participants were asked to categorize hybrid faces ( composed of two overlapped faces of different spatial bandwidths ) by gender and emotion .
Control participants exhibited a bias for low-pass information during gender categorization and a bias for high-pass information during emotion categorization .
By contrast , adults with ASD showed the same low-pass bias in both tasks .
This absence of a shift in processing style in the ASD group is discussed in terms of diminished top-down modulation in autism .
The idea that individuals with autistic spectrum disorders ( ASD ) perform low-level perceptual tasks in an atypical manner is widespread ( for a review , see Behrmann , Thomas , & Hum- phreys , 2006 ) .
Several studies have shown that individuals with ASD are more accurate than control subjects in tasks requiring detail-focused processing .
This pattern has been found , for ex- ample , on the Block Design test ( from the Wechsler Intelligence Scales ) , the embedded-figures task ( Jolliffe & Baron-Cohen , 1997 ; Shah & Frith , 1983 ) , the impossible-figures task ( Mottron , Belleville , & Ménard , 1999 ) , and the maze-map task ( Caron , Mottron , Rainville , & Chouinard , 2004 ) .
Individuals with ASD also show enhanced performance relative to control subjects in visual search ( e.g. , O ’ Riordan , Plaisted , Driver , & Baron-Cohen , 2001 ) and feature discrimination ( O ’ Riordan & Plaisted , 2001 ; Plaisted , O ’ Riordan , & Baron-Cohen , 1998 ) .
In line with this evidence for superior performance of individuals with ASD in various domains of visual perception , neuroimaging studies have found that such individuals exhibit patterns of increased activation in posterior brain areas during visuo-perceptual tasks ( for a review , see Frith , 2003 ) .
Individuals with ASD also show atypical patterns of perfor- mance in tasks demanding rapid shifts of attention ( e.g. , Burack , 1994 ; Courchesne et al. , 1994 ) or perceptual categorization ( e.g. , Soulières , Mottron , Saumier , & Larochelle , 2007 ; Teunisse & de Gelder , 2001 ) .
However , in this case , they show inferior , rather than superior , performance relative to typically devel- oping individuals .
Because visual tasks require interaction between the incoming stimuli and the observer ’ s top-down cat- egorization goals ( i.e. , top-down processing ) , researchers have proposed that the atypical perceptual profile in autism is due to reduced top-down influences ( e.g. , Frith , 2003 ) .
However , this hypothesis needs further investigation .
Within this context , the study of perceptual categorization— the phenomenon underlying the transformation of lower-level perceptual representations into common categories—has been of major interest .
Studies using perceptual categorization to investigate interaction between levels of processing have shown that categorization goals exert a dynamic influence on early visual stages , that is , on spatial-frequency processing ( e.g. , Schyns & Oliva , 1999 ) .
Spatial-frequency information in faces is important for identifying and discriminating individuals ( Boutet , Collin , & Faubert , 2003 ) .
More precisely , high-spatial- frequency ( HSF ) information in a face represents fine-grained information , such as contours or shapes of face parts ( Costen , Parker , & Craw , 1996 ; Liu , Collin , Rainville , & Chaudhuri , 2000 ) , whereas low-spatial-frequency ( LSF ) information repre- sents configural information ( Boutet et al. , 2003 ; Costen et al. , 1996 ) .

1In these stimuli , a face depicting a particular expression at a coarse spatial scale was overlapped with an opposite-gender face depicting a different ex- pression at a fine spatial scale .
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 70 Volume 19—Number 1Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science strated that observers use different spatial-frequency bands to process the same class of objects in different categorization tasks .
Similarly , Deruelle and Fagot ( 2005 ) recently found a bias in visual perceptual selection that differed as a function of the categorization task .
Whereas emotion recognition relied on HSF information ( i.e. , local information ) , identity and gender rec- ognition were based on LSF information ( i.e. , global informa- tion ) .
The fact that the use of different visual indices depended on the categorization task suggests that the visual system adjusts to cognitive demands .
Taken together , these studies suggest that top-down processing dynamically influences the use of spatial-frequency informa- tion in typically developing individuals ( for a review , see Sow- den & Schyns , 2006 ) .
If this is the case , and if adults with ASD have reduced top-down influence , then categorization should have a smaller influence on perceptual processing in adults with ASD than in control subjects .
The following study was designed to test this hypothesis directly .
Adults with ASD were presented with hybrid faces created by superimposing two faces ( one high- pass filtered and one low-pass filtered ) that differed systemati- cally in gender and emotional expression .
They were asked to categorize the faces either by gender or by expression , and their performance was compared with that of normal control subjects .
METHOD Participants Two groups took part in this study .
The ASD group included 21 high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger ’ s syndrome ( 17 men and 4women ; ages 18–53 years , M5 28.1 , SD5 9.9 ) .
They all fulfilled criteria for autism according to at least one of the following : the revised fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Sta- tistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( American Psychiatric As- sociation , 2000 ) , the Gillberg scale ( Ehlers , Gillberg , & Wing , 1999 ) , and the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised ( Lord , Rutter , & Le Couteur , 1994 ) .
IQs were measured with the third edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( Wechsler , 1997 ) and ranged from 78 to 137 ( M5 106.3 , SD5 20.9 ) .
At the time of testing , no one in this group had known associated medical disorders or visual problems ( as assessed by a standard visual examination ) .
As their mean IQ score was within the normal range , the ASD participants were individually matched to a group of typically developing individuals on the basis of sex and chronological age .
The participants in this control group ( mean age5 27.3 , SD5 6.2 ) were all volunteers andwere free of psychiatric disorders at the time of testing .
Apparatus and Stimuli Participants were tested in a quiet , dimly lit experimental chamber .
They were seated in front of a 17-in .
monitor controlled by a Macintosh computer and were requested to place their chin on a chin rest that kept the viewing distance equal to 60 cm .
The stimulus set comprised 24 hybrid and 24 control faces that were constructed from black-and-white images of the faces of 12 women and 12 men .
In order to homogenize the stimuli , we included only men with short hair and women with tied-back hair .
All stimuli were created by superimposing two faces , one conveying fine-scale information ( i.e. , HSF ) and one conveying coarse-scale information ( i.e. , LSF ) .
Each hybrid face was composed of two faces ( one HSF and one LSF ) differing in both gender and emotional expression ( 6 smiling and 6 grimacing faces per gender ) .
For instance , if the high-pass face showed a grimacing man , the low-pass face showed a smiling woman ( see Fig .
1 ) .
By contrast , each control stimulus was created by su- perimposing two faces of the same gender ( a subset of 6 female and 6 male faces was used ) and expression ( 3 smiling and 3 grimacing faces for each gender ) .
For instance , both the high- and the low-pass face might show a grimacing man ( see Fig .
2 ) .
The size of the faces was normalized so that the two faces in each stimulus overlapped completely .
Luminance was also normal- ized .
The stimuli were presented on a gray background mea- suring 256 256 pixels ( corresponding to 61 of visual angle at the viewing distance ) .
The low-pass-filtered faces contained only spatial frequencies below 2 cycles/deg of visual angle .
The high-pass-filtered faces contained only spatial frequencies higher than 6 cycles/deg of visual angle .
The low- and high-pass cutoffs corresponded to spatial frequencies below and above 12 and 36 cycles per image , respectively .
A Gaussian filter was used for the cutoffs .
All stimuli were created using Scion Image 1.62 ( Scion Corporation , Bethesda , MD ) .
Preliminary control tests were conducted to ensure that the stimuli ( overlapped faces ) did not induce a Fig .

particular spatial-frequency bias .
In addition , previous studies using the same stimuli and procedure have shown reliable re- sults with typically developing children and adults ( e.g. , Deru- elle & Fagot , 2005 ) .
Procedure The experiment included two categorization tasks , one focusing on gender and the other focusing on emotional expression .
Each task comprised 36 trials , 24 with hybrid faces ( hybrid trials ) and 12 with control faces ( control trials ) .
In order to exclude stim- ulus-dependent bias , we used the same hybrid faces for the gender and expression tasks .
For the gender task , the control trials presented 6 female and 6 male faces , and for the expres- sion task , the control trials presented 6 smiling and 6 grimacing faces .
Each task was presented in a separate block .
Before each task , participants were informed that they were going to view a series of faces and that after the offset of each face , they were to judge as quickly as possible whether it represented a man or a woman ( gender task ) or whether it was smiling or grimacing ( expression task ) .
Four practice trials were then presented in order to ensure that participants understood these instructions .
Each trial began with a fixation point ( red square , 11 11 ) presented for 500 ms , followed by a target stimulus displayed for 100 ms2 in the center of the screen .
Participants responded by pressing the ‘ ‘ A ’ ’ or ‘ ‘ P ’ ’ key of an AZERTY keyboard ; colored patches made these keys distinctive .
Both the order of the tasks ( gender and expression ) and the order of trials were counter- balanced across subjects .
After each trial , participants were asked whether they had seen one or two faces ( see Schyns & Oliva , 1999 , Experiment 1 methods ) .
Trials on which subjects reported that they had seen two faces were discarded .
Note , however , that this resulted in the loss of less than 1 % of trials .
RESULTS Both the number of correct responses ( control trials ) and the number of high-pass choices ( hybrid trials3 ) were analyzed in two-way analyses of variance ( ANOVAs ) with group ( ASD vs. control ) as a between-subjects factor and task ( gender vs. emotion ) as a within-subjects factor .
Results for the number of correct responses revealed that only the main effect of task was significant , F ( 1 , 40 ) 5 7.09 , p < .01 , with participants being more accurate on the gender task ( M5 12.0 , SD 5 0.18 ) than on the emotion task ( M 5 11.2 , SD 5 0.19 ) .
Moreover , neither the main effect of group , F ( 1 , 40 ) 5 2.29 , p > .13 , nor the GroupTask interaction , F ( 1 , 40 ) 5 1.77 , p > .19 , was significant .
This suggests that the two groups per- formed similarly on both the emotion task ( ASD : M 5 11.0 , SD5 0.27 ; control : M5 11.3 , SD5 0.27 ) and the gender task ( ASD : M 5 11.2 , SD 5 0.26 ; control : M 5 11.9 , SD 5 0.26 ) .
Analysis of the number of high-pass choices ( see Fig .
3 , which also shows the number of low-pass choices ) yielded a significant effect of group , F ( 1 , 40 ) 5 7.9 , p < .01 ; control subjects made moreHSF choices ( M5 10.3 , SD5 0.82 ) thanASD participants did ( M5 7.02 , SD5 0.81 ) .
The main effect of task , F ( 1 , 40 ) 5 69.5 , p < .001 , was also significant , with the number of high- pass choices being greater in the emotion task ( M5 10.8 , SD5 0.66 ) than in the gender task ( M 5 6.5 , SD 5 0.60 ) .
Most important , the Group Task interaction was significant , F ( 1 , 40 ) 511.3 , p < .001 .
Post hoc comparisons using Tukey ’ s honestly significant difference tests revealed that on the gender task , the groups did not differ in the number of high-pass choices ( ASD : M 5 5.71 , SD 5 0.85 ; control : M 5 7.19 , SD 5 0.85 ; p > .80 ) , whereas on the emotion task , the control group showed a greater high-pass bias ( M 5 13.3 , SD 5 0.93 ) than the ASD group ( M 5 8.3 , SD 5 0.94 ; p 5 .02 ) .
We also analyzed the number of high-pass choices using chi- square tests .
Results confirmed a shift in spatial-frequency preference from the gender to the emotion task in the control group .
Whereas a low-pass bias prevailed on the gender task for this group , w2 ( 1 , N5 21 ) 5 70 , p < .001 , a significant high-pass bias was found on the emotion task , w2 ( 1 , N5 21 ) 5 36 , p < .01 .
By contrast , no shift in spatial-frequency preference was found in the ASD group .
Instead , this group showed a low-pass bias on Fig .

2This duration was chosen on the basis of previous reports that subjects perceive one stimulus at this presentation duration and are not aware that two faces have been presented simultaneously ( Deruelle & Fagot , 2005 ) .
3Responses on hybrid trials were used to infer preferential bias for one range of spatial frequency .
The number of high-pass choices was complementary to the number of low-pass choices .
For the sake of statistical validity , only one frequency range was included in the analyses .

In order to determine the influence of age on performance patterns ( number of high-pass choices ) , we conducted a corre- lation analysis for each group separately , using Pearson r tests .
Results revealed that age did not exert a significant influence on performance of either the ASD group ( gender task : r 5 .22 , p > .34 ; emotion task : r 5 .37 , p > .10 ) or the control group ( gender task : r5.03 , p > .89 ; emotion task : r5 .22 , p > .31 ) .
Similar analysis of the IQ scores showed that in the ASD group , performance level ( HSF choices ) was not correlated to overall intellectual functioning on either the gender task ( r 5 .16 , p > .49 ) or the emotion task ( r 5 .02 , p > .94 ) .
DISCUSSION In this study , we investigated whether categorization has less influence on perceptual processing in individuals with ASD ( compared with control subjects ) as a result of reduced top-down influences .
Participants were asked to categorize the gender and the emotional expression of hybrid faces resulting from super- imposing one HSF and one LSF face .
Typically developing adults were found to use different strategies as a function of the task .
When they focused on gender , they relied on LSF informa- tion , but when they focused on emotional expression , they relied instead on HSF information ( see Fig .
3 ) .
These findings are in agreement with the idea that the visual system is flexible even at an early stage of visual processing ( for a review , see Sowden & Schyns , 2006 ) .
Moreover , they are consistent with findings of previous studies showing that normal control subjects rely on LSF information to perform gender-categorization tasks , but rely instead on HSF information for emotion categorization ( Deruelle & Fagot , 2005 ; Schyns & Oliva , 1999 ; see also Vuillemier , Armony , Driver , & Dolan , 2003 ) .
There is consistent evidence that this functional separability occurs as early as the age of 5 to 6 years ( e.g. , Deruelle & Fagot , 2005 ; De Sonneville et al. , 2002 ) .
Most important , this shift in spatial-frequency bias as a function of task is thought to result from top-down influences ( i.e. , to be dependent on the task goals ) .
In particular , several studies have shown that observers can select different spatial- frequency bands to process the same object class depending on the categorization task—a top-down effect ( e.g. , Schyns , Bonnar , & Gosselin , 2002 ; Schyns & Oliva , 1999 ; see also Sowden & Schyns , 2006 , for a review ) .
Strikingly , adults with ASD did not show such a shift in pro- cessing style .
Instead , they relied on LSF in both the gender and Fig .

the emotion tasks ( see Fig .
3 ) .
But what can explain this per- severance on LSF information ( regardless of the categorization task ) in individuals with ASD ?
According to Sowden and Schyns ( 2006 ) , ‘ ‘ [ spatial frequency ] analysis is a product of both the stimulus properties and the visual categorization and recognition goals of the observer ’ ’ ( p. 538 ) .
It is important to note that the same hybrid stimuli ( see Fig .
1 ) were used in the gender and the emotion tasks .
Thus , there is no reason to believe that stimulus properties per se induced participants to select different spatial-frequency channels in different tasks .
Alternatively , one may argue that individuals with ASD did not shift from LSF to HSF information in the emotion task simply because they can not use HSF indices to process visual information .
In this case , it might be that indi- viduals with ASD have atypical spatial-frequency thresholds and are thus more sensitive to the higher contrast in LSF in- formation than to the lower contrast in HSF information .
How- ever , recent studies have shown that high-functioning adults with ASD ( closely matched in age and IQ to our ASD partici- pants ) do not differ from control subjects in their contrast sen- sitivity for LSF and HSF information ( de Jonge et al. , 2007 ) and perform within the normal boundaries in detecting low- and high-frequency gratings ( Behrmann , Avidan , et al. , 2006 ) .
In addition , previous studies using spatial-frequency-filtered faces have demonstrated that children with ASD do have the ability to process HSF information , as they perceive HSF components more accurately than control subjects do ( Deruelle , Rondan , Gepner , & Tardif , 2004 ) and show a bias towardHSF information in facial-identity processing ( Deruelle , Rondan , Salle-Col- lemiche , Rosset , & Da Fonseca , in press ) .
Because LSF processing is thought to convey the global as- pects of faces ( Boutet et al. , 2003 ; Costen et al. , 1996 ; Goffaux & Rossion , 2006 ) , one may argue instead that our ASD partici- pants processed stimuli in both tasks ( gender and emotion ) on the basis of LSF information because of an underlying bias to- ward global information .
Yet , although there is consistent evi- dence for a perceptual bias in autism , it is a systematic bias toward local details or featural ( HSF ) information , rather than global ( LSF ) information ( e.g. , for a review , see Behrmann , Thomas , & Humphreys , 2006 ; see also Rondan & Deruelle , 2007 ) .
Taken together , previous findings render unlikely the possibility that low-level impairments , such as atypical fre- quency thresholds , account for the absence of shifting from LSF to HSF processing found in the ASD group .
Alternatively , higher-level deficits might underlie the differ- ences in emotion ( but not gender ) processing style between the ASD and control groups .
There is little doubt that individuals with ASD are impaired in emotion processing ( e.g. , Adolphs , Sears , & Piven , 2001 ) and , in particular , in facial emotion perception ( e.g. , Hobson , Ouston , & Lee , 1988 ) .
Therefore , one might expect participants with ASD to have greater difficulties than control participants in the emotion task we used .
Inter- estingly , this was not the case in the present study .
Although individuals with ASD used different perceptual strategies to perform this task ( i.e. , they made fewer high-pass choices than control subjects did ) , their overall performance level ( number of correct responses ) was similar to that found for control subjects .
This is evidence that despite relying on atypical visual indices to categorize emotions , individuals with ASD can achieve normal levels of performance .
Thus , there seems to be no reason to in- terpret our findings as resulting from emotion-processing defi- cits in ASD .
Note also that perceptual difficulties in autism have been shown to affect not only the perception of emotion in faces ( e.g. , Hobson et al. , 1988 ) , but sometimes also the perception of gender in faces ( Hobson , 1987 ; see also Njiokiktjien et al. , 2001 ) .
We propose that deficits in top-downmodulation in processing of visual stimuli account for the absence of the shift in pro- cessing style in the ASD group .
In line with this idea , recent neuroimaging studies have found a lack of attentional modula- tion in face-selective regions among individuals with ASD , possibly because of ‘ ‘ a failure of attention to modulate connec- tivity between extrastriate areas and primary visual cortex ’ ’ ( Bird , Catmur , Silani , Frith , & Frith , 2006 , p. 1620 ) .
Also , recent studies using categorical perception paradigms have demon- strated that high-functioning individuals with autism do not show the same facilitation of discrimination near the category boundary that normal control subjects do , perhaps because of diminished top-down influence ( Soulières et al. , 2007 ) .
Taken together , these findings suggest that higher-level processes ( e.g. , categorization goals ) do not influence low-level processing to the same extent in individuals with ASD as in control subjects .
The findings of the present study go further to validate this hypoth- esis by suggesting that reduced top-down influence in autism also affects very early stages of visual processing .
It seems that individuals with ASD differ from control subjects in the manner in which the cognitive demands of a task influence selection of spatial-frequency channels ( and this difference could not be accounted for by task difficulty because overall performance levels did not distinguish the two groups ) .
At the cognitive level , one could argue that reduced top-down processing in autism may be related to deficits in cognitive flexibility .
Indeed , numerous studies have demonstrated that executive dysfunction ( including dysfunctions in planning , impulse control , and mental flexibility ) may underlie many of the cognitive , as well as behavioral , problems found in indi- viduals with ASD ( for a review , see Hill , 2004 ) .
In particular , studies have found that because of poor mental flexibility , in- dividuals with ASD experience difficulties in shifting to a different thought or action as a situation changes ( e.g. , Ozonoff & McEvoy , 1994 ; Shu , Lung , Tien , & Chen , 2001 ) .
Such a deficit may also account for some characteristic symptoms of ASD .
For instance , autistic individuals ’ difficulties in inhibiting prepotent responses ( i.e. , stereotyped movements , compulsions ) , orienting to novel events in the environment ( i.e. , restricted interests , insistence on sameness ) , and generating flexible patterns of 74 Volume 19—Number 1 Face Categorization in Autism behavior ( i.e. , repetitive behaviors , rituals ) may all be related to deficits in cognitive flexibility due to reduced top-down pro- cessing .
In conclusion , this study shows that adults with ASD are able to categorize spatial-frequency-degraded faces in terms of both gender and emotion .
However , they rely on different strategies than control subjects do .
Indeed , they do not switch indices as a function of the task , which suggests that categorization does not influence their perceptual processing .
Thus , our results support the idea that individuals with ASD exhibit reduced flexibility even at early visual stages , possibly because of insufficient top- down processing .
