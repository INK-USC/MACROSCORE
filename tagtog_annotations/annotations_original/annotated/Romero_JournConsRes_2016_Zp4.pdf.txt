Healthy-Left , Unhealthy-Right : Can Displaying Healthy Items to the Left ( versus Right ) of Unhealthy Items Nudge Healthier Choices ?
MARISABEL ROMERO DIPAYAN BISWAS Would laterally displaying a healthy item to the left versus right of an unhealthy item influence choice and consumption ?
The results of seven studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items enhances prefer- ence for the healthy options .
In addition , consumption volume of a healthy item ( vis- à-vis an unhealthy item ) is higher when it is placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the un- healthy item .
We propose that a “ healthy-left , unhealthy-right ” ( vs. healthy-right , un- healthy-left ) lateral display pattern is congruent with consumers ’ mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness , which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control , thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choos- ing healthy options .
While prior studies have examined the role of several factors in influencing choices between healthy and unhealthy options , the present research is the first to demonstrate the effects of lateral display positions of healthy/unhealthy options on choice and healthful consumption .
The findings of our research have im- portant implications for designing retail food displays and restaurant menus as well as for conducting research studies involving healthy and unhealthy food displays .
Keywords : healthy and unhealthy choices , lateral visual display position , food and beverage consumption , sensory marketing Would the lateral display patterns of food items influ-ence choice ?
More specifically , would displaying healthy item ( s ) on the left and unhealthy item ( s ) on the right lead to different choice outcomes than displaying the items in the opposite pattern ?
The results of our experiments show that not only does the lateral display pattern of healthy and unhealthy items influence choice , it also has consequential effects on consumption volume .
The findings of our re- search have important conceptual and practical implications , especially in light of growing worldwide concerns related to obesity and a heightened focus on encouraging healthful consumption .
Also , given that marketers have considerable flexibility in terms of how they display food items in retail outlets and restaurant menus , they can use the findings of this research to design optimal display patterns that are aligned with their objectives in terms of consumer choices .
Building on research in the domain of left-to-right or- ganization of stimuli ( Bueti and Walsh 2009 ; Casasanto 2009 ; Lourenco and Longo 2010 ) , we propose and find that the lateral position of healthy/unhealthy foods influences choices .
Specifically , we demonstrate that when a healthy and an unhealthy item are organized laterally , there is rela- tively greater preference for the healthy option when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option .

43 2016 DOI : 10.1093/jcr/ucw008 103 tendency is to mentally organize healthy items to the left of unhealthy items , which in turn influences self-control and food choices .
We base these propositions on research related to spatial representation of magnitude , in which individuals tend to mentally map increases in magnitude from left to right ( Chae and Hoegg 2013 ; Kadosh et al .
2008 ) .
To elaborate , research shows that individuals hold a generalized system of magnitude representation in which dimensions such as time duration , number magnitude , and spatial extent are mentally organized in increasing magni- tude from left to right ( Bueti and Walsh 2009 ; Lourenco and Longo 2010 ; Walsh 2003 ) .
In the context of foods , a healthy item is perceived to be less heavy ( Deng and Kahn 2009 ) , lower in calories ( Chandon and Wansink 2007 ) , less filling ( Oakes 2006 ) , and even less tasty ( Raghunathan , Naylor , and Hoyer 2006 ) than an unhealthy item .
Since stimuli of lower magnitude tend to be mentally organized on the left and those of higher magnitude tend to be men- tally represented on the right ( e.g. , Hubbard et al .
2005 ) , we propose that consumers naturally represent healthy items to the left of unhealthy items .
Additional evidence in favor of this mental representation model is provided by the body-specificity theory ( Casasanto and Chrysikou 2011 ) that proposes individuals link desirable products to their dominant side and undesirable products to their nondomi- nant side ( Brookshire and Casasanto 2012 ) .
Incidentally , about 90 % of the world population is right-handed ( Eelen , Dewitte , and Warlop 2013 ) .
Since consumers often deem unhealthy ( vs. healthy ) foods as inducing more favorable affect ( Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999 ) as well as being more de- sirable and tempting ( Hofmann et al .
2010 ) , most individ- uals should mentally associate unhealthy foods with the right lateral field .
Studies across different research streams have shown that when mental representations are congruent ( vs. incon- gruent ) with display patterns , ease of processing is higher ( Chae and Hoegg 2013 ; Lee and Aaker 2004 ) .
Hence food displays that are congruent ( vs. incongruent ) with con- sumers ’ mental representation should facilitate greater ease of processing .
Moreover , ease of processing should enhance self-control and facilitate resistance to temptation , which in turn should lead to a higher likelihood of choosing healthier options ( Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999 ) .
Accordingly , we hy- pothesize that choice likelihood of the healthier option will be higher when the healthy items are displayed laterally to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items .
We examine this phe- nomenon with the help of seven studies .
<SD> STUDY 1A </SD> : DISPLAY POSITIONS OF HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY ITEMS Design , Participants , and Procedure <SD> Study 1a </SD> was a between-subjects experiment with two manipulated conditions ( healthy items displayed to the left vs. right of unhealthy items ) .
A restaurant menu was used ; the menu featured a picture of a healthy item ( chicken salad ) and of an unhealthy item ( bacon cheeseburger ) .
The menu also had a listing of four healthy items and four un- healthy items .
( The appendix and online appendix A pro- vide menu details . )
To ensure ecological validity , the food items presented on the menu and the overall menu layout were similar to those used by an actual restaurant .
First , a pretest ( n¼ 22 ; average age¼ 37 years , 50 % female ) verified the healthiness/unhealthiness of the items chosen .
Participants rated the perceived healthfulness of the eight menu items ( appendix ) on a 7-point scale ( 1 ¼ not at all healthy , 7¼ very healthy ) .
The four salad entrees were perceived as healthier ( M¼ 4.59 ) than the four burger entrees ( M¼ 2.86 ; t ( 21 ) ¼ 4.91 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
Consistent with this pretest finding , we coded participants ’ choice for any of the four salads as healthy and choices for the four bur- gers were coded as unhealthy .
In the main study , <SS> 48 </SS> respondents recruited through an online ( Mechanical Turk [ MTurk ] ) panel ( average age¼ 35 years ; 50 % female , 90 % right-handed ) partici- pated in exchange for monetary compensation .
They were evenly and <SP> randomly assigned </SP> to either the “ healthy-left , unhealthy-right ” or the “ healthy-right , unhealthy-left ” con- dition .
Participants viewed a menu and were told that the menu was from a new restaurant and that all portions and prices across the different options were equivalent .
They then selected one menu item they would like to eat if they were visiting this restaurant .
Finally , they provided general demographic information .
Results and Discussion Consistent with our hypothesis , there was greater prefer- ence for the healthy items when they were displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy items on the menu ( 58.33 % vs. 29.16 % ; v2¼ 4.15 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) .
Next , <SD> study 1b </SD> replicated these effects using a simpler choice set—one healthy item and one unhealthy item .
Also , <SD> study 1a </SD> used online ( MTurk ) participants ; <SD> study 1b </SD> was conducted in a con- trolled lab setting .
<SD> STUDY 1B </SD> : LATERAL DISPLAY OF A HEALTHY AND AN UNHEALTHY ITEM <SD> Study 1b </SD> replicated the findings of <SD> study 1a </SD> by asking participants to choose an item from a set of two food op- tions : one healthy and one unhealthy .
A total of <SS> 93 </SS> students ( average age 22 years , 57 % female , 87 % right-handed ) from a major US university participated in this study in ex- change for course credit .
Broccoli salad was used as the healthy item ; grilled cheese sandwich was the unhealthy item ( e.g. , Chernev 2011 ) .
Participants first arrived at a waiting area and were then brought into a computer lab by a research assistant .
Participants had to click through the 104 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH introduction page to go to the page ( on the computer screen ) that displayed the food items .
In one condition , the broccoli salad was displayed on the left and the grilled cheese sandwich was displayed on the right .
In the other condition , this pattern was reversed ( details in online ap- pendix B ) .
The computer software <SP> randomly assigned </SP> each participant to an experimental condition .
After viewing the images of the food items , participants indicated their pref- erence for one of the items .
Consistent with our hypothesis and the findings of <SD> study 1a </SD> , preference for the healthy item ( broccoli salad ) was relatively higher when it was on the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item ( 41.30 % vs. 19.14 % ; v2¼ 5.42 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) .
This replicates the finding of <SD> study 1a </SD> using a dis- play pattern that featured only two food items , one healthy and one unhealthy .
Next , <SD> studies 2a and 2b </SD> provide evi- dence of the left-to-right mental organization of healthy and unhealthy foods .
<SD> STUDIES 2A AND 2B </SD> : ORGANIZING ITEMS IN DIFFERENT LATERAL FIELDS Procedure <SD> Study 2a </SD> tested whether consumers naturally organize healthy and unhealthy concepts in different lateral fields .
We employed a conceptual classification task , similar to a procedure used in prior studies ( e.g. , Casasanto 2009 ) .
<SS> Seventy-eight </SS> participants recruited from an online ( MTurk ) panel ( average age 31 years , 30 % female , 90 % right-handed ) performed a task in which they were asked to place word pairs on the left versus right lateral field .
There were two empty boxes on a computer screen ( one on the left side and one on the right side of the screen ) .
For each trial , participants indicated which one of the two words they would place in the left box .
The focal word pairs were “ eating healthy–indulging , ” “ strawberries– cheesecake , ” “ nutrition–pleasure , ” “ grilled chicken–fried chicken , ” and “ healthy foods–unhealthy foods. ” The order of presentation of the words in the pairs was counterbal- anced .
In terms of counterbalancing , there were order ef- fects for the “ nutrition–pleasure ” pairing and a marginally significant effect for the “ eating healthy–indulging ” pair- ing ; however , we did not find order effects ( <PV> p > .10 </PV> ) for any of the other relevant word pairs .
To avoid hypothesis guessing , filler trials were included : “ email–call , ” “ fruit salad–apples , ” “ bat–net , ” and “ work–enjoyment. ” Results and Discussion Overall , participants consistently associated the healthy ( vs. unhealthy ) concept with the left lateral field .
Specifically , for the “ eating healthy–indulging ” word pair , 64.10 % of participants indicated that eating healthy belonged on the left ( v2¼ 6.20 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) ; for the “ nutrition– pleasure ” word pair , 62.82 % of participants placed “ nutri- tion ” on the left ( v2¼ 5.13 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) , and for the “ healthy foods–unhealthy foods ” word pair , 71.79 % of participants placed “ healthy foods ” on the left ( v2¼ 14.82 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
Additionally , for the specific food pairings , we found the same trend , whereby 65.38 % of respondents placed straw- berries ( vs. cheesecake ) on the left ( v2¼ 7.38 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) , and 64.10 % placed grilled chicken ( vs. fried chicken ) on the left ( v2¼ 6.20 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) .
Handedness did not influence place- ment decisions ( <PV> p > .10 </PV> ) .
The results of this study provide evidence for our the- oretical claim that a healthy option is mentally represented to be on the left of an unhealthy option .
Also , this study eliminates the possibility of items being organized alpha- betically .
For example , the word pairing “ strawberries– cheesecake ” reveals the same pattern of results even though the healthy ( unhealthy ) item begins with the letter “ s ” ( “ c ” ) .
The same holds for the “ grilled chicken ” and “ fried chicken ” pair .
In a follow-up study ( 2b ) , we replicated our findings in the context of a menu design task .
<SS> Forty-four </SS> respon- dents from an online ( MTurk ) panel ( average age 29 years , 34 % female , 91 % right-handed ) were asked to place two food items , a grilled chicken sandwich ( healthy item ) and a fried chicken sandwich ( unhealthy item ) , on different sides of a blank menu .
The presentation of the items was coun- terbalanced to avoid order effects .
As theorized , a greater proportion of participants placed the healthy ( unhealthy ) item on the left ( right ) side of the menu compared to plac- ing the healthy ( unhealthy ) item on the right ( left ) side ( 70.45 % vs. 29.55 % ; v2¼ 7.36 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
No order effects were found for the counterbalanced presentation of the items ( <PV> p > .10 </PV> ) .
These results provide additional support for the theoretical claim related to mental representation of healthy items being to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items .
Next , <SD> study 3 </SD> rules out an alternative explanation for the effects observed in <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> .
<SD> STUDY 3 </SD> : RULING OUT LEFT-SIDE BIAS EFFECTS The results of <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> show that preference for the healthy item is higher when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item .
A corollary to that finding is that preference for the unhealthy item is also higher when it is displayed on the left ( vs. right ) .
We proposed a mental representation explanation and found empirical evi- dence of that claim in <SD> studies 2a and 2b </SD> .
Nevertheless , a potential alternative explanation for the findings of <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> is a left-side bias , whereby there is greater over- all preference for the item displayed on the left , irrespec- tive of whether it is healthy or unhealthy .
Hence in <SD> study 3 </SD> , we examined this alternative explanation .
Specifically , while in <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> we displayed healthy/unhealthy ROMERO AND BISWAS 105 items on the left and on the right , in <SD> study 3 </SD> we also in- cluded a control condition related to displaying the healthy and unhealthy items in a neutral location ( i.e. , the center ) in order to demonstrate how preference for the healthy and unhealthy items changes in comparison to this baseline ( control ) condition .
Design , Participants , and Procedure <SD> Study 3 </SD> was a between-subjects experiment with three manipulated conditions ( healthy left–unhealthy right vs. healthy right–unhealthy left vs. healthy and unhealthy both in center ) .
The last condition ( i.e. , both items in center ) was counterbalanced by having the healthy item on the top and the unhealthy item on the bottom or having this in the reverse pattern .
There were no effects of top versus bottom positions on choice ( v2¼ .30 , p¼ .58 ) .
Online appendix C presents the images of the different experimental condi- tions .
Strawberries and chocolate cake slice ( both weighing 300 g ) were the healthy and unhealthy options , respec- tively .
A total of <SS> 109 </SS> students ( average age 24 years , 59 % female , 90 % right-handed ) from a major US university par- ticipated in exchange for course credit .
Participants first ar- rived at a waiting area and were subsequently brought into a lab by a research assistant .
The food items were dis- played on a screen in the lab after participants sat in the center of the room .
After seeing the food image , partici- pants indicated their preference on a survey .
One partici- pant ( from the “ healthy right–unhealthy left ” condition ) did not look at the displayed image ; however , keeping or removing this participant did not alter the pattern of results .
Results and Discussion Consistent with the findings observed in <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> , preference for the healthy option was higher when it was displayed on the left ( vs. right ) ( 70.0 % vs. 47.50 % ; v2¼ 3.54 , p¼ .06 ) .
Removing the participant who did not look at the image displayed on the screen made the effect stronger ( v2¼ 3.92 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) .
More interestingly , dis- playing the healthy item on the left ( vs. control condition of center ) led to higher preference for the healthy item ( 70.0 % vs. 46.15 % ; v2¼ 3.92 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) , while displaying the unhealthy item on the left ( vs. control condition ) led to a similar preference for the unhealthy item ( 52.50 % vs. 53.85 % ; v2¼ .01 , p¼ .91 ) .
These findings rule out the effects of <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> being attributed to a left-side bias .
Specifically , if there were a left-side bias , then preference for the unhealthy item also would have been higher when it was displayed on the left versus at the center .
Instead , we find that , com- pared to a baseline ( i.e. , center ) condition , only displaying the healthy item on the left side increases preference ; im- portantly , we see no such effects for the unhealthy item .
Next , <SD> study 4 </SD> rules out another potential alternative explanation .
<SD> STUDY 4 </SD> : RULING OUT POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF GAZE STARTING POINT Research indicates that when exposed to visual stimuli , people from Western societies tend to process the informa- tion starting from the left visual field ( Chae and Hoegg 2013 ; Chokron and De Agostini 2000 ; Shaki , Fischer , and Petrusic 2009 ) .
In other words , consumers tend to first no- tice items displayed on their left visual field before notic- ing items on their right visual field .
Hence the findings observed in <SD> studies 1a and 1b </SD> could be attributed to pri- macy effects ( Biswas , Grewal , and Roggeveen 2010 ; Biswas et al .
2014 ) whereby consumers notice the healthy item first , leading to higher preference for the healthy item .
To rule out primacy effects as an alternative explanation , in <SD> study 4 </SD> , we manipulated gaze starting point position ( left vs. right ) to test whether it alters the pattern of findings .
Method <SD> Study 4 </SD> was a 2 ( healthy item displayed to the left vs. right of the unhealthy item ) 2 ( gaze starting point : left vs. right ) between-subjects experiment .
A total of <SS> 169 </SS> stu- dents ( average age 23 years , 48 % female , 91 % right- handed ) from a major US university participated in ex- change for course credit .
We selected raisins as the healthy option and chocolate chip cookies as the unhealthy option ( e.g. , Laran 2010 ) .
As in <SD> studies 1 and 3 </SD> , we manipulated the first factor by presenting the healthy item to the left versus right of the unhealthy item .
We also manipulated the location of the gaze starting point by asking partici- pants to focus on a fixation cross ( adapted from Mormann et al .
2012 ) , which was presented on the left versus right side of the screen .
Participants first arrived at a waiting area .
They were then brought into a lab and instructed to take a seat in the center of the room .
The images of the food items were projected on a screen located in the front of the lab .
Before showing the two food items , participants were asked to fo- cus on a fixation image ( i.e. , a cross ) placed on either the left or right side of the screen .
With participants fixating on the cross , the slide changed and transitioned into an im- age of two food options laterally displayed ( with the healthy and unhealthy items displayed in a left-right vs. right-left pattern ) .
After this , participants indicated their food choice on a survey .
Results and Discussion The results of a 2 2 logistic regression revealed a sig- nificant main effect of display position on choice ( Wald 106 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH v2¼ 7.78 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
The interaction effect and the main ef- fect of gaze starting point were nonsignificant ( <PV> p ’ s > .95 </PV> ) , which rules out gaze starting point as an alternative expla- nation for the effects of lateral display positions on choice .
Contrast tests showed that overall , there was a main effect of display position , whereby consistent with the find- ings of our earlier studies , preference for the healthy option was higher when it was displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option ( 26.93 % vs. 9.89 % ; v2¼ 8.34 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
For the “ left gaze starting ” condition , preference for the healthy option was higher when it was displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option ( 26.83 % vs. 9.80 % ; v2¼ 4.59 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) , and the pattern of results re- mained the same for the “ right gaze starting ” condition ( 27.03 % vs. 10.0 % ; v2¼ 3.75 , p¼ .05 ) .
The results of <SD> study 4 </SD> demonstrate higher preference for the healthy option when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option , and this pattern persists irre- spective of the initial fixation position .
Hence these find- ings rule out primacy effects , of noticing items on the left first , as a potential alternative explanation for the effects observed in our studies .
Next , <SD> study 5 </SD> demonstrates a downstream behavioral outcome of lateral display positions .
<SD> STUDY 5 </SD> : EFFECTS OF DISPLAY POSITION ON CONSUMPTION VOLUME In our previous studies , participants indicated their pref- erence for a single item that was either healthy or un- healthy .
However , in many real-world contexts , consumers might be able to undertake consumption involving a com- bination of both healthy and unhealthy items ( Chandon and Wansink 2007 ) .
Moreover , in our earlier studies , partici- pants indicated preferences , but there were no serious con- sequences of their choices in terms of amount of consumption .
Hence <SD> study 5 </SD> incorporates an important consequential element in the choice process , whereby par- ticipants were allowed to consume healthy and unhealthy items in whatever quantities they wanted .
The results of our studies show that displaying healthy items to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items nudges healthful choices .
Along similar lines , we expect consump- tion volume of the healthy item ( vis-à-vis the unhealthy item ) will be higher when it is placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item .
Design , Participants , and Procedure <SD> Study 5 </SD> was a mixed-design experiment where the dis- play positions of the beverages were manipulated across two between-subjects conditions ( healthy beverage dis- played to the left vs. right of the unhealthy beverage ) ; con- sumption of healthy and unhealthy drinks was measured within subjects .
<SS> Sixty </SS> students ( average age 24 years , 50 % female ) from a major US university participated in this study .
The healthy beverage was a low-calorie orange juice with high vitamin content ; the unhealthy beverage was a high-calorie synthetic orange soda with no vitamin content .
The beverages had comparable color and texture .
A pretest ( n¼ 30 ) confirmed ( on a 1 to 7 scale ) that the low-calorie orange juice was perceived as healthier than the high-calo- rie orange soda ( Mjuice¼ 5.20 vs. Msoda¼ 1.50 , t ( 29 ) ¼ 14.54 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
For the main study , participants arrived at a waiting area .
They were then brought into a lab and asked to sit at specific desks .
Before bringing in the participants to the lab , a research assistant placed a healthy beverage to the left ( vs. right ) of an unhealthy beverage based on where the participants would be seated .
The serving size for the beverages was 3.5 oz .
each .
First , participants were provided with information about the calorie and nutrition contents of each respective beverage and were asked to take a look at each beverage .
They were then told that they could drink as much or as lit- tle of each beverage as they wanted .
The key dependent variable , consumption volume , was measured by weighing the cups before and after consumption ( i.e. , before partici- pants arrived and after they left the lab ) .
Toward the end of the survey , participants were also asked to indicate how they were feeling at that moment , on six different items based on 1 to 7 scales ( such as bad–good , sad–happy , calm–excited , tired–energetic ) .
These items did not differ in their ratings across the two manipulated conditions ( all <PV> p ’ s > .25 </PV> ) and hence are not discussed any further .
Results and Discussion The results of a 2 ( lateral display pattern of healthy/un- healthy options ) 2 ( consumption of healthy and unhealthy beverages ) mixed <TN> analysis of variance </TN> revealed a margin- ally significant interaction effect ( F ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ 3.45 , <PV> p < .07 </PV> ) .
Follow-up tests showed that participants consumed a higher volume of the healthy beverage when it was placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy beverage ( Mleft¼ 1.79 oz .
vs. Mright¼ 1.14 oz .
; F ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ 4.86 , <PV> p < .05 </PV> ) .
Interestingly , the lateral position of the unhealthy item did not influence its consumption volume ( Means¼ 1.27 oz .
vs. 1.07 oz .
; F ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ .43 , p¼ .52 ) .
Additionally , we find that participants had a higher in- take of the healthy ( vs. unhealthy ) beverage only when the healthy beverage was on the left ( Means¼ 1.79 vs. 1.27 ; F ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ 10.76 , <PV> p < .01 </PV> ) .
However , when the healthy bev- erage was on the right , participants consumed an equal amount of the healthy and unhealthy beverages ( Means¼ 1.14 vs. 1.07 ; F ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ .12 , p¼ .74 ) .
Online appendix D graphically presents the key results of this study .
<SD> Study 5 </SD> demonstrates an important behavioral out- come of lateral positions of healthy and unhealthy items in ROMERO AND BISWAS 107 the form of overall consumption volume .
Specifically , when having the option to consume both healthy and un- healthy beverages , participants had a higher intake of the healthy beverage ( vis-à-vis the unhealthy beverage ) when it was displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy bev- erage .
At a broader level , while product choice is an impor- tant managerially relevant variable , overall consumption volume has strong practical implications for health and well-being .
In that regard , <SD> study 5 </SD> , which examines how the lateral positions of a healthy and an unhealthy item might influence consumption volume of each item , has strong substantive implications .
GENERAL DISCUSSION Summary and Conclusions We examined the effects of lateral positions of healthy and unhealthy food items on choice and consumption vol- ume across a robust set of food items .
The results of our seven studies demonstrate that in a scenario involving healthy and unhealthy food items placed at different lateral positions , consumers are more likely to choose the healthy item when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the un- healthy food item .
We also found that when given the op- tion to consume both healthy and unhealthy items placed at different lateral positions , consumption volume of the healthy item ( vis-à-vis the unhealthy item ) is higher when it is placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item .
We base our propositions on research related to spatial representation of magnitude in which individuals tend to mentally map increases in magnitude from left to right ( Kadosh et al .
2008 ) .
Thus , in the context of food , un- healthy items with relatively higher affective values ( Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999 ) , higher perceived taste ( Raghunathan et al .
2006 ) , higher desirability , and greater temptation as- sociations ( Hofmann et al .
2010 ) are likely to be organized to the right of healthy items .
Furthermore , we conceptual- ize that when food items are laterally displayed in a man- ner congruent ( vs. incongruent ) with consumers ’ natural mental representation , it enhances the likelihood of choos- ing healthier options .
To elaborate , we propose that consumers experience greater self-control when healthy/unhealthy items are dis- played in a manner congruent with their natural mental rep- resentation .
That is , as demonstrated by <SD> studies 2a and 2b </SD> , consumers tend to mentally represent healthy items to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items .
Hence a display pattern that is congruent with this mental representation should fa- cilitate ease of information processing , which in turn should enhance self-control and resistance to temptation ( e.g. , Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999 ) , thereby leading to a rela- tively higher likelihood of choosing healthy options .
Online appendices E and F report the results of two experi- ments that provide empirical evidence regarding the role of self-control as a mediator for the effects of healthy/un- healthy food display positions on choice .
Another related ( but conceptually different ) explana- tion for our observed effects is that encountering a display pattern that is congruent ( vs. incongruent ) with the natural mental representation increases consumers ’ belief that they are capable of exerting self-control .
This is in line with re- cent research linking processing fluency to self-efficacy judgments ( White , MacDonnell , and Dahl 2011 ) .
Clearly , additional research is needed to examine these underlying processes in greater depth .
Although there can be several possible explanations for our findings , based on the results of <SD> study 3 </SD> , resource depletion is not a viable alternative explanation for the ob- served effects .
Specifically , a resource depletion model would imply that compared to the baseline condition , choice likelihood for the healthy option should be lower for the condition with a high level of cognitive resource de- pletion ; in contrast , choice likelihood for the healthy option should be similar for the baseline condition and the condi- tion with a low level of cognitive resource depletion .
In <SD> study 3 </SD> , the “ healthy-right ” ( “ healthy-left ” ) condition was incongruent ( congruent ) to the natural mental representa- tion and hence required higher ( lower ) cognitive resources .
So a resource depletion model would predict choice likeli- hood difference between the baseline and the “ healthy- right ” conditions and no difference between the baseline and the “ healthy-left ” conditions .
However , we find a greater likelihood of healthy food choices in the “ healthy- left ” ( vs. baseline ) condition , effectively ruling out the al- ternative explanation related to a resource depletion model .
Similarly , the results of <SD> study 2a </SD> rule out the role of price as an alternative explanation .
Specifically , research shows that consumers place less expensive items on the left than on the right ( Cai , Shen , and Hui 2012 ; Valenzuela and Raghubir 2015 ) and perceive healthy items as more expensive than unhealthy items ( Drewnowski and Barratt- Fornell 2004 ) ; however , the findings of <SD> study 2a </SD> demon- strate effects in the opposite direction .
The findings of this research have important concep- tual implications .
While prior research has examined dif- ferent factors that can influence choices between healthy versus unhealthy foods , such as affective/cognitive states ( Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999 ) , temptation ( Dhar and Wertenbroch 2000 ) , body types of others ( McFerran et al .
2010 ) , assortment structure ( Kahn and Wansink 2004 ) , self-control ( Baumeister 2002 ; Kivetz and Simonson 2002 ) , and health claims ( Chandon and Wansink 2007 ) , among others , no study , to the best of our knowledge , has examined the effects of lateral display positions of healthy and unhealthy options on consumer choices .
The present research takes an important step in this direction .
In es- sence , choosing between healthy and unhealthy options of- ten entails trading off between short-term benefits in terms of taste/pleasure and long-term benefits in terms of health/ 108 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH well-being .
As a result , self-control in resisting temptation plays an influential role in determining final choice out- come between healthy and unhealthy options .
Our research shows that laterally displaying healthy options to the left ( compared to the right ) of unhealthy options is congruent with their natural mental representation .
This increases ease of processing and enhances self-control , which in turn increases the likelihood of choosing the healthy option ( the experiments reported in online appendices E and F provide empirical evidence regarding the role of self- control ) .
Our findings also contribute to research in the domain of sensory marketing and specifically to the domain of vi- sual marketing .
In particular , visual cues are usually en- countered prior to other sensory cues ( e.g. , olfactory , gustatory , haptic , or auditory ) because they usually require the least amount of proximity and are processed faster neu- rologically compared to the other sensory cues ( Herz and Engen 1996 ) .
Hence , not surprisingly , visual cues play a dominant role in influencing food choices and evaluations ( Biswas et al .
2014 ; Chandon and Ordabayeva 2009 ; Hoegg and Alba 2007 ) .
The findings of our research add to this growing literature in the domain of visual marketing by highlighting how subtle cues such as lateral visual posi- tions can influence healthful choices .
Additionally , the findings of this research contribute to the literature on lateral and visual field positions .
Prior studies examining lateral positions and mental representa- tion of magnitude have focused on a variety of topic do- mains such as number processing , time perception , aesthetics , and ad evaluations ( Calabria and Rossetti 2005 ; Chae and Hoegg 2013 ; Chokron and De Agostini 2000 ; Janiszewski 1990 , 1993 ) .
Also , previous research has dem- onstrated how items displayed in the center lead to higher preference and value inferences ( Raghubir and Valenzuela 2006 ; Valenzuela and Raghubir 2009 ) , as well as higher vi- sual attention ( Atalay , Bodur , and Rasolofoarison 2012 ) .
The present study , however , is the first to examine how lat- eral display patterns of healthy and unhealthy food options influence choice and consumption volume .
Our research also has potentially serious implications for lab-based ( or even field-based ) research studies involv- ing healthy and unhealthy options .
At the very least , the lateral display positions ( left vs. right ) of healthy and un- healthy items need to be counterbalanced for such research studies .
This is an important issue that future research stud- ies need to factor in when designing studies/experiments involving food displays , to avoid potential confounding ef- fects related to lateral display positions .
Implications for Managers , Regulators , and Consumers The findings of our study have interesting implications for retail product displays and menu designs .
For instance , if a store wants to enhance sales of their healthy items , they can display them to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy options , from the consumer ’ s visual perspective .
Similarly , while designing restaurant menus , a restaurant wanting to enhance sales of healthy food items might want to display the healthy items on the left side of the menu and the un- healthy items on the right side .
With growing trends toward focusing on healthy eating , optimal menu designs can help restaurant managers in driving sales of healthy versus un- healthy items .
Incidentally , while there is high interest in the popular press about the psychological aspects of menu designs ( Zhang 2014 ) , there is very limited research in the marketing academic literature examining psychological phenomena behind menu design .
Our research aims to take an important step in this direction by identifying how lat- eral display patterns of healthy/unhealthy items on a menu can potentially influence choice .
Clearly , additional stud- ies , especially in field settings , are needed to examine this phenomenon in greater depth .
Given the worldwide concerns related to obesity and factors influencing choices for healthy ( vs. unhealthy ) op- tions , understanding how visual cues influence choice has important consequential implications .
In particular , pol- icymakers could use the findings of this research to nudge consumers toward healthier choices .
Specifically , the find- ings of this research have implications for consumer welfare in terms of facilitating healthy choice behavior .
Policymakers and consumers might want to promote having healthy items displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items in order to nudge healthier food choices and consumption .
Limitations and Future Research Directions In our studies , we examined only healthy and unhealthy items , while many food items might be “ neutral ” ( i.e. , nei- ther healthy nor unhealthy ) .
Additional studies are required to examine how the left-to-right mental organization holds for “ neutral ” products .
Similarly , there can be several rele- vant moderators that can influence the pattern of effects observed in this research .
For instance , would a person ’ s orientation toward a healthy lifestyle or health goals influ- ence the results observed here ?
Cultural background can be another relevant moderator .
That is , in our studies , all the participants were based in the United States and were ex- pected to be oriented to process information from left to right .
It will be interesting to examine if the pattern of our results hold for consumers who tend to read and process in- formation from right to left .
In this research , we focused primarily on the interest- ing effects of lateral display positions of food items on choice .
We did not explore the underlying processes in depth .
While we report the findings of process studies dem- onstrating mediating effects , in online appendices E and F , there is scope for additional research on the process front .
ROMERO AND BISWAS 109 In other words , future research should explore the underly- ing process in greater depth .
As mentioned previously , something “ good ” ( or “ pos- itive ” ) is often represented on the right , whereas something “ bad ” ( or “ negative ” ) is represented on the left ( Casasanto 2009 ) .
From a scholarly or regulatory perspective , healthy ( unhealthy ) items are considered to be “ good ” ( “ bad ” ) .
However , from a consumer standpoint , “ good ” can refer to “ good taste ” ( and not necessarily “ good for you in the long term ” ) , as has been highlighted earlier .
Hence the situa- tional concept of what is considered “ good ” or “ bad ” might moderate the effects observed in our studies .
Similarly , can the handedness ( right vs. left ) of a person moderate our ef- fects ?
This can be even more interesting when considering individuals who have flexible concepts of handedness ( Eelen et al .
2013 ) .
This research focused on the effects of lateral displays of food items on the left versus on the right .
Future re- search can extend this by examining the implications of display patterns in other formats , such as vertical ( top-bot- tom ) displays of healthy and unhealthy items .
Given the relatively nascent stage of research on effects of food dis- play patterns , there is scope for significant additional work in this area .
Finally , while it is important to understand choices be- tween healthy and unhealthy options , display positions can possibly also bias choices in other marketplace scenarios ( Chandon et al .
2009 ) .
For example , would lateral positions of two items , with different price or indulgence levels , influ- ence choice ?
Such studies would be conceptually interesting and have relevant managerial implications .
Indeed , with hardly any research examining the effects of lateral display positions of products on choice , there is scope for substantial future research studies in this domain .
We hope our research will encourage work in these and related areas .
