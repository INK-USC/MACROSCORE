Makiwane Human Resources Research Council , Pretoria , South Africa Anne Teitelman University of Pennsylvania Objective : Little research has tested HIV/sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) risk-reduction interventions ’ effects on early adolescents as they age into middle and late adolescence .
This study tested whether intervention-induced reductions in unprotected intercourse during a 12-month period endured over a 54-month period and whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of STIs , which increase risk for HIV .
Method : Grade 6 learners ( mean age 12.4 years ) participated in a 12-month trial in Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , in which 9 matched pairs of schools were <SP> randomly selected </SP> and within pairs randomized to a theory-based HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention or an attention-control intervention .
They completed 42- and 54-month postintervention measures of unprotected intercourse ( the primary outcome ) , other sexual behaviors , theoretical constructs , and , at 42- and 54-month follow-up only , biologically confirmed curable STIs ( chlamydial infection , gonorrhea , and trichomoniasis ) and herpes simplex virus 2 .
Results : The HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention reduced unprotected intercourse averaged over the entire follow-up period ( OR 0.42 , 95 % CI [ 0.22 , 0.84 ] ) , an effect not significantly reduced at 42- and 54-month follow-up compared with 3- , 6- , and 12-month follow-ups .
The intervention caused positive changes on theoretical constructs averaged over the 5 follow-ups , although most effects weakened at long-term follow-up .
Although the intervention ’ s main effect on STIs was nonsignificant , an Intervention Condition Time interaction revealed that it significantly reduced curable STIs at 42-month follow-up in adolescents who reported sexual experience .
Conclusion : These results suggest that theory-based behavioral interventions with early adolescents can have long-lived effects in the context of a generalized severe HIV epidemic .

6 , 610–621 0278-6133/15/ $ 12.00 http : //dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0000140 610 Accounting for an estimated 1.6 million deaths in 2012 ( UNAIDS , 2013a ) , the HIV epidemic continues to have devastat- ing effects on global health .
Approximately 70 % of new HIV infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa , where heterosexual expo- sure is the main mode of transmission ( UNAIDS , 2013a ) .
People ages 15–24 years account for 39 % of new HIV infections ( UN- AIDS , 2013b ) , raising concern about HIV prevention for youth .
In South Africa , the sub-Saharan African nation with the largest number of people living with HIV in the world that is experiencing a generalized ( UNAIDS and World Health Organization , 2000 ) severe epidemic , HIV disproportionately affects young women : Approximately 3 % of males and 7 % of females ages 15–19 years are HIV positive , as are 5 % of males and 21 % of females ages 20–24 years ( Shisana et al. , 2009 ) .
The median age of first sex in South Africa is about 16 years ( Richter , 2005 ; Simbayi , Chauveau , & Shisana , 2004 ) .
Intervening in early adolescence , ages 10–14 years before or just after children become sexually active , is a way to educate them about safer sex practices before they establish habitual patterns of unsafe behavior ( UNICEF , 2011 ) .
Although several randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) have found that interventions reduced HIV sexual risk behaviors in early adolescents ( Coyle , Kirby , Marin , Gomez , & Gregorich , 2004 ; J .
B. Jemmott , Jemmott , & Fong , 1998 , 2010 ; Stanton et al. , 1996 ) , only one such trial focused on sub-Saharan African early adolescents ( J .
B. Jemmott , Jemmott , O ’ Leary , et al. , 2010 ) .
Intervention trials with sub-Saharan African youth have had mixed results .
One trial ( Jewkes et al. , 2008 ) found a reduced incidence of herpes simplex virus 2 ( HSV-2 ) , whereas two found interventions did not affect HSV-2 ( Cowan et al. , 2010 ; Ross et al. , 2007 ) .
Two trials found intervention-induced reductions in sexual risk behaviors ( Ross et al. , 2007 ; Stanton et al. , 1998 ) , but two others ( Cowan et al. , 2010 ; Jewkes et al. , 2008 ) did not .
Moreover , no trials have tested the effects of HIV/sexually transmitted infec- tion ( STI ) risk-reduction interventions in sub-Saharan African early adolescents as they age into middle and late adolescence when their sexual activity increases .
Although some trials exam- ined effects 2 or more years postintervention ( Cowan et al. , 2010 ; Doyle et al. , 2010 ; Jewkes et al. , 2008 ) , the participants were older adolescents and the trials did not test statistically whether the interventions ’ effects were significantly reduced at longer term follow-up .
Here we report tests of ( a ) an intervention ’ s effects on South African early adolescents during a 54-month postintervention pe- riod and ( b ) whether its effects were smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postinterven- tion .
A cluster RCT of the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention Let Us Protect Our Future with Grade 6 learners ( mean age 12.4 years ) found that those in the intervention schools had lower odds of reporting vaginal intercourse , unprotected vaginal intercourse , and multiple partners during the 12-month postintervention period compared with an attention-matched control group ( J .
B. Jemmott , Jemmott , O ’ Leary , et al. , 2010 ) .
The intervention also caused positive changes on potential mediators of sexual risk behaviors the intervention targeted ( O ’ Leary et al. , 2012 ) .
Besides examining these outcomes , we examined whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) , Neisseria gonor- rhoeae ( GC ) , Trichomonas vaginalis ( TV ) , and HSV-2 infections , based on assays of biological specimens 42 and 54 months postin- tervention .
Method Institutional Review Board 8 at the University of Pennsylvania , the designated institutional review board under the federal-wide assurances of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Fort Hare , South Africa , approved the study .
The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand approved the laboratory testing undertaken at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases .
We conducted the study in an urban township and a neighboring semirural settlement in Eastern Cape Province , South Africa .
Schools serving Grade 6 learners from the general population were eligible .
Of 36 schools serving Grade 6 learners in the catchment area , one serving children with learning disabilities was ineligible , leaving 35 eligible schools ; all agreed to participate .
From 17 matched pairs of schools similar in numbers of Grade 6 learners , classrooms , and classrooms with electricity , including one “ pair ” consisting of three schools , we <SP> randomly selected </SP> nine .
We used a cluster RCT design , reducing the potential for con- tamination between treatment arms that would be present were individuals randomized .
We enrolled schools over 13 months beginning in October 2004 and used computer-generated random number sequences to randomize , within pairs , one school to the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention and one to the control group .
Recruiters , following a standardized scripted recruitment protocol , announced the study at the schools and distributed cover letters and parent/guardian consent forms to Grade 6 learners .
During recruitment , school personnel , potential participants , and recruiters were masked to the schools ’ randomized intervention assignment .
The nature of the intervention precluded masking the facilitators and participants to the group assignment during the interventions .
Interventions As described elsewhere ( L. S. Jemmott et al. , 2014 ) , we devel- oped the interventions based on social–cognitive theory ( Bandura , 1986 ) and the theory of planned behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 ) , integrated with qualitative information from extensive formative research with the target population ( O ’ Leary et al. , 2012 ) .
Each intervention included 12 modules , each lasting 1 hr , with two modules deliv- ered during each of six sessions on consecutive school days .
Sessions involved games , brainstorming , role-playing , group dis- cussions , and comic workbooks with a series of characters and storylines .
Using standardized manuals , male and female adult cofacilitators implemented each intervention in mixed-sex small groups of nine to 16 adolescents .
Twenty-one women and 22 men ages 27–56 years ( M 42 years ) bilingual in English and Xhosa served as cofacilitators ( L. S. Jemmott et al. , 2014 ) .
Fifty percent had a bachelor ’ s degree , 65 % previously worked as teachers , and 63 % previously taught HIV education .
We randomly assigned them to an 8-day training to implement one of the two interven- tions , a training in which trainers modeled the intervention activ- ities and facilitators learned their intervention and practiced im- plementing it with feedback .
The HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention was designed to ( a ) increase HIV/STI risk-reduction knowledge , ( b ) enhance outcome T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

611EFFICACY OF AN HIV/STI RISK-REDUCTION INTERVENTION expectancies ( Bandura , 1986 ) supporting abstinence and condom use , and ( c ) increase skills and self-efficacy ( Ajzen , 1991 ; Ban- dura , 1986 ) to use condoms and to negotiate abstinence and condom use .
Table 1 includes the specific theoretical constructs the intervention targeted .
To facilitate parent–child discussions of sexual matters , we gave the learners take-home assignments to complete with a parent .
The health-promotion control intervention ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 2011 ) included activities similar to the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention , but targeting physical activ- ity and fruit and vegetable consumption , behaviors linked to chronic diseases that are leading causes of death in South Africa ( Joubert et al. , 2007 ; Schneider , Norman , Steyn , & Bradshaw , 2007 ) .
Procedure We enrolled in the trial Grade 6 learners who completed the preintervention questionnaire and attended Session 1 of the inter- vention .
They completed immediate-post and 3- , 6- , and 12-month postintervention questionnaires by December 2006 .
The initial informed-consent process covered activities through the 12-month follow-up .
Accordingly , we located the learners , then attending more than 200 secondary schools , and gave them parent/guardian consent forms and cover letters explaining the continuation of the trial and inviting their parents or guardians to a meeting where they could ask questions about the follow-up study .
We began 42-month data collection in April 2008 and com- pleted 54-month data collection in June 2010 .
As compensation , learners received a notebook , a pen , and a pencil for the 3-month follow-up ; a T-shirt for the 6-month follow-up ; a backpack for the 12-month follow-up ; an umbrella ( if female ) or a cap ( if male ) for the 42-month follow-up ; and a jacket for the 54-month follow-up .
We held the intervention and data collection sessions except the 42- and 54-month follow-ups at the learners ’ schools during the extracurricular period at the end of the school day .
We held the 42- and 54-month follow-ups on Saturdays at one of the 18 schools , a centrally located school with suitable plumbing facilities ; trans- portation was provided to the sessions .
Measures The primary outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the learner reported having unprotected vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months .
We defined vaginal intercourse as “ your penis in a female ’ s vagina ” ( male version ) or “ a boy ’ s penis in your vagina ” ( female version ) .
We coded the responses 1 for learners reporting not having vaginal sex or using a condom during vaginal sex and 2 for those reporting vaginal sex without using a condom .
Sec- ondary behavioral outcomes included sexual experience ( i.e. , whether they ever had vaginal sex ) and behaviors in the past 3 months : vaginal sex , multiple partners , heterosexual anal sex , consistent condom use , frequency of condom use , condom use at last sex , and talking to parents about condoms and about not having sex .
We defined anal intercourse using the term “ anus/ behind. ” Condom use measures excluded learners not reporting vaginal sex in the past 3 months .
Consistent condom use was report of using condoms 100 % of the time .
Frequency of condom use was on a scale from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ) .
Additional secondary outcomes included potential mediators— theoretical constructs the HIV risk-reduction intervention target- ed—and biologically confirmed STIs .
The number of items , coef- ficient alpha , and mean ( SE ) by intervention condition and data collection period for each theoretical construct are shown in Table 1 .
HIV risk-reduction knowledge ( J .
B. Jemmott , Jemmott , Braver- man , & Fong , 2005 ) and its subscales on cultural myths ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 2014 ) and condom use knowledge ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 2005 ) are the sum of the correctly answered true–false questions .
We assessed three types of condom use outcome ex- pectancies .
Hedonistic outcome expectancy concerns the belief that using condoms will not interfere with sexual enjoyment ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2005 , 2007 ) .
An example item is “ When a condom is used , sex is more fun. ” Prevention outcome expectancy is the belief that condoms can reduce the risk of pregnancy and HIV/STI ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2007 ) .
An example item is “ Condoms help prevent AIDS. ” Expected parental approval of condom use is the participants ’ belief that their mother and father would approve of their using condoms ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 2007 ) .
Items were rated on scales from 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 5 ( agree strongly ) ; the mean is the score .
We assessed three types of condom use self-efficacy .
Negotia- tion self-efficacy is the learners ’ belief that they can convince their partner to use condoms ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 2005 , 2007 ) .
An example item is “ I can get my partner to use a condom , even if he or she doesn ’ t want to. ” Technical skill self-efficacy is learners ’ belief that they know how to use condoms ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2005 , 2007 ) .
An example item is “ I can use a condom , even if the room is dark. ” Impulse control self-efficacy is the learners ’ belief that they can control themselves sufficiently when sexually excited to use a condom ( J .
B. Jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2005 ) .
An example item is “ If I am sexually aroused , I can stop before sex to use a condom. ” Learners rated items composed of self-efficacy on scales from 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 5 ( agree strongly ) ; the mean is the score .
We assessed three abstinence or sexual intercourse outcome expectancies .
Abstinence–career goals outcome expectancy is the belief that practicing abstinence will facilitate achieving career goals ( Jemmott et al. , 1998 ) .
Abstinence–prevention outcome ex- pectancy is the belief that practicing abstinence prevents preg- nancy and HIV/STI ( Jemmott et al. , 1998 ) .
Expected parental approval of sex is the learners ’ belief that their mother and father would approve of their having sex .
This scale was related to increased odds of reporting sexual intercourse in pilot data ( O ’ Leary et al. , 2012 ) .
Items were rated on scales from 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 5 ( agree strongly ) ; the mean is the score .
We measured two types of abstinence or sexual intercourse self-efficacy : self- efficacy to refuse sex and to avoid sexual-risk situations .
Items were rated on 4-point scales from 1 ( not at all sure ) to 4 ( com- pletely sure ) ; the mean is the score .
An example item for self- efficacy to refuse sex is “ How sure are you that you could refuse to have sex with a person even if you loved him ? ” ( female version ) .
An example of an item measuring self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations is “ How sure are you that you could refuse a ride offered to you by a person that you thought might want to have sex with you ? ” Both scales were related to reduced intention for sexual intercourse in pilot data ( O ’ Leary et al. , 2012 ) .
After completing the 42- and 54-month postintervention ques- tionnaires , learners provided a first-pass urine specimen and a blood specimen , which were delivered to the STI Reference Centre of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases , Johannes- T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

burg , South Africa .
Urine specimens were assayed for CT and GC using the Aptima Combo Assay ( Hologic Gen-Probe , San Diego , CA ) and TV using the Aptima Trichomonas vaginalis Assay ( Hologic Gen-Probe , San Diego , CA ) .
Sera were tested for HSV-2 using the HerpeSelect 2 ELISA IgG assay ( Focus Diagnostics , Cypress , CA ) .
Participants testing positive for curable STIs ( CT , GC , or TV ) received directly observable single-dose antimicrobial treatment and risk-reduction counseling per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations .
Those testing seropos- itive for HSV-2 were counseled , given a short course of acyclovir for flare-ups , and referred for treatment for future flare-ups .
Statistical Analysis The a priori unit of inference was the individual ( J .
B. Jemmott , Jemmott , O ’ Leary , et al. , 2010 ) .
A sample size calculation was performed to detect an effect of d 0.25 standard deviations ( Cohen , 1988 ) on the a priori primary outcome unprotected inter- course , adjusting for the expected variance inflation due to clus- tering ( Donner & Klar , 2000 ) .
Assuming .05 , a two-tailed test , intraclass correlation ( ICC ) coefficient .00864 based on unpub- lished pilot data , 20 % attrition , and N <SS> 1,100 </SS> Grade 6 learners enrolled in the trial from 16 schools with an average of 67 learners in each school , the trial was estimated to have 80 % power to detect d 0.25 effect of the intervention .
We also performed a power analysis for the intervention ’ s effect on STIs , a secondary outcome introduced 42 and 54 months postintervention .
In studies in schools and other nonclinic settings , some adolescents will be sexually experienced and therefore at risk of STI , whereas others will not be sexually experienced and hence not at risk .
Based on prior research ( Richter , 2005 ; Simbayi et al. , 2004 ) , we considered three estimates of the percentage of learners who would be sexual experienced : 76.5 % ( n 809 ) , 51.3 % ( n 542 ) , and 38.3 % ( n 405 ) of the original 1,057 learners .
Assum- ing that 15.4 % of the sexually experienced learners in the absence of an intervention would test positive for CT , GC , or TV , .05 , a two-tailed test , ICC .009 , attrition 20 % , and a reduction in STI rates from 15.4 % in the control group to 8.0 % in the inter- vention group , the estimated power was .84 if 51.3 % were sexually experienced , .95 if 76.5 % were sexually experienced , and .72 if 38.3 % were sexually experienced .
In the primary analyses , the efficacy of the HIV/STI intervention compared with the control intervention on behavioral outcomes over the 3- , 6- , 12- , 42- , and 54-month follow-ups was tested using gen- eralized estimating equation models , adjusting for longitudinal re- peated measurements on learners <SP> clustered within schools </SP> ( Fitzmau- rice , Laird , & Ware , 2004 ; Liang & Zeger , 1986 ) .
Robust standard errors were used , and an exchangeable working correlation matrix was specified .
The models included time-independent covariates , baseline measure of the criterion , time ( five categories representing 3- , 6- , 12- , 42- , and 54-month follow-up ) , intervention condition , and the Intervention Condition Time interaction .
In models for theoretical constructs , time had six categories because the immediate-post as- sessment was included .
We report estimated intervention effects av- eraged over all postintervention assessments constructed from appro- priate “ estimate ” statements from fitted generalized estimating equation models .
We used Intervention Condition Time interaction contrasts to test whether the effect of the intervention was significantly different 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postintervention .
In analyses of condom use , baseline condom use was not included because too few learners reported vaginal intercourse at baseline .
We intended to examine the efficacy of the intervention on STIs , restricting the analysis to learners who reported sexual experience , but found that some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for STIs ; accordingly , we also report anal- yses for those reporting no sexual experience .
Analyses focused on any curable STI and HSV-2 separately and controlled for gender , a strong correlate of STIs , including HIV , in this setting .
We tested the intervention effects on report of sexual inexperience by the 54-month follow-up using <TN> logistic regression </TN> not controlling for baseline sexual experience because the analysis was restricted to those sexually in- experienced at baseline .
We used an intent-to-treat mode with partic- ipants analyzed based on their intervention assignment , regardless of the number of intervention or data collection sessions attended .
We used <TN> chi-square and t tests </TN> to analyze attrition .
Analyses were com- pleted using SAS Version 9 .
Results More than 90 % of 1,057 learners attended each follow-up ses- sion ( see Figure 1 ) .
The percentage that attended at least one follow-up did not differ between the HIV/STI risk-reduction ( 99.5 % ) and control interventions ( 99.2 % ) , <PV> p .583 </PV> .
Attending a follow-up was unrelated to sex , father ’ s presence in the household , residing in the semirural area , or sexual behavior at baseline .
However , only 171 ( 97.7 % ) of learners ages 14–18 years at baseline returned for a follow-up compared with 631 ( 99.5 % ) of those ages 12–13 and 248 ( 100 % ) of those ages 9–11 , <PV> p .011 </PV> .
Unprotected vaginal sex in the past 3 months increased over the follow-up period ( see Table 2 ) .
A smaller percentage of learners in the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention schools reported having unprotected vaginal sex averaged over the postintervention period compared with their counterparts in control schools ( d 0.15 ) , controlling for baseline unprotected vaginal sex ( see Table 3 ) .
The Intervention Condition Time interaction contrast was nonsig- nificant , indicating that the effect was not significantly different at 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postintervention .
The intervention also had effects on two secondary behavioral outcomes , decreasing the odds of heterosexual anal sex ( d 0.16 ) and increasing the odds of talking to parents about not having sex ( d 0.14 ) averaged over the postintervention period in HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention participants compared with controls , effects that were not smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postintervention .
Two effects approached significance : nonsignificantly lower odds of self- reported vaginal sex ( d 0.11 ) and multiple partners ( d 0.10 ) , effects that were smaller at the 42- and 54-month follow-ups compared with the first 12 months .
There were no significant differences between the interventions in measures of condom use and talking to parents about condom use .
The intervention had the hypothesized effect on each theo- retical construct ( see Table 4 ) .
Its effect on condom use hedo- nistic expectancy , condom use technical skills , expected paren- tal approval of sex , self-efficacy to refuse sex , and self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations was not smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with the first 12 months of follow- T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

Even though the effect was smaller at long- term follow-up on the three knowledge variables and condom use impulse control , it was still significant ( see Table 4 ) .
We treated all learners testing positive for a curable STI .
Table 2 presents the percentages of learners testing positive for STIs .
Of those reporting sexual experience at 42 months , 123 ( 21.1 % ) tested positive for a curable STI , as did 29 ( 7.7 % ) of those reporting no sexual experience ( <PV> p .001 </PV> ) .
At 54 months , the figures were 119 ( 19.6 % ) and 11 ( 6.0 % ) , respectively ( <PV> p .001 </PV> ) .
In the analyses on self-reported sexually experienced learners , the intervention effect on curable STIs averaged over the 42- and 54-month follow-ups was nonsignificant , OR 0.91 , 95 % CI [ 0.73 , 1.12 ] .
The Inter- vention Condition Time interaction was significant , <PV> p .022 </PV> .
The intervention reduced curable STIs at 42-month follow-up , OR 0.71 , 95 % CI [ 0.54 , 0.95 ] , but not at 54-month follow-up , OR 1.15 , 95 % CI [ 0.84 , 1.57 ] .
The analysis on HSV-2 serosta- tus revealed no significant intervention effect or interaction , ps .66 .
In the analyses on self-reported sexually inexperienced learn- ers , the intervention ’ s effects on curable STIs and HSV-2 and the Intervention-Condition x Time interactions were nonsignificant , ps .18 .
Discussion These results , obtained more than 4 years postintervention , indicate that the Let Us Protect Our Future intervention had significant effects on South African early adolescents .
Averaged over the 54-month follow-up period , the intervention reduced self-reported unprotected vaginal sex and heterosexual anal sex and increased self-reported talking to parents about not having sex compared with the control group .
Moreover , nonsignificant Inter- vention Condition Time interaction contrasts revealed that these effects were not smaller during the longer term compared with shorter term follow-ups .
The intervention ’ s effects on reports of vaginal sex and multiple partners were smaller at long-term compared with short-term Figure 1 .

617EFFICACY OF AN HIV/STI RISK-REDUCTION INTERVENTION follow-up , and its effects averaged over the follow-up period revealed only nearly significant trends toward reductions in vagi- nal sex and multiple partners .
The attenuation of the intervention ’ s effects on some behavioral outcomes after more than 4 years is perhaps not surprising ; the durability of its effects on unprotected vaginal sex , heterosexual anal sex , and talking to parents about not having sex is surprising .
In this connection , some might argue that the intervention , based on a Western theoretical model , social– cognitive theory , implemented in sub-Saharan Africa , would have little effect on behavior .
Contrary to this , its effects were similar to those in a meta-analytic review of HIV risk-reduction interven- tions with adolescents , although none of the trials reviewed had a follow-up as long as 54 months postintervention ( Johnson , Scott- Sheldon , Huedo-Medina , & Carey , 2011 ) .
The intervention also had a significant effect averaged over the postintervention period on each theoretical construct .
Moreover , its effects on several of them , including condom use hedonistic outcome expectancy , condom use technical skills , expected parent approval of sex , self-efficacy to refuse sex , and self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations , did not decrease at long-term com- pared with short-term follow-up .
Interestingly , two of these theo- retical constructs , expected parent approval of sex and self- efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations , mediated the intervention ’ s efficacy over the first 12 months postintervention ( O ’ Leary et al. , 2012 ) .
That effects on these constructs endured may well account for the continued efficacy of the intervention , a possibility that future <TN> mediation analyses </TN> must explore .
In the planned analysis on learners reporting sexual experience , the intervention did not reduce curable STIs or HSV-2 averaged over the 42- and 54-month follow-ups .
However , its effect on curable STIs differed significantly at the two follow-ups .
It re- duced curable STIs 42 months , but not 54 months , postinterven- tion .
Reducing STIs is important because having an STI increases the risk of coinfection with HIV ( Fleming & Wasserheit , 1999 ) .
STIs detected 42 months postintervention are a measure of prev- alence because when the learners contracted the STIs is unknown .
In contrast , STIs detected 54 months postintervention are a mea- sure of 1-year incidence because we treated all curable STIs detected 42 months postintervention .
Thus , the intervention had an effect on curable STIs sometime between the intervention ’ s cul- mination and the 42-month assessment , an effect that did not persist sufficiently to affect STI incidence at 54-month follow-up .
Although some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for STI , analyses revealed no significant intervention or Intervention Condition Time interaction effects on curable STIs or HSV-2 in learners reporting no sexual experience .
A few other studies on youth in sub-Saharan Africa have found intervention-induced behavior change ( Michielsen et al. , 2010 ; Paul-Ebhohimhen , Poobalan , & van Teijlingen , 2008 ) , but the follow-up periods were generally shorter than 1 year and rarely 2 or more years , and none targeted early adolescents .
Notably , one cluster RCT found a decreased HSV-2 incidence during a 2-year follow-up period and , in men , decreased transactional sex and problem drinking ( Jewkes et al. , 2008 ) .
Another intervention study , employing a 9-year follow-up , reported no effects on HIV or HSV-2 incidence or self-reported behavior ( Doyle et al. , 2010 ) .
We are unaware of any other RCT reporting effects of an HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention on sub-Saharan African early adolescents over 4.5 years .
Indeed , we are not aware of any other trials that have tested an HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention 1-year postintervention period compared with longer term follow- up , and most meta-analyses have not investigated whether inter- vention efficacy varies over time .
Although a meta-analysis ( John- son et al. , 2011 ) reported that the length of postintervention follow-up did not affect effect size estimates , such review- generated evidence as opposed to study-generated evidence ( Coo- per , 1989 ) is correlational , not addressing whether the effects within trials are significantly smaller at long-term follow-up be- cause length of follow-up may be related to other aspects of trials , complicating interpretation .
Future trials , like the present trial , reporting statistical tests comparing short-term and long-term follow-up results , are needed to provide the data for meta-analyses on the whether the size of intervention effects varies over time .

A common concern about providing HIV education , including information about condoms , to young sexually inexperienced ad- olescents is that such education would encourage them to have sex .
The present study in which only 3.3 % of young adolescents reported sexual experience before the intervention ( J .
B. Jemmott , Jemmott , O ’ Leary , et al. , 2010 ) should allay that concern .
The adolescents who received the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention were less likely to report unprotected vaginal sex during a 54- month postintervention period than were their counterparts in the control group , a finding suggesting that intervening with adoles- cents before they are sexually active is salubrious , causing reduc- tions in their sexual risks .
The strengths of this study include the attention-matched control group , <SP> random selection </SP> of schools , long-term follow-up , high retention rates , biological markers , generalized epidemic setting , and the cluster RCT design , which increased internal validity while decreasing risk of contamination between arms .
The use of self- reports is a limitation .
The fact that some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for STI suggests socially desir- able responding , but the significant relation between self-reported sexual experience and STIs 42 and 54 months postintervention reassures that results were not entirely due to socially desirable responding .
Moreover , the robust and consistent results for inter- vention effects on theoretical constructs lend credence to the validity of the data .
The intervention reduced unprotected vaginal sex , but did not increase condom use .
Analyses of the interven- tion ’ s effects on condom use had less power than did analyses on other outcomes : Data from the first three follow-ups were ex- cluded from the condom use analyses because too few learners reported having sex , as were data from learners who did not report sex at 42-month or 54-month follow-up , whereas analyses on other outcomes included all learners , irrespective of whether they had sex .
Therefore , we may have underestimated the intervention ’ s effects on condom use .
Another limitation is that the results may not generalize to all South African adolescents .
Unknown is whether the intervention would continue to be efficacious if im- plemented by teachers in classrooms across South Africa .
A chal- lenge for the future is whether the characteristics of the interven- Table 4 Generalized Estimating Equation Empirical Significance Tests , Mean Differences , ( 95 % Confidence Intervals ) for the Overall Intervention Effect ( Immediate-Post and 3 , 6 , 12 , 42 , 54 Months Postintervention ) , Short-Term Intervention Effect ( Immediate-Post and 3 , 6 , 12 Months Postintervention ) , and Long-Term Intervention Effect ( 42 and 54 Months Postintervention ) and on Theoretical Constructs Adjusted for Baseline Theoretical Construct Score , Mdantsane and Berlin , South Africa , 2004–2010 Overall intervention effect Short-term intervention effect Long-term intervention effect Intervention condition Time interaction contrast Theoretical construct Mean difference [ 95 % CI ] p Mean difference [ 95 % CI ] p Mean difference [ 95 % CI ] p p Constructs relevant to abstinence and condom HIV risk-reduction knowledge 2.78 [ 2.22 , 3.35 ] .001 3.43 [ 2.82 , 4.04 ] .001 1.59 [ 0.93 , 2.25 ] .0001 .0001 Cultural myths 0.66 [ 0.38 , 0.94 ] .001 0.71 [ 0.43 , 1.05 ] .001 0.56 [ 0.22 , 0.90 ] .0012 .0224 Constructs relevant to condom use Condom use knowledge 1.02 [ 0.84 , 1.21 ] .001 1.29 [ 1.08 , 1.50 ] .001 0.49 [ 0.27 , 0.71 ] .001 .001 Condom use hedonistic outcome expectancy 0.39 [ 0.25 , 0.54 ] .001 0.43 [ 0.26 , 0.60 ] .001 0.31 [ 0.15 , 0.48 ] .001 .850 Condom use prevention outcome expectancy 0.28 [ 0.14 , 0.43 ] .001 0.42 [ 0.23 , 0.61 ] .001 0.01 [ 0.13 , 0.15 ] .877 .001 Perceived parent approval of condom use 0.45 [ 0.22 , 0.67 ] .001 0.67 [ 0.39 , 0.96 ] .001 0.03 [ 0.17 , 0.23 ] .761 .001 Condom use technical skill self-efficacy 0.28 [ 0.08 , 0.49 ] .006 0.35 [ 0.10 , 0.60 ] .006 0.16 [ 0.04 , 0.35 ] .114 .295 Condom use negotiation self- efficacy 0.50 [ 0.31 , 0.69 ] .001 0.66 [ 0.42 , 0.90 ] .001 0.20 [ 0.04 , 0.36 ] .015 .097 Condom use impulse control self-efficacy 0.51 [ 0.33 , 0.70 ] .001 0.68 [ 0.44 , 0.92 ] .001 0.20 [ 0.03 , 0.37 ] .023 .001 Constructs relevant to abstinence Abstinence–career goal outcome expectancy 0.49 [ 0.33 , 0.65 ] .001 0.70 [ 0.51 , 0.90 ] .001 0.09 [ 0.13 , 0.31 ] .442 .001 Abstinence–prevention outcome expectancy 0.23 [ 0.06 , 0.40 ] .008 0.35 [ 0.14 , 0.55 ] .001 0.02 [ 0.18 , 0.23 ] .823 .004 Perceived parent approval of sexual intercourse 0.21 [ 0.33 , 0.09 ] .001 0.23 [ 0.37 , 0.10 ] .001 0.18 [ 0.34 , 0.01 ] .034 .880 Self-efficacy to refuse sexual intercourse 0.41 [ 0.22 , 0.60 ] .001 0.51 [ 0.29 , 0.73 ] .001 0.26 [ 0.06 , 0.46 ] .009 .166 Self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations 0.51 [ 0.30 , 0.71 ] .001 0.57 [ 0.34 , 0.81 ] .001 0.40 [ 0.19 , 0.61 ] .001 .285 Note .

619EFFICACY OF AN HIV/STI RISK-REDUCTION INTERVENTION tion and its effects can be maintained with implementation in the real world , important questions implementation research will have to answer .
Nonetheless , the fact that adolescents who received only 12 hr of intervention in Grade 6 , when few reported sexually experience , retained risk-reduction knowledge , self-efficacy , and outcome ex- pectancies and were continuing to engage in safer sexual behavior during a 54-month follow-up period is quite extraordinary .
The HIV epidemic is having devastating effects in South Africa , the country with the most people living with HIV .
These results indicate that intervening early , before the initiation of sexual activity , can have long-lasting effects on behavior—necessary effects should we hope to see an AIDS-free generation .
