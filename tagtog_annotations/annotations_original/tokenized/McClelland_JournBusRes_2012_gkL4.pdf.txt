Specifically , we argue that CEOs with shorter career horizons ( as measured by their age ) will adopt risk- averse strategies that will , on average , adversely influence future firm performance .
Further , we argue that at high levels of CEO ownership , this relationship is exacerbated due to the accompanying power that comes with high ownership .
In terms of CEO tenure , we propose that CEOs ' paradigms will become increas- ingly obsolete as their tenure increases with this process hurting future performance in dynamic industries .
However , such performance declines may not occur in more stable industries .
Using a sample of US-based firms from the S & P 500 , we find support for our arguments when examining the future Return on Assets of firms .

Introduction Over the last few decades , scholars have found that Chief Executive Officers ( CEOs ) affect strategic choices and organizational performance ( Finkelstein , Hambrick , & Cannella , 2009 ) .
Intriguing questions from this perspective involve the effects of CEO age ( Hambrick & Mason , 1984 ) and tenure ( Henderson , Miller & Hambrick , 2006 ; Simsek , 2007 ) on firm performance .
In particular , our study argues that CEO age and tenure are associated with hard-to-measure cognitive factors such as the CEO 's career time horizon and paradigm for running the firm , and these ‘ unseen ’ factors affect firm performance in certain situations .
While CEO age and CEO tenure are usually correlated , prior re- search ( e.g. , Barker & Mueller , 2002 ; Musteen , Barker , & Baeten , 2006 ) has indicated that CEO age and CEO tenure may affect firm out- comes differentially .
In recent decades , the age and tenure of CEOs have also become increasingly decoupled .
As noted in the business press , there has been a dramatic decline in CEO tenure in the past two decades ( e.g. , Weisman , 2008 ) , which implies a greater number of CEOs with shorter tenure even if appointed at an advanced age .
In contrast , some younger CEOs , especially in technology industries , are enjoying extended tenure .
Thus , given this decoupling of CEO age and tenure , we particularly focus on how CEO age and CEO tenure affect future firm performance.The idea that younger managers attempt novel and unprecedent- ed strategies trying to improve firm future performance is inherently tied to the ‘ horizon problem ’ ( Hambrick & Mason , 1984 : 198 ) .
By def- inition , a CEO 's career horizon is a function of the CEO 's age .
While younger CEOs , with relatively long career horizons , are more likely to adopt risky strategies to enhance future firm financial perfor- mance , CEOs with shorter career horizons are more likely to adopt strategic postures that are risk-averse and more conducive to career security .
From a personal point of view , such older CEOs may be reluctant to embrace risky strategies if the pay-off is expected to ma- terialize after the CEO 's retirement .
Indeed , a number of empirical studies have shown that CEOs curtail the use of risky strategies involving R & D expenditures ( Barker & Mueller , 2002 ) capital expen- ditures ( Dechow & Sloan , 1991 ) or international acquisitions ( Matta & Beamish , 2008 ) as their career horizons shorten .
In addition , CEOs ' paradigms or schemas for running their firms affect future firm performance .
Hambrick and Fukutomi ( 1991 ) explained the evolution of CEO paradigms as their tenure increases .
In the early stage of tenure , newly appointed CEOs start to develop their knowledge and beliefs regarding how the firm should be managed .
However , after some time , CEOs have less interest to accept new information and are unwilling to initi- ate strategic change due to developing a relatively fixed paradigm ( Hambrick & Fukutomi , 1991 ) .
Therefore , longer-tenured CEOs risk becoming ‘ stale in the saddle ’ ( e.g. , Miller , 1991 ) where their paradigms become outdated .
Researchers have found that this problem becomes even more exacerbated in dynamic environ- ments where the constant adaptation , rather than re-use of previ- ous knowledge , is needed for the firm to perform well ( Henderson et al. , 2006 ) .

McClelland et al .
/ Journal of Business Research 65 ( 2012 ) 1387–1393In this paper , we argue that a CEO 's career horizon and paradigm will influence the firm 's future financial performance negatively when ( a ) the CEO reaches an age that is near or beyond conventional retirement age and ( b ) the CEO has extended tenure .
However , these arguments are nuanced by contingencies .
We argue that career hori- zon problems are more problematic when CEOs have high ownership .
In contrast , extended tenure 's performance implications depend on the level of stability in a firm 's industry .
Using a data set of over 200 firms from the S & P 500 in 2001 , we find some support for these arguments .
2 .
Theory and hypotheses Our main argument is that future performance of firms will vary with the CEOs ' career horizon and tenure .
Specifically , the ‘ horizon problem ’ becomes salient as CEOs near retirement age ( i.e. , tradition- ally 65 years of age in the USA ) and the ‘ fixed paradigm problem ’ becomes prominent as CEOs gain longer tenure .
We expect the rela- tionship between CEO age and future firm performance to be concave , showing little association over most of the range of CEO ages .
Howev- er , as CEOs approach traditional retirement age , we expect a negative relationship to develop between CEO age and future firm perfor- mance .
Additionally , we expect that the power associated with equity ownership by the CEO will strengthen this relationship resulting in even lower future performance for firms with older CEOs .
We also propose a negative relationship between CEO tenure and future per- formance moderated by the level of industry dynamism such that the negative relationship is stronger in unstable industries .
The rest of this section will present the theory underlying this study .
2.1 .
CEO career horizon and future financial performance As CEOs approach retirement , the potential for agency prob- lems increases ( Davidson et al. , 2007 ; Matta & Beamish , 2008 ) .
This phenomenon is called the horizon problem .
The goals of the CEO may diverge from those of shareholders when the CEO has a shorter time horizon for firm actions to personally benefit the CEO than the time horizon for actions maximizing shareholder wealth or long-term firm performance .
Indeed , empirical research shows that firms with short-horizoned top executives follow less risky investment strategies with firm resources .
For example , sev- eral studies have found that older CEOs are less likely to spend money on long-term investments such as research and develop- ment ( Barker & Mueller , 2002 ) , advertising and capital investment ( Dechow & Sloan , 1991 ) .
Other studies have found that firm actions having some level of risk may also decline with CEO age such as international acquisitions ( Matta & Beamish , 2008 ) or en- trepreneurial behavior ( Levesque & Minniti , 2006 ) .
The horizon problem becomes increasingly salient as CEOs near retirement age for two reasons .
First , shorter career horizons are accompanied with reduced career mobility ( e.g .
Veiga , 1983 ; Ward , Sonnenfeld , & Kimberly , 1995 ) .
Once removed from office , older CEOs are less likely to find similar positions at firms than their youn- ger counterparts .
The relative lack of job mobility for older CEOs is amplified by involuntary loss of the CEO position .
Fired CEOs are often viewed in the external labor market as having less to offer pro- spective employers ( Ward et al. , 1995 ) .
These findings suggest that as CEOs age it becomes a rational personal career strategy ( as they begin to focus on their own financial and career security ) to avoid the pos- sible employment losses associated with riskier firm strategies that may make firm performance more variable in the short-term .
Second , the idea of retirement is often dreaded by top managers .
Sonnenfeld argued that some CEOs become “ shrunken ” individuals as their retirements begin and that as retirement age nears they “ see nothing attractive in retirement and much to avoid ” ( 1988 : 33 ) .
CEOs are largely high achievers that have often dedicated muchof their life to work .
Sonnenfeld ( 1988 ) characterized this work dedication and attitude with a statement made by a CEO in his study : “ I want my death and my retirement to be simultaneous ” ( Sonnenfeld , 1988 : 35 ) .
In other words , many CEOs have their identi- ties tightly connected with the top position and therefore may want to hang onto the CEO title for years after having become less effective .
Empirically , while many of the studies cited previously have examined the association between CEO career horizon and firm deci- sions ( e.g. , investments , acquisitions , etc .
) , little examination has been undertaken examining the relationship between CEO career horizon and future firm performance .
However , a few studies offer some insight .
Child ( 1974 ) found that executive age was negatively correlated with multiple measures of company growth .
Child attrib- uted the findings to younger managers being likely to challenge the status quo and reporting greater pressure for change in their compa- nies , which could lead to greater growth opportunities .
Similarly , Norburn ( 1986 ) found that the directors of companies in growing in- dustries tended to be significantly younger than the directors of com- panies in declining industries .
While these studies were not designed to conceptualize the problems associated with CEO career horizon , they do suggest that shorter career horizons may be associated with lower levels of future firm performance .
If risk-averse strategies are more likely to be adopted as a CEO 's career horizon shortens , negative performance implications exist for firms with CEOs having relatively short career horizons .
Because CEO age is the best way to measure career horizon going forward in time ( e.g. , Davidson , Xie , & Ning , 2007 ) , we hypothesize that : Hypothesis 1 .
CEO age and futurefirmperformancewill have a concave relationship .
With this concave relationship , we expect a modest relationship between CEO age and future firm performance over much of the range of CEO ages .
However , we expect a distinct drop in future firm performance as a CEO 's age nears the mid-60s .
Hence , a curvilin- ear relationship is expected .
2.2 .
CEO power , career horizon , and future financial performance Theoretically , it may be insufficient to argue that CEOs with shorter career time horizons will negatively affect future perfor- mance .
While they may have the motivation to maintain the status quo , they must also have the capacity to do so .
The traditional view of agency theory argues that CEO and share- holder interests converge when CEOs become shareholders ( e.g .
Fama & Jensen , 1983 ; Jensen & Meckling , 1976 ; Morck et al. , 1988 ) .
Within this view , managerial ownership of equity mitigates the agen- cy problem by reducing incentives to consume perquisites and to undertake self-interested actions at the expense of shareholders .
However , researchers have also shown that power is likely to accrue to CEOs who hold substantial stakes of their firm 's equity ( e.g .
Daily & Johnson , 1997 ; Matta & Beamish , 2008 ; McClelland & O'Brien , 2011 ) .
CEO power from high equity ownership may be seen as a double-edged sword .
On one hand , CEOs need power in order to formulate and implement strategies , and to negotiate outcomes that benefit the firm .
On the other hand , CEO power has also been shown to be associated with the pursuance of individual agendas , often to the detriment of firm shareholders ( e.g. , Stulz , 1988 ) .
That is , CEOs with relatively high levels of ownership have a greater capac- ity to be free from the discipline of the firm 's board , shareholders , and the market for corporate control .
Hence , in arguing that power will facilitate the capacity to lengthen career horizons , we adopt the latter perspective .
Indeed , research has shown that CEO power increases as a func- tion of equity ownership .
For example , McEachern ( 1975 ) found that CEOs who had substantial equity holdings were better able to 1389P.L .
McClelland et al .
/ Journal of Business Research 65 ( 2012 ) 1387–1393guard against disciplining forces of capital markets .
Such CEOs were able to lengthen their tenures even when their firms performed poorly .
Indeed , several studies have found that CEOs with relatively large equity stakes are able to ward off unwanted takeover attempts ( Buchholtz & Ribbens , 1994 ; Stulz , 1988 ) .
The study that probably most supports the argument that owner- ship can combine with career horizon to reduce risk-taking behavior and thus future firm performance is Matta and Beamish 's ( 2008 ) study of the international acquisition behavior of firms .
They found that international acquisitions , which carry a significant chance of failure , were less likely to occur when CEOs had a short career time horizon and when they had significant ownership in the firm ( i.e. , the interaction of the two variables ) .
They argued that short- horizoned CEOs may use ownership power to reduce the probability international acquisitions by the firm and thus reduce downside risks of failed acquisitions .
In terms of the performance-related firm effects of CEO power con- veyed by equity ownership , a number of studies in finance have shown that firms run by CEOs with relatively high ownership positions perform relatively poorly in the stock market ( cf. , Morck , Shleifer , & Vishny , 1988 ; Slovin & Sushka , 1993 ) .
While making the CEO a share- holder can align CEO and shareholder interests , the power conveyed by relatively large equity stakes can also facilitate the capacity to make self-serving decisions .
Indeed , it seems that managerial ownership of public firms aligns interests ( i.e. , increases stockholder returns ) only up to a certain level of ownership and thenmayhave entrenching effects ( e.g. , Florackis , Kostakis , & Ozkan , 2009 ) .
Given the arguments regarding the hypothesized career horizon and future financial performance rela- tionship , we hypothesize the following : Hypothesis 2 .
The proportion of outstanding shares held by the CEO ( CEO ownership ) will strengthen the hypothesized curvilinear CEO age and future firm performance relationship ( i.e. , make it more con- cave with a steeper performance drop at high age ) .2.3 .
CEO tenure , industry condition , and future financial performance As CEOs gain longer tenure , they have been found to display a lack of adaptability ( Miller , 1991 ) and risk averseness ( Simsek , 2007 ) .
This phenomenon may be labeled the ‘ fixed paradigm problem ’ and is as- sociated with bounded rationality ( e.g. , Cyert & March , 1963 ) .
Bound- edly rationale CEOs operate with a finite model , or paradigm , of how the environment exists , what strategies are available , and how the organization should operate ( Hambrick & Fukutomi , 1991 : 721 ) .
This paradigm is the basis for the CEO 's action and may change over time as learning occurs .
However , the flexibility of a CEOs ' paradigm will likely vary over the length of the CEO 's tenure .
CEOs with rela- tively short tenure may be alert to environmental changes and orga- nizational options , so they are likely to have a relatively flexible paradigm .
On the contrary , CEOs with longer tenure tend to become more supportive of maintaining the status quo as their paradigm becomes more fixed ( Hambrick & Fukutomi , 1991 ; McClelland et al. , 2010 ; Simsek , 2007 ) .
Several processes may contribute to the fixed paradigm prob- lem .
First , past successes of the firm and CEO may lead to over- confidence in the existing paradigm and make it resistant to change ( Hambrick & Fukutomi , 1991 ) .
Second , longer tenure is also associated with increasing risk-aversion ( Simsek , 2007 ) .
Risky strategies create the possibility of uncertain outcomes , and CEOs often have firm-specific human capital that may be lost if they are removed from office due to the downside risk of these uncertain outcomes .
These mechanism underlie why previous studies have consistently found that increasing tenure in top man- agers leads to persistent strategies ( e.g .
Finkelstein & Hambrick , 1990 ; McClelland , Liang , & Barker , 2010 ; Miller , 1991 ) .Long-tenured CEO will therefore be more likely to value the status quo versus the unknown outcomes of enacting change .
Hence : Hypothesis 3 .
CEO tenure and future firm performance will have a negative relationship .
The fixed paradigm problem accompanying greater CEO tenure is more salient when there is instability in a firm 's environment .
Previous literature emphasized the importance of environment-organization alignment ( e.g .
Lawrence & Lorsch , 1967 ) .
For instance , dynamic envi- ronments demand more flexible structures and innovative strategies ( Miller , 1991 ) .
Therefore , if CEOs do not effectively respond to environ- mental changes by updating their paradigms , firms are likely to experi- ence a decline in performance due to environment-organization misalignment .
In stable industries , the fixed paradigm problem brings less risk to future firm performance as the environment changes more slowly and the chances of a mismatch between the organization and the environment are lower .
Our arguments strongly reflect Henderson et al .
's ( 2006 ) findings about the relationship between CEO tenure and firm performance over forty years in two different industries .
They found that firm per- formance decreased with increasing CEO tenure in the dynamic com- puter industry .
In contrast , firm performance increased with CEO tenure in the more stable food processing industry until CEOs had been in place for more than a decade .
This pattern of findings strongly suggests that industry dynamism moderates the relationship be- tween CEO tenure and future form performance .
Hypothesis 4 .
The level of industry dynamism will negatively moder- ate the relationship between CEO tenure and future firm performance .

Methods A sample of 220 firmswas randomly drawn from the 2001 Standard & Poor 's 500 list .
Therefore , the firms were large , publicly traded , USA corporations .
Archival sources were used to complete the data set .
All variables were collected for the 2001 calendar year with the exception of future financial performance , which was measured in the year 2003 ( e.g. , t+2 ) .
Missing data reduced the final sample to 206 firms .
3.1 .
Dependent variables To capture actual future profitability , we used a firm 's Future return- on-assets in 2003 ( as a percentage ) , which would allowmany decisions made in 2001 to show in firm financial performance.We alsomeasured each firm 's Market-to-book value for the focal year ( 2001 ) reflecting investor expectations about future cash flows .
Thus , any visible firm actions that reflect the horizon problem for CEOs should be accounted for in reducedmarket expectations about future performance .
This var- iable was transformed by adding a constant ( ‘ 10 ’ ) to a firm'smarket-to- book ratio and then applying a natural logarithm due to the variable 's skewed nature .
Data for both variables was collected from the Standard and Poor 's Compustat database .
3.2 .
Independent variables Our hypotheses revolve around two independent variables ( CEO age and CEO tenure ) and two moderating variables ( CEO ownership and Industry dynamism ) .
CEO age was measured in years in year 2001 .
CEO tenurewas measured as the number of years a CEO had oc- cupied the CEO position .
Data for these variables were collected from either of two sources : the Dun and Bradstreet reference book of corpo- rate managements orWho 's who in finance and industry .
CEO ownership was measured as the proportion of a firm 's total outstanding common shares owned by the CEO .
CEO equity ownership data was collected from the Standard and Poor 's Execucomp database .
The total number 1390 P.L .
McClelland et al .
/ Journal of Business Research 65 ( 2012 ) 1387–1393of shares outstanding was collected from Compustat .
Unexercised CEO stock options were not included because they have no voting rights and therefore are not representative of equity ownership power .
Be- cause this variable was not normally distributed and positively skewed , it was transformed logarithmically after adding a constant ( ‘ 10 ’ ) .
Similar logarithmic transformations of equity ownership are common in the literature ( e.g. , Himmelberg , Hubbard & Palia , 1999 ) .
We also calculated the Industry dynamism , following Keats and Hitt ( 1988 ) , using a two-step procedure .
First , the natural logarithmof oper- ating income for each industry ( at the two-digit SIC code level ) over the years 1997–2001 was regressed against time ( as an independent vari- able ) , and then antilogarithms of the standard errors from thesemodels were computed .
This measure is the variability of industry growth in terms of operating income .
Thus , these antilogarithms represent the de- gree of environmental volatility or unpredictability of change within an industry .
Such measures are commonly utilized to capture the industry dynamism ( see Palmer & Wiseman , 1999 ) .3.3 .
Control variables Because we examine equity ownership as a source of CEO power and because multiple studies have shown that other components of the governance context may be substitutable in their capacity to limit CEO power ( e.g. , Himmelberg , Hubbard , & Palia , 1999 ; Rediker & Seth , 1995 ; Walters et al. , 2007 ) , we control our analyses for the influence of the firm 's governance context .
Institutional shareholdings , measured as a percentage of common stock held by institutions , was collected from Standard & Poor 's research insight .
Separation of the CEO and chairperson position ( a dummy variable coded as ‘ 1 ’ when sepa- rate people held the positions ) and Proportion of outside directors on the board for 2001 were collected from SEC filings as reported by The Corporate Library research service ( www.thecorporatelibrary .
com ) .
Because debt in a firm 's capital structure can act as a gover- nance mechanism , we also measured a firm 's Debt-to-assets ratio , defined as total firm debt divided by total firm assets expressed as a percentage .
Data for this variable was collected from the Compustat database .
We also controlled for Total CEO compensation for 2001 in- cluding salary , bonuses and other forms of annual compensation .
Data for this variable were collected from Execucomp and were mea- sured in millions of dollars .
Additionally , we controlled for Firm size using the natural logarithm of the number of firm employees ( in thou- sands ) , which was collected from Compustat .
Finally , we included the CEO change ( in interim 2 years ) due to the time lag when measuring Return-on-assets in 2003 as a dependent variable , but not for Market- to-book value .
When there was a change of CEO between 2001 and 2003 , we included a dummy variable coded as ‘ 1 ’ , otherwise 0.Table 1 Means , standard deviations and correlations .

Correlations with abs4 .
Analyses The hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression ana- lyses .
Hierarchical regression is a conservative method of testing the hypotheses because control variables are entered first into the regres- sion model before the variables of theoretical interest are analyzed .
The variable means , standard deviations , and correlations for the data are reported in Table 1 .
Cook–Weisberg tests of the full regression models for both performance variables revealed the presence of heteroskedasticity ( pb .0001 ) , thus we used robust standard errors in our analyses ( see Huber , 1967 ; White , 1982 ) to correct for heteroskedasticity .
We ana- lyzed both performance measures in five steps .
In the first step , dummy variables were added for a sample firm 's primary two-digit SIC code as reported by Compustat .
Doing so allowed us to control for industry structure effects on firm performance .
We do not include individual industry dummy variables in Table 1 or the regression models reported in Table 2 for parsimony .
Instead , we reported the number of industry dummy variables whose coefficients were signif- icant at the p≤ .05 level .
Table 2 shows the results for Future return on assets .
Model 1 adds the industry dummies .
Model 2 adds CEO variables as well as firm , governance and other control variables .
The direct effect of CEO Age is not significant .
To test for the hypothesized curvilinear effect of CEO Age , we mean-centered the CEO Age variable ( subtracting the mean ) , squared it ( i.e. , made it a quadratic ) and entered it into the model as CEO age — squared ( e.g. , Cohen , Cohen , West , & Aiken , 2002 ) in Model 3 .
The results indicate no support for Hypothesis 1 at conventional significance levels .
Model 4 shows the results for the test of Hypothesis 2 where the interaction between CEO age — squared and CEO ownership is entered .
We find support for the Hy- pothesis 2 that CEO ownership moderates the curvilinear effect of CEO age ( pb .01 ) .
Hypothesis 3 was not supported as CEO tenure had no significant direct effect in Model 2 ( when entered alone ) or in Models 3 and 4 .
We included the interaction term of CEO tenure and Industry dyna- mism in Model 5 in Table 2 .
The results indicate that this interaction term is statistically significant ( pb .05 ) , so Hypothesis 4 is supported .
For testing interactions , all continuous variables were mean-centered following the advice of Cohen et al .
( 2002 ) .
While we report adjusted R-square statistics for models in Table 2 , which can be interpreted similarly to the traditional OLS R-square statistics , no F-tests are reported because such tests are not interpret- able when using robust standard errors ( see STATA Base Reference Manual , Vol .
3 , 2003 : 336–337 ) .

for high ownership , −1 s.d .
for lowownership ) .
The graph in Fig .
1 is constructed from the re- gression results from Model 5 in Table 2 .
The numbers on the left axis represent performance in the industrial equipment industry .
While the relative relationship is the same across all industries , the future ROA numbers on the left axis shift if an industry dummy variable is signifi- cant .
For example , the dummy variable for SIC Code 28 ( Chemicals and Allied Products , including Pharmaceuticals ) had a value of 6.99 and was significantly different from zero ( pb .01 ) ( not reported in Table 1 for parsimony ) .
Therefore , for SIC Code 28 , the graph looks exactly the same but the reader would add about 7 ( e.g. , 6.99 ) to the numbers on the left axis .
As canbe seen fromFig .
1 , CEO ownership acts as a disordinal moderator as it changes the shape of the relationship between CEO age and Future return on assets ( see Malhotra , 2004 , for more discussion on disordinal moderators ) .
A number of observations can be drawn from Fig .
1 .
First , no sub- stantial horizon problem existed for the “ average firm ” that had around the mean level of CEO ownership .
Indeed , there is a very slight positive but near zero relationship between CEO age and Future return on assets for the firms in our sample ( e.g. , the dashed line in Fig .
1 ) .
This would explain why the coefficients for CEO Age or CEO age — squared were not significant in Model 2 in Table 2 .
At average owner- ship levels , virtually no relationship exists in our sample between CEOFig .

Second , we see very little future per- formance differences between firms with CEOs ranging about 53 to 68 years in age .
The lines for mean , low , and high CEO ownership are clustered in the same range of future ROA during that age range .
However , we do see a horizon effect exhibited for the high CEO ownership firms in Fig .
1 .
At about the traditional retirement age ( mid-60s ) , future ROA starts to go down as CEOs become older .
This trend continues to accelerate to the highest CEO age in the sample .
At low CEO ownership firms , we do not see a deterioration of perfor- mance with very advanced age .
One of the main reasons seems to be that very few low ownership CEOs stay in office until a very advanced age .
As seen on Fig .
1 , we stopped graphing the line for low CEO own- ership at age 69 since no CEO with ownership less than one standard deviation below the mean level of ownership was older than 69 years of age in 2001 .
Fig .
1 reveals several other interesting findings .
First , the highest level of future firm performance comes from CEOs that are ( 1 ) young and ( 2 ) have low ownership .
This finding is consistent with these CEOs having the longest career horizons and making strategic decisions that increase future firm performance .
The most surprising finding is that young , high-ownership CEOs performed poorly .
How- ever , this part of the graph was sparsely populated with CEOs given the positive correlation between CEO age and ownership levels ( r=.26 , see Table 1 ) .
We also graphed the effect of CEO tenure and Industry dyna- mism on Future return on assets in Fig .
2 , based on the results in Model 5 in Table 2 .
As seen in Fig .
2 , Industry dynamism moderates the relationship between CEO tenure and Future return on assets .
Similar to Henderson et al .
( 2006 ) finding , CEO tenure has a nega- tive relationship with future ROA in dynamic industries .
Also mimicking their findings , our results show that increasing CEO tenure has a slight positive relationship with future ROA in less dynamic industries .
Where our results deviate from their results was that we never found a turning point in less-dynamic indus- tries where excessive CEO tenure began to hurt future perfor- mance .
In unreported analyses , we tested for such an effect by inserting a squared term ( i.e. , CEO tenure×CEO tenure ) in the models .
These squared terms were not significant at conventional levels ( pb .05 or lower ) .
For parsimony , the Market-to-book value results are not reported in tabular format but are available from the authors .

When graphed out , the interaction was similar in shape to the results reported in Fig .
1 .
However , in a change from the Future return on assets ' results , no moderating effect was found for Industry dynamism on the relationship between CEO tenure and Market-to-book value .
While the regression coefficient on the interaction terms was in the hypothesized direction , the size of the effect was not significantly dif- ferent from zero ( pN .05 ; Hypothesis 4 not supported ) .

Discussion The main findings of this study are that ( a ) shorter CEO career horizons , coupled with higher levels of ownership , lead to lower future financial and market performance and ( b ) that longer CEO tenure generates lower future financial performance in dynamic industries but not in stable industries .
However , it is important for readers to understand the nuances of our findings .
For example , one should not draw the blanket conclu- sion that older CEOs reduce future performance .
Again referring to Fig .
1 , lower future ROA happens only on average when older CEOs hold high ownership positions in their firms .
Indeed , CEO age has very little effect on future performance around mean levels of CEO ownership .
Similarly , increasing CEO tenure does not necessarily hurt performance .
Increasing tenure only hurts performance on aver- age in highly dynamic industries .
As shown in Fig .
2 , future ROA tends to actually increase slightly with tenure in more stable industries .
What do our findings mean for thinking about the performance ef- fects of CEO tenure and age ?
Their effects depend on the contingen- cies or conditions the firm faces .
In dynamic environments , CEO paradigms become increasingly obsolete as tenure increases with negative implications for future performance .
In less dynamic envi- ronments , the continual development and implementation of existing paradigms may actually increase performance or at least not hurt it .
In terms of age , the main contingency seems to be the ability of CEOs to entrench themselves with high levels of ownership when they have very short career horizons .
In other words , short career time horizon plus the power conveyed by ownership can be a recipe for deteriorating future performance .
5.1 .
Theoretical implications In terms of implications for theory , our findings suggest that CEO ownershipmay havemixed effects on the performance of publicly trad- ed firms .
While acknowledging that management equity ownershipincreases the level of management power , many scholars have promot- ed equity ownership as a cure to agency conflicts at firms arguing that it acts as an incentive to maximize shareholder value ( e.g. , Jensen & Meckling , 1976 ) .
However , the role of management equity ownership is more complex ( cf .
Himmelberg et al. , 1999 ) .
Some of this complexity stems from the power-enhancing effects of relatively high levels equity ownership that allows CEOs to effectively gain control of the firms they manage.Management controlmaywork against shareholders in certain situations .
For example , found high equity ownership interacts with a short CEO career horizon to reduce future firm performance .
Indeed , the power associated with high levels of equity ownership can enable shorter-horizoned CEOs to pursue less risky strategies that hurt long term shareholder value such as under-investing in research and devel- opment ( e.g. , Barker & Mueller , 2002 ) .
However , absent short career ho- rizons , the power associated with relatively high levels of equity ownership has less of an effect on future financial performance .
Another contribution was the finding that CEOs with relatively long tenures may have a detrimental effect on future financial performance in dynamic industries .
Previous literature found that the effects of CEO tenure on financial performance are contingent on several factors such as managerial discretion ( Finkelstein & Hambrick , 1990 ) and board of directors ( Walters , Kroll , & Wright , 2007 ) .
Indeed , Henderson et al .
( 2006 ) found that industry dyna- mism is a key moderating factor in the relationship between CEO tenure and firm performance .
However , in operationalizing indus- try dynamism , Henderson and colleagues used a sample of firms in only two industries ( food industry versus computer industry ) .
Our study used firms from various industries across the S & P 500 , enhancing the generalizability of their previous finding .
5.2 .
Limitations This study is not without limitations .
Most of our study design is cross-sectional .
However , cross-sectional data can indicate if an association exists and whether a theory is plausible ( see Child , 1974 : 176 ) .
Also , by lagging our explanatory variables by two years from future ROA , we can make stronger causality inferences than purely cross-sectional studies .
Second , our sample size of 206 firms , although adequate to find support for many of our hypoth- eses , lacks the size to smaller-effect-size relationships .
Third , since much of our theory about CEO age is based on a decreased appe- tite for risk that comes with a shorter career horizon , our results might be different in recent years ( our sample year was 2001 with 2003 financial performance ) where more risky positions could have been punished with performance declines due to gen- eral economic weakness and the global financial crisis .
Therefore , we can not speculate beyond the 2001–2003 time frame of our study .
Lastly , the sample is composed of large USA-based corpora- tions .
Owning even a small percentage of shares in these large firms may place CEOs in unique positions of power and wealth making our results specific to very large firms .
If the firms were headquartered outside the USA , the results might be different .
Governance mechanisms work differently in other cultural–legal environments ( Firth , Fung , & Rui , 2007 ) , so generalizability out- side the USA is limited .

Conclusion The strategy literature has made great strides in identifying rela- tionships between various CEO characteristics and firm outcomes .
This study uniquely adds to that body of knowledge .
We find that the relationship between CEO career horizon and performance is af- fected by the extent to which the CEO wields power associated with high levels of equity ownership .
This finding is intriguing and opens an entirely new avenue for governance researchers interested in the effect that the power conveyed by relatively high levels of equity 1393P.L .
McClelland et al .
/ Journal of Business Research 65 ( 2012 ) 1387–1393ownership conveys vis-à-vis other governance mechanisms .
Our find- ings also reaffirm contentions that CEO tenure may have differential effects on firm performance contingent on the industry conditions .
Taken together , we propose that further examination of the perfor- mance implications of CEO characteristics such as career time hori- zon , tenure , and power is warranted .
