More specifically , is attention allocated in a serial manner , to only one word at any given time ?
Or is it instead allo- cated simultaneously to multiple words ?
Although these questions might appear straightforward , they have important implications for our understanding of how attention and lexical processing guide the eyes during reading and for the methodology of using eye move- ments to make inferences about attention and language processing during reading ( Rayner , 2009 ) .
Both the serial- and parallel-attention theoretical perspectives have proponents who have advanced arguments sup- porting their positions ( see Radach & Kennedy , 2013 ; Reichle , Liversedge , Pollatsek , & Rayner , 2009 ) .
The purpose of this article is to further inform this debate by reporting the results of two experiments designed to provide a novel test of the serial-allocation hypothesis— a test inspired by Duncan ’ s ( 1984 ) original demonstra- tion that when viewing two spatially overlapping objects , people can more easily attend to two features of one object than one feature from each of two objects ( Ciaramitaro , Mitchell , Stoner , Reynolds , & Boynton , 2011 ; see Chen , 2012 , for a review ) .
Before disclosing how this was done , however , it is first necessary to provide some background .
The debate about attention allocation during reading came to the fore with the development of two classes of computational models of eye-movement control in reading—the serial-attention ( e.g. , E-Z Reader ; Reichle , Pollatsek , Fisher , & Rayner , 1998 ; Reichle , Pollatsek , & Rayner , 2012 ) and attention-gradient ( e.g. , saccade gen- eration with inhibition by foveal target , or SWIFT ; Engbert , Nuthmann , Richter , & Kliegl , 2005 ) models , which instantiate the serial- and parallel-allocation hypotheses , respectively .
Both classes of models pro- vide quantitative accounts of eye movements during reading , despite doing so using very different assump- tions about how attention and lexical processing are related to ongoing decisions about when and where to 734827 PSSXXX10.1177/0956797617734827Liu , ReichleObject-Based Attention in Reading research-article2017 Corresponding Author : Yanping Liu , Department of Psychology , Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Social Cognitive Neuroscience and Mental Health , Sun Yat-sen University , 135 Xingang Xi Rd. , Guangzhou , China , 510275 E-mail : liuyp33 @ mail.sysu.edu.cn Eye-Movement Evidence for Object-Based Attention in Chinese Reading Yanping Liu1 and Erik D. Reichle2 1Department of Psychology , Sun Yat-sen University , and 2Department of Psychology , Macquarie University Abstract Is attention allocated to only one word or to multiple words at any given time during reading ?
The experiments reported here addressed this question using a novel paradigm inspired by classic findings on object-based attention .
In Experiment 1 , participants ( N = 18 ) made lexical decisions about one of two spatially colocated Chinese words or nonwords .
Our main finding was that only the attended word ’ s frequency influenced response times and accuracy .
In Experiment 2 , participants ( N = 30 ) read target words embedded in two spatially colocated Chinese sentences .
Our key finding here was that only target-word frequencies influenced looking times and fixation positions .
These results support the hypothesis that words are attended in a strictly serial ( and perhaps object-based ) manner during reading .
The theoretical implications of this conclusion are discussed in relation to models of eye-movement control during reading and the conceptualization of words as visual objects .

For example , according to E-Z Reader , words are attended to and processed in a strictly serial manner ; the lexical identification of one word causes attention to shift to the next word , so that its processing can begin .
In contrast , the core assumption of SWIFT is that attention is a gradient or flexible “ zoom lens ” ( Schad & Engbert , 2012 ) that supports the simultaneous pro- cessing of a few words , causing the gradient to progress down a line of text as individual words are identified .
Most empirical attempts to discriminate between these two accounts of attention allocation have exam- ined the spatial extent of lexical processing .
For exam- ple , there have been efforts to show that lexical processing is distributed across multiple words by attempting to demonstrate that variables that influence the lexical processing rate of word N + 1 ( e.g. , its fre- quency of occurrence in printed text ) can influence the time spent fixating on word N. Such parafoveal-on- foveal effects would be illustrated , for example , if fixa- tion durations on word N tended to decrease as the frequency of word N + 1 increased , presumably because an increased rate of word N + 1 lexical processing reduces the time required for its identification from word N ( for a review , see Schotter , Angele , & Rayner , 2012 ) .
If demonstrated , such effects would provide evi- dence against serial-attention models such as E-Z Reader because they posit that only the completion of some stage of lexical processing of word N initiates saccadic programming to move the eyes to word N + 1 .
Although previous studies have yielded consistent parafoveal-on-foveal effects when , for example , per- ceptual variables such as the orthographic familiarity of word N + 1 affect the fixation duration on word N ( Kennedy , 1998 , 2000 ; White , 2008 ) , evidence for lexical parafoveal-on-foveal effects is mixed .
Statistical analy- ses of eye-movement corpora during reading experi- ments ( e.g. , Kliegl , Nuthmann , & Engbert , 2006 ) and nonreading experiments ( e.g. , Kennedy , 1998 , 2000 ) typically show such effects , but experiments in which lexical properties of target words are controlled during reading typically yield null results ( e.g. , Drieghe , Rayner , & Pollatsek , 2008 ; Henderson & Ferreira , 1993 ; for a recent meta-analysis , see Brothers , Hoversten , & Traxler , 2017 ) or results that are difficult to interpret ( e.g. , shorter fixations on word N if word N + 1 is low frequency ; Kennedy , 1998 , 2000 ) .
This interpretation is also made difficult because , in natural text , linguistic variables associated with word N and word N + 1 covary in complex ways , making inferences based on statistical analyses tentative ( see Kliegl , 2007 ; Rayner , Pollatsek , Drieghe , Slattery , & Reichle , 2007 ; see also Angele et al. , 2015 ) , and because the properties of word N + 1 might seemingly influence fixations on word N because of saccadic error , imperfect eye convergence , or eye-tracker measurement error ( see Reichle & Drieghe , 2015 ) .
The goal of this article , however , is not to examine the serial versus parallel debate by testing the spatial extent of lexical processing , but rather to examine the issue using a completely novel approach—one that pro- vides a test of the serial hypothesis by asking whether or not people can attend to one of two words that are located in the same region of space , using paradigms inspired by Duncan ( 1984 ; see also MacLeod , 1991 ) .
These paradigms involved two Chinese word/text stim- uli being displayed simultaneously in different colors in the same spatial location ( see Fig .
1 ) .
In Experiment 1 , these stimuli consisted of individual words and non- words , and participants were instructed to make lexical decisions about one of the two spatially colocated char- acters .
In Experiment 2 , the stimuli consisted of target words embedded in whole sentences , which partici- pants were instructed to read for comprehension while their eye movements were recorded .
In both experi- ments , the frequencies of the attended and ( according to the serial-attention hypothesis ) unattended words were orthogonally manipulated .
Because word fre- quency is known to robustly influence the rate of lexi- cal processing ( as measured using lexical decision response times and eye-movement measures ; e.g. , Schilling , Rayner , & Chumbley , 1998 ) , our factorial manipulation of word frequency provides a novel test of the serial-attention hypothesis .
Specifically , if the serial hypothesis is correct , then lexical decision responses and eye-movement measures should be influenced only by the frequency of the attended words and not the fre- quency of the spatially colocated but unattended ( i.e. , distractor ) words .
Such results would suggest that atten- tion is allocated to individual words in an object-based manner .
The theoretical implications of this conclusion will be examined in the General Discussion .
Experiment 1 Method Participants .
A total of 18 native-Chinese-speaking undergraduate students ( 8 males , 10 females ) from Sun Yat-sen University were paid 20 yuan for their participa- tion .
All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision ( includ- ing no color blindness ) , were naive to the purpose of the experiment , and provided informed consent prior to the start of the experiment .
Materials and design .
On each trial , participants were instructed to attend to and make lexical decisions about a two-character target word or nonword that spatially overlapped another ( unattended ) two-character distractor 280 Liu , Reichle word ( see Fig .
1a ) .
Characters were rendered in Song 100 font .
Each character subtended about 3° of visual angle , and each pair of characters was diagonally offset by about 0.5° of visual angle .
Both the color of the attended charac- ter pairs ( i.e. , red vs. green ) and the color of the unat- tended characters ( i.e. , red on green or vice versa ) were counterbalanced across participants .
The experiment con- sisted of 256 trials , half requiring “ yes ” responses ( if the two characters were a word ) and half requiring “ no ” responses ( if the two characters were a nonword ) .
The 128 word trials were constructed using a 2 ( target-word fre- quency : high vs. low ) × 2 ( distractor-word frequency : high vs. low ) within-subjects design , crossing 64 high- and low- frequency target words with 64 high- and low-frequency distractor words .
Table 1 shows the mean frequency and complexity ( i.e. , number of strokes per character ) of the words and the complexity of the nonwords .
The latter were generated by combining two Chinese characters that do not constitute a two-character word .
The experiment was preceded by 20 practice trials , and trial order was completely random for each participant .
Apparatus and procedure .
Participants were tested individually in a normally lit room .
Stimuli were dis- played against a black background on a 27-in .
LED video monitor ( Model PG27AQ , ASUS , Beitou District , Taipei , Taiwan ; resolution = 2,560 × 1,440 pixels , refresh rate = 144 Hz ) driven by a Dell computer .
Each trial started with a white fixation cross displayed in the center of the moni- tor for 500 ms , which was then replaced by a stimulus .
Participants were asked to make a lexical decision about the upper-left character pair by pressing either the “ f ” ( for words ) or “ j ” ( for nonwords ) on the keyboard , which also terminated the trial .
The next trial started 1,000 ms later .
Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible .
Results To determine whether target- or distractor-word frequency influenced the rate or accuracy of target-word processing , we analyzed response time and accuracy using general- ized linear mixed-effects models .

For purposes of illustration , the target and distractor words in ( b ) are indicated , respectively , by solid and dashed rectangles , and the stimuli are rendered on a white—rather than black—background .
Object-Based Attention in Reading 281 distractor-word frequency , and their interaction were entered as fixed-effects factors for word trials , but only distractor-word frequency was entered for nonword trials .
Response times were log-transformed prior to analysis .
To maximize the generalizability of our analyses , we cre- ated models that used a maximal random-effects structure ; however , the models fail to converge because of overpa- rameterization ( Barr , Levy , Scheepers , & Tily , 2013 ) .
There- fore , we generated a parsimonious random-effects structure using iterative reduction of insignificant random- effects components from the maximal random-effects models , resulting in a parsimonious random-effects struc- ture including significant variance and covariance com- ponents for participants , items , the different slopes of fixed effects for each participant and item , and their cor- relations ( see Bates , Kliegl , Vasishth , & Baayen , 2015 , for details ) .
Our results were robust regardless of which random-effects structure was used .
The models were fitted using the lme4 package ( Version 1.1-14 ; Pinheiro & Bates , 2000 ) in R ( Version 3.4.2 ; R Core Team , 2017 ) .
The degrees of freedom and p values were estimated using the lmerTest package ( Version 2.0-33 ; Kuznetsova , Brockhoff , & Christensen , 2013 ) .
As can been seen by inspecting mean response time ( Table 2 ) and the linear mixed-effects models ( Table 3 ) for word trials , only target-word frequency influenced response times : Responses were faster for high- frequency targets ( M = 713 and 719 ms for the high- and low-frequency-distractor conditions , respectively ) than for low-frequency targets ( M = 825 and 797 ms for the high- and low-frequency-distractor conditions , respec- tively ) , b = −0.12 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = [ −0.17 , −0.08 ] , SE = 0.02 , t ( 30.56 ) = −5.80 , p < .001 .
Neither the effect of distractor-word frequency ( p = .383 ) nor its interaction with target-word frequency ( p = .327 ) was significant .
And for nonword trials , response times did not differ significantly between high- and low- frequency-distractor conditions ( M = 858 and 864 ms , respectively ; p = .863 ) .
As can also be seen in Tables 2 and 3 , for word tri- als , only target-word frequency influenced response accuracy : Accuracy was higher for high-frequency targets ( M = .97 and .96 for the high- and low-frequency- distractor conditions , respectively ) than for low-frequency targets ( M = .86 and .90 for the high- and low-frequency distractor conditions , respectively ) , b = 1.49 , 95 % CI = [ 0.82 , Table 1 .

Neither the effect of distractor frequency ( p = .550 ) nor its interaction with target-word frequency ( p = .244 ) was significant .
And for nonword trials , accuracy did not differ significantly between high- and low-frequency-distractor conditions ( M = .95 and .94 ms , respectively ; p = .228 ) .
Experiment 2 Experiment 1 showed that the time and accuracy when processing an attended stimulus were influenced only by the frequency of that word and not the frequency of a spatially colocated distractor word .
This finding suggests that participants can fully comply with instruc- tions and attend to a single word—even if that word happens to overlap almost completely with another word .
To examine whether this finding generalizes to natural sentence reading , we conducted an eye- movement experiment in which participants were instructed to read one of two spatially overlapping sentences containing target and distractor words that—as in Experiment 1—could be either high or low frequency .
Method Participants .
A total of 30 native-Chinese-speaking undergraduate students ( 12 males , 18 females ) from Sun Yat-sen University were paid 20 yuan for their participa- tion .
All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision ( including no color blindness ) , were naive to the purpose of this experiment ( e.g. , none had participated in Experiment 1 ) , and gave informed consent prior to the start of the experiment .
Materials and design .
This experiment used the same 2 ( target-word frequency : high vs. low ) × 2 ( distractor- word frequency : high vs. low ) within-subjects design as Experiment 1 .
Target words consisted of 160 pairs of high-frequency ( M = 120.71 per million , SD = 95.02 ) and low-frequency ( M = 2.10 per million , SD = 1.50 ) two- character words , with one word of either type embedded ( near the center ) within 1 of 160 sentences .
The distractor words also consisted of 160 pairs of high-frequency ( M = 133.73 per million , SD = 107.62 ) and low-frequency ( M = 2.19 per million , SD = 1.35 ) two-character words , with one word of either type embedded ( near the center ) within 1 of another set of 160 sentences .
The two sen- tences composing each target-distractor pair were the same length and were matched for naturalness of mean- ing across all four conditions by 16 additional partici- pants ( all ps > .15 ) .
Cloze norms from an additional 19 participants also indicated that all target and distractor words were completely unpredictable from their preced- ing sentences ( i.e. , no word was predicted by any partici- pant ) .
As Figure 1b shows , stimuli were rendered in Song 30 font ( each character subtending approximately 1° of visual angle ) .
On each trial , a distractor-word sentence was diagonally offset ( to the lower right ) from a target- word sentence by approximately 0.25° of visual angle .

Object-Based Attention in Reading 283 Sentences were rendered in orange and green to control luminance .
The location of the attended sentence ( upper vs. lower ) , its color ( orange vs. green ) , and the sentence “ layering ” ( i.e. , orange on green or vice versa ) was coun- terbalanced across participants .
Apparatus and procedure .
Stimuli were displayed against a black background on a 27-in .
LED monitor iden- tical to that used in Experiment 1 .
Stimulus presentation was controlled by an OpenGL-based Psychophysics Tool- box-3 , which incorporates the EyeLink Toolbox exten- sions ( Cornelissen , Peters , & Palmer , 2002 ) in MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) .
Eye movements were recorded using an EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker ( SR Research , Kanata , Ontario , Canada ) sampling at a 1,000- Hz rate .
Viewing was binocular , but eye-movement data were collected only from the right eye .
Participants were given task instructions on arriving at the lab and then seated approximately 58 cm from the video monitor .
A chin and forehead rest was used to minimize head movements .
An initial three-point calibration and validation procedure was performed until the maximal error was less than 0.4° of visual angle , and recalibration and revalidation was conducted as necessary .
During the experiment , participants first read 16 practice sentences ( excluded from analysis ) and then read the 160 experimental sentences in random order .
Each trial consisted of a drift check in the middle of the screen followed by a fixation box ( 1° × 1° , the size of a single character ) at the location of the first character of the sentence .
If the initial fixation did not register in the box or the drift check indicated more than a 0.4° error , then the participant was recalibrated ; otherwise , a sentence appeared , which participants read silently for comprehension , terminating the trial using a button box .
Participants also used the button box to answer a comprehension question that occurred after half of the sentences and to start the next trial .
Results Accuracy .
Mean sentence-comprehension accuracy was 96 % , and there were no differences across conditions ( all ps > .14 ) .
Eye-movement measures .
Approximately 3.4 % of trials were removed because an eyeblink occurred during a fixa- tion on , immediately before , or immediately after the target- word region .
This region consisted of the union of the target- and distractor word “ envelope ” because the goal was to determine whether the frequency of the distractor words influenced fixation durations on the target words .
Our analyses of these regions were based on four standard eye-movement measures : ( a ) first-fixation duration , or the duration of the initial fixation on the target word during first-pass reading ; ( b ) gaze duration , or the sum of all first- pass fixations on the target word ; ( c ) total viewing time , or the sum of all fixations on the target word ; and ( d ) fixation position , or the location of the initial fixations on the target words ( measured from the left edge of the first character ) during first-pass reading .
Finally , to test for possible parafoveal- on-foveal effects , we analyzed the duration of last first-pass fixation on pretarget words as a function of both target and distractor word frequency .
All fixation-duration measures were log-transformed and , as in Experiment 1 , analyzed using linear mixed-effects models with target-word frequency , distractor-word frequency , and their interaction as predictor variables .
These models were also analyzed using the same random-effects structure as in Experiment 1 .
As can be seen by inspecting the mean fixation- duration measures ( see Table 4 ) and the linear mixed- effects models ( see Table 5 ) , all three fixation-duration measures on targets exhibited a similar pattern .
First- fixation durations were shorter on high- than low- frequency target words , b = −0.05 , 95 % CI = [ −0.07 , −0.02 ] , SE = 0.01 , t ( 87.09 ) = −3.68 , p < .001 , as were gaze durations , b = −0.08 , 95 % CI = [ −0.12 , −0.05 ] , SE = 0.02 , t ( 148.52 ) = −5.17 , p < .001 , and total viewing times , b = −0.13 , 95 % CI = [ −0.17 , −0.09 ] , SE = 0.02 , t ( 72.78 ) = −6.11 , p < .001 .
In addition , neither the effect of distractor-word frequency ( all ps > .493 ) nor its inter- action with target-word frequency ( all ps > .584 ) was significant .
Moreover , fixation position exhibited a pat- tern reported previously ( e.g. , Liu , Reichle , & Li , 2016 ) , being further to the right on high- than low-frequency target words , b = 0.06 , 95 % CI = [ 0.01 , 0.10 ] , SE = 0.02 , t ( 27.94 ) = 2.59 , p = .015 , but showing no effect of distractor-word frequency ( p = .366 ) or Target-Word Frequency × Distractor-Word Frequency interaction ( p = .316 ) .
Finally , consistent with the findings of Ma , Li , and Rayner ( 2015 ) , there were no parafoveal-on- foveal effects : The duration of the last fixation on the pretarget word was not influenced by the frequencies of target words and distractor words or their interaction ( all ps > .226 ) .
These results collectively show that only the frequency of the attended target words influenced when and where the eyes moved during sentence reading .
General Discussion In this article , we examined attention allocation during reading using two novel experiments inspired by Duncan ( 1984 ) —experiments wherein participants attended to and lexically processed one of two spatially colocated words .
Experiment 1 showed conclusively that the speed and accuracy of lexical decisions were influenced only by the frequency of the attended target word and 284 Liu , Reichle not the unattended distractor word .
Experiment 2 like- wise showed that fixation times and positions on target words during sentence reading were modulated only by target-word frequencies .
Together , these results sug- gest that attention can be allocated to one of two spa- tially colocated words .
We will now speculate about why this might be true .
In both experiments , our measures of target-word processing time were influenced only by the frequen- cies of those words , consistent with the serial-attention hypothesis .
The failure to observe distractor-word fre- quency effects or Target-Word Frequency × Distractor- Word Frequency interactions is also inconsistent with the attention-gradient hypothesis ( e.g. , SWIFT ; Engbert Table 4 .

Object-Based Attention in Reading 285 et al. , 2005 ) ; according to such accounts , distractor- word processing should draw attention resources away from target-word processing , resulting in an interaction between the two variables.1 This predicted interaction , which is a direct consequence of the assumption that attention is a limited resource that can be allocated only to a small number of words or letters , does not reflect the precise shape of the attention gradient ( e.g. , a linear vs. nonlinear distribution of attention ; see Liu , Reichle , & Gao , 2013 ) .
Our results therefore support a strong version of the serial-attention hypothesis—one in which , at any time , attention is allocated to only one word , even if that word is spatially colocated with another word .
Of course , one might ask whether other aspects of eye-movement behavior , such as where saccades are directed during reading , might shed light on the serial- versus-parallel debate .
Although much is known about saccadic programming and its relation to attention ( e.g. , covert attention probably shifts to locations of impend- ing saccade targets ; Deubel & Schneider , 1996 ) , saccade targeting will not be likely to inform the debate because both serial-attention ( e.g. , E-Z Reader ; Reichle et al. , 2012 ) and parallel-attention models make similar assump- tions about saccade targeting—that saccades are directed toward the centers of word “ targets ” using peripheral visual information ( i.e. , blank spaces demarcating word boundaries ) .2 Thus , although our observed target-word frequency effects on fixation positions might seemingly favor serial-attention models , they are probably also con- sistent with parallel-attention models .
Although neither E-Z Reader nor SWIFT were explic- itly designed to explain the admittedly artificial situation of reading one of two spatially colocated sentences , the demonstration that attention can be allocated completely to one of two colocated words is naturally concordant with the core assumption of serial-attention models such as E-Z Reader ( Reichle , 2011 ) .
In contrast , although the “ zoom-lens ” assumption of SWIFT ( Schad & Engbert , 2012 ) might conceivably allow it to explain our results by adopting the assumption that readers focus their attention on individual words in a serial manner , this account amounts to making the parallel-attention model a serial one .
The main findings of our experiments , in combination with the lack of evidence for lexical para- foveal-on-foveal effects in Experiment 2 , are thus more parsimoniously explained by the assumption that readers attend to and process words in a serial manner .
Finally , it is worth speculating about how an object- based view of attention might be reconciled with serial- attention theories of attention allocation in reading , especially given that the reported experiments were conducted in Chinese—a writing system that does not demarcate word boundaries .
According to Duncan ’ s ( 1984 ) original conception , visual objects are identified in two stages : a preattentive stage , in which the features in the visual field are segmented into objects , followed by an attentive stage , in which individual objects are identified ( Chen , 2012 ; Ciaramitaro et al. , 2011 ) .
This view is consistent with the interpretation of word iden- tification offered by the E-Z Reader model ( see Reichle , 2011 ) if words are conceptualized as visual objects .
In the context of reading alphabetic languages such as English , this conceptualization is intuitive because indi- vidual words are demarcated by blank spaces , effectively rendering each word as a distinct visual object .
This may be more complex in languages such as Chinese , how- ever , because individual words are not separated by boundaries but must instead be segmented from con- tinuous lines of characters ( Zang , Liversedge , Bai , & Yan , 2011 ) .
This segmentation may be linked to word identification through a highly interactive process whereby the activation of candidate lexical representa- tions constrains earlier stages of visual processing ( e.g. , segmentation ) , delimiting the number of characters that probably constitute any given attended word ( Li , Rayner , & Cave , 2009 ) , but possibly resulting in some informa- tion leaking in from spatially adjacent characters .
Although this leakage hypothesis was not directly examined in the present research , it suggests that atten- tion allocation is more complex than traditionally acknowledged .
With writing systems having word boundaries and many short words ( e.g. , English ) , atten- tion may be very well approximated by serial-attention models .
However , with writing systems lacking clear word boundaries ( e.g. , Chinese ) or containing many long , polymorphemic words ( e.g. , Finnish ) , we suspect that this might be less true , with some amount of leak- age from spatially adjacent characters or morphemes resulting from the requirement to segment and identify spatially contiguous strings of characters or morphemes .
However , even with the possibility that attention control is imperfect , readers probably attempt to allocate atten- tion in a serial manner to the maximal extent possible in the service of identifying meaningful units .

This is how SWIFT accounts for the reduced word N + 1 pre- view typically observed when the difficulty of processing word N increases ( Henderson & Ferreira , 1990 ) .

In nonspaced writing systems such as Chinese , saccade length is also modulated by lexical processing difficulty ( Liu , Huang , Gao , & Reichle , 2017 ; Liu , Reichle , & Li , 2015 , 2016 ) .
