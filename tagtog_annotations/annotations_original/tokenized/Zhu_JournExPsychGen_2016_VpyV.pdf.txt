BRIEF REPORT Once Failed , Twice Shy : How Group-Based Competition Influences Risk Preference in Young Children Yi Zhu , Jiajie Wang , and Xiaofeng Lv Southwestern University of Finance and Economics Yansong Li Nanjing University and The Research Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences of Jiangsu Province , China Recent developmental research demonstrates that young children tend to be risk-seeking .
However , very little is known about the extent to which such a capacity varies with children ’ s group-based experience .
Given that between-group competition is a central feature of human social life , this study aimed at examining the influence of group-based competition over risk preference in young children .
In total , 234 children from 3 age groups ( 2– 4-year-olds , 5– 6-year-olds , and 8 –9-year-olds ) engaged in an intergroup competition manipulation , which was followed by a prosocial game assessing children ’ s ingroup egalitarianism and a gambling task measuring children ’ s risk preference .
We found that children in the intergroup competition condition tended to be risk-averse compared with those who were in the nonintergroup competition condition .
Furthermore , we found that an aversion to risk in the intergroup competition condition was driven by such an aversion observed in children from the losing group .
In addition , we found a positive relationship between ingroup egalitarianism and risk preference in children from the winning group rather than those from the losing group .
Together , our results contribute to the understanding of the effects of group-based experience on children ’ s risk preference and may have important implications for understanding individuals ’ risky decisions .
Keywords : risk preference , ingroup egalitarianism , young children , intergroup competition , group identification Many human behaviors , from mating , food acquisition , to job seeking and business transaction , entail some degree of risk .
Risk preference refers to one ’ s tendency to choose between a risky option and a safe option of an equal expected value ( e.g. , choosing between a sure gain of ¥15 and a 50:50 chance of gaining either ¥30 or nothing ) .
Considering risk preference has deep roots in human life span development , considerable empirical effort has been devoted to the question of how an individual ’ s risk preference changes across development .
One developmental phase that has received much attention in recent years is that of childhood , due in part to the fact that explicit representations of various psycholog- ical capacities can be accessed during this period ( Bigler & Liben , 2006 ) and also to the fact that childhood adversity is associated with a heightened risk of health and social problems ( McCrory , De Brito , & Viding , 2012 ) .
Earlier developmental science literature suggests that young children make more risky choices ( Harbaugh , Krause , & Vesterlund , 2002 ; Levin & Hart , 2003 ) and are more influenced by the probability of winning than adults ( Harbaugh et al. , 2002 ) .
Recent developmental research has further shown that risk seeking increases in childhood ( Levin , Weller , Peder- son , & Harshman , 2007 ; Rakow & Rahim , 2010 ; Weller , Levin , & Denburg , 2011 ) .
For example , 8 –11 year-olds tend to accept risk more often than 5– 6 year-olds ( Levin et al. , 2007 ) and with increasing risk , children are risk-seeking , while adults and adolescents are risk-averse ( Paulsen , Platt , Huettel , & Brannon , 2012 ) .
Although evidence for the development of risk preference in childhood is growing , very little is known about the extent to which this capacity varies with children ’ s group-based experience , given that risk preference is generally confronted by an individual embedded in a social group rather than by a single individual in our real life situations ( Masclet , Colombier , Denant-Boemont , & Lohéac , 2009 ; Shupp & Williams , 2008 ) .
It has been revealed that the interactions between two unitary groups are more competitive than the interactions between two individuals ( Schopler & Insko , 1992 ) .
Between-group competition is therefore thought to be a ubiquitous social context in human society ( Stein , 1976 ) .
Devel- opmental research demonstrates that children ’ s perception of com- petition emerges in early childhood ( Gratch , 1964 ; Priewasser , Roessler , & Perner , 2013 ) .
Moreover , competitiveness is natural among young children ( Friedman , 2013 ) .
This then raises an important open question of whether children ’ s risk preference may Yi Zhu , Jiajie Wang , and Xiaofeng Lv , International Business School , Southwestern University of Finance and Economics ; Yansong Li , Depart- ment of Psychology , School of Social and Behavioural Sciences , Nanjing University , and The Research Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences of Jiangsu Province , China .

To address this issue , we designed an experiment in which three age groups ( 2–4-year-olds , 5–6-year-olds , and 8–9-year-olds ) en- gaged in an intergroup competition manipulation involving an intergroup competition task and a nonintergroup competition task .
This was followed by a prosocial game involving a choice between 1/1 option and 1/0 option and a gambling task involving a choice between a risky option and a safe option of an equal expected value .
Based on arguments that young children tend to think in terms of winning and is generally characterized by must-win ways ( Friedman , 2013 ) , we could expect that failure in the between- group competition would decrease children ’ s tendency to make risky choices .
Method Participants There were 234 native Chinese-speaking children recruited in the present study .
Our sample size was based on previous research ( Fehr , Bernhard , & Rockenbach , 2008 ) , but final sample size was further determined by the number of parents provided consent as well as the number of children who attended classes .
The partic- ipants were divided into three age groups : 60 children ( 29 boys and 31 girls ) aged 2 to 4 ( M 40.03 months , SD 5.713 ) , 78 children ( 39 boys and 38 girls ) aged 5 to 6 ( M 68.03 months , SD 4.904 ) , and 96 children ( 52 boys and 44 girls ) aged 8 to 9 ( M 106.06 months , SD 5.028 ) .
Data from five participants in the prosocial game were excluded because of either experimenter errors ( n 3 ) or teachers ’ presence ( n 2 ) .
Furthermore , data from one participant in the gambling task was excluded because of his failure in following the instructions .
The two younger age groups were recruited from a kindergarten and the older age group was recruited from a primary school in Chengdu , China .
Because participants were under 18 years old , informed consents were obtained from their parents .
The study was approved by the ethics committees of the two schools .
Experimental Procedures Intergroup competition manipulation .
Upon arrival at the waiting room , six participants of each age group were randomly assigned to two equal-sized groups .
Each participant was then provided with either a blue or purple ribbon that was tied to his or her right arm according to which group they belonged to ( either a blue group or a purple group ) .
After both groups were escorted to the same experimental room by experimenters , they were told that they would be involved in an intergroup competition task .
Our experimental protocol concerning the intergroup competi- tion manipulation was similar to the one used in a previous study ( Zhu , Guan , & Li , 2015 ) , which includes the intergroup competi- tion task and the nonintergroup competition task .
Before the in- tergroup competition task , experimenters explained the rule of the task to participants and showed the prize ( a box of Cartoon Jellies ) that a winning group would get .
The explanation was repeated when necessary to ensure that participants fully understood it .
Then , each group was led by an experimenter to a table separately in the same room .
The two tables were 6 m away from each other .
On each table , there were three spoons and two containers ( one contained 30 ping-pong balls and the other was empty ; between- container distance was 40 cm ) .
During intergroup competition task , members of each group engaged in their teamwork simulta- neously in which each member transferred ping-pong balls with a spoon from one container to the other within 20 s. Both groups engaged in such tasks simultaneously .
The experimenters were present during the task and recorded the total number of balls successfully transferred by all members of each group .
When intergroup competition was completed , these two groups were identified to be either a winning or a losing group according to outcomes of the between-groups rivalry .
Finally , each member of the winning group was rewarded a piece of Cartoon Jelly in front of members from the losing group who received no reward .
By contrast , treatment in the nonintergroup competition task was identical to the intergroup competition task described above with one exception—no intergroup competition manipulation was involved .
No information about outcomes of the between-groups competition or the prize was delivered to each group in this control group .
Furthermore , to control for the potential implicit competi- tion arising from the observation on other group ’ s performance , neither group were allowed to observe each other ’ s performance .
Ingroup bias measurement .
After the intergroup competition task , we used a so-called “ prosocial game ” to measure children ’ s ingroup preference to confirm that our intergroup competition manipulation succeeded in creating ingroup bias .
The prosocial game has been demonstrated to be suitable for measuring ingroup bias in young children ( Fehr et al. , 2008 ) .
Specifically , each child was asked to choose between the option ( 1,1 ) —one bar of choc- olate for herself and one for a partner—and the option ( 1,0 ) —one for herself and non for a partner .
Participants engaged in two prosocial games in which the partner was either from their own group or from the competing group .
In this game , the option ( 1,1 ) could increase the partner ’ s welfare at no cost to themselves , thereby comparing such egalitarian choices toward ingroup and outgroup partners could allow us to check the validity of our intergroup manipulation .
In addition , children ’ s egalitarian choices toward their ingroup partners allowed for assessing ingroup egalitarianism , which has been argued to be an impor- tant index of individuals ’ ingroup attitudes ( Rutland , Killen , & Abrams , 2010 ) .
Risk preference measurement .
To measure children ’ s risk preference , we used a simplified version of gambling task in which children were asked to choose between a sure small prize and equal chances of winning a larger prize or no prize ( see Figure 1 ) .
This task is similar to the one described in previous work that has been demonstrated to be especially suitable for measuring risk preference in young children ( Levin & Hart , 2003 ) .
Before this task , only children under the intergroup competition condition were asked about their group performance ( i.e. , winning or losing ) to elicit their intergroup competition experience .
Then , they made a choice between Option A ( a certain win of one prize ) and Option B ( 50 % chance of winning two prizes or no prize ) .
All prizes were wrapped in a yellow bag .
Participants were instructed not to open the prizes until they left the classroom , and not to interact with other participants when they finished the gambling task to prevent possible prior knowledge effects .

398 ZHU , WANG , LV , AND LI Results Manipulation Check for Group Induction We first checked the validity of our group induction .
A logistic regression analysis predicting children ’ s egalitarian choices in the prosocial game as a function of partner memberships ( outgroup 0 , ingroup 1 ) , controlling for competitive outcomes , gender , and age groups , showed a highly significant difference in the egalitar- ian choice ( 1,1 ) between ingroup and outgroup partners across all age groups ( .96 , p .001 , odds ratio [ OR ] 2.62 ) .
This suggests that participants are more willing to share resources with ingroup partners than out-group partners , thereby confirming the validity of our group induction .
Effects of intergroup competitive outcomes on children ’ s ingroup egalitarianism .
We next asked whether competitive outcomes affected children ’ s ingroup preference .
A logistic regres- sion predicting children ’ s egalitarian choices as a function of competitive outcomes ( losing 0 , winning 1 , nonintergroup competition 2 ) , controlling for gender and age groups , showed a significantly positive effect of competitive outcomes ( winning vs. losing : 1.33 , p .05 , OR 3.79 ; nonintergroup compe- tition vs. losing : 1.44 , p .02 , OR 4 .
20 ) .
This indicated that children from the losing group ( n 60 ) exhibited weaker ingroup identification than those from the winning ( n 61 ) and control groups ( n 107 ; Figure 2a ) .
There was also a significantly positive age group effect ( 1.07 , p .006 , OR 2.90 ) , implying that children ’ s ingroup egalitarianism increased with age .
However , we did not find a significant effect of gender ( .09 , p .25 , OR .92 ) .
Effects of intergroup competition on children ’ s risk preference .
We found that children under the intergroup com- petition condition ( 80.0 % ) were more likely to shun away from risk than those who were under the nonintergroup competition condition ( 90.7 % ) .
Our subsequent analysis showed that children who lost the intergroup competition were less likely to choose risky choices than those who won the intergroup competition ( risky choices : 68.3 % vs. 90.7 % ) , while percentage of risky choices observed in the winning group was similar to that observed in the control group ( risky choices : 91.9 % vs. 90.7 % ) .
Our logistic regression analysis revealed a highly significant main effect of competitive outcomes on risky choices when con- trolling for age groups and sex ( winning vs. losing : 1.78 , p .002 , OR 5.60 ; nonintergroup competition vs. losing : 1.49 , p .001 , OR 4.45 ) ( Figure 2b ) .
This further suggests that children who lost the intergroup competition tended to be risk- aversive compared with those who were from the other two groups .
Moreover , to test for age and sex effects , we conducted two separate logistic regressions on risky choices as a function of age and sex .
We found a significantly positive age effect ( .95 , p .001 , OR 2.60 ) , indicating that children ’ s risk-seeking increases with age .
However , we did not find a significantly effect of sex ( .34 , p .250 , OR .71 ) , suggesting that the effects observed above were similar across sex groups .
Relationship between ingroup egalitarianism and risk preference .
Three separate logistic regressions predicting risk preference ( risky choices 1 , nonrisky choices 0 ) as a function of ingroup egalitarianism ( egalitarian choices 1 , nonegalitarian choices 0 ) were conducted to examine the link between ingroup egalitarianism and risk preference in each of three groups ( the winning , losing , or control groups ) .
We found a significantly positive relationship between ingroup egalitarianism and risk pref- erence in both the winning and control groups ( the winning group : 1.50 , p .05 , OR 4.50 ; the control group : 2.02 , p .007 , OR 7.50 ) .
However , such a relationship was not signifi- cant in the losing group ( .77 , p .12 , OR 2.17 ) , implying that such a relationship is sensitive to group status .
Discussion In this study , we examined the influence of the between-group competition over risk preference in young children .
We found that children in the intergroup competition condition tended to be risk-averse compared with those who were in the noncompetition condition .
Our subsequent analysis showed that this competition- Figure 1 .

On the left side of the table were three white dishes ( diameter 16 cm ) representing two options—Option A for a sure small prize ( a dish containing 1 piece of cookie ) and Option B for a gamble with equal probability of winning a larger prize ( a dish containing two pieces of cookies ) or nothing ( an empty dish ) .
On the right side of the table was a nontransparent jar containing five yellow balls ( in white ) and five green balls ( in gray ) .
Those who chose Option B were asked to pick a ball from the jar—a green ball for a larger prize and a yellow ball for zero prize .

399COMPETITION AND RISK PREFERENCE IN YOUNG CHILDREN induced risk aversion was driven by a dramatic decrease in risky decisions made by children from the losing group , indicating that children in the losing group tend to be risk-averse relative to those from the other two groups .
Consistent with previous findings ( Nesdale & Flesser , 2001 ; Yee & Brown , 1992 ) , our results imply that young children are sensitive to group status .
Moreover , these findings go beyond them .
Prior literature demonstrates that a single young child was insensitive to gain or loss task framing ( Reyna & Ellis , 1994 ) , whereas our observations suggest that they were instead sensitive to the group-based loss .
More important , accord- ing to a dual system model ( Steinberg , 2010 ) , individuals ’ risky decisions reflect an imbalance or a dynamic competition between self-control and impulsivity .
One possible explanation for the modulating effects of the between-groups competition on risk preference in young children is that the failure experience may enhance children ’ s self-control capacity , which subsequently makes them shun away from risky options so that they could avoid losing once again .
This actually underscores the need to consider the modulating role of group-based experience in the development of risk preference in children ( Defoe , Dubas , Figner , & van Aken , 2015 ) .
A body of literature demonstrates that intergroup competition reduces the within-group conflict and positively affect the coop- eration levels ( Bornstein , Gneezy , & Nagel , 2002 ) as well as ingroup identification ( Tajfel & Turner , 1979 ) .
Strong ingroup identification is thought to reduce uncertainty ( Hogg , 2007 ) be- cause peers as the source of social support serve as “ cushion ” in the case of losses ( Hsee & Weber , 1999 ) .
This “ cushion effect ” suggests a positive relationship between ingroup identification and risk preference .
Our results confirm it by showing a significantly positive relationship between ingroup egalitarianism and risk pref- erence in the winning group .
However , such a relationship was relatively weak in the losing group .
It has been revealed that negative information ( e.g. , losing ) about the group performance would reduce the ingroup liking ( Bigler , Brown , & Markell , 2001 ; Nesdale & Flesser , 2001 ) and the failure in group-based compe- tition impairs young children ’ s self-evaluation and performance in the subsequent task ( Rhodes & Brickman , 2008 ) .
As a result , one possible explanation for the weak predictive power of ingroup egalitarianism in the losing group may reflect these negative consequences .
Further clarification on this issue requires future studies exploring the role of emotion induced by the between- groups competitive outcomes in risk preference , because emotions often drive people ’ s decision away from cognitive assessment of risky situations ( Loewenstein , Weber , Hsee , & Welch , 2001 ) .
Additionally , consistent with prior findings ( Fehr et al. , 2008 ) , we found that parochial egalitarianism was already present in early childhood and increased with age ( an ingroup-outgroup gap : 5.3 % of 2–4-year-olds , 13 % of 5–6-year-olds , and 23.4 % of 8–9-year- olds ) .
Moreover , the age-related decrease in sensitivity of ingroup egalitarianism to competitive outcomes ( a win-loss gap : 30.6 % of 2–4-year-olds , 12.6 % of 5–6-year-olds , and 0.5 % of 8–9-year- olds ) may reflect the fact that older children are less sensitive to negative feedback ( Humphreys et al. , 2015 ) and more matured to consider efforts and merits than younger children ( Almås , Cap- pelen , Sørensen , & Tungodden , 2010 ) .
Finally , the present study is not without any limitations .
We found that older children tended to be risk-seeking compared with younger children .
Because we did not manipulate reward proba- bilities associated with risky choices , it is still unclear whether the effect we see regarding the greater preference for risky options in older children , regardless of experimental conditions , is a function of understanding probabilities better than younger children—a 50/50 chance of a high reward outcome is a pretty good chance—or if intergroup competition condition does not modulate risk preference in older children .
Moreover , a closely related issue is that we only offered one shot gambling task , making it difficult to ascertain whether and how risk preference unfolds as a function of age and group-based competition .
Building on these consider- ations , we believe that it is important to take them into account in future studies ( e.g. , including more trials with varied risk proba- bilities ( e.g. , 33 % or 10 % ) .
In summary , we explored the extent to which risk preference varies with group-based competition in young children .
We found that the failure experience during intergroup competition would make children show weaker preferences for risky choices .
Our findings endorse a view that between-groups experience can shape children ’ s risky decisions and may stimulate more empirical and theoretical work on this topic in future studies .
