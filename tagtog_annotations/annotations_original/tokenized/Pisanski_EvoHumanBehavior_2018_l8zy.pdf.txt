Yet , despite dramatic changes in women 's sex hormone levels and bodies during and after pregnancy , previous be- tween-subject and case studies have not found systematic changes in F0 due to pregnancy .
Here , we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers ' voices during their first pregnancy , as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum .
Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control .
Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean , range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers , controlling for age at time of recording , whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls .
Mothers ' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before .
These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing .
Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy , mothers ' F0 parameters re- verted after the first year postpartum , approaching pre-pregnancy levels .
Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinizing effect on women 's voices .
1 .
Introduction Nonverbal properties of the human voice , particularly fundamental frequency ( F0 , perceived as voice pitch ) , correlate with a range of physical traits and behaviours , and predict individual differences in reproductive and social success ( Pisanski and Bryant , 2018 ; Puts et al. , 2016 ) .
Fundamental frequency is more sexually dimorphic in humans than in any other great ape ( Puts et al. , 2016 ) .
This sex difference emerges following a pubertal surge in the androgen levels of adolescent boys that masculinizes the larynx , lengthening and thickening the male vocal folds and resulting in a voice pitch that is around 75 % lower in adult men than women ( Titze , 1989 ) .
Fundamental frequency also varies considerably within the sexes .
Numerous studies , focusing mostly on men , have linked individual differences in men 's F0 to testosterone levels , facial masculinity , social dominance , and number of sex partners ( Pisanski and Bryant , 2018 for review ) .
There is therefore strong con- sensus that low F0 has been sexually selected in men to communicate threat potential and mate quality ( Puts et al. , 2016 ) , and constitutes a secondary sex characteristic ( Feinberg , 2008 ) .
Women 's voices , while comparatively less studied , also appear to communicate reproductive potential and fertility , and predict men 's mate preferences .
Men show preferences for indices of femininity and youth in women 's traits , including high mean F0 in women 's voices , presumably because these traits suggest a woman is of reproductive age and potentially fecund ( Pisanski and Feinberg , 2018 ; Puts , Jones , and DeBruine , 2012 for reviews ) .
Vocal attractiveness ratings are highest for women in their 20 's and comparatively low for pre-pubertal and post- menopausal women ( Röder , Fink , and Jones , 2013 ; Wheatley et al. , 2014 ) .
Indeed , cross-sectional and longitudinal studies show that wo- men 's F0 either decreases gradually or stays relatively constant ( barring cyclic fluctuations , see below ) throughout their reproductive years , but consistently report a 10–35 Hz decrease in women 's F0 following me- nopause ( Abitbol , Abitbol , and Abitbol , 1999 ; Amir and Biron-Shental , 2004 ) .
This drop in F0 may be caused by menopausal decreases in es- trogens and increases in androgens resulting in swelling ( edema ) that alters the thickness and mass of the vocal folds ( Derman , 1995 ; Hirano , Kurita , and Nakashima , 1983 ) .
Hormone therapies provide further evidence that testosterone permanently decreases women 's F0 ( Baker , 1999 ) , whereas estrogen injections partially counter postmenopausal decreases in F0 ( Lindholm , Vilkman , Raudaskoski , Suvanto-Luukkonen , and Kauppila , 1997 ) .
Taken together , there is good evidence that a woman 's voice pitch can indicate whether she is of reproductive age .
Studies have also shown intra-individual fluctuations in women 's F0 across the menstrual cycle , suggesting that F0 may indicate cycle-to- cycle changes in fertility .
Acoustic analyses reveal increases in women 's F0 just prior to ovulation ( Fischer et al. , 2011 ) or at peak fertility https : //doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2018.04.002 Received 23 August 2017 ; Received in revised form 3 April 2018 ; Accepted 6 April 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author .

T ( Bryant and Haselton , 2009 ) , and playback studies show covariation between menstrual fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone levels and listeners ' assessments of women 's voice quality ( Çelik et al. , 2013 ) .
Although hormonal contraceptive usage , which stabilizes the cyclical variation in women 's hormone levels , does not appear to predict dif- ferences in women 's mean F0 , lower levels of vocal perturbation among women taking monophasic birth control pills have been attributed to a stable hormonal balance leading to increased regularity in vocal fold vibration ( Amir , Biron-Shental , and Shabtai , 2006 ) .
Indeed , the vocal folds appear particularly sensitive to sex hormone levels which are known to fluctuate throughout the life cycle .
Sex hormones may act on neuromotor control of the larynx ( Higgins and Saxman , 1989 ) or act directly on the vocal fold mucosa that contain specific receptors for androgens , estrogens and progesterone ( Newman , Butler , Hammond , and Gray , 2000 ) .

Does pregnancy affect women 's voice pitch ?
Women 's bodies change dramatically during and immediately fol- lowing pregnancy .
Estrogen , progesterone , testosterone and cortisol levels increase during pregnancy , followed by dramatic decreases fol- lowing parturition ( O'Leary , Boyne , Flett , Beilby , and James , 1991 ; Tan and Tan , 2013 ) .
Changes in anatomy and physiology during pregnancy include Reinke 's edema ( vocal fold swelling ) , decreased lung capacity , and altered respiration patterns ( Speroff and Fritz , 2005 ; Tan and Tan , 2013 ) .
Many women also experience behavioural and psychological changes such as increased fatigue , changes in self-perception or self- presentation ( e.g. , perceived attractiveness and competency ) , and re- duced mating motivation .
These various endocrinological , physical and behavioural changes could affect women 's F0 production during preg- nancy and in the early years of childrearing .
Some singers and actresses have self-reported pregnancy-induced ‘ voice deepening ’ ( e.g. , Abramson et al. , 1984 ) .
In turn , some voice clinicians have warned professional performers that pregnancy may alter their voices ( Alford and Stasney , 2000 ; Brodnitz , 1971 ) , some- times encouraging them not to sing while pregnant ( Sataloff , Emerich , and Hoover , 1997 ) .
Descriptions of laryngopathia gravidarum , an ap- parently permanent lowering of voice frequencies following pregnancy , emerged as early as the 1970 's ( Von Deuster , 1977 ) .
However , no em- pirical study has yet to show evidence of systematic and significant changes in women 's F0 during or after pregnancy .
To our knowledge , six other studies have empirically tested for vocal changes during pregnancy ( Cassiraga , Castellano , Abasolo , Abin , and Izbizky , 2012 ; Hamdan , Mahfoud , Sibai , and Seoud , 2009 ; Hancock and Gross , 2015 ; Lã and Sundberg , 2012 ; Saltürk et al. , 2016 ; Von Deuster , 1977 ) .
Focusing predominantly on mean F0 and other spectral parameters , these studies have used between-subject designs or long- itudinal case studies of a single individual .
Hamdan et al .
( 2009 ) and Cassiraga et al .
( 2012 ) found no differences in mean F0 comparing pregnant women in their third trimester to non-pregnant controls .
However , pregnant women 's F0 increased by 8 Hz within 12 to 24 h of giving birth ( Hamdan et al. , 2009 ) .
Saltürk et al .
( 2016 ) compared three groups of pregnant women , each in a different trimester of pregnancy , to a fourth group of non-pregnant controls and also found no significant group differences in mean F0 .
Finally , Hancock and Gross ( 2015 ) re- corded one woman weekly during the last 30 weeks of her pregnancy and once at 21 weeks postpartum .
The authors reported no systematic changes in mean F0 throughout pregnancy .
None of these studies measured women 's voices before becoming pregnant , and thus lacked a baseline for intra-individual comparison .
Several limitations may have contributed to the null results reported in these previous studies , and we designed our study to specifically address these issues .
First , between-subject designs can introduce con- founds due to demographic differences between pregnant and non- pregnant women , as well as individual differences in their baseline vocal parameters , whereas case studies entirely ignore between-in- dividual variation .
Second , no study has measured women 's voices be- fore conception .
This makes it impossible to know from previous work whether F0 measured during or after pregnancy was different from women 's pre-pregnant ( i.e. , baseline ) levels .
Third , in previous studies , voice measures were taken from scripted speech including vowel sounds and short read passages , rather than free speech that is naturally more variable .
Finally , no study has examined the effect of pregnancy on F0 range ( min and max ) or variation , despite subjective reports on various websites and blogs from singers ( e.g. , C.S. , 2008 ; Gerson , 2013 ) or voice coaches/therapists ( e.g. , Emerich , 2013 ; Gupta , 2018 ) of dif- ficulty reaching high frequencies during or after pregnancy .

Present study Here , we acoustically analysed archival recordings of 20 women experiencing their first pregnancy ( Table S1a ) .
We measured changes in F0 parameters before pregnancy ( 5 years ) , during pregnancy , and after pregnancy ( 5 years ) , and compared this to voice measures taken from 20 age-matched nulliparous controls ( Table S1b ) during corresponding timeframes .
This allowed us to directly test whether mothers ' F0 values decreased during or after pregnancy relative to pre-conception , and by how much , and whether and for how long these voice changes persisted postpartum .
Although this study is the first longitudinal study of its nature , the small sample size ( 20 mothers , 20 controls ) deems it ex- ploratory .
For acoustic analysis , we extracted a total of 634 interview clips ( 277min of audio ) from mothers and controls ( Table S2 ) .
Voice re- cordings of mothers were categorized into 5 phases : long-term pre- pregnancy , short-term pre-pregnancy , pregnancy , ST postpartum and LT postpartum ( Fig .
1 ) , and those of controls were categorized into timeframes corresponding to the pregnancy , ST and LT postpartum phases in mothers .

Timeline and categorization of voice recordings .
Voice recordings were categorized into 5 pregnancy phases spanning approximately 10 years of each mother 's life .
Short-term ( ST ) pre-pregnancy and postpartum phases were one year prior to conception and one year after parturition , respectively , each approx- imating the duration of pregnancy .
The long-term ( LT ) pre-pregnancy and postpartum phases each spanned a period of 4 years before and after the short-term phases , respectively .
The long-term pre-pregnancy phase acted as a within-subject control phase to test whether F0 decreased within-individuals due to ageing prior to having ever conceived a child .
The long-term postpartum phase acted as a recovery phase to test whether changes in F0 were transient or long lasting , and excluded clips during which some women were pregnant with a second child .
As an additional control , data were collected from nulliparous controls during age-matched time- frames corresponding to the pregnancy and postpartum phases of mothers .

We examined only mothers who were pregnant with their first child , analysed multiple long segments of natural free speech , and measured 5 voice pitch parameters : mean ( F0 mean ) , minimum ( F0min ) , maximum ( F0 max ) , standard deviation ( F0 sd ) , and the coefficient of variation ( F0 CV ) using Praat software ( Boersma and Weenink , 2016 ) .

Results 4.1 .
Between-sample comparisons of F0 Linear Mixed Models ( LMMs ) fit by maximum-likelihood estima- tion , including participant identity as a subject variable with random intercept , sample ( mothers , nulliparous controls ) as a fixed factor , and woman 's age at the time of voice recording as a random covariate , showed no significant differences in any F0 parameters between mo- thers and controls collapsing across phases ( all F < 1.3 , all P > 0.271 ) .
This result confirmed that the two samples of age-matched women could effectually be compared .
4.2 .
Within-individual changes in F0 Linear Mixed Models were then used to test for within-individual changes in each F0 parameter across pregnancy phases in mothers and across corresponding timeframes in controls .
Each model included participant identity as a subject variable with random intercept and phase/timeframe as a fixed factor .
To control for the potential effect of ageing on F0 , women 's age at the time of voice recording was included as a random covariate .
Mother 's age at parturition ( childbirth ) , included as a fixed covariate , showed no effect ( all F < 2.9 , all P > 0.103 ) , and the corresponding age of nulliparous controls also showed no effect ( all F < 1.03 , P > 0.323 ) , and was therefore excluded from final models .
Significant effects were further examined using pairwise tests with Šidák correction for multiple comparisons .
In our sample of mothers , residuals were computed for each F0 parameter controlling for parti- cipant identity ( random intercept ) and mother 's age at voice recording ( fixed covariate ) .
This allowed us to plot within-individual changes in F0 across pregnancy phases above and beyond what could be attributed to ageing .
4.2.1 .
Mothers The results of LMMs confirmed that all F0 parameters changed significantly as a function of pregnancy phase among mothers , con- trolling for the mother 's identity and age at the time of voice recording ( Table 1a ) .
Planned pairwise comparisons among pregnancy phases with Šidák correction are shown in Fig .
2a ( see Table S3a for full pairwise com- parison matrix with/without adjusting for multiple comparisons ) .
Among mothers , we observed a decrease in all F0 parameters one year postpartum compared to one year pre-pregnancy ( Fig .
2a : ST Post vs ST Pre ) .
Thus , in the year following the birth of their first child , women 's F0 parameters dropped on average by 14.6 Hz ( F0 mean ) , 13.6 Hz ( F0min ) , a sizeable 43.7 Hz ( F0 max ) , 8 Hz ( F0 sd ) , and 0.022 Hz ( F0 CV ) compared to the year prior to conception .
Women 's F0 mean , max , sd and CV values were also lower one year postpartum compared to during pregnancy ( Fig .
2a : ST Post vs Pregnant ) .
This indicates that women 's voices became relatively lower-pitched and more monotonous after giving birth than during pregnancy or before conception .
Pairwise comparisons further confirmed no significant differences in any F0 parameter between the long-term ( i.e. , within-individual control phase ) and short-term pre-pregnancy phase ( Fig .
2a : LT Pre vs ST Pre ) , indicating that F0 did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing .
Fi- nally , a clear pattern was observed in which mother 's F0 parameters increased or ‘ reverted ’ in the long-term postpartum phase , approaching pre-pregnancy levels .
After adjusting for multiple comparisons ( Table S3a ) , mother 's mean F0 in the long-term postpartum phase was not statistically different than in the year prior to pregnancy ( Fig .
2a : LT Post vs ST Pre ) , and their F0min , max , sd , and CV were not statistically different than in the 5 years prior to pregnancy ( Fig .
2a : LT Post vs LT/ ST Pre ) .
This indicates that mother 's voices , although lower-pitched and more monotonous in the year following pregnancy , increased again to ( age adjusted ) pre-pregnancy levels in the four years following that .
Residuals for each F0 parameter , showing changes in F0 by phase above and beyond the effects of ageing , are plotted in the bottom panel of Fig .
2a .
4.2.2 .
Nulliparous controls For childless women , the results of LMMs controlling for women 's identity and age at the time of voice recording showed no significant changes in any F0 parameter across timeframes ( Table 1b ) .
Thus , in contrast to mothers , the voice pitch of age-matched nulliparous controls remained relatively stable across an average period of 7.5 years , cor- responding to the pregnancy and postpartum phases in mothers ( Fig .
2b ) .
Although temporal changes in nulliparous women 's F0 sd and CV approached significance ( Table 1b ) , no pairwise comparisons reached statistical significance following Šidák correction ( all P > 0.08 ) and the observed trends were in the opposite direction as those found in mothers ( i.e. , F0 sd and CV showed a nonsignificant trend toward increasing over time in nulliparous controls ; see Table S3b for full pairwise comparisons matrix ) .

Discussion The results of this longitudinal study show that women 's average voice pitch , pitch range and pitch variability decrease after giving birth to their first child .
These voice changes endure for at least one year postpartum , later returning to near pre-pregnancy levels controlling for ageing .
Previous between-subject and case studies have focused on voice changes during pregnancy ( Cassiraga et al. , 2012 ; Hamdan et al. , 2009 ; Hancock and Gross , 2015 ; Lã and Sundberg , 2012 ; Saltürk et al. , 2016 ; Von Deuster , 1977 ) .
Here , we show that although women 's voice pitch shows a trend toward lower values during pregnancy , significant decreases in pitch occur after pregnancy , and are transient .

Evolution and Human Behavior 39 ( 2018 ) 457–463 459 observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of age- and profession-matched nulliparous controls , offering further support that the postpartum F0 changes we observed in mothers can not be attributed to age-related F0 variation , or to the women 's line of work .
There are several possible , non-mutually exclusive mechanisms that may help to explain why women 's voices are temporarily masculinized following pregnancy .
Although respiration patterns and lung capacity change during pregnancy ( Gilroy , Mangura , and Lavietes , 1988 ; Tan and Tan , 2013 ) , this is unlikely to explain postpartum voice changes in the year after pregnancy , as lung volume returns to normal within two days of parturition ( Gilroy et al. , 1988 ) .
However , in the months after giving birth , women 's estrogen , progesterone , and cortisol levels de- crease dramatically compared to pregnancy levels .
In addition to po- tentially inducing postpartum depression in some women ( Hendrick , Altshuler , and Suri , 1998 ; Mehta et al. , 2014 ) , abrupt drops in sex steroid levels may affect F0 by acting directly on hormone receptors on the vocal folds or indirectly on neural laryngeal control ( Higgins and Saxman , 1989 ; Newman et al. , 2000 ) .
Postpartum decreases in F0 may also be a product of behavioural changes .
Women experience increased mental and physical fatigue during the first year of childrearing , as well as changes in mood .
Although robust evidence that fatigue decreases women 's F0 is lacking ( Cho , Yin , Park , and Park , 2011 ) , voice pitch plays a key role in the communication of emotion and affect ( Sauter , Eisner , Calder , and Scott , 2010 ) .
Alternatively , women may behaviorally modulate their voices .
There is growing evidence that women and men speak with a lower F0 in specific social contexts , particularly when experiencing ( or wishing to portray ) a high degree of competence and authority ( Pisanski , Cartei , McGettigan , Raine , and Reby , 2016 ) .
New mothers may also experience decreased motivation to volitionally raise their voice pitch .
Although a high voice pitch in women can signal youth and femininity to potential mates , it is likewise associated with perceptions of immaturity and submissiveness ( Pisanski and Bryant , 2018 for review ) .
The magnitude of voice pitch changes observed in our sample of women was large .
Women 's mean and minimum F0 dropped by ap- proximately 14 Hz ( approx .
1.3 semitones ) after giving birth relative to pre-conception levels .
Women 's maximum F0 dropped by 44 Hz ( ap- prox .
2.2 semitones ) , indicating that reaching high frequencies may be particularly inhibited in the year following pregnancy .
Such voice changes are likely to be easily perceptible as they are well beyond the just-noticeable differences in voice pitch perception ( Pisanski and Rendall , 2011 ; Re , O'Connor , Bennett , and Feinberg , 2012 ) .
However , playback studies are now needed to test whether listeners can dis- criminate mother 's voices recorded in pre-pregnancy , pregnancy and postpartum phases , or can differentiate mothers from non-mothers from the voice alone .
In addition , while the effects of a relatively low-pitched and monotonous ( i.e. , masculine ) voice on listeners ' biosocial judg- ments are well documented ( Pisanski and Bryant , 2018 for review ) , playback studies are also needed to assess whether postpartum de- creases in voice pitch influence listeners ' voice-based judgments of new mothers .
The aim of this study was to test whether women 's voice pitch changes during or after pregnancy relative to before conception , and to what extent , employing methods that address many of the shortcomings of previous investigations ( i.e. , we use a longitudinal design ; include a “ pre-pregnancy ” baseline phase ; utilize natural rather than scripted speech ; and measure multiple pitch parameters ) .
The use of archival recordings allowed us to readily explore this research question by analyzing within-individual changes in women 's voice pitch over a span of 10 years .
This would be difficult with real-time voice recording , particularly recording women 's voices before conception .

Evolution and Human Behavior 39 ( 2018 ) 457–463 460 study will have the benefit of allowing researchers to also system- atically measure and control for other variables to examine covariation in F0 , sex hormone levels , and behavioural measures and thus to better understand the mechanisms driving postpartum voice changes .
More generally , longitudinal measures of hormone levels and vocal para- meters across the lifetime could reveal whether large hormonal shifts predict large changes in pitch .
Researchers may also test whether women who adopt children or acquire a child through surrogacy show decreases in F0 parameters .
If so , this could suggest that the mechanism is at least partially behavioural .
Questionnaire data could help reveal whether greater subjective experience of fatigue , mood changes or postpartum depression predicts larger decreases in voice pitch in the year after parturition .
Finally , future work may examine whether wo- men 's F0 parameters also drop following the birth of subsequent chil- dren , and whether these voice changes are amplified following a mul- tiple birth ( e.g. , twins ) .
Our sample of mothers and nulliparous controls included actresses , journalists or reporters , celebrities , and singers .
Although these women are performers or public figures by profession , all voice recordings used in this study ( from both mothers and controls ) were taken from un- scripted interviews in which the women were not explicitly acting .
Moreover , while it is possible that the voice changes we observed were partially behavioural ( i.e. , voice modulation ) , we did not observe analogous voice changes in nulliparous controls whose professions matched those of the mothers , suggesting that profession can not itself explain our pattern of results .
Nevertheless , we can not rule out an in- teraction between profession and pregnancy phase .
Future longitudinal work utilizing a larger sample of women in a wider range of profes- sions , and cultures , is now clearly needed to establish the replicability and generalisability of our results .
Although our data can not offer an answer to the question of whether postpartum voice changes represent an evolved signal or a byproduct , this is an important question worth considering here , and testing in future work , particularly given the known influence of voice pitch on social and reproductive success , and its potential role in communicating female fertility and fecundity ( e.g. , ovulation and menopause : Abitbol et al. , 1999 ; Amir and Biron-Shental , 2004 ; Bryant and Haselton , 2009 ; Çelik et al. , 2013 ; Fischer et al. , 2011 ) .
While it is possible that selection could operate on women to honestly communicate , or deceptively ex- aggerate or suppress , postpartum state , or on men to reliably detect the reproductive states of women ( see e.g. , Haselton and Gildersleeve , 2011 ) , the most parsimonious explanation for our results is that post- partum changes in women 's voices reflect a byproduct of physiological , anatomical and/or behavioural changes following pregnancy .
To test these competing hypotheses , additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms driving postpartum voice changes , as described above , and their potential influence on listeners .

Methods 6.1 .
Subjects We analysed voice recordings collected from 40 adult women , in- cluding 20 women who had given birth to their first child , and 20 nulliparous controls who had never given birth .
We first searched on- line for female public figures who had given birth to their first child no less than four years ago .
This search produced a list of twenty-nine women .
We then excluded women ( n=9 ) for whom we could not find 10 years ' worth of frequent ( i.e. , at least bi-monthly ) , standardized , high-quality voice recordings spanning several years before and after their first pregnancy .
Our final sample of mothers included 20 women , who were born between the years 1966 and 1987 and were between 27 and 41 years of age ( mean 35.3 ) when their first child was born ( Table S1a ) .
As voice recordings were collected up to 5 years before and after childbirth , mothers ' ages at time of voice recording ranged from 22.6 to 49.7 .
Their occupations included actress/celebrity ( n=9 ) , journalist/ reporter ( n=8 ) , and singer/performer ( n=3 ) .
Nulliparous controls were located online by searching for women , with the same professions as our sample of mothers , who had never had a child and for whom we could locate several years of high-quality voice recordings .
To match our sample size of mothers , we terminated our search once we had obtained data from 20 nulliparous controls .
These women were born between 1958 and 1980 , and were thus age- matched to our sample of mothers at parturition ( mean age 36.08 ) , such that the age of each nulliparous control matched the age of one given mother at parturition by an average of± 10.7 months ( min 1.2months , max 34.8 months ; Table S1b ) .
The occupations of nulliparous controls were matched to those of mothers and included actress/celebrity ( n=13 ) , journalist/reporter ( n=6 ) , and singer/performer ( n=1 ) .
See Table S1for subject-level demographic data .
Although no previous study has examined long-term effects of pregnancy on the voice , studies examining longitudinal changes in women 's F0 more generally ( e.g. , de Pinto and Hollien , 1982 ; Russell , Penny , and Pemberton , 1995 ) indicated that 20 women ( per group ) is a sufficient sample size to detect long-term F0 changes where they are present in either mothers or controls .

Voice recordings Voice recordings were extracted from interviews made available through the UCLA Digital Civic Learning Search Engine ( a large col- lection of archived digital media from a range of television networks dating 2005-present ) and from footage publically available online ( e.g. , YouTube ) .
We searched for interviews that took place within the al- lotted timeframe by inputting each woman 's name , the word “ inter- view ” , and the dates of interest into Google Videos or UCLA search engines .
Interview dates were then verified through the UCLA database and by cross-sourcing with online databases ( e.g. , television guides ; Internet Movie Database ) .
Inclusion criteria for interview clips were a lack of strong emotional content , shouting , and background noise .
We searched for and randomly selected 4 clips per phase/timeframe for each woman that met these criteria , attaining an average of 4.4 ± 2.2 interviews per phase for each mother ( Table S2a ) and 3.8 ± 2.7 in- terviews per corresponding timeframe for each nulliparous control ( Table S2b ) .
A total of 634 clips were extracted for analysis with an average duration of 29 ± 16.5 s ( mothers ) and 21.3 ± 13.5 s ( con- trols ) , totalling 277min of audio ( see Table S2 for clip descriptives by woman and phase/timeframe ) .
For mothers , voice recordings were categorized into five phases spanning approximately 10 years of each mother 's life : long-term ( LT ) pre-pregnancy ( 102 clips , 57.1min in total ) , short-term ( ST ) pre-preg- nancy ( 69 clips , 25 .
1min ) , pregnancy ( 87 clips , 38.7 min ) , ST post- partum ( 99 clips , 44.9 min ) and LT postpartum ( 50 clips , 31min ; see Fig .
1 ) .
Birthdates of all children were determined and cross-checked using online sources , and dates of conception were estimated using a conservative threshold of 284 days maximum length of gestation ( Jukic , Baird , Weinberg , McConnaughey , and Wilcox , 2013 ) .
Fourteen mothers conceived a second child within five years of giving birth to their first child ( mean number of days between pregnancies : 636 , range 157 to 1756 ) .
Clips collected in postpartum phases excluded those in which these women were pregnant with a subsequent child .
For nulliparous controls , voice recordings were categorized into three timeframes which corresponded to the phases of pregnancy ( 40 clips , 15.1min ) , ST postpartum ( 45 clips , 17.5 min ) and LT postpartum ( 142 clips , 48min ) experienced by our sample of mothers .
Together , these timeframes spanned approximately 7.5 years of each nulliparous woman 's life .

Acoustic analysis Audio was extracted from each clip and saved as WAV files using Boom 2 and Praat v 6.0.19 software ( Boersma and Weenink , 2016 ) ( mono , 48 kHz sampling frequency ) .
Segments of multi-voicing , acute K. Pisanski et al .
Evolution and Human Behavior 39 ( 2018 ) 457–463 461 noise , and nonverbal vocalizations ( e.g. , laughter ) were manually re- moved in Praat .
We measured 5 parameters of fundamental frequency : mean ( F0 mean ) , minimum ( F0min ) , maximum , ( F0 max ) , standard deviation ( F0 sd ) , and the coefficient of variation ( F0 CV ) using Praat 's autocorrelation algorithm with a search range of 60–600 Hz and a time step of 0.01 s. Whereas F0 mean represents average voice pitch , and F0min and max represent its range , F0 sd and CV represent pitch variability .
A less variable , more monotonous voice will have lower values of F0 sd .
However , because F0 sd decreases as F0 mean increases , we additionally measured F0 CV that represents pitch variability cor- rected for mean ( F0 sd/F0 mean ) .
Erroneous pitch values and spurious octave jumps were manually corrected by selecting the appropriate F0 in Praat 's pitch object window ( Raine , Pisanski , and Reby , 2017 ; Reby , Levréro , Gustafsson , and Mathevon , 2016 ) .
Acoustic measures were performed on the entire duration of each clip .
Silences were not re- moved before analysis as Praat 's autocorrelation algorithm does not track F0 in silent segments of speech .
Ethics The study was reviewed and approved by the Sciences and Technology Cross-Schools Research Ethics Committee ( C-REC ) of the University of Sussex ( ER-REBY-2,8 ) .
The audio samples used for acoustic analysis were extracted from publicly or institutionally avail- able video files .
