Although the overall level of taxation may be largely a function of spending level , the struc- ture of tax systems can vary dramatically even across states with the same level of spending .
The distribution of relative tax burden—the degree to which a tax system is progressive or regressive—is one aspect of tax structure that has important consequences for inequality and individual well-being .
Moti- vated by Joseph Schumpeter ’ s ( [ 1918 ] 1991 ) assertion that the best way to un- derstand a society and its priorities is to analyze how it taxes its citizens , this article furthers the project of the new fiscal sociology ( Martin , Mehrotra , and Prasad 2009 ; Martin and Prasad 2014 ) in examining how racial composition— shown to be an important determinant of redistributive social spending—in- fluences the progressivity of state and local taxes in the United States .
Where racial heterogeneity is higher , government spending is lower .
This association has been documented in analyses of public spending both within and between countries ( see , e.g. , Alesina , Baqir , and Easterly 1999 ; Alesina , Glaeser and Sacerdote 2001 ; Alesina and Glaeser 2004 ) .
In the United States , for example , racial composition is an important predictor of cashwelfare spend- ing across states , net of a host of other factors ( see , e.g. , Rodgers and Tedin 2006 ) .
Although cash assistance is a critical component of welfare state policy , total welfare spending in the United States is substantially less than the direct cash transfers to low-income households delivered through the tax code in the form of refundable tax credits .
Indeed , tax policy is central not only to shaping aggregate levels of inequality but also to comprehending the size and generos- ity of the welfare state , particularly in the United States ( Howard 1999 ; Gar- finkel , Rainwater , and Smeeding 2010 ) .
Considering the structure of tax sys- tems is therefore necessary to understanding the overall level of redistribution in a given society.At the same level of revenue , a highly regressive tax system can serve to reduce the net redistributive effect of high levels of social spend- ing : low-income householdsmay benefit from spending on education andwel- fare , but at the cost of reduced disposable income .
Given the impact of tax pol- icy on household income , it is not surprising that tax systems have been shown to influence a range of individual outcomes—including health and educational attainment—even after accounting for government spending ( e.g. , Strully , Reh- kopf , andXuan2010 ; NewmanandO ’ Brien2011 ; EvansandGarthwaite2014 ; Hoynes , Miller , and Simon 2015 ) .
Moreover , recent work using administrative tax data to study trends in intergenerational economic mobility finds a direct link between tax structure and the transmission of ( dis ) advantage across gen- erations : localitieswithmore progressive tax systems have higher levels of inter- generational economicmobility , net of the overall levels of taxationand spend- for their thoughtful comments and suggestions .

Taken together , these stud- ies demonstrate that the structure of tax systems has an effect on life chances independent of government spending .
Beyond their redistributive functions , tax systems also provide a unique lens for analyzing larger social forces , in this case the changing nature of ethnora- cial division in the United States and its role in the perpetuation of inequality through public policy .
Indeed , historical accounts document the important role of racial division—at times characterized by overt racism—in structuring American tax policy from the colonial era to the present at all levels of govern- ment ( see , e.g. , Einhorn 2001 , 2006 ) .
Although attributing policy positions to overtly racist motivations is less common today , race continues to shape pol- icies and preferences by serving as a salient marker of group membership ( see Bonilla-Silva 2006 ; Abascal 2015 ; DiTomaso 2013 ) .
Studies of public opinion reveal that support for redistributive policies is partially contingent on whether respondents believe those policieswill benefitmembers of their own ( “ coethnic ” ) in-group ( Gilens 1999 ; Luttmer 2001 ) , a process of inequality reproductionTilly labels “ opportunity hoarding ” ( Tilly 1999 ) .
These feelings of in-group solidarity are theorized to be most salient when members of the dominant racial group feel their group position is threatened , which is likely to occur when there is an increase in the number of minorities present in the community ( Blumer 1958 ; Blalock 1967 ; Enos 2014 ; Abascal 2015 ) .
Given this , we might expect that preferences for redistribution , including the structure of taxation , are strongly influenced by change in the racial composition of states over and above the level of racial diversity present .
This investigation provides three empirical contributions to our understand- ing of race as a determinant of redistribution and to the social processes that shape the structure of tax systems.First , usingfixed effects regression analyses and data on state and local tax systems , I demonstrate that changes in racial composition are associated with changes in the progressivity of state and local tax systems : between 1995 and 2007 , an increase in the percentage of Latinos in a state is associated with more regressive state and local tax systems and an increasing tax burden on low-income households .
Second , using evidence from a nationally representative survey experiment I find that individual prefer- ences for taxation are actively shaped by the changing ethnoracial composi- tion of the community .
Third , additional evidence from the survey experiment reveals that in-group preference—or feelings of “ solidarity ” —is one mecha- nism through which racial change shapes tax preferences .
By providing empirical evidence that racial composition influences not only preferences for taxation at the individual level but also the real structure of tax systems at the state and local levels , this investigation makes an important contribution to our understanding of the determinants of redistribution and welfare state generosity .
Moreover , in analyzing how social forces shape tax structures , this article contributes to the broader project of the New Fiscal So- Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1017 ciology , a movement enjoying a resurgence as sociologists explore the cultural and historical roots ( Morgan andPrasad 2009 ; see esp.Martin et al .
2009 ) , mod- ern politics ( Martin 2008 ; Pearson 2014 ; see also Prasad and Deng 2009 ) , and social consequences of tax systems ( Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ; Strully et al .
2010 ; Chetty et al .
2014 ; Chetty and Hendren 2015 ) .
RACE AND REDISTRIBUTION Racialized Origins of the American Tax State Documenting the role of race and racial division in the development—or un- derdevelopment—of the U.S. welfare state has been and continues to be a fo- cus of researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds ( e.g. , Quadagno 1994 ; Lieberman 2001 ; see alsoManza 2000 ) .
The historical and social scien- tific literatures on race and redistribution detail the myriad ways that race has served to not only dampen overall levels of social spending at the federal , state , and local levels but also to shape the contours of the American welfare state—perhapsmost notably its decentralized ( federalized ) structure , which em- phasizes local control .
One line of research analyzes the role of race in the de- velopment of welfare state policy by focusing on how specific policy efforts to increase social spendingwere either curtailed or wholly blocked by racially mo- tivated politics , most notably during key historical periods fromReconstruction to theNewDeal to theGreat Society eras ( e.g. , Quadagno 1994 ; Goldfield 1997 ) .
A second related analytic approach prioritizes the role of race in the crea- tion and perpetuation of institutional barriers to welfare state development , such as super-majority voting requirements and localized control of public pro- grams and public dollars and other “ veto points ” that serve to impede the im- plementation of progressive spending policies ( e.g. , Lieberman 2001 ) .
As government spending is tightly coupled with tax revenues , particularly in earlier epochs , disentangling the role of race in the evolution of the Amer- ican welfare state from the role of race in the evolution of the American tax state is complicated .
In documenting how race shapes the politics of social spend- ing , the existing literature already articulates—either directly or indirectly— one pathway throughwhich race has influenced tax policy at all levels of gov- ernment ( see Alesina and Glaeser 2004 ) .
Efforts to block increases in social spending ( almost always ) by definition also serve to block increases in the tax level .
The reverse is also true .
Yet beyond the level of taxation , there is also significant historical evidence that the structure of tax systems , namely , the distribution of tax burden , has been and continues to be shaped by race and racialized politics .
Race has influenced the structure of tax systems in specific historical moments as well as shaped the distribution of tax burdens over time through racially motivated institutional barriers to progressive taxation .
American Journal of Sociology 1018 Analysis of tax and spending policies in the Southern states in the decades before and after the Civil War illustrates how racialized politics shaped not only the level but also the structure of tax systems ( Thornton 1982 ; Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ; Foner 2005 ) .
Throughout the colonial and antebellum periods , as the historian Robin Einhorn ( 2001 , 2006 ) details , Southern slave owners worked to ensure that all property , including both land holdings and slave holdings , be taxed at the same rate , an ideamotivated out of fear that vot- ers maywant to adopt amore progressive structure that taxed slave wealth— and therefore the rich—at higher rates .
According to Einhorn ( 2001 , 2006 ) , these “ uniformity clauses ” put downward pressure on property taxes in the South , resulting in a poorly funded public sector and an institutional legacy of taxation that gave preferential treatment to property .
In the period following the Civil War , newly enfranchised blacks moved to increase social spending , particularly on education ( Woodward1971 ; Kous- ser 1980 ; Thornton 1982 ; Foner 2005 ) .With increased spending came increased taxes , often levied with distinctly progressive rate structures , including signif- icant new taxes on property , of which blacks owned very little .
This sharp in- crease in the level of taxation—necessary to fund a public education system that now served blacks in addition to whites—as well as the progressive distri- bution of the tax burden fueled backlash and resentment among landowning whites culminating in a dramatic reappropriation of power .
During this “ re- demption ” era ( Foner2011 ) , both the level andstructureof taxationwere changed as public spending was cut and the newly instituted progressive property taxes were rolled back in favor of significantly more regressive tax policies such as poll taxes , which had the added benefit of disenfranchising black Americans ( Woodward 1971 ; Thornton 1982 ; Foner 2005 ) .
Efforts to roll back progres- sive tax policies were pursued through legislatures as well as the courts where the uniformity clauses of the antebellum period were invoked to strike down thenewly implementedprogressive tax instruments ( on income , property , bus- iness ) ( Einhorn 2001 , 2006 ; Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ) .
The racialized politics of Reconstruction structured tax policy in the South for decades to come , and not just through the inertia inherent to tax systems .
Beginning in the redemption era , white landholders across the South put in place a series of institutional barriers—from supermajority requirements to state constitutional amendments—designed to impede efforts to increase any taxes and particularly progressive taxes such as those on property ( Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ; Einhorn 2001 , 2006 ) .
Similar procedural obstacles to pro- gressive taxationwere put in place during the Great Depression , a periodwhen racialized politics served as amajor constraining force to President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt ’ sNewDeal agenda ( Biles 1994 ; Wright 1986 , 2010 ) .
And three decades later , as racial tensions flared during the civil rights era , yet more pro- cedural barriers to progressive taxation were put into place : following the Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1019 passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , Louisiana adopted a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority to increase any tax in the state .
Mississippi followed suit with a three-fifths majority .
Similar institutional bar- riers swept states and localities across the country in the decades that followed ( Knight 2000 ; Mullins andWallin 2004 ; Waisanen 2008 ; NewmanandO ’ Brien 2011 ; see also Pearson 2014 ) .
Although more work is needed to elucidate the special role of race in the evolution of tax policy at the federal , state , and local levels , existing research demonstrates that racial division was pivotal to the successful implementa- tion of regressive tax schemes in key historical moments as well as to the in- stitutionalization of barriers to progressive taxation—such as supermajorities and constitutional limits—that continue to shape the structure of tax systems to this day : in 2007 the state of Alabama settled a lawsuit that asserted that the underfunding of public higher education in the state is the direct result of a century-old discriminatory tax system ( Walker 2007 ) .
Race , Spending , and Taxation in the Modern Era Complementing historical analyses of how racial division undermined pro- gressive social policies throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , recent empir- ical studies of the link between racial composition and levels of redistribu- tive social spending have found a consistent inverse ( and arguably causal ) relationship ( Orr 1976 ; Cutler , Elmendorf , and Zeckhauser 1993 ; Ribar and Wilhelm1996 ; Poterba1997 ; Alesina , Baqir , andEasterly1999 ; Alesina , Glaeser , and Sacerdote 2001 ; Alesina andGlaeser 2004 ; Rodgers andTedin 2006 ) .
Ale- sina , Glaeser , and Sacerdote ( 2001 ) demonstrate , for example , that redistrib- utive social spending is lower when beneficiaries are disproportionately from minority backgrounds and find that this association holds both within and between countries .
In one study of U.S. cities , for example , Alesina , Baqir , and Easterly ( 1999 ) find that spending on productive public goods , including edu- cation , sewers , and roads , is lower in cities with higher levels of ethnic frag- mentation .
More recent work analyzing implementation of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program following the welfare reforms of the mid-1990s finds racial heterogeneity to be an important predictor of a state adoptingmore restrictive and punitive rather than inclusivewelfare policies ( Soss et al .
2001 ; Fellowes and Rowe 2004 ) .
In his analysis of attitudes toward redistributive spending , Luttmer ( 2001 ) finds that levels of support for welfare spending are strongly influenced by the proportion of local welfare recipients that are coethnics .
He concludes that support for social programs is higher where welfare spending is perceived to benefit members of one ’ s own ethnic group .
This “ racial group loyalty ” shapes preferences forwelfare spendingnet of a respondent ’ s own income level ; even low-income households who stand to benefit from greater welfare spending American Journal of Sociology 1020 are less likely to support increased spending when they perceive welfare to disproportionately benefit other racial or ethnic groups .
In his highly influ- ential study , Gilens ( 1999 ) similarly finds that antiwelfare attitudes among whites are motivated by assumptions that this spending disproportionately advantages minorities ( specifically blacks ) whom whites view as being lazy and lacking work ethics .
These stereotypes undermine feelings of solidarity with minority groups and thereby reduce whites ’ motivation to mobilize re- sources for their benefit .
In analyzing determinants of social spending , these studies provide indirect evidence for how racial composition influences the level of taxation , given the relationship between the two .
Yet these studies tell us little about how race might influence the structure of tax systems , specifically the distribution of tax burden .
Two articles in the sociological study of taxation attempt to address this gap in the literature by analyzing changes in the federal tax code .
Using event his- tory analysis to explore changes in the U.S. federal tax code over the second half of the 20th century , Jacobs and Helms ( 2001 ) find that events that reflect positively on racial minorities , such as peaceful civil rights demonstrations , are associated with progressive changes to the federal tax code , whereas events that reflect negatively on racial minorities , such as violent urban riots , are as- sociated with regressive changes to federal taxes .
Notably , the authors find no evidence for a direct effect of changes in the racial composition of the popula- tion on the structure of the tax system .
Earlier work by Jacobs andWaldman ( 1983 ) did find some evidence that racial composition influenced the struc- ture of tax systems at the subnational level , specifically that states with a higher proportion of black residents had more regressive tax systems .
A more recent political science study of local tax votes in Texas and Mas- sachusetts suggests that it may not be the level of ethnoracial diversity pres- ent that influences taxation but rather the degree of demographic change .
Analyzing local tax votes in these two states , Hopkins ( 2009 ) finds no evidence of an association between the level of racial heterogeneity present and the like- lihood a community votes to increase taxes , yet he does find strong evidence of reduced support for increased taxes in communities that had experienced recent demographic change , specifically an increase in racial heterogeneity .
The idea that racial change is the key driver of both shifting public opinion and public policy , as evidenced in this study by Hopkins , motivates both the theoretical model and empirical strategies employed below .
Group Position , Opportunity Hoarding , and Racialized Preferences for Redistribution How might an increase in the presence of ethnoracial minorities influence preferences for tax policy ?
According to Blumer ( 1958 ) , racial prejudice is en- Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1021 gendered when the dominant group ( e.g. , whites ) feels its sense of group position—atop the hierarchy and/or in control of economic and political resources—is challenged ( see alsoBobo andHutchings 1996 ; Bobo 1999 ) .Mi- nority groups do not need to actively challenge the dominant group , however , for the feelings of threat to be salient .
As Blalock asserts ( 1967 ) , simply the in- creased presence or visibility of racial or ethnic minorities may increase the sense of threat felt by the ( white ) majority over control of economic resources and political power .
The cognitive basis for this sense of threat has been systematically explored by social psychologists .
Experimental evidence demonstrates that negative stereotypes held by whites about blacks and Latinos , particularly low-income blacks and Latinos , are derived from reduced feelings of warmth and percep- tions of competency ( Fiske et al .
2002 ) .
Low-income minorities are seen to be in competition with the majority population , evoking a “ contemptuous prej- udice ” ( Fiske et al .
2002 ; Cuddy , Fiske , and Glick 2007 ) among whites .
There- fore , differential groupmembership premised on ethnoracial distinctions may engender preferences for policies that actively harm the out-group ( see , e.g. , Enos 2014 ) .
Yet the forces that perpetuate racial inequality today need not be , and in- deed may not be , compelled by active feelings of race prejudice ( Bonilla-Silva 2006 ; DiTomaso 2013 ) .
Charles Tilly ’ s ( 1999 ) notion of opportunity hoarding may be a more fruitful theoretic lens for understanding how race shapes pref- erences for and patterns of redistribution .
Instead of analyzing redistributive preferences and processes as a site for overt racialized conflict—where domi- nant whites actively harm subordinate minority populations through reduced welfare spending or higher tax rates—Tilly asserts that the same social out- comes can be produced through a process in which whites acquire power and resources that are used for the benefit of in-group members .
There need not be active , deliberate harm to out-group members for inequalities to be per- petuated .
For Tilly , the key to understanding how or why a dominant group ( e.g. , whites ) may serve to perpetuate racial inequality is not the degree to which they fear or hate an out-group ( e.g. , blacks , Latinos ) but rather the degree to which in-group members feel bound by notions of solidarity and loyalty ( and often reciprocity , as emblematic of immigrant networks ) .
Where soli- darity is higher , the motivation , and perhaps even capacity , for the group to “ hoard ” opportunities for the benefit of group members is greater ( Tilly 1998 ) .
Indeed , Tilly points to the politics of inequality in both wealthy and devel- oping countries as a strategic site for the hoarding of political rights and eco- nomic spoils by “ categorically bounded ” groups , with particular emphasis on ethnoracially dominant groups and men ( 1998 , pp .
10 , 194–212 ) .
How does Tilly ’ s notion of opportunity intersect with Blalock ’ s concep- tion of racial threat ?
A recent study by Abascal ( 2015 ) demonstrates that op- American Journal of Sociology 1022 portunity hoarding is a dynamic process ; the degree to which the dominant group hoards resources for in-groupmembers is in part a function of the de- gree to which they feel threatened .
In her behavioral experiment , Abascal finds that priming respondents with information about recent growth in the Latino population makes whites less generous to blacks in a dictator game setting .
In this study , increasing racial threat from one out-group—Latinos— leads whites to hoard resources in a way that reduces the welfare of a differ- ent out-group—blacks .
Under threat , in-group members seek to benefit their own , which in turn increases inequalitybetween the in-groupandall out-groups , regardless of the source of threat .
Solidarity within the categorically bounded group of white Americans— perhaps heightened in areas with increasing populations of ethnoracial mi- norities—may engender a set of policy preferences that favors a more pro- gressive taxation regime in ethnically homogenous communities and a more regressive taxation regime in increasingly heterogeneous communities .
And , importantly , racemay influence individual preferences for , and the actual struc- ture of , tax systems distinct from how it shapes preferences for and the actual level of social spending and taxation .
CHANGING RACIAL COMPOSITION AND THE PROGRESSIVITY OF STATE AND LOCAL TAXES Informed by the above empirical work on the determinants of taxation and redistributive social spending as well as the theoretical understanding of how racial change may influence opportunity hoarding by dominant groups , I posit two guiding hypotheses for how changing racial composition at the state level may influence the progressivity of state and local tax systems : HYPOTHESIS 1.—As the percentage of Latinos and the percentage of blacks in a state increase , state and local tax systems will become less progressive .
HYPOTHESIS 2.—As the percentage of Latinos and the percentage of blacks in a state increase , the tax burden on low-income households will increase .
Before proceeding to the first set of empirical analyses on the link between racial composition and the changing structure of state and local tax systems , I begin with a discussion of how tax progressivity is operationalized in the current investigation .
Measuring Tax Progressivity Measuring the progressivity of tax systems can be conceptually problematic and practically difficult .
In the most basic sense , tax systems are understood to be progressivewhen higher-income earners pay a greater proportion of their income in taxes than thosewith lower incomes .
Statements about progressivity , Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1023 therefore , are inherently comparative , that is , a given tax or tax system is said to be more or less progressive than another tax or tax system .
One approach to measuring the progressivity of a tax system holistically is to analyze the mix of taxes used to fund the public sector .
Comparisons of tax systems across nations reveal that , on average , sales and excise taxes are more regressive than income and property taxes ( Prasad and Deng 2009 ) .
Whereas any tax instruments can be designed to be more or less progressive , greater reliance on the sales tax is , on average , associated with more regres- sive tax systems .
Although understandably useful in making cross-national comparisons , systematic analysis of tax systems at the subnational level ne- cessitates a finer level of detail , particularly in the United States , where the use of specific tax instruments varies across states and localities ; for example , a number of states do not levy a sales tax and another subset of states does not levy a personal income tax .
Another way to measure progressivity is to calculate the ratio of the tax burden at two different points in the income distribution , for example , the ratio of the tax burden on the top quintile to the tax burden on the bottomquin- tile .
Although intuitively appealing , measures of this type fail to incorporate any information about the distribution of the tax burden across quintiles.More- over , this type of measure does not incorporate any information about the actual distribution of income or degree of income inequality .
The latter infor- mation is central to our understanding of tax progressivity ; for example , hold- ing the relative tax burden of the top and bottom earners constant , we may have a very different interpretation of progressivity if the income gap between the top and bottom earners is 10:1 rather than to 2:1 .
One measure of tax progressivity that considers inequality in both income and taxes is the Suits index , named for economist Daniel Suits ( 1977 ) who de- veloped the measure in the 1970s .
Analogous to the Gini index for income or wealth inequality , the Suits index captures the cumulative percentage of taxes paid across households as a proportion of the cumulative percentage of income earned across households .
It therefore simultaneously incorporates information on both the distribution of income as well as the distribution of taxes .
A Suits index of 1—extreme progressivity—is when all of the taxes are paid by the highest earner .
A Suits index of21—extreme regressivity—is when all taxes are paid by the lowest earner .
Ideally , the Suits index of tax progressivity would be constructed using data on the income earned and taxes paid by all households .
Given data lim- itations , however , this information is often approximated using data on the cumulative income earned and taxes paid by households at various points in the income distribution .
For the purposes of this investigation , the Suits in- dex will be calculated using data on the income earned and taxes paid from seven different points in the income distribution : bottom 20 % , second 20 % , third 20 % , fourth 20 % , next 15 % , next 4 % , and top 1 % .
American Journal of Sociology 1024 By incorporating information on the total income earned and taxes paid across the income distribution , the Suits index overcomes many of the limi- tations of other measures of tax progressivity .
Yet it should be noted that this measure—indeed any attempt to measure “ progressivity ” —fails to capture any information on the overall level of taxation .
For this reason , differences in tax “ progressivity ” across states can not be used to directly infer differences in tax “ burden ” across levels of income .
The tax burden on the poor could be very high in a state that is still considered progressive ( if taxes on everyone are high ) , and the tax burden on the rich could be very low in a state that is still considered progressive ( if taxes on everyone are low ) .
As the actual level of the tax burden on the poor has been shown to be associated with a number of measures of individual and household well-being ( Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ) , the analysis presented below will additionally explore a connection be- tween racial composition and the actual tax burden of the poor .
Data and Methods The power to tax is vested at many levels of government .
In addition to fed- eral and state governments , myriad and often overlapping subunits within a state—including municipalities , counties , school districts , and even special taxing districts—are empowered to tax their residents .
The structure of tax systems therefore varies widely across the states , both in which government entity levies taxes and what they tax .
In some states , for example , the gen- eral sales tax is reserved as an instrument of the state government , whereas in other states sales tax rates are determined and revenue is collected at the county level for local use , and in still other states the sales tax is used at both the state and local level .
The same is true for property and personal income taxes .
Given differences both across states and over time in the role of local versus state governments in both taxing and spending , this study aggregates state and local spending and uses state as the unit of analysis.2 Data for this analysis are taken from the Institute for Taxation and Eco- nomic Policy ( ITEP ) , a nonprofit , nonpartisan , research organization with an expertise and focus on U.S. tax policy at the federal , state , and local levels .
Since 1996 , ITEP has maintained and updated a microsimulation model for estimating the net effect of current and proposed laws on overall tax revenues as well as the tax burden of households by income quintile .
In addition to rou- tinely updating data on federal , state , and local tax laws , the ITEP micro- simulation model is estimated using data from a number of sources , including 2 It should be noted that aggregating data to the state level—which is necessary in a na- tional analysis given variations in the structure of substate tax regimes and basic data limitations—masks potentially important variations across localities and within locali- ties over time .
Indeed , racial change may bemore likely to influence policy at a local level than at a state level in the short run .
Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1025 hundreds of thousands of individual tax returns from the IRS public use files as well as the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) , American Community Sur- vey , and Survey of ConsumerExpenditures.3 Although comparable to microsimulation models used by the U.S. Trea- sury , the Congress , and the Congressional Budget Office , ITEP ’ s model is unique in its ability to simulate tax incidence at the state level , including ag- gregated state and local estimates .
The degree of detail in themodel is essen- tial for estimating the true “ net effect ” of tax law on households : published tax rates for personal income , property , or sales taxes can vary substantially from the effective tax rate due to numerous credits , offsets , and exemptions that ex- ist at the federal , state , and local levels .
The ITEPmodel also incorporates es- timates of indirect taxes that may be paid by households ; most notably , for example , households whose heads do not own their own homes are never- theless considered to bear some brunt of property taxes in a locality by way of higher rent .
Published estimates of tax burden by income for all 50 states using ITEP ’ s microsimulation model are available at three points in time : 1995 , 2002 , and 2007 .
In each of these years , ITEP calculated the total tax burden paid by households in the first 20 % , second 20 % , third 20 % , fourth 20 % , next 15 % ( 80th–95th percentile ) , next 4 % ( 96th–99th percentile ) , and top 1 % .
To calculate the Suits index for each of the 50 states at each point in time , I combined this tax burden information with the state-specific income distri- bution information used by ITEP to calculate tax burden .
Using the ITEP model results , I calculated the total income earned in each state and then calculated the proportion of income earned by each of the bottom four quin- tiles , the next 15 % , the next 4 % , and the top 1 % .
I then calculated the total amount of state and local taxes paid overall and then calculated the propor- tion of taxes paid by each of the bottom four quintiles , the next 15 % , the next 4 % , and the top 1 % .
Relating the cumulative income earned to the cumu- lative taxes paid according to the function outlined by Suits generates a state-specific Suits index for the progressivity of the state and local tax sys- tems of each of the 50 states in 1995 , 2002 , and 2007 , the three years for which data are available .
The above calculations yield a Suits index for each of the 50 states in the United States at three points in time , or 150 state-year observations in total .
To ease interpretation of results in the regression models , I standardized the Suits index by dividing by the standard deviation .
As a reminder , a ( hypo- thetical ) Suits index of 1 indicates a tax system is perfectly progressive , whereas a ( hypothetical ) Suits index of21 indicates a tax system is perfectly regressive .
Therefore , in looking at within-state change in the Suits index over time , an 3 For more information , see http : //www.itep.org/about/itep_tax_model_full.php .
American Journal of Sociology 1026 increase in the value of the Suits index reflects a move toward greater pro- gressivity , whereas a decrease reflects a move toward greater regressivity .
The calculated Suits index for each state and each year is reported in the appendix ( table A1 ) .
Notably , every state-year estimate is below zero , mean- ing that all state and local tax systems can be characterized as regressive .
Note also that states which are generally considered relatively “ progressive ” or gen- erous in terms of redistributive social spending donot always have progressive tax systems , for example , Massachusetts .
Moreover , some states that are often characterized as being laggards in social spending have relatively progressive tax structures , for example , South Carolina .
This discrepancy further under- scores the need to analyze the social determinants of taxation separately from the determinants of redistributive social spending .
As described above , the primary focus of this investigation is to test for an association between a change in the racial composition of a state and a change in the progressivity of state and local tax systems.Therefore , data are analyzed using a linear model with state and year fixed effects .
State fixed effects are employed to net out all time-invariant state-specific characteristics thatmay be associated with racial composition and the structure of tax systems .
All models also include year fixed effects to net out national level trends and fed- eral policy shifts that affect all states equally .
The key predictors for racial composition are % black ( non-Hispanic ) , % Latino , and % Asian ( non-Hispanic ) in the state .
These numbers are de- rived from theCPS and are scaled to 0–100 .
I use percentage of the population by ethnoracial category over other commonly used metrics of heterogeneity , such as ethnic diversity or “ fractionalization ” indices , for several reasons .
First , blacks , Latinos , and Asians ( and other ethnoracial or nation origin groups ) have distinct histories and historical trajectories in theUnited States ; indeed , historically the nature and level of welfare support low-income households re- ceive vary across ethnoracial categories , beyond a white-nonwhite dichotomy ( Soss et al .
2001 ; Fox 2012 ) .
Second , the content of race-based stereotypes and racial prejudice varies significantly across these groups ( Gilens 1999 ; Fiske et al .
2002 ; Cuddy et al .
2007 ) .
Third , given that we are particularly interested in looking at change in racial composition over time , having separate indicators for the percentage of each minority group in the population allows for a more nuanced examination of demographic change relative to a summary index or more general measure such as % nonwhite .
Although summary indices may be necessary in cross-national studies where minority distinctions vary and may be premised on religion or language ( e.g. , Alesina , Glaeser , and Sacerdote 2001 ) , using these distinct—but still coarse—measures is important and poten- tially instructive in the U.S. context .
In addition to state and year fixed effects , models also include a vector of time-varying state-level covariates to account for factors that may be jointly correlated with the changing racial composition of the state and the changing Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1027 progressivity of the tax system .
First , I include a measure of the percentage of state residents who are foreign born , to ensure models are isolating the effect of changing ethnoracial composition net of immigration status .
Second , mod- els include a number ofmeasures from theCPS to capture themacroeconomic condition of the state , including labor force participation rate ( scaled 0–100 ) , unemployment rate and poverty rate ( scaled 0–100 ) , and total income per cap- ita ( logged ) , which is an aggregate measure of all income earned by individ- uals in the state , adjusted for inflation .
Log income per capita is highly corre- lated with state gross domestic product and , in addition to serving as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions , serves as a control for changes in the taxable resources available to a state , which likely has important implications for the structure of tax systems.4 Political party control—which canboth influence tax policy and may be shaped by changing demographics—is accounted for by a continuous measure of Republican control of the state house , taken fromHarmon ( 2011 ) .5Finallyallmodels include state-specificGini coefficients , as inequalitymay be associatedwith both changing racial composition aswell as changing distribution of tax burden .
To correct for potential autocorrelation across waves , standard errors are clustered at the state level.Models are robust to various lag structures ; unlagged results are presented in the tables below ( see Lynch 2011 ) .
Results Table 1 presents results from the regression model predicting the progres- sivity of state and local tax systems , as operationalized by the Suits index .
In the basic random effects model , the coefficient for % Latino is negative and statistically significant : across states , those with higher Latino popula- tions have more regressive tax systems , net of all covariates .
The coefficients for black and Asian are not significant .
Although this cross-sectional evidence is suggestive , the unique ( often racialized ) histories of state-local tax policy yielded significant differences across states that must be netted out in order to evaluate whether changing racial composition is associated with changing tax structures net of underlying differences in tax systems .
Model 2 presents results from a model that includes state fixed effects .
Here we see evidence that within-state change in the % Latino is associated 4 Separate analysis used state gross domestic product instead of total income .
Results are unaffected by choice of measure .
5 From Harmon : “ State House and Senate variables were constructed by centering the percent Republican around 50 % so that Republican control represents positive devia- tions from 50 % , while Democratic control represents negative deviations .
The absolute values of the deviations were then logged with the negative sign returned to the Demo- crats to create a logarithmic scale with positive and negative deviation from zero to rep- resent the diminishing returns of political party concentrations ” ( 2011 , p. 103 , n.20 ) .

This association ex- ists net of changes in state macroeconomic characteristics % foreign born , level of income inequality , and political party control .

Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1029 sivity of state and local tax systems over this period , which is not unexpected given the smaller change in those groups at the state level relative to the changes in % Latino over this time period .
This model provides compelling evidence that racial composition at the state level structures the progressivity of tax systems .
Yet , as noted above , changes in progressivity may not directly translate into changes in abso- lute tax burden .
Recall that a tax system can simultaneously become more regressive while actually reducing the net tax burden on those at the bottom if , for example , the tax burden on those at the top is also reduced .
Although changing progressivity is an important process of interest in its own right , wemight also be interested to know the association between changing racial composition and changes in the absolute tax burden , particularly the burden on low-income households whose well-being is likely to be strongly affected by tax policy ( Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ) .
Using total tax burden on those in the bottom quintile estimated by ITEP as the dependent variable , mod- els 3 and 4 in table 1 test for this relationship using random effects and fixed effects specifications , respectively .
Although the random effects model sug- gests that the overall percentage of Latinos is not associatedwith higher taxes on the poor , the preferred fixed effects specification provides evidence that an increasing percentage of Latinos in the state is indeed associated an increase in the absolute tax burden on low-income households .
The above analyses demonstrate that an increasing percentage of Latinos in a state is associated with a more regressive state and local tax system and , moreover , this increasing regressivity is being driven in part by increasing the tax burden on low-income households .
The fixed effects modeling strat- egy coupled with the macroeconomic and political covariates helps to rule out competing explanations for this association and to isolate a direct , causal effect for racial composition on the structure of tax systems.Notably , % Latino is a significant predictor of both tax progressivity and tax burden on the poor even after accounting for % foreign born in the state ( which in itself is not a significant predictor of tax progressivity or burden on poor ) .
CHANGING RACIAL COMPOSITION AND PREFERENCES FOR TAXATION Whereas the above analyses provide compelling evidence that changing ra- cial composition at the state level influences the structure of state and local tax systems , the nature of the datamakes it difficult to directly test formech- anisms through which ethnoracial change may shape tax progressivity .
A first-order hypothesis is that ethnoracial change may influence the structure of tax systems by shaping the preferences of voters , which in turn shape pol- icy .
Individual voter preferences , or mass public opinion , play an important role in shapingpolicyprioritiesandpolicyoutcomes , although the strengthof this American Journal of Sociology 1030 relationship is contingent on many factors ( Gilens 2005 ; Brooks andManza 2007 ) .
Given the role of race in structuring opinions toward redistributive social spending and resource allocation across groups ( Gilens 1999 ; Luttmer 2001 ; Abascal 2015 ) and suggestive evidence that this effect may extend to preferences for taxation ( Jacobs and Waldman 1983 ; Jacobs and Helms 2001 ; Hopkins 2009 ) , it is instructive to test how racial change may shape the tax preferences of individuals .
Is there evidence that changes in the ethnoracial composition of local areas influence preferences for taxation ?
Motivated by this question , I designed a survey experiment to test three additional hypotheses : HYPOTHESIS 3.—Whites who are told to imagine that their community has experienced a recent influx of black or Latino residents will be less likely to support higher taxes .
HYPOTHESIS 4.—Whites who are told that their community has experi- enced a recent influx of black or Latino residents will be more likely to prefer a regressive , flat tax over a more redistributive , progressive tax .
Building on the notional mechanism offered by Tilly ( 1998 ) and suggested by Luttmer ( 2001 ) , the final hypothesis attempts to experimentally test for how feelings of solidarity may influence preferences for taxation and medi- ate any observed relationship between racial composition and preferences for taxation .
HYPOTHESIS 5.—Respondents ’ feelings of solidarity with members of their community will mediate the effect of ethnoracial change on preferences for taxation .
Survey Experiment For the experimental study I recruited a sample ( n 5 1,030 ) of individuals to complete an online survey .
The samplewas recruited froma privatelyman- aged online panel and was designed to be nationally representative of the UnitedStatesby income , age , andgender.6Respondentswerepresentedwith avignette that asked them to imagine theywere living in a hypothetical county that recently experienced rapid population growth .
Respondents were ran- domly assigned to one of three conditions where they were told the new ar- rivals to the county were predominately ( 1 ) white , ( 2 ) black , or ( 3 ) Latino .
All respondents were told that the new arrivals to the county were generally 6 The survey was administered to participants in an online panel recruited and main- tained by Qualtrics , a research firm .
The general adult population in the Qualtrics sam- ple was invited to take the survey , and quotas were used to make the sample representa- tive across income , age , and gender .
Although this sampling strategy is inferior to a true national probabilistic design , the range of respondents recruited through this method is likely more readily generalizable than convenience samples typically used in experimen- tal designs ( e.g. , university students ) .
Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1031 low-income , in order to reduce the likelihood that taxpreferenceswere based on inferences about the income of the new arrivals .
The vignette went on to note that the local government has decided it needs to raise additional revenue and asked the respondents for their opinions about how taxes should be raised ( see full vignette text in the appendix ) .
The analytic sample is limited to non-Hispanic whites who successfully passed the manipulation check at the end of the survey by identifying the race or ethnicity of the new arrivals described in their treatment condition ( n 5 473 ) .7 A multinomial logistic regression model predicting respondent status in each of the conditions confirms covariate balance was achieved across groups through randomization ( see table A2 in the appendix ) .
In addition to analyses of the full sample , I also conducted analyses on subsets of the sample by sex , given evidence in the literature that men and women tend to havesubstantiallydifferentpreferences for redistribution , withwomenconsis- tently favoring higher levels than men ( see Alesina and Giuliano 1999 ; Fong 2001 ; Pinker 2006 ) .
Data were analyzed using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) models adjusting for basic demographic covariates including income ( log ) , age ( linear and squared terms ) , education , and marital status .
Although all re- sults presented are frommodels with covariates , the results are not sensitive to the inclusion of controls ( see Mutz 2011 ; Gerber and Green 2012 ) .
After reading the initial vignette , respondents were first asked whether they would support or oppose the county council ’ s efforts to raise taxes in the county ( 1–6 scale with 1 being “ strongly oppose ” and 6 being “ strongly support ” ) .
As illustrated in table 2 and figure 1 , support for increased taxation was highest among white respondents who were told that the new arrivals to the county were predominately white .
Conversely , white respondents who were told that the newarrivalswere black or Latinowere less likely to support raising taxes , although notably only the Latino condition was statistically dif- ferent from the white condition .
Being in the Latino condition was associated 7 Of the 793 white respondents , 320 failed the manipulation check asking them to recall the race/ethnicity of the new residents described in the prime .
A logistic regression model predicting a correct answer to the manipulation check finds no differences in the odds of answering correctly by respondent sociodemographic characteristics ( income , age , sex , or education ) .
As these respondents did not receive the “ treatment ” being tested here , they add “ noise ” to the data and are excluded from the analyses that follow ( see Oppenheimer , Mayvis , andDavidenko 2009 ) .When respondents who failed themanipulation check are included in the sample ( in their assigned conditions ) , coefficients for the Latino and black conditions in the model predicting support for taxes attenuate to zero and are nonsignif- icant ( P > .9 and P > .4 , respectively ) .
The results for the main finding of preferences for flat vs. progressive taxation are more robust ; inclusion of those who failed the manipula- tion check reduces the coefficients on being in the Latino or black conditions by half ( P5 .22 andP5 .13 , respectively ) .
Coefficients on the Latino and black conditions in themodel predicting solidarity also shrink but remain statistically significant ( P < .01 and P < .01 , respectively ) .
American Journal of Sociology 1032 with a .37 point lower score on a 6-point scale , equivalent to one-quarter of a standard deviation .
The above finding provides supportive evidence for the first hypothesis : increasing the percentage of nonwhites in a local population reduces sup- port for efforts to increase taxation .
But does the changing racial composi- tion of an area influence respondents ’ preferences for the structure of taxes ?
To test for this association , respondents were asked the following question : “ Overall , would you prefer a ‘ flat tax ’ ( where everyone would pay the same percentage of their income in new taxes ) or a ‘ progressive tax ’ ( where the tax rate increases with income , in other words , middle- and higher-income people would pay a greater percentage of their income in new taxes than TABLE 2 OLS Regression Predicting Support for Tax Increase by Race Condition Full Sample Experimental condition ( ref 5 white ) : .

Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1033 lower-income people ) ? ” Respondents were asked to report whether they preferred a “ flat tax ” or a “ progressive tax ” ( 1–6 scale , with 1 being “ strongly prefer flat tax ” and 6 being “ strongly prefer progressive tax ” ) .
As shown in table 3 and figure 2 , analysis of the full sample of respondents found no sta- tistically significant difference between the white condition and either of the minority conditions in preferences for a flat versus a progressive tax .
How- ever , when subsetting the sample by sex of respondent , substantial differ- ences emerge .
Specifically , male respondents in both the black and Latino conditions were significantly more likely to prefer a flat tax than male re- spondents in the white condition ; when the new arrivals to the county were nonwhite , support among white males for a progressive , redistributive tax was lower .
Put another way , white male respondents whowere told that the new arrivals to the county were white were more likely to prefer a redistrib- utive , progressive tax than those who were told that the new arrivals to the county were black or Latino .
The coefficient point estimates reflect that , rel- ative to those in the white condition , the average response for male respon- dents in the black condition was about .57 points lower on the 6-point scale ( approximately 30 % of a standard deviation ) and the average response for male respondents in the Latino conditionwas about .78 points lower ( approx- imately 40 % of a standard deviation ) .
Interestingly , female respondents in this sample reported no statistically significant differences in their preference for flat versus progressive taxation across the three conditions , suggesting that womenmay view tax policy dif- ferently from spending policy when considering redistributive policies ( see Alesina and Giuliano 1999 ; Fong 2001 ; Pinker 2006 ) .
It is also notable that the order of conditions is consistent in both figures 1 and 2 : the point esti- mates are lower for the Latino condition than the black condition in both instances , although it is important to note the difference between these two FIG .

American Journal of Sociology 1034 conditions is not statistically significant in either case .
Taken together , these results provide some support for hypothesis 4 : increasing the presence of ra- cial minorities reduces support for progressive tax structures , although nota- bly only for male respondents .
Overall support for taxation—and for male respondents , support for pro- gressive taxation—is lower for whites who are told their community has re- cently experienced an influx of nonwhites .
But what drives this association ?
Following Tilly ( 1998 ) , I hypothesized that respondents would bemore likely to support raising taxes and , specifically , to support raising taxes progres- sively , when they felt “ solidarity ” with the new arrivals , that is , when they felt the new arrivalswere like them and thereforemore readily identified as being part of the “ in-group. ” To test for this potentialmechanism , respondents were TABLE 3 OLS Regression Predicting Preference for Progressive Tax by Race Condition Full Sample Men Women Experimental condition ( ref 5 white ) : Black condition .

Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1035 asked the degree to which they believed the new arrivals to the county were like them or not like them ( 6-point scale with 1 being “ not at all like me ” and 6 being “ just like me ” ) .
As shown in table 4 and figure 3 , those in the black and Latino conditions were significantly less likely to report that the new arrivals to the county were like them than those in the white condition .
In other words , experimentally manipulating the race of the new arrivals sig- nificantly altered the degree to which respondents felt solidarity with the group , with the average response for those in black and Latino conditions being .6 and 1point lower on the 6-point scale , respectively ( which translates to approximately 44 % of a standard deviation lower for the black condition and 78 % lower for the Latino condition , relative to thewhite condition ) .
No- tably , respondents in theLatino condition felt less solidaritywith the newar- rivals than those in the black condition , a difference that is statistically sig- nificant ( P < .01 ) .
But do these differences in expressed solidarity by racial condition ac- count for any of the observed differences in preferences for taxation across the three conditions ?
Results from a mediation analysis are presented in ta- ble 5 .
Model A reproduces results from the earlier analysis that found that support for taxes was significantly lower among respondents in the Latino condition relative to the white condition .
To test whether respondents ’ ex- pressed feelings of solidarity with the new arrivals mediate the association between the race of the new arrivals and support for taxation , in model B I added the measure of solidarity to the equation .
Results demonstrate that solidarity is a significant predictor of support for taxation—the higher a re- spondent ’ s feeling of solidarity toward the new arrivals , the greater the sup- port for increased taxes .
At the same time , when I include the measure of FIG .

Indeed , once solidarity is included in the model , the average response for those in the Latino condition shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically different from the white condition .
Changes in the Latino coefficient between the twomodels suggest that variation in feel- ings of solidarity can account for approximately 57 % of the observed asso- ciation between being in the Latino condition and reduced support for tax- ation ( Sobel mediation test significant at P < .01 ) .
Solidarity is a meaningful predictor of support for taxation and , as evi- denced by comparing coefficients inmodel A andmodel B , serves tomediate TABLE 4 OLS Regression Predicting Solidarity with New Arrivals by Race Condition Full Sample Experimental condition ( ref5 white ) : Black condition .

Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1037 the association between the race conditions and support for taxation .
But do feelings of solidarity influence respondent preferences for a progressive tax structure ?
Table 5 , model C , reproduces the previous analysis , which found a strong effect of race condition on preferences for progressive taxation among male respondents : support for progressive taxation was lower among males who were told the new arrivals to the countywere black or Latino.ModelD adds the measure of solidarity to the model .
Results demonstrate that solidarity is a significant driver of support for a progressive , rather than flat , tax struc- ture .
Moreover , after accounting for solidarity , the differences in preferences for a progressive tax amongmale respondents in the black and Latino condi- tions relative to the white condition shrink toward zero and are no longer statistically significant .
Changes in the coefficients for the black and Latino conditions between models C and D suggest that this measure of solidarity accounts for about 28 % and 36 % , respectively , of the association between be- ing in the black condition and Latino condition on reduced support for pro- gressive taxation ( Sobel mediation test significant at P < .05 ) .
These findings provide support for hypothesis 5—observed differences in support for increased taxes and preferences for progressive tax systems by race condition can be explained , in part , by differences in the degree to which white respondents feel solidarity with the new arrivals to their hy- pothetical county .
This provides some evidence for the individual-level pro- cess through which changing racial composition may lead to a real change in tax structures ( Hopkins 2009 ) .

Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1039 ity of tax systems , likely in part because few states saw an appreciable change in the proportion of residents who were black or Asian between 1995 and 2007 .
The experimental results demonstrated a statistically significant differ- ence amongwhite respondents in their feelings of solidarity toward blacks as well as Latinos , with respondents feeling less similar to Latinos than to blacks .
One reason whites may feel less solidarity with Latino arrivals than with black arrivals involves assumptions about the immigration and citizenship status of the new arrivals—Latinos may be more different because they were born in another country and may not be citizens or even legal residents of the United States .
It could be argued , therefore , that any observed empirical association be- tween ethnic composition and the structure of tax systems is confounded by assumptions about the immigration or legal status of new residents .
In other words , it may not be the ethnicity of new arrivals that is driving preferences for regressive tax systems but instead their immigrant status .
In addition to including a control for % foreign born in the regression models , I further tested for this potential confounding explanation directly in the experiment by asking respondents both how likely it is that the new arrivals were for- eign born and how likely it is that the new arrivals were citizens or legal res- idents .
Although respondents in the Latino condition were more likely to re- port thenewarrivalswere foreignbornandnoncitizens thanthose in thewhite or black conditions , this measure was not associated with respondents ’ tax preferences and did not serve tomediate the association between the increase in minorities and tax preferences ( see table A3 in the appendix ) .
These analytic techniques provide some evidence that these results are not driven by a pure “ immigrant ” effect .
At the same time , attitudes toward Latinos in the contemporary United States are certainly influenced by no- tional assumptions about immigrants and noncitizens .
Indeed , the content of the racialized category of Latinos in the United States has evolved and continues to be shaped within discourses of immigration , foreignness , and citizenship ( Padilla 1984 ; Martinez 2008 ) .
Nevertheless , I posit that these findings suggest amore complexmechanism for how a changing Latino pres- ence may be influencing tax preferences and tax policies than simply a gen- eralized response to immigrants .
Race and Assumptions of Public Spending Taxation and spending are inherently related ; therefore , we might expect in- dividual preferences for how governments should tax to be strongly influ- enced by preferences for how government should spend .
One could therefore argue that the relationship between race and tax progressivity documented in this investigation is merely an artifact of the already established link be- American Journal of Sociology 1040 tween race and social spending , that is , individual support for increased taxes or progressive tax structures is driven by race-based assumptions of how that money will be spent .
In other words , it may be that racial composition shapes tax preferences by shifting assumptions about what the money will be spent on .
Individuals may prefer to use progressive tax instruments to fund educa- tion and regressive tax instruments for highways , for example .
Given that minority status is often conflated with poverty and further associated with welfaredependencyandcriminality ( Gilens1999 ) , it could thereforebeargued that the observedassociation is being driven by attitudes toward certain types of spending that are typically associated with minority populations .
I attempted to account for this potential feedback loop between race , as- sumptions about government spending , and preferences for taxation in a variety of ways .
First , the experimental study was designed to prevent the conflation of minority status with welfare dependence—and the conflation of race and class more generally—by explicitly noting that the new arrivals were generally low-income irrespective of race.Moreover , in follow-up ques- tions , respondents were asked how likely it was that the county needed ad- ditional revenue in order to increase spending in each of the following areas : health and hospitals , welfare and income assistance , parks and recreation , police andpublic safety , and education.Notably , I foundno evidence of a dif- ference in expectations for how the tax revenue would be spent across the three race conditions ; respondents in the black and Latino condition were no more likely to report that they believed the county needed revenue to in- crease spending on welfare , policy , parks , education , or health than respon- dents in the white condition ( results available on request ) .
This null finding suggests that attitudes toward redistributive taxation are being shaped di- rectly by attitudes toward race , not by differential expectations about what the race of the new arrivals may mean for how the new tax dollars are spent .
Finding no difference in the expected use of tax revenue by race provides additional support for the argument that the association is being driven by a more basic notion of solidarity with the new arrivals than by assumptions about their deservingness for redistribution , at least in terms of criminality and welfare dependence .
Although it may be a stretch to conclude that re- spondents believed blacks and Latinos were no more likely than whites to rely on welfare or be involved in criminal activity , the results are suggestive and raise a number of interesting questions for future research .
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Understanding the social determinants of taxation is essential to under- standing the social determinants of redistribution .
This study therefore of- fers three contributions to the existing literature on race and redistribution .
Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1041 First , it demonstrates that increasing racial heterogeneity , specifically the in- creasing proportion of Latinos in a state , is associated with more regressive tax systems , including higher taxes on the poor .
Second , in so doing , this anal- ysis demonstrates that racial change , and not simply the level of ethnoracial diversity present , is a key driver of tax policy and preferences .
Third , evi- dence from the survey experiment highlights one mechanism through which changing racial composition may influence preferences for taxation : lower feelings of solidarity among whites toward new arrivals of color .
This mech- anism , motivated by Tilly ’ s notion of opportunity hoarding , may prove to be more useful than conflict-based theories of race prejudice in future explora- tions of the relationship between race and redistribution .
Although the state-level analyses presented above find % Latino—and not % black—to be associated with tax progressivity , it is important to un- derscore that this discrepancy may be in part a function of the time period analyzed , 1995–2007 .
Indeed , as described above , racialized conflict be- tween whites and blacks has played a central role in the evolution of sub- national tax structures in the United States since the colonial era .
For this reason , it is worth emphasizing that much of the “ effect ” of blacks on tax structure has already been “ locked in ” to state and local tax systems by 1995 , the first year of data used in the current analysis.Moreover , given that there is considerably less within-state variation in % black compared to % Latino during this time period , it is no surprise the models yield no signifi- cant association between % black and tax progressivity in these data , despite historical evidence detailing how racialized conflict centered on African- Americans has influenced subnational tax systems .
Although the conclusions of this study are broadly consistent with the ex- isting literature , the particular impact of increasing Latino presence on tax preferences and tax outcomes and the gendered differences in sensitivity to racial change warrant further exploration in studies of social spending .
Moreover , given the limitations inherent to using state as the unit of anal- yses , future work should explore the link between racial change and the dis- tribution of tax burden at lower levels of government , for example , counties or municipalities .
This would permit more detailed exploration of how the changing composition of blacks , Asians , and subsegments of the Latino pop- ulation ( e.g. , Mexican immigrants ) shapes tax policy .
Local-level analyses may also provide more analytic leverage for parsing how racial change is shaping public discourse as well as the political and policymaking processes that lead to reduced social spending and more regressive tax systems .
Stud- ies focusing onmunicipalities , specifically , would also permit analysis of non- tax sources of government revenue , including fines and fees , which are absent from the current investigation .
American Journal of Sociology 1042 The relationship between taxation and spending is complex and contin- gent on a wide range of historical , social , political , and economic consider- ations .
Regressive tax policies do not always correlate with low levels of re- distributive social spending just as high spending does not always correlate with progressive tax structures .
Indeed , across U.S. states we see examples of high-spending states with generally regressive tax systems ( e.g. , Massa- chusetts ) as well as states with relatively progressive tax systems that spend relatively less on social investments ( e.g. , South Carolina ) .
Cross-nationally , Prasad and Deng ( 2009 ) find that European countries with high levels of re- distributive social spending—and often characterized by high levels of social solidarity—typically rely on regressive tax instruments such as consumption taxes to fund generous social programs .
Conversely the United States has a comparatively progressive tax system but less generous social spending .
This underscores the need to consider both taxation and spending in analyses of re- distributive social spending aswell as the potential for new insights to emerge in the study of welfare states and political economy from grappling with the intersection of these two policy areas .
Under what social , political , economic , and demographic conditions is social spending funded through progressive versus regressive tax structures ?
Does the distribution of the tax burden in- fluence public support for redistributive policies and programs or is it the re- verse ?
The structure of a tax system has important consequences for inequality within and between groups .
Given recent evidence of the independent effect of tax systems on everything from health ( e.g. , Strully et al .
2010 ) and edu- cational attainment ( Newman and O ’ Brien 2011 ) to intergenerational eco- nomic mobility ( Chetty et al 2014 ; Chetty and Hendren 2015 ) , social scien- tists analyzing the role of policy in structuring life chances must consider the role of taxation .
Net of social spending , taxes can serve to ameliorate or exacerbate existing inequalities by reducing the real income of some households through taxation while increasing the income of others through tax transfers .
Future work should strive to account for both taxes and social spending when estimating the net effect of redistributive policy on every- thing from measures of individual and household well-being to aggregate levels of inequality .
In tandem with efforts to better integrate analyses of taxation into studies of redistribution , more work must be done to quantify and contextualize the structure of tax systems in contemporary societies .
The study of taxation—from empirically modeling tax structures and de- tailing their historical determinants to isolating their causal effects on state capacity , inequality between groups , and individual life chances—has the potential to generate new understandings across subfields on the causes and consequences of welfare state policy .
Redistribution and the New Fiscal Sociology 1043 APPENDIX Vignette from Survey Experiment Imagine you are a longtime resident of Chestnut County .
Chestnut County is a midsized county on the outskirts of a large American city .
The county has experienced rapid population growth in recent years , and most of the people moving to the area are [ white/black/Latino ] and generally low income .
Re- cent changes in the county have placed increased demands on the county ’ s finances .
