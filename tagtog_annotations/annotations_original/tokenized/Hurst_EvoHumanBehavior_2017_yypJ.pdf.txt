The current study ( N = 138 ) investigated the associations between life history strat- egies , symptoms of psychopathology , aggression , incidence of self-harm behaviour , and attachment ( perceived parental support ) in sample drawn from the general population and communitymental health service providers .
The results from the study indicate those with a faster life strategy report greater levels of aggression and symp- toms of psychopathology .
Further , perceptions of poorer parental support were associated with a faster life his- tory strategy .
Implications for life history theory , conceptualising psychopathology , and future research directions are discussed .

Introduction To what extent do early childhood experiences influence later mental health outcomes ?
Most theoretical literature from a develop- mental perspective ( e.g .
Beauchaine & Gatzke-Kopp , 2013 ; Hinshaw , 2013 ; Kerig , Ludlow , & Wenar , 2012 ; Mash & Dozios , 2003 ) suggests that negative early experiences result in an increased risk of psycholog- ical distress and symptoms of psychopathology ; however , what are the mechanisms that convert adverse environments into mental health difficulties ?
Evolutionary theory is well established in the psychological litera- ture to explain human cognitions , emotions , behaviours ( e.g. , Buss , 2005 ) , and even psychopathology ( e.g .
Akiskal & Akiskal , 2005 ; Andrews & Thomson , 2009 ; Murphy & Stich , 2000 ; Wakefield , 1992 ) .
More recently an evolutionary–developmental theory of psychopathol- ogy , incorporating life history theory has emerged that describes the complex interplay between development , biological , and environmen- tal factors that can result in later psychopathology ( i.e .
Del Giudice & Ellis , 2016 ; Ellis & Del Giudice , 2013 ; Ellis , Del Giudice , & Shirtcliff , 2013 ) .
Del Giudice and Ellis ( 2016 ) describe how individual differences in life history strategy can lay down the foundations for the develop- ment of psychopathology.ork and Social Policy , University ralia .

Terminology Ellis et al .
( 2013 ) highlight the discrepancies between the evolution- ary perspectives and mental health perspectives with the use and defi- nition of such terms as adaptive andmaladaptive .
From an evolutionary perspective any behaviour or trait that affords an organism an advan- tage that increases its ' chances of survival and reproduction is consid- ered adaptive ; however , from a mental health perspective adaptive is synonymous with desirable .
It is possible that traits and behaviours that are biologically adaptivemay cause an individual psychological dis- tress and/or interpersonal difficulties .
Therefore , consistent with Ellis et al .
( 2013 ) we will use the term adaptive to represent biologically adaptive and desirable to represent what mental health professionals often refer to as “ adaptive ” as to avoid any confusion between adaptive processes and socially desirable processes.1.2 .
Life History Theory Put simply , life history theory elucidates the allocation of resources between specific components of fitness to enhance survival and reproduction ( Figueredo , Vásquez , Brumbach , & Schneider , 2004 ; Figueredo et al. , 2006 ; Hill & Kaplan , 1999 ) .
Within a life history theory framework , knowledge of the environment and environmental pres- sures influence individuals ' decisionmaking processes about the alloca- tion of resources , finding a mate , the production of offspring , and parental investment .
Life history theory describes the adaptive choices made by individuals to optimise reproduction and survival on account of the environment , resulting in different life history strategies and developmental trajectories .

Kavanagh / Evolution and Human Behavior 38 ( 2017 ) 1–8Extrinsic mortality has been identified as one of the most important environmental determinants of the ideal trade-off between current and future reproduction ( Chisholm , 1996 ; Chisholm et al. , 1993 ; Figueredo et al. , 2006 ) .
This means that the reality of death from predation , homi- cide , disease , and accidents will influence the allocation of resources , and consequently life history strategy .
According to Figueredo et al .
( 2004 ) , when the environment is stable and relatively consistent , it is expected that individuals will adapt/naturally select a slow life history strategy ( K-selected ) .
Slow life history strategies are reflective of somatic efforts over reproductive efforts and parental efforts overmating efforts .
The somatic efforts emphasise enhancing the quality and survival of existing offspring by allocating more energy and resources to existing progeny through parental investment , rather than producing more – mating effort ( Figueredo et al. , 2004 ) .
An environment with low envi- ronmental risk and stability would facilitate increased parental invest- ment such as responsiveness , reliability , and sensitivity .
Life history theory suggests that the optimal reproductive strategy would be a high parenting effort strategy to maximise future reproduction by hav- ing fewer offspring , but investing heavily in their growth and develop- ment ( Chisholm , 1996 ) .
Conversely , people with fast life strategies ( r-selected ) allocate reproductive effort over somatic effort , and mating effort over parental effort .
This strategy emphasises the increase in pro- duction of offspring over the survival of existing offspring ( Figueredo et al. , 2004 ; Griskevicius , Tybur , Delton , & Robertson , 2011 ) .
Del Giudice and colleagues ( Del Giudice , 2014 ; Del Giudice & Ellis , 2016 ) describe four possible pathways for how life history theory may lead to psychopathology .
These causal pathways are : 1 ) adaptive life- history-related traits may be regarded as symptoms , 2 ) life-history- related traits may be expressed at maladaptive levels , 3 ) adaptive strat- egies may yield individually maladaptive outcomes , and 4 ) adaptive life-history-related traits may increase vulnerability to dysfunction ( Del Giudice , 2014 , p. 269 ) .
Therefore , while the behaviours in which people with a fast life strategy may be biologically adaptive , they are not necessarily socially desirable or conducive to health and well- being in the longer term , with traits and behaviours such as aggression , early sexual activity , and reduced empathy in possiblemanifestations of a fast life strategy ( Del Giudice & Ellis , 2016 ) .
Crawford ( 2000 ) referred to some of these traits as pseudopathologies to reflect the concept that although these behaviours may have been ancestrally adaptive , they are currently considered dysfunctional .
That is , such manifesta- tions , while adaptive , may not be considered desirable from a mental health perspective and would typically be regarded as symptoms of psychopathology ( Crawford , 2000 ; Del Giudice , 2014 ; Del Giudice & Ellis , 2016 ) .
Other symptoms of psychopathology , such as self-harm , may be the behavioural expression of a number of “ fast spectrum ” ( see Del Giudice , 2014 ; Del Giudice & Ellis , 2016 ) symptoms of psychopathology such as novelty seeking , risk-taking , disinhibition , impulsivity , and discounting future rewards in an effort at self-regulation .
That is , while engaging in self-harm on the face of it does not appear to be adap- tive , when used as a self-regulation strategy , it may help an individual down-regulate for long enough to engage other behaviours thatmay in- crease inclusive fitness .
Indeed , common explanations for the reasons for self-harming from those who self-harm ( i.e. , emotional regulation ) are consistent with this notion ( see for example , Hill & Dallos , 2012 ; Laye-Gindhu & Schonert-Reichl , 2005 ; Mangnall & Yurkovich , 2008 ) .
There are consistent findings that males tend to engage in overt ag- gression ( Crick & Grotpeter , 1995 ; Fanti & Henrich , 2014 ; Koh & Wong , 2015 ; Volk , Camilleri , Dane , & Marini , 2012 ) and females tend to engage in more self-harm behaviours than males ( Laye-Gindhu & Schonert- Reichl , 2005 ; Rodham , Hawton , & Evans , 2005 ) .
This sex difference may be due to the potentialfitness costs – that is engaging in aggression towards others is more costly for females than males , with greater po- tential benefits formales ; whereas , engaging in self-directed aggression ( i.e. , self-harm ) is less costly for females , given that it is rarely lethal , and provides no fitness benefits for males.1.3 .
Family Structure Men are not equipped with the biology to carry and nourish infants .
Therefore , men have an opposing strategy to enhance reproduction whenever plausible .
This means that men 's reproductive effort may not be with the same partner .
Unlike women having more children with their current partner , men with fast life strategies may reproduce with women outside their romantic relationships , or alternatively , leave their current mate and children , to reproduce with another mate .
Therefore , it is plausible that these children are more likely to be raised in single parent or stepparent homes .
Children living with one biological parent and one stepparent are 40 times more likely to be physically abused than those living with two biological parents ( Daly & Wilson , 1985 ) , with child abuse also a well documented predictor for adverse mental health effects and psy- chopathology ( Daly & Wilson , 1985 ; Spataro , Mullen , Burgess , Wells , & Moss , 2004 ; Wolfe , 2007 ) .
Children tend to respond to unpredictable and unstable environments by growing up quickly and living in themo- ment ( Ellis et al. , 2012 ) .
That is , children faced with unstable environ- ments and levels of uncertainty will naturally select strategies that maximise their current reproduction in the face of such difficulties , even at the cost of shortened lifespans and decreased social and emo- tional functioning ( Chisholm et al. , 1993 ; Ellis & Essex , 2007 ; Tither & Ellis , 2008 ) .
One could speculate then , that children from unstable fam- ily environments are more likely to develop a fast life strategy and sub- sequently develop greater levels of psychopathology .
1.4 .
Attachment , Parental Investment , and Mental Health There is considerable evidence linking attachment style to childhood social and emotional adjustment .
For example , Crawford et al .
( 2006 ) in- vestigated the associations between self-reported attachment styles and personality disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( American Psychiatric Association , 2000 ) and found a positive association between anxious attachment and clus- ter B and C symptoms , and a positive association between avoidant at- tachment and cluster A symptoms .
The results from Crawford et al .
( 2006 ) highlight the effects of early experience and attachment on sub- sequent mental health , especially personality pathology .
Life history theory explains attachment in terms of parental effort and the resources afforded to rearing and enhancing the survival and quality of offspring ( Figueredo et al. , 2004 ; Kaplan & Gangestad , 2005 ; Quinlan , 2007 ) .
Hill and Kaplan ( 1999 ) summarised the life history trade-off as being the allocation of reproductive effort to increasing number of progeny ( quantity ) or increasing the fitness ( quality ) of existing progenies .
This trade-off is assumed to reflect the limited re- sources of parents to invest in each child , and any future offspring inev- itably reduces investment amount per offspring .
A life history perspective acknowledges that when resources are scarce , it is not nec- essarily adaptive to have fewer offspring ( mating effort ) as to allow in- creased parental effort ; rather the more advantageous strategy would be to invest more energy into offspring production .
Chisholm ( 1996 ) found that marked individual differences in attachment are strategic as to optimise the trade-off between infant survival versus growth and development .
Specifically , children whose mothers have decreased availability and responsiveness , or are more intrusive or rejecting often , show an unwillingness to explore and play .
Insecurely attached children show increased aggression , anxiety , and depression when older , and aremore likely to develop interpersonal relational difficulties when compared to securely attached individuals ( Bartholomew & Horowitz , 1991 ; Chisholm , 1996 ) .
In sum , exposure to mechanisms of a fast life history strategy such as levels of parental investment and en- vironmental hardship potentially places children and adults at an in- creased risk for developing social , emotional , cognitive , and health problems ( Crawford et al. , 2006 ; Del Giudice , 2014 ; Ellis , 2004 ; Ellis et al. , 2012 ; Simons , Paternite , & Shore , 2001 ) .

Aggression Life history strategies influence parental involvement , with parental involvement in turn influencing aggression ( Crawford et al. , 2006 ; Marcus & Kramer , 2001 ; Simons et al. , 2001 ) .
Although aggression can be considered to be adaptive from a fast life strategy perspective , from a mental health perspective it is considered socially undesirable and is a predictor of poor social and emotional development , isolation , affec- tive disorders , and personality disorders ( Buss & Shackelford , 1997 ; Campbell , 2008 ; Crawford et al. , 2006 ; Crick & Grotpeter , 1995 ; Ellis , 2004 ; Marcus & Kramer , 2001 ; Simons et al. , 2001 ) .
Simons et al .
( 2001 ) found that the perceived quality of adolescent/mother attach- ment was negatively associated with adolescent self-reported aggres- sion .
Marcus and Kramer ( 2001 ) investigated the relationship between participant 's proactive and reactive forms of aggression , at- tachment with the participant 's mother , and pro-social behaviours and concluded that attachment to themother and pro-social behaviours significantly influences proactive and reactive aggression .
Children whom reported less secure attachmentwith theirmothers displayed in- creased reactive and proactive aggressive behaviour , when compared with children whom reported more secure attachment with their mothers .
Draper and Harpending ( 1982 ) investigated the effects of fa- ther absence during critical periods of development ( 0–5 years ) .
They found that father absent boys showed greater interpersonal aggression and an increased risk of arrest and incarceration when compared to males from a father present family .
As previously stated perceived mortality is an important environ- mental contributor to life history strategy .
Along these lines Dunkel , Mathes , and Harbke ( 2011 ) manipulated perceived life expectancy ( i.e. , asking participants to imagine they had five months , five years , or fifty years to live ) and then asked them about their future criminal in- tent , and reported positive associations between fast life strategies , ear- lier death , and great criminal intent .
Further , Mishra , Barclay , and Lalumière ( 2014 ) found that risking is increased in the presence of a competitive disadvantage , indicating that when individuals perceive they are at a competitive disadvantage they are more likely to engage in risky behaviours , such as aggression .
Finally , Figueredo , Gladden , and Beck ( 2012 ) have demonstrated the links between life history strat- egy and engaging in interpersonal aggression and intimate partner vio- lence .
The results from all of these studies support the links between life history strategy and propensity for aggression .
Sexual selection theory ( Trivers , 1972 ) predicts thatmales should be more tolerant to risk given their lower potential cost to reproduction , whereas females have greater potential costs .
Given the potential costs associated with aggressive behaviours , males should therefore generally be more aggressive than females .
Consistent with this propo- sition , a number of studies have demonstrated greater levels of aggres- sion inmales versus females starting at an early developmental age ( see for example , Crick & Grotpeter , 1995 ; Fanti & Henrich , 2014 ; Koh & Wong , 2015 ; Volk et al. , 2012 ) .
In sum , there appears to be an influence of life history strategy on engaging in risky behaviours such as aggres- sion and that this relationship may vary as a function of sex with men more likely to engaged in aggression and interpersonal violence than women .
1.6 .
The Current Research The aim of the current research is to expand the current life history strategy literature by exploring the associations between family struc- ture , life history strategies , attachment , symptoms of psychopathology , and self-harm behaviours .
We predict that individuals that report a faster life history strategy will have a greater number of half siblings or stepsiblings and will be more likely to have a stepparent .
With regard to mental health and attachment , we predict that indi- viduals with faster life strategies will 1 ) report more symptoms of psy- chopathology ; 2 ) report lower perceived responsiveness of theircaregiver than those individuals with a slower life history ; 3 ) be more aggressive as compared to those with a slow life history strategy ; and 4 ) report significantly higher incidence of self harm as compared to in- dividuals with a slow life history strategy .
Further , we expect that women will report a higher incidence of self-harm than men and that the associations between life history strategy and aggression will vary as a function of sex , with a ) males with a fast life strategy reporting higher levels overt aggression and females with a fast life strategy reporting greater levels of self-harm .

Method 2.1 .
Participants and Procedure Participants were recruited from numerous locations .
These includ- ed socialmedia websites , a university campus , andmultiple community mental health organisations .
Two hundred and nine participants initial- ly started the online survey ; however , 71 participants did not complete all measures and were subsequently excluded from the final analyses .
The final sample ( n = 138 ) consisted of 46 men ( MAge = 36.67 years , SDAge = 15.73 ) and 92 women ( MAge = 33.13 , SDAge = 14.16 ) .
Partici- pants self-selected to participate , provided informed consent , were not offered any incentives to complete the survey , and were able to discon- tinue at any stage .
Upon completion of the survey , participants were debriefed and thanked .
Exclusion criteria included anyone under the age of 16 years of age .
The majority of participants in the sample were from blended families with 83.3 % reporting having at least 1 half- sibling and 89.1 % reporting having at least one stepsibling , 8.7 % reporting having a stepmother , and 10.9 % having a stepfather .

Measures 2.2.1 .
Attachment Attachment was measured using the Adolescent Attachment Ques- tionnaire ( AAQ ; West , Rose , Spreng , Sheldon-Keller , & Adam , 1998 ) .
This particular measure of attachment was chosen as the main recruit- ment sites were community mental health clinics that specialised in the treatment adolescents experiencing mental health concerns .
The AAQ is a 9-item self-report measure with three domains ( availability , goal-corrected partnership , angry distress ) rated on a 5-point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree ; 5 = strongly agree ) .
The availability sub- scale quantifies the adolescent 's confidence in the responsiveness and availability of the parent or caregiver .
The goal-corrected partnership subscale measures the consideration and empathy the adolescent ex- presses to the needs and feelings of the caregiver .
The angry-distress subscale defines the quantity of anger within the attachment relation- ship .
Each domain consisted of three questions each , with the items for each of the three domains demonstrating high internal consistency ( see Table 1 ) .
Items were thus summed to form a total measure of at- tachment and the three attachment subscales .
The total score of attach- ment reflects the respondent 's perception of their relationship with their caregiver , and their caregiver 's responsiveness ( West et al. , 1998 ) .
The subscales and the total measure demonstrated high internal consistency .
Refer to Table 1 for the scale statistics for the three sub- scales and total measure of attachment .
2.2.2 .
Aggression Aggression was measured using the Buss-Perry Aggression Scale ( Buss & Perry , 1992 ) .
The Aggression scale is a 29-item self report mea- sure with four domains ( physical aggression , verbal aggression , anger , hostility ) rated on a 5-point Likert scale ( 1= extremely uncharacteristic ofme ; 5= extremely characteristic ofme ) .
All the items of each of the do- mains , as well as the total measure , demonstrated good internal consis- tency and were thus summed to form a measure of each of the four aggression domains , and a total measure of aggression ( see Table 1 for the scale and subscale statistics ) .

Life History Life strategies were measured using the Mini-K ( Figueredo et al. , 2006 ) and the High-K Strategy Scale ( HKSS ; Giosan , 2006 ) .
The Mini-K has been reported as more superior for assessing behavioural traits of life history strategy than compared to the High-K Strategy Scale that suggests more superiority in physical traits ( Figueredo et al. , 2006 ) .
Both measures were included in the study to provide a more robust measurement of life history strategy and in the current samplewere sig- nificantly correlated ( r = .71 , p b .01 ) .
The Mini-K is a short from of the Arizona Life History Battery ( Figueredo et al. , 2004 ) .
The 20 item self-report questionnairemeasures cognitive and behavioural aspects of an individual 's life history strategy and was scored on a 5-point Likert scale ( −2 = extremely uncharacter- istic of me ; +2 = extremely characteristic of me ) .
The scores were summed to produce a total life history score ( see Table 1 ) .
A positive score is indicative of a slower life strategy ( increased parental involve- ment and fewer extrinsic risks to survival ) and conversely a negative score is indicative of a faster life strategy .
The Mini-K demonstrated good internal consistency ( see Table 1 ) .
The HKSS ( Giosan , 2006 ) is a 22 item , self-report questionnaire that also assesses traits and behaviours of an individual 's life history strategy .
The statements are scored using a 5-point Likert scale to identify the ex- tent to which participants agree to each item ( 1 = strongly disagree ; 5 = strongly agree ) .
The items on the HKSS demonstrated high internal consistency and were summed to produce a total life history strategy score ( see Table 1 ) .
2.2.4 .
Psychopathology The DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure— Adult ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013b ) was used to measure the intensity and frequency of symptomology across mental health do- mains of 13 psychiatric diagnoses relevant to the Diagnostic and Statisti- cal Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013a ) .
These domains are depression , anger , anxiety , mania , somatic symptoms , suicidal ideation , psychosis , sleep distur- bances , memory , repetitive thoughts and behaviours , dissociation , per- sonality functioning , and substance use .
The questionnaire includes 23 items inquiring about specific symptoms during the past 2 weeks .
Each itemwas rated on a 5-point scale ( 0= none or not at all ; 1= slight or rare , less than a day or two ; 2 =mild or several days ; 3 =moderate or more than half the days ; 4 = severe or nearly every day ) .
For most of the subscales , a score of 2 or more warrants further inquiry of symptoms ; however , for suicidal ideation , psychosis and substance use subscales , a score of 1 ( slight ) may warrant further investigation .
See Table 2 for the percentage of participants whom met the threshold for psychopa- thology symptom criteria .
As we were interested in total psychopathol- ogy severity the scores on all items were summed to produce an index of psychopathology ( M = 40.10 , SD= 14.57 ; range = 23 to 84 ) .2.2.5 .
Self-Harm The Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory ( Gratz , 2001 ) is a 17-item self- report questionnaire thatwas used to assess the frequency , severity , du- ration andmechanisms of deliberate self-harming behaviour .
For use in this study , we adopted a method of coding and scoring developed by Gratz ( 2001 ) to calculate the total frequency of engaging in self-harm behaviours .
This is calculated by summing the reported frequency for each of the 17 methods of self-harm queried in the questionnaire .
See Table 3 for the individual frequencies of the various self-harm behaviours .

Results 3.1 .
Preliminary Analyses A series of correlations were conducted to determine the potential influence of subject variables ( i.e. , age and sex ) on the dependent vari- ables .
The results from these analyses ( see Table 4 ) indicated that peo- ple who were older reported more secure attachment , were less aggressive , and had less psychopathology .
Given these multiple associ- ations , age was entered as a covariate in all main analyses as we were interested in the associations between life history strategies and Table 3 The frequencies of women and men reporting engaging in specific self-harm behaviours .

Main Analyses Given the multiple partial correlation analyses that were conducted as part of the main analyses , we used Bonferroni corrections to protect from type I error ( Howell , 2002 ) .
As such , statistical significance was set at p b .002 ( i.e. , .05/30 = .001666 ) .

Life History Strategies and Family Structure To test if as predicted a blended family structure was more predic- tive of a fast life strategy a series of partial correlations controlling for age were conducted between the numbers of biological siblings , half- siblings , and step-siblings , and the twomeasures of life history strategy , alongside the presence of a step-parent .
There were no significant asso- ciations at p b .002 .

Life History Strategies and Psychopathology To examine if there were associations between life history strategy and psychopathology a series of partial correlations were conducted between the life history measures , total scores on the DSM-5 symptom measure , and frequency of self-harm behaviours , controlling for the influence of age .
The results ( see Table 5 ) revealed significantTable 4 Correlation coefficients for attachment , aggression , total psychopathology , and total fre- quency of self-harm with age and sex .

Neither of the life history strategy measures was significantly correlated ( p b .002 ) with frequency of self- harm behaviours .
To determine if , as predicted , the associations between life history strategy and self-harm would vary as function of sex , as series of mod- eration analyses were conducted using procedures outlined in Hayes ( 2013 ) , with sex as themoderating variable , and age entered as a covar- iate .
The results did not confirm any main effects for sex or any signifi- cant sex by life history strategy interactions .
3.2.3 .
Life History Strategies and Attachment To test the prediction that individuals with a fast life strategy would report significantly lower perceptions of parental/caregiver responsive- ness when compared to individuals with a slow life history strategy , a series of partial correlations controlling for age , were conducted be- tween both measures of life history strategy and attachment .
As can be seen in Table 5 there were significant correlations between both life history strategy measures and all subscales of parental attachment .
People who reported less empathy toward their caregivers ( goal direct- ed partnership ) perceived that their caregivers were less responsive to their needs ( availability ) , and reported greater anger within the attach- ment relationship ( angry–distress ) also indicated engaging in a faster life strategy .
To determine if perceived parental support independently predicted life history strategy over and above numbers siblings , two regressions were conducted – one with each life strategy measure .
That is , scores on the Mini-K and then the HKSS were separately regressed on attach- ment , while controlling for age , numbers of half- , step- and biological siblings .
The result from these analyses ( see Table 6 ) revealed that per- ceived parental support was a significant predictor of life history strate- gy , independent of numbers of siblings .
3.2.4 .
Life History Strategies and Aggression Next , a series of partial correlations were conducted to test predic- tion that people with a faster life strategy would be associated with greater levels of aggression .
As can be seen in Table 5 , therewere signif- icant associations for both measures of life history strategy and all com- ponents of aggression except verbal aggression .
People with fast life strategies reported more physical aggression , anger , hostility , and over- all aggression .
To determine if , as predicted the effect of life history strategy on ag- gression varied as function of sex a series of moderation analyses were conducted using procedures outlined in Hayes ( 2013 ) , with sex as the Table 6 The regression coefficients for predicting life history strategy from attachment , controlling for age and siblings .

Discussion As predicted , the results from the current study show that faster life strategies are significantly associated with more symptoms psychopa- thology and aggression .
Further , individuals who perceived poorer pa- rental investment and attachment relationships reported a faster life history strategy .
Life history strategies potentially influence mental health and psy- chological outcomes in a variety of ways ( Del Giudice , 2014 ) .
In the cur- rent study we identified some of the psychological constructs and behaviours that are potentially influenced by an individual 's selected life strategy .
The current study is a valuable aid in the understanding of life history strategy as a mechanism for the development of psycho- pathology .
More importantly this study provided the insights into the relationship between selected life strategies and an individual 's level of psychological functioning from a clinical psychology perspective .
More specifically we demonstrated how life history strategies are asso- ciated with the manifestation of DSM-5 symptomology .
4.1 .
Social and Emotional Development Chisholm et al .
( 1993 ) identified a slow life history strategy as opti- mal for social and emotional development .
The current research sup- ports this finding and further suggests that an individual with a fast life history strategy experiences greater social , emotional , and psycho- logical difficulties .
This consolidates and builds on previous findings that stipulate that an unstable environment ( fast life history strategy ) affects social , emotional , and physical development ( Chisholm et al. , 1993 ; Coccaro , Berman , & Kavoussi , 1997 ; Dunkel et al. , 2011 ; Ellis , 2004 ; Ellis & Essex , 2007 ; Figueredo et al. , 2004 ; Kaplan & Gangestad , 2005 ) .
The results of the current study suggest that a fast life history sig- nificantly increases reported psychological dysfunction , self-harm be- haviour , and aggression .
Individuals from a fast life strategy also endorsed poorer attachment to caregivers .
If a fast life strategy reflects greater efforts to reproduce , it would be expected that individuals from a slow life strategy to report a lower number of stepsiblings and greater numbers of biologically related sib- lings .
The results from our analyses revealed an association between faster life strategies and numbers of half-siblings ( pr= − .20 , p = .02 ) and step-parents ( pr = − .19 , p = .03 ) .
Although these correlations were not significant given our Bonferroni correction , these results do demonstrate a trend that is consistentwith life history strategy .
If a par- ent is to adopt a fast life strategy and invest in greatermating effort then it stands to reason that they would have multiple children to multiple partners , leading to fewer resources/time allocated to the existing chil- dren ( less parental effort ) , which in turn influences a fast life strategy .
The association between life history strategy and family structure isconsistent with the notion that paternal dysfunction and disrupted or broken families influence a fast life history strategy , and subsequently adversely affect the social , emotional and physical development of their offspring ( Ellis & Essex , 2007 ; Tither & Ellis , 2008 ) .
4.2 .
Attachment Due to parental effort being an integral component in determining one 's life history strategy we assumed that perceived attachment and relationship to the primary caregiver would be a significant factor influencing life history strategies .
As predicted the results of the current study revealed significant associations between life history strategies and all scales of reported attachment .
Parents who have more children have less time and resources available for parental investment , and the children may have to compete for such resources .
Individuals with a slower life strategy are typically exposed to greater parental invest- ment and somatic efforts , compared to reproductive efforts ( parents having more children and subsequently more siblings ) .
This greater in- vestment of energy and resources into the development of their off- spring facilitates the development of a slower life strategy , in turn nurturing greater attachment relationships .
The importance of this parent–child attachment process in predicting life history strategies was also evident independent of the potential influence of the number of siblings ( step- , half- , and full ) within the family .
That is , individuals who reported more positive and secure relationships with their care- givers appeared to have selected a slower life strategy .
There is substan- tial evidence suggesting that poor attachment ( reflective of a fast life strategy ) creates developmental difficulties in social and emotional functioning ( e.g .
Crawford et al. , 2006 ; Ellis , 2004 ; Figueredo & Wolf , 2009 ; Marcus & Kramer , 2001 ; Simons et al. , 2001 ; West et al. , 1998 ) .
Our findings add further support by demonstrating that faster life strat- egies are associated with greater aggression and more symptoms of psychopathology .
4.3 .
Aggression Ellis et al .
( 2012 ) highlighted the advantages of aggression for repro- ductive effort and status within a fast life history .
We predicted that in- dividuals from a slow life history strategy would report lower levels of aggression and aggressive behaviours and this prediction was support- ed by the results .
Specifically , individuals from a fast life history report- ed beingmore physically aggressive , angry , and hostile , withmenmore angry than women .
This sex difference in anger is consistent with evo- lutionary theory in that women have a higher replacement cost in regards to reproductive value , males are more inclined to show aggres- sion and provoke confrontations ( Buss & Shackelford , 1997 ; Campbell , 2008 ) .
Given that women tend to show more relational aggression than men ( i.e. , Crick & Grotpeter , 1995 ) the lack of a robust finding of aggression across domains warrants further investigation within a life strategy context .
The Aggression Scale used in the current study did not include items pertaining to relational aggression and exclusion 7J.E .
Hurst , P.S .
Kavanagh / Evolution and Human Behavior 38 ( 2017 ) 1–8from peer groups , hence may not have included more common aggres- sive behaviours of females .
Nevertheless , the results of the current re- search demonstrate that individuals whom receive more parental and somatic efforts , as a result of a slow life history strategy express less ag- gression than those with a fast life history strategy .
This result , coupled with the predictive nature of attachment on life strategy consolidates the findings of Simons et al .
( 2001 ) who found that more secure attach- ment resulted in less aggression .
Therefore , a fast life history strategy is not only reflective of lower levels of attachment ; it results in a greater number of aggressive behaviours .
It is interesting to consider themech- anisms for such aggression andwhether the increase in this behaviour is not contingent on poor attachment , but may be due to learned aggres- sionmodelled fromparents or caregiverswith a fast life history strategy .
4.4 .
Psychopathology Finally , we predicted that a fast life history strategywould be associ- atedwithmore symptoms of psychopathology and self-harming behav- iours and the results partially supported these predictions .
To further investigate we considered gender differences in the incidence of self- harming behaviour .
Contrary to prior investigations ( i.e .
Klonsky , Oltmanns , & Turkheimer , 2003 ; Laye-Gindhu & Schonert-Reichl , 2005 ) no significant gender differences were identified in the overall frequen- cy of self-harm behaviours ; however , women did report a higher incidence of specific self-harming behaviour such as cutting , and carving words or pictures into their skin .
Conversely , men reported banging their heads or variations of this as the most common method .
This finding suggests that previous definitions of self-harm may not have provided the diversity of options for men to correctly report their self-harming behaviours .
4.5 .
Limitations and Future Directions The results notwithstanding , there are some limitations with the current study .
The most salient limitation being that this was a cross- sectional correlational design , invoking the issue of causality .
Ideally fu- ture research of this typewould sample atmultiple timepoints to deter- mine the exact causal nature of family structure , attachment processes , life history strategies , and degree of psychopathology .
Most of the par- ticipants in the study were females , thus limiting the generalisability of the results ; however , this is also typically thedemographicwhoexpe- rience mental health problems and seek help in Australia ( Ivancic , Perrens , Fildes , Perry , & Christensen , 2014 ) .
The AAQ measured per- ceived parental responsiveness , rather than the traditional categorical models of attachment ( i.e. , Bartholomew & Horowitz , 1991 ) .
Although the current findings relating to attachment were significant , the AAQ may not have adequately reflected items that resonate with adults in regards to the perceived responsiveness of their caregiver .
This is be- cause it was developed for use in an adolescent population ; however , given that the current research investigated a broad range of ages ( 16–69 ) , and was attempting to target the lower end of the age range , it was considered most appropriate in this instance .
Finally , we chose to use a global measure of psychopathology to gain the best broad- brush strokes indicator of current symptoms of psychopathology .
While this was a brief global measure , the strength of using this mea- sure is that it reflects psychiatric diagnoses relevant to the DSM-5 ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013a ) , without increasing partici- pant burden .
Future research should explore which elements or components of fitness of life history strategies are most detrimental to future mental health .
The current study demonstrated the important potential influ- ence parental investment and attachment has on determining an individual 's life history strategy could be better substantiated using a longitudinal study .
It appears that aggression plays an important role as both an adaptive fast life strategies and an undesirable mental health problem associated with psychological distress .
More research couldimplicate specific vulnerabilities to certain diagnoses or personality functions associated with life history strategies , alongside fast and slow spectrum psychopathologies ( see Del Giudice & Ellis , 2016 ) .
Alter- natively , future research could investigate the role that slow life history strategies play in the development of pro-social behaviours , socially de- sirable psychological functioning , and coping behaviours .
The current study highlighted the important implications that life history strategies have on later mental health outcomes and life trajec- tories .
The implications for this research raise concern regarding the role that early interventions could play to combat psychological distress and maladaptive coping mechanisms of individuals with a fast life history strategy .
More specifically , it may be plausible to develop methods to easily identify individuals who select a fast life history strategy , or iden- tify inter-generational life history strategies in order to determine who is at increased risk for later mental illness or social and emotional diffi- culties .
This study has provided support to life history theory and the re- sults suggest that selected life history strategies directly impact and increase difficulties in psychological , social and emotional functioning , aggression and self-harm behaviours .
