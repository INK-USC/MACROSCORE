Using data from a panel of 34,621 households from India Human Development Surveys ( 2004 and 2011 ) , we examine the relationship between conspicuous consumption and subjective economic well-being ( SEWB ) using several empirical strategies .
Results support our hypotheses that higher conspicuous consumption may result in improved SEWB and that the effect is higher for households in the BOP .
Our findings contribute to the domain of conspicuous consumption and BOP in emerging markets .

Introduction Conspicuous consumption , driven primarily by its visibility rather than its perceived objective utility remains an area of much academic inquiry ( Hicks & Hicks , 2014 ; Kastanakis & Balabanis , 2014 ; Kaus , 2013 ; Wang & Griskevicius , 2014 ) .
However as evidence of conspicuous consumption emerges from low income populations ( Banerjee & Duflo , 2011 ) , it ceases to be an issue only of academic interest , attracting attention from policy makers and practitioners as well .
Why is it that the “ poor ” , who might be expected to spend more on basic necessities , divert expenditure to goods and services that appear to be exhibitionist and unproductive ?
An underlying explanation in previous inquiries has been the subjective utility ( perceptual in nature , and may not be related to objective utility ) that consumers derive from conspicuous consump- tion , based on their perceptions of status ( Powdthavee , 2009 ; Roychowdhury , 2017 ) and relative positions in society ( Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ; van Kempen , 2003 ) .
Although promising , in the absence of measures of subjective economic well-being , the explanation is also not one that is very easily amendable to empirical examination , especially in emerging economies like India .
Conspicuous consumption is defined as the use of resources to consume goods with the objective of displaying one 's high social status to others ( Veblen , 1899 ) .
Households may indulge in conspicuous consumption to reduce the dissatisfaction arising from their current level of possessions in comparison to their peers and to ‘ keep up with the Joneses ’ ( Christen & Morgan , 2005 ; Frank , 1985 ) .
Hence households may feel economically healthy when they are able and willing to signal higher social status via conspicuous consumption .
As a result , although considered wasteful from one perspective , conspicuous consumption might play a role in the perceived economic well-being of the house- hold , a dimension of welfare that is increasingly being recognized and studied .
This increased attention to the determinants of subjective economic well-being stems primarily from challenges to the assumption that economic growth leads to better welfare ( eg .
McBride , 2001 ) and that the “ happiness ” of a country may not be associated with its economic growth , a paradox labeled as the ‘ Easterlin paradox ’ ( Easterlin , 1974 , 1995 , 2001 ) .
Possible explanations have pointed to the idea that members of a society are more concerned about relative ( rather than absolute ) wealth levels , i.e. , ‘ keeping up with the Joneses ’ or outdoing them ( Christen & Morgan , 2005 ; Clark , Frijters , & Shields , 2008 ; Layard , 2005 ; McBride , 2001 ) .
Recent studies in emerging economies also suggest that households are likely to rely on conspicuous consumption to signal higher status in a society , especially when income inequality levels are higher ( e.g .
Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ) .
However , what remains under examined is the extent to which conspicuous consumption actually translates to higher subjective economic well-being .
The limited studies examining this relationship primarily use cross- http : //dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.05.027 Received 30 September 2016 ; Received in revised form 23 March 2017 ; Accepted 23 May 2017 ⁎ Corresponding author at : M-310 , New Academic Block , IIM Calcutta , D H Road , Joka , Kolkata , West Bengal 700104 , India .

T sectional data and/or small scale data sets restricted to small geogra- phies ( Linssen , Kempen , & Kraaykamp , 2011 ) , with the evidence re- maining inconclusive .
We contribute to the literature by using a nationally representative panel data set from India to estimate the relationship between the consumption of such conspicuous products and changes in the perception of one 's economic well-being .
Using an unique panel dataset of 36,421 Indian households from 2004 and 2011 India Human Development Survey ( henceforth IHDS ) , we find that higher levels of conspicuous consumption are associated with increased perceptions of subjective economic well-being and that this effect is even more pronounced among households in the ‘ bottom of the pyramid ’ ( henceforth BOP ) .
We believe that the findings from our study pose a number of challenges and opportunities to marketers and policymakers alike , in emerging markets .
The rest of the paper is organized into five sections .
First , we provide a brief background on economic growth and subjective well- being in India .
We argue that conspicuous consumption might result in an improved sense of economic well-being , as these households are better able to signal higher social status and are able to ‘ keep up with the Joneses ’ .
Second , based on the key characteristics of the ‘ bottom of the pyramid ’ in emerging economies , we hypothesize the effect to be higher for the low-income households .
Third , we explain the IHDS panel dataset and few of its unique features that help us in examining the relationship of interest .
Fourth , we present the empirical strategies followed to test the hypotheses and then discuss the results .
Finally , we explain the marketing and policy implications of our findings .

Conspicuous consumption and subjective economic well-being in emerging economies There is ample evidence for conspicuous consumption in developing countries ( Anderson , 2003 ; Banerjee & Duflo , 2011 ; Case , Garrib , Menendez , & Olgiati , 2013 ; Fafchamps & Shilpi , 2008 ; Guillen-Royo , 2011 ; Jin , Li , & Wu , 2011 ; Linssen et al. , 2011 ) .
Rather than dismissing it as irrational , literature from a variety of disciplines , including economics , psychology and sociology attribute the prevalence of conspicuous consumption to the attention people pay to relative rather than absolute standing in society ( Kastanakis & Balabanis , 2012 , 2014 ) , as a means of signaling social status ( Ordabayeva & Chandon , 2011 ) and overcoming feelings of relative deprivation ( Sen , 1983 ) .
The use of conspicuous consumption as an instrument to signal relative status has also been found to be significant in emerging economies such as India , and among the more disadvantaged within it ( e.g .
Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ) .
For instance , a field experiment by van Kempen ( 2004 ) also revealed that households in Bolivia , a developing economy , were willing to forego expenses on basic needs for conspicuous goods .
Plausible explanations for conspicuous consumption in emerging markets include seeing it as a substitute for educational qualifications and the absence of other means for signaling status ( Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ; Moav & Neeman , 2012 ) .
For instance , India and several other emerging economies such as Brazil , are characterized by lack of access to proper high return financial institutions ( Basu , 2006 ; Brown , Bulte , & Zhang , 2011 ; Claessens , 2006 ; Jung , 1986 ; Mahajan & Ramola , 1996 ) .
Due to this lack of access , households in emerging economies may not involve in ‘ status savings ’ ( Corneo & Jeanne , 1999 ) , but indulge in conspicuous consumption ( Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ; Powdthavee , 2009 ) .
An implicit assumption in these explanations is that while conspicuous consumption may not be productive from a material or a basic needs perspective , it serves to improve the subjective economic well-being of the consumers and hence the indulgence in it .
However , this is an assumption that has received limited empirical examination .
A plausible reason for the lack of empirical studies is the relatively recent attention that the idea of subjective economic well-being has received in studying human wel- fare .
While quantifying welfare has been a long-standing topic of interest ( Dolan , Peasgood , & White , 2008 ; McBride , 2001 ) , the last few decades has seen a marked attention to self-reported ‘ happiness ’ or subjective well-being ( e.g .
Easterlin , 2001 ) .1 A key finding in the subjective well- being literature is that the extent of economic growth in a society may not be associated with overall ‘ happiness ’ of the members of the society ( Easterlin , 1995 ) .
According to the ‘ Easterlin paradox ’ , “ raising the incomes of all , does not increase the happiness of all , because the positive effect of higher income on SWB [ subjective well-being ] is offset by the negative effect of higher living level norms brought about by the growth in incomes generally ” ( Easterlin , 1995 , p. 36 ) .
Instead , people are more likely to anchor their sense of economic well-being on the relative income levels prevalent in the society ( Layard , 2005 ) .
Since income levels are not directly observable , households are likely to resort to more visible forms of consumption to signal their relative status and find ways to ‘ keep up with the Joneses ’ ( Christen & Morgan , 2005 ) , and eventually report deriving ‘ welfare ’ in doing so .
Building on these arguments , we hypothesize that households spending a higher percentage on conspicuous goods , are more likely to report higher levels of SEWB .
H1 .
The amount spent on conspicuous products is likely to have a positive impact on SEWB , while controlling for objective indicators of economic growth and welfare .
2.1 .
Conspicuous consumption in the ‘ bottom of the pyramid ’ The literature on ‘ keeping up with the Joneses ’ and ‘ status con- sumption ’ , which links our hypothesized relationship between subjec- tive economic well-being and conspicuous consumption , can be seen as having its origins in the relative income hypothesis proposed by Duesenberry ( 1949 ) .
According to Duesenberry 's theory , a household 's attitude towards consumption and savings are greatly influenced by the relative position in terms of the household 's income , rather than by the abstract standard of living .
Further , the relative income hypothesis argues that the propensity to spend on consumption increases for a household in the lower end of the income ladder .
One of the key characteristics of emerging economies is the presence of ‘ below the poverty line ’ households , termed as the ‘ bottom of the pyramid ’ ( Prahalad & Hammond , 2002 ; Sheth , 2011 ) and several studies have examined the differences in consumption behavior of such BOP households ( e.g .
Elliot , Cherian , & Elaydi , 2014 ; Gau , Ramirez , Barua , & Gonzalez , 2014 ; London , Anupindi , & Sheth , 2010 ) .
While ‘ bottom of the pyramid ’ may just be an economic phenomenon as per the constrained view of poverty based on neoclassical approach , these households may be characterized by inclusion of sociocultural aspects of consumption , such as consuming for social acceptance and desir- ability ( Laderchi , Saith , & Stewart , 2003 ) .
Fueled by material depriva- tion that affects the sense of well-being and ill-being ( Bertrand , Mullainathan , & Shafir , 2006 ; Chakravarti , 2006 ) , the consumption propensities of the BOP households are highly influenced by the socioeconomic environment ( Sinha , Tripathi , & Mishra , 1982 ) .
Further , prolonged material deprivation may have an impact on self-efficacy ( Moller , Ryan , & Deci , 2006 ) , which in turn may result in the BOP households losing self-control ( Mullainathan , 2007 ) to balance the consumption across the present ( e.g .
conspicuous products ) and the future ( e.g .
savings and education ) .
This may further be complicated by the lack of future orientation among BOP households to produce imprudent consumption actions in the present ( Liberman & Trope , 2000 ; Lynch & Zauberman , 2006 ) .
Evidently , the motivation and con- sumption patterns of these BOP households and their resulting sense of 1 In this paper , we specifically focus on subjective economic well-being - a subcategory of overall well-being – a target variable of economic policy .
However , this is not a distinction that is always made in the literature , hence we broadly rely on the subjective well-being literature to draw inferences for our relationship of interest – subjective economic well-being ( SEWB ) and conspicuous consumption .
S. Jaikumar et al .
Journal of Business Research 86 ( 2018 ) 386–393 387 well-being may differ significantly from those of a typical household .
Few development economists ( e.g .
Sen , 1983 , 1999 ) have also suggested that capability-based assessment of well-being may be a more holistic approach , and that poverty should be viewed as the failure to achieve such salient capabilities which reduces the freedom of the poor to lead a quality life .
While Sen 's study is important in recognizing the need for the poor to develop the absolute capability to avoid shame as well as social exclusion ( Alkire , 2005 ; Gasper , 1997 ) , it is also important to realize that often the BOP consumers resort to consumption of products or services to avoid shame or humiliation associated with material deprivation ( Sen , 1983 ) .
Several studies in marketing have also discussed how certain consumption practices helps the poor in coping with poverty and its associated challenges , as well as increase their perceptions of well-being .
For example , studies have shown that BOP consumers increase their consumption to reduce feelings of alienation , or loss of control ( Alwitt , 1995 ; Hill & Stephens , 1997 ) , anger , or incapability ( Sen , 1992 ) , learned helplessness ( Rabow , Berkman , & Kessler , 1983 ) , or even escapism , addiction and severe mental illness ( Hill , 1991 ) .
Such consumptions are often conspicuous ( e.g .
a poor mother buying her child branded shoes to avoid humiliation of her child due to peer misbehavior ) and increased their perceptions of subjective well-being , as well as social inclusion .
Evidently , conspic- uous consumption among the poor in developing economies have been reported in several studies ( e.g .
Bloch , Rao , & Desai , 2004 ; Brown et al. , 2011 ; van Kempen , 2003 ) .
Hence we hypothesize that ceteris paribus : H2 .
The effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB is likely to be higher for BOP households compared to other households .

Data Emerging markets have been characterized by unprecedented growth in recent times , and it is expected that by 2035 , the GDP of the emerging markets would surpass that of all developed markets ( Wilson & Purushothaman , 2003 ) .
This suggests an increasing demand from consumers in these markets .
With the growing prosperity of emerging markets , and reducing gaps with their western counterparts , welfare has become an interesting area of research .
We study the relationship between conspicuous consumption and subjective econom- ic well-being , in the context of Indian households .
India , as one of the leading emerging markets , as well as world 's third largest market based on purchasing power parity index ( as per International Monetary Fund 2008 ) , liberalized her economy in 1991 , and since then the economy has undergone several changes in tune with the demands of globaliza- tion .
We use data from IHDS 2004 and 2011 to empirically test our hypotheses in the context of India .
In 2004 , the University of Maryland and the National Council of Applied Economic Research ( NCAER ) organized and conducted the IHDS .
Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 41,554 households across India , covering all the 33 states and union territories .
The survey covered 1503 villages and 971 urban areas across the country .
Further , the sample consists of 27,010 rural and 13,126 urban households ( Desai et al. , 2005 ) .
In 2011 , a second round of interviews ( IHDS II ) was conducted with a sample of 42,152 households .
Majority of the house- holds interviewed in 2004 ( 83 % ) were re-interviewed in IHDS II .
Further , the second wave of IHDS covered 1420 villages and 1042 urban areas across the country ( Desai & Vanneman , 2011 ) .
We merged the two surveys to create a panel of 34,621 households ( 69,242 observations across two time periods ) for our analysis .
Further , we also used the deflators specified in IHDS II to convert all amounts ( income and expenses ) in 2011 to 2004 values , thus creating a unique dataset that could provide rich insights into the changes at the house- hold level .
The IHDS panel dataset has several merits over other surveys conducted in India and other emerging economies .
IHDS surveys capture detailed information on the household income .
Income from various sources ( e.g .
business , farming , salary , labor , remittances ) is measured separately for each household .
This enables us to identify households that are below poverty line within a state .
Below poverty line households may be identified based on total income ( eg .
bottom 10 % households in terms of income within a state ) or based on income per capita ( and comparing it with the official poverty line index ) .
IHDS also reports detailed consumption information ( 47 categories in 2004 and 52 in 2011 ) at the household level , data that we use to construct our measures of conspicuous consumption .
The data collected by IHDS in the two survey waves mainly capture household characteristics using questionnaire items well established in the literature ( Desai et al. , 2005 ; Desai & Vanneman , 2011 ) .
Further , IHDS dataset has been used exten- sively in the literature to provide empirical evidence for a wide range of research work ( e.g .
Khamis , Prakash , & Siddique , 2012 ; Roychowdhury , 2017 ) .
The survey captures household consumption information across 47 categories .
We follow the classification schemes used in prior research ( Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ; Khamis et al. , 2012 ; Roychowdhury , 2017 ) and classify 12 of these items as conspicuous ( listed in Appendix A ) .
In line with our definition of conspicuous consumption , the 12 items meet the following two criteria : ( i ) be readily visible/observable by others , and ( ii ) create the perception that households consuming these items are , on average , economically better off than those who consume less of them ( Roychowdhury , 2017 ) .
We use the share of household expenses spent on these 12 items as a measure of visible or conspicuous consumption .
Further , in 2011 , the head of all households were asked : ‘ Compared to 7 years ago [ 2004 ] , would you say your household is economically doing the same , better , or worse today ’ .
In 2004 , the household heads were posed the same question , but on a 10 year margin ( compared to 1994 ) .
The responses were coded as 1 - worse , 2 - same and 3 - better ( increasing order of SEWB - recoded from original responses ) .
We use the response to this question as our measure of SEWB and the dependent variable in our empirical analysis .
Our measure of SEWB differs from other conventional measures of sub- jective well-being ( refer Helliwell , Richard , and Jeffrey ( 2015 ) and Dolan et al .
( 2008 ) for a larger discussion ) that ask respondents more explicitly to evaluate their well-being relative to that of a specific reference group ( e.g .
neighbours ) or a particular anchor ( e.g .
Cantrill 's ladder ) .
As stated above , the question explicitly asked respondents to assess changes in their economic circumstances in subjective terms and based on their own perceptions of how well they are doing .
In doing so , we believe it captures an important and distinct construct hitherto unexplored in the context of an emerging economy .
4 .
Empirical framework and results We employ an ordered probit model to test our hypotheses using the data from the two survey waves .
The rationale for selecting ordered probit regression rather than linear models ( or non-linear probit regression ) is that the responses to SEWB can be on three discrete levels .
The three levels have a clear order ( worse , same , better – increasing order ) .
Ordered probit models utilize this additional order information effectively in computing the likelihood of a household reporting each of these responses .
Using a linear model ( or a non-linear probit model ) would not effectively utilize the additional embedded order information in the response to SEWB .
We utilize the panel nature of the data and compute changes in share of conspicuous consumption between 2011 and 2004 .
A higher change indicates that the household is willing to spend a larger portion of its consumption expenses on conspicuous items in 2011 compared to 2004 .
By focusing on changes in conspicuous consumption , we partly address the issue of endogeneity that higher perception of economic well-being may lead to higher conspicuous consumption .
As we are examining the changes in conspicuous consumption against the percep- tion of changes in economic well-being in 2011 , we may attribute the S. Jaikumar et al .
Journal of Business Research 86 ( 2018 ) 386–393 388 perceived changes in SEWB reported in 2011 to the change in consumption of such goods .
Further , by controlling for reported changes in SEWB in the years before 2004 , we also control for any underlying differences in a household 's interpretation of the SEWB measure used by us .
We express the reported changes in SEWB as a function of changes in share of conspicuous consumption and other control variables and estimate the following ordered probit model : y k κ δx δx β X β κPr ( > | , , ϑ ) = Ф ( + ϑ − ) i i i i i i k1 1 ( 1 ) where i= 1 , 0.34,621 households , yi is the SEWB measure for house- hold i in 2011 , δx1 refers to the focal variable - change in share of conspicuous consumption ( share of conspicuous consumption2011 – share of conspicuous consumtion2004 ) , Xi refers to the vector of covariates , ϑi are independent and identically distributed N ( 0 , σ2ϑ ) , κ is a set of cutpoints κ1 , … κK − 1 , where K is the number of possible outcomes ( in this case K = 3 and hence there are only two cutpoints – κ1 and κ2 ) , and Ф ( . )
is the standard normal cumulative normal distribution function .
The response variable y , in this case , may take one of three values ( 1 , 2 or 3 ) .
The model may also be expressed as a latent linear response , where observed ordinal responses yi are gener- ated from latent continuous responses as shown below : y x β ε= + ϑ +i i i i ∗ ( 2 ) where error terms εi follow a standard normal distribution N ( 0,1 ) and are independent of ϑi .
This results in : ⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎩⎪ y y κ κ y κ κ y = 1 if < 2 if < < 3 if < i i i i ∗ 1 1 ∗ 2 K−1 ∗ ( 3 ) where 1 - worse , 2 - same and 3 – better .
We conduct the analysis with multiple sets of Xi – ( 1 ) with just the variable of interest : change in share of conspicuous consumption , ( 2 ) with state level changes in : mean income ( log ) and income inequality ( gini coefficient ) , ( 3 ) with household characteristics : location ( urban/rural , metro city ) , social group , number of members in the household , number of years of education ( of the most literate member of the household ) , SEWB in 2004 , and ( 4 ) with changes in objective indicators of economic well- being : monthly income and household assets .
The results of the random-effects ordered probit models are presented in Table 1 .
The four columns present the coefficients and their standard errors ( robust standard errors are reported in parenth- eses ) .
The fourth column corresponds to the results of the full model presented in Eq .
( 1 ) with state level controls , household characteristics and indicators of economic status .
In all the four models , the coefficient of interest , ( coefficient of change in the share of conspicuous consump- tion ) is found to be statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
Consistent with our predictions , the sign of the coefficient is positive , indicating that a higher share of conspicuous consumption in 2011 compared to 2004 results in an increase in the probability of the household to report an elevated sense of economic well-being .
Together , the effects indicate a significant shift towards a better SEWB ( =3 ) when there is an increase in Δ conspicuous consumption .
Further , consistent with earlier findings on Easterlin paradox , we find that changes in state mean income do not have any significant effect on SEWB .
However , an increase in income inequality is found to have a negative impact of SEWB , providing support for the argument that relative income levels may play a significant role in explaining SEWB rather than absolute economic growth .
4.1 .
Bottom of the pyramid We categorize the bottom 10 percentile ( in terms of household income ) within each state as the low-income group or the bottom of the pyramid ( BOP ) .
We then conduct a series of analyses to estimate whether the effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB is different for the BOP households .
First , we compare the effect between the bottom 10 percentile ( BOP ) and the rest of the households ( column 1 in Table 2 ) .
Second , we compare the effects between the bottom 10 percentile and the penultimate 10 percentile group ( the group of households just above the BOP line ) in terms of income within each state ( reduced sample of 6839 households - column 2 in Table 2 ) .
Finally , we compare the bottom 10 percentile and the top 10 percentile ( high-income ) groups ( reduced sample of 6809 households - column 3 in Table 2 ) .
In all these cases , we test Eq .
( 1 ) with all controls .
The results of the three models are presented in Table 2 .
Across the three analyses , the interaction term between low-income group and change in conspicuous consumption is consistently found to be positive and significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
Evidently , the low-income households are more susceptible to a sense of increased economic well-being when they set aside a higher portion of their expenses for conspicuous goods .
This effect is consistent irrespective of the comparison group – rest of the sample , penultimate 10 percentile ( in terms of income ) or top 10 percentile .
We present the predicted probabilities of BOP and top 10 percentile households reporting different levels of SEWB for a 1 % change in Δ conspicuous consumption in Table 3 .
The marginal effects are insignificant for the top 10 percentile income households , indicating that increasing conspicuous consumption did not change the likelihood Table 1 Changes in conspicuous consumption and SEWB .

However , in the case of BOP , there is a 6.5 percentage point ( p < 0.05 ) decline in reporting ‘ worse ’ SEWB ( =1 ) , 5.7 percentage point ( p < 0.05 ) decline in reporting ‘ same ’ SEWB ( =2 ) , and a 12.2 percentage point ( p < 0.05 ) increase in reporting a ‘ better ’ SEWB ( =3 ) .
Overall , results indicate that BOP households tend to derive a higher sense of economic well-being from consuming conspicuous goods .

Panel ordered probit regression To further verify our results , and to account for household time- invariant effects , we use the panel data and assess the effect of share of conspicuous consumption on SEWB .
Specifically , we employ a random effects panel ordered probit model : y k κ x x β κPr ( > | , , ϑ ) = Ф ( + ϑ − ) it it i it i k ( 4 ) where the subscript t indicates time period ( 1 = 2004 and 2 = 2011 ) and all other variables are defined similar to Eq .
( 1 ) , except that instead of δ we use actual values at time = t. Results presented in Table 4 ( overall effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB ) and Table 5 ( BOP vs. others ) are consistent with our earlier findings in terms of direction and significance reported in Tables 1 and 2 ) .
Specifically , we find that an increase in share of conspicuous consumption is associated with an increased likelihood of reporting better SEWB ( Table 4 ) and the effect to be higher for BOP households , irrespective of the reference group ( Table 5 ) .

Robustness tests We perform a number of robustness tests to ensure that the pattern of results hold under different specifications .
First , we specify conspic- uous consumption in two different forms –amount spent on conspicuous consumption ( in 2004 real prices ) and log of the amount spent on conspicuous consumption .
Second , we change the composition of the conspicuous goods - we use the top six items from Jaikumar and Sarin ( 2015 ) and Khamis et al .
( 2012 ) .
Third , we select one item – jewelry and ornaments as the conspicuous good and examine the hypotheses .
Finally , we change our definition of BOP from bottom 10 percentile based on income to bottom 10 percentile based on income per capita , and repeat the analyses .
In all these cases , the pattern of results was similar to those reported earlier .

Discussion of results Using a panel of 34,621 Indian households over 2004 and 2011 , we find that an increase in conspicuous consumption may result in the household feeling better about their economic well-being .
We use two different empirical approaches – ( i ) using an ordered probit model in which SEWB in 2011 is modeled as function of change in conspicuous consumption and control variables in 2011 compared to 2004 , and ( ii ) using a random effects panel ordered probit model in which SEWB is modeled as a function of conspicuous consumption and control vari- ables .
Further , we also examine whether the effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB is different for the BOP households .
We employed both the empirical approaches and compared the BOP households against ( i ) rest of the households , ( ii ) the layer just above the BOP households , and ( iii ) the high-income households .
Consistently , we find that the effect of conspicuous consumption on SEWB is higher for the BOP group .
Finally , we find the results to be robust to changes in the definition of conspicuous consumption and BOP households .
5.1 .
Policy implications The conclusion that conspicuous consumption has a significant impact on SEWB , beyond objective measures of economic well-being and economic growth , has far reaching policy and marketing implica- tions .
Our estimates suggest that the need and gratification from exhibiting status via conspicuous consumption would lead households to increase the share of conspicuous consumption to “ feel ” better and that this gets more pronounced in poorer households .
This does not necessarily represent a pathology among the poor , but a possible response to the institutional and structural elements that provide alternate ways of “ feeling better ” .
While an improved sense of economic well-being may be beneficial to the household and the economy as a whole from a policy perspective , an increase in the share of conspicuous consumption indicates substantial diversion of resources from other uses ( Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ; van Kempen , 2004 ) , which may have helped improve the economic status in the long term ( e.g .
education and savings ) .
Further this effect is found to be stronger for low-income households ( BOP ) indicating that such households are likely to suffer the consequences of lesser savings and weaker endowments in terms of education and assets , which is common across BOP in emerging markets ( Alkire , 2005 ; Bloch et al. , 2004 ; Gasper , 1997 ; Sen , 1983 ; van Kempen , 2003 ) .
If what drives people is subjective economic well- being , then our results that find the relationship between average state income and SEWB to be statistically insignificant , suggest that econom- ic growth in itself is likely to be an inadequate goal for policy makers , consistent with the Easterlin paradox .
Further , Rising inequalities ( Deaton & Dreze , 2002 ; Frank , 1985 ) will need increased attention as they decrease SEWB , as per our results .
This raises questions about policies like cash transfers that are increasingly finding favor in the development policy discourse .
Overall , we argue that the policy goal of the governments in emerging economies should be to provide better returns to education and access to well-performing financial institutions for the BOP .
Rather than focusing on an increase in overall state income , focus should be directed at reducing the prevalent income inequality .
Together , this would help improve perceptions of economic well-being while keeping conspicuous consumption under check .
5.2 .
Marketing implications From a marketing perspective , our results suggest that firms are likely to benefit from marketing their products , even to the members of the lower end of the income distribution , with a conspicuous value , stressing on the social benefits .
However , firms should also be socially responsible in the marketing message conveyed to the lower income group .
While positioning a product as status rewarding may be beneficial for the firm , but as our results suggest , it results in instilling a false sense of economic well-being in the minds of the BOP consumers .
This may result in a vicious circle of the poor remaining poor in the long term and may adversely affect the firms ' ability to sell high value products to that segment .
Evidently , the conspicuous nature of goods and services may be perceived as both an advantage and threat to the firm 's reputation .
In this perspective , we also agree with Shultz and Holbrook ( 2009 ) that marketing may be reducing as well as contribut- ing to consumer vulnerability , thus playing a paradoxical role espe- cially in the lives of the BOP consumers .
Hence firms may develop and emphasize goods that not only have a visible value , but are also socially productive ( Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ) .
This would help these BOP households in the emerging markets to overcome common misconcep- tions that increase their vulnerability in the market place ( Sinha et al. , 1982 ) .
5.3 .
Theoretical implications Our study makes several contributions to the literature on conspic- uous consumption and BOP markets .
The stream of literature on Easterlin paradox argues that relative income levels may explain the lack of clear relationship between economic growth and perceived well- being ( e.g .
Diener & Biswas-Diener , 2002 ; Layard , 2005 ) .
Another stream argues that consumers are likely to resort to different consump- tion behaviors to address the issue of relative income levels or income inequalities ( e.g .
Jaikumar & Sarin , 2015 ) .
We combine the insights from the two streams and find that households that use conspicuous Table 5 BOP vs. others : panel ordered probit regression .

Further , we contribute to the literature on human agency among the poor .
Human agency is defined as the ability of individuals to act and bring about a meaningful change in their lives as per their own values and objectives ( Lindeman , 2012 ; Robeyns , 2005 ) .
Prior research on human agency in the BOP suggests that individuals may utilize market devices that offer them agency to move out of poverty ( Narayan , Pritchett , & Kapoor , 2009 ) .
Evidently , conspicuous consumption could be viewed as market device that may bring about a meaningful change , in terms of perceived economic well- being .
While leveraging assets , a form of human agency may help households emerge out of poverty traps ( Narayan et al. , 2009 ) , our study identifies another form of human agency that may improve a BOP household 's perception , but may not economically help in the long term .
Thus , our work may also be relevant to the growing stream of literature on human agency and transformative consumer research ( Mick , Pettigrew , Pechmann , & Ozanne , 2012 ) that focus on improving well-being of the BOP segment .
5.4 .
Limitations and future work In concluding , we like to acknowledge a few limitations of our study and suggest avenues for further research .
First , we consider higher conspicuous consumption as an indicator of the household 's ability and willingness to spend on conspicuous goods to signal higher social status and derive a sense of economic well-being .
However each item classified as a conspicuous good may have a range within which the consumption motivation would be to signal social status .
Due to the limitations of the secondary data , we do not segregate the expenses under each item .
However , we do conduct a robustness study using just one item – jewelry and ornaments , considered highly conspicuous across its entire range ( based on the argument that there is no minimum threshold for its consumption to be conspicuous ) .
Second , while we address household specific effects on SEWB and conspicuous consump- tion using a panel model , we do not explicitly identify an extraneous factor to address any potential endogeneity issues .
As a result we can not rule out the presence of other time variant factors that are correlated to both changes in SEWB and share of conspicuous consumption .
Further research can focus on identifying potential instruments that may be related to conspicuous consumption and eliminate reverse causal effects ( SEWB affecting conspicuous consumption ) .
Finally , our hypothesis on the BOP households rests on the assumption that poor are market-savvy and their capabilities allow them to indulge in conspicuous consump- tions to experience a better sense of SEWB .
However , prolonged material deprivation in the BOP may lead to ‘ transcendent fatalism ’ , where the poor accept poverty as preordained by fate and lower their aspiration to cope with the situation ( Hundeide , 1999 ) .
This psycholo- gical barrier to happiness may thus adversely affect both conspicuous consumption and SEWB .
Further research may probe the drivers of SEWB in households that have been under prolonged material depriva- tion and have low aspirations in terms of social status .
