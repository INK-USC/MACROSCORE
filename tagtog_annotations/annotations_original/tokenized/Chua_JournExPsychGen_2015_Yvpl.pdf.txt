BRIEF REPORT Holistic Processing From Learned Attention to Parts Kao-Wei Chua , Jennifer J. Richler , and Isabel Gauthier Vanderbilt University Attention helps us focus on what is most relevant to our goals , and prior work has shown that aspects of attention can be learned .
Learned inattention to parts can abolish holistic processing of faces , but it is unknown whether learned attention to parts is sufficient to cause a change from part-based to holistic processing with objects .
We trained subjects to individuate nonface objects ( Greebles ) from 2 categories : Ploks and Glips .
Diagnostic information was in complementary halves for the 2 categories .
Holistic processing was then tested with PlokGlip composites that combined the kind of part that was diagnostic or nondiagnostic during training .
Exposure to Greeble parts resulted in general failures of selective attention for nondiagnostic composites , but face-like holistic processing was only observed for diagnostic composites .
These results demonstrated a novel link between learned attentional control and the acquisition of holistic processing .
Keywords : holistic processing , learning , attention , perceptual expertise Attention allows us to react to salient or surprising events ( Theeuwes , 1991 , 1994 ) and find information relevant to current goals ( Folk et al. , 1992 ; Bacon & Egeth , 1994 ) .
Attention can facilitate learning ( Shiu & Pashler , 1992 ; Ahissar & Hochstein , 1993 ) , but some learning effects are best characterized as changes in how we attend , or learned attention .
Attention can be guided by statistical learning ( Zhao , Al-Aidroos , & Turk-Brown , 2013 ) , or reward and past selection history ( Awh , Belopolsky , & Theeuwes , 2012 ) .
When task parameters correlate with item properties , map- pings between items and the relevant attentional set may be learned ( Jacoby , Lindsay , & Hessels , 2003 ; Bugg & Crump , 2012 ) .
Learned attentional settings can transfer to novel members of a category ( Bugg , Jacoby , & Chanani , 2011 ) .
Similarly , learned attention could account for phenomena related to perceptual learn- ing ( Nosofsky , 1986 ; Goldstone , 1994 ) .
For example , eye move- ments reveal that subjects shift from attending to all stimulus dimensions equally to dimensions most diagnostic for categoriza- tion ( Blair , Watson , Walshe , & Maj , 2009 ) .
Although most studies of learned attention use simple stim- uli , complex objects like faces can also trigger attentional sets .
For instance , in a study of cognitive control , subjects learned associations between face sex and proportions of congruent responses ( Cañadas , Rodríguez-Bailón , Milliken , & Lupiáñez , 2013 ) .
Similarly , learned attention to dimensions of complex objects such as faces may account for expert visual object processing phenomena such as holistic processing , the tendency to process objects as unified wholes rather than parts ( Young , Hellawell , & Hay , 1987 ) .
In Chua , Richler , and Gauthier ( 2014 ) , subjects learned to individuate faces from two novel face categories : Lunaris and Taiyos .
Diagnostic information for identifying each face was found in complementary halves of the two categories .
For example , the top halves of Taiyos and the bottom halves of Lunaris provided diagnostic information for individuation .
After training , subjects saw composites made of diagnostic and nondiagnostic face parts in the composite para- digm , a common measure of holistic processing ( Farah , Wilson , Drain , & Tanaka , 1998 ; Richler & Gauthier , 2014 ) .
In this task , subjects judge whether the target half ( e.g. , top ) of two sequen- tially presented composite faces ( made of top and bottom halves from different faces ) is the same or different while ignoring the other part ( e.g. , bottom ) .
Holistic processing is inferred when subjects can not ignore information in the task-irrelevant half , which is typically only obtained for aligned face halves .
In Chua et al .
( 2014 ) , holistic processing was only found for face parts that were diagnostic at training , suggesting that learned attention to face parts may be responsible for holistic process- ing .
This is inconsistent with the prevalent idea that holistic processing is strictly a perceptual phenomenon ( Rossion , 2013 ) , Editor ’ s Note .

The LunariTaiyo study challenged this sort of explanation , pointing to a role for learned attention in holistic processing .
This conclusion was also supported by the finding that sub- jects showed no holistic processing for face composites made of parts that were nondiagnostic during training .
Face parts with a history of not being attended did not trigger obligatory atten- tion .
However , while processing diagnostic and nondiagnostic composites differed , novices who had never seen Taiyo or Lunari faces processed them holistically .
Thus , because the stimuli were faces , this experiment could not track the acqui- sition of holistic processing for diagnostic composites with learned attention , although it did show how learned inattention can abolish holistic processing for faces made of parts with a nondiagnostic history .
In this study , we addressed the acquisition of holistic pro- cessing with novel objects .
We trained participants to individ- uate Greebles , objects that novices do not process holistically .
We used two kinds of Greebles that contained diagnostic infor- mation in different parts and then tested holistic processing for Greebles combining parts never presented together before .
In the TayioLunari study , congruency effects that did not vary as a function of alignment were observed in the nondiagnostic condition ( see Richler , Bukach , & Gauthier , 2009 , for evidence that this is not face-like holistic processing ) , whereas in the diagnostic condition , the effect was abolished in the misaligned condition .
The misaligned baseline should be more easily in- terpreted with novel objects because no congruency effect should be found in novices .
We also included an additional phase-scrambled baseline not expected to be sensitive to train- ing effects .
Method Subjects Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to either the Glip- Top/PlokBottom ( 18 men , 22 women ; Mage 21.6 years ) or the GlipBottom/PlokTop ( 16 men , 24 women ; Mage 21.9 years ) training condition .
Group assignment dictated which part was diagnostic for each Greeble category during individuation train- ing .
A control group ( n 40 ) received no training ( 16 men , 24 women ; Mage 20.5 years ) .
Subjects received $ 15 per hour for participation .
The study was approved by the Vanderbilt Uni- versity institutional review board .
Sample size was predeter- mined based on the Group Congruency Alignment inter- action in Chua et al .
( 2014 ) ( p2 .04 ) , and on our expectation that using fewer parts in the composite task would improve its reliability ( see Ross , Richler , & Gauthier , 2014 ) .
With 80 subjects and an alpha of .05 , power for the critical interaction should reach .90 .
Stimuli Stimuli were asymmetrical Greebles ( Gauthier & Tarr , 1997 ; Rossion , Kung , & Tarr , 2004 ) .
Ploks and Glips had distinct body shapes , textures ( see Figure 1 ) , and parts that pointed in different directions ( up vs. down ) .
All Greebles were presented in grayscale and tilted 40° clockwise to facilitate making composites without cutting any parts .
During individuation training , different stimulus sets were used depending on condition .
For example , in the GlipTop/ PlokBottom condition , three Glip bottom halves were combined with 10 unique top halves each , and three Plok tops halves were combined with 10 unique Plok bottoms each , to create 30 Glips that varied 10 times more in the top than in the bottom and 30 Ploks that varied 10 times more in the bottom than in the top .
A separate set of 60 Greebles was created for the GlipBottom/ PlokTop condition , with the reverse assignment of part vari- ability .
For the composite task , two sets of five unique top and bottom halves from the two categories that were not seen during training were used .
Composite Greebles varied on the top and bottom .
Therefore , all subjects were tested on Greebles with the same amount of variation ; any differences in composite task performance could only be attributed to training .
The top and bottom Greeble halves were randomly combined to form Plok- Glip composites ( 400 400 pixels ) .
A white line 6 pixels thick separated Greeble halves .
Misaligned composites were made by shifting the top and bottom halves 35 pixels to the left and right , respectively .
An advantage of the Greebles being tilted is that the misaligned object remains inscribed within a box approximately the same width as the aligned object , elim- inating a potential confound with the standard misalignment manipulation in which misaligned trials are wider .
Another baseline condition was added wherein task-irrelevant parts were phased-scrambled ( 83 % ; see Figure 2 ) while luminance , con- trast , and spatial frequency were preserved ( Sadr & Sinha , 2004 ) .
With faces , performance does not differ between phase- Figure 1 .
Example Glips and Ploks for a subject who saw Glips with diagnostic top halves and Ploks with diagnostic bottom halves .
The part that was diagnostic for each family was counterbalanced between two groups .
Note that the nondiagnostic half did vary ( there were three parts for each category , only one is shown ) , but there was 10 times more variation for the diagnostic half .

724 CHUA , RICHLER , AND GAUTHIER scrambled and misaligned baselines ( Richler , Floyd , & Gau- thier , 2014 ) .
Experimental Procedures Subjects completed three sessions of individuation training ( about 60 min each ) over the course of a week , followed by the composite task at the end of Session 3 .
Individuation Training Subjects learned unique names for 16 Greebles , eight from each category .
During training trials , subjects were shown Greebles with one syllable names ( e.g. , Awg , Dak ) .
Names were randomly assigned to objects for each subject .
In all trials , subjects pressed the first letter of the Greeble ’ s name .
Training trials were followed by test trials where Greebles were presented without names .
If a Greeble appeared that had no learned name association , subjects pressed “ n ” to indicate “ no name. ” Of the 30 Greebles for a given category , eight were assigned names for participants to learn , while the remaining 22 required a “ no name ” response .
Incorrect responses were followed by feedback showing the correct name ( including “ no name ” ) .
There were three phases on each training day ( see Table 1 ) .
All trained Greebles were introduced by the end of Day 1 .
Composite Task Stimuli in the composite task were PlokGlip or GlipPlok composites made of parts not seen during training ( see Figure 3 ) .
Five tops and five bottoms from each category , and their phase-scrambled versions , were used across all trials .
For each subject , half of the composites were made of parts similar to parts that were diagnostic during training , and the other half were made of parts similar to parts that were nondiagnostic during training .
Each trial started with a fixation cross ( 200 ms ) , followed by a study Greeble ( 200 ms ) , a blank screen ( 500 ms ) , and a test Greeble ( 200 ms ) .
Subjects were instructed to judge if the cued halves of the study and test composites were the same or different , while ignoring the other , irrelevant half .
On congruent trials , the cued and irrelevant halves were associated with the same response ( e.g. , both parts same , or both parts different ) ; on incongruent trials , the irrelevant and cued halves were associated with different responses ( e.g. , one part same , the other part different ) .
A congruency effect ( better perfor- mance on congruent vs. incongruent trials ) indicates an inability to selectively attend : the irrelevant object half influenced per- formance , despite instructions to ignore it .
On misaligned trials , only the test Greeble was misaligned to prevent pseudoholistic effects that are not sensitive to configuration ( see Richler et al. , 2009 ; Richler , Wong , & Gauthier , 2011 ) .
The signature of holistic processing is a Congruency Alignment interaction , with larger congruency effects on aligned than misaligned trials ( Richler & Gauthier , 2014 ) .
Likewise , congruency can be de- fined on phase-scrambled trials ( see Figure 2 ) , depending on whether the task-irrelevant phase-scrambled half is the same or different between study and test .
Therefore , holistic processing using the phase-scrambled baseline is also defined as an inter- action , with larger congruency effects on aligned than phase- scrambled trials .
There were 15 trials for each combination of composite condi- tion ( diagnostic/nondiagnostic ) , congruency ( congruent/incongru- ent ) , alignment ( aligned/misaligned/phase-scrambled ) , cued part ( top/bottom ) and correct response ( same/different ) , for a total of 720 trials .
Cued part was blocked ( order counterbalanced across subjects ) .
All other factors were randomized .

The cued halves are the same and the phase-scrambled halves are different , so this is an example of an incongruent phase-scrambled trial .

725HOLISTIC PROCESSING FROM LEARNED ATTENTION Composite Task Data from two trained subjects and two control subjects were removed for below-chance performance , leaving 78 trained subjects and 38 untrained control subjects .
Trials with reaction times less than 100 ms or greater than 2,000 ms were discarded ( 1.62 % of trials ) .
Sensitivity ( d= ) for control and trained subjects ( separated into diagnostic and nondiagnostic composites ) for aligned , misaligned , and phase-scrambled trials is presented in Figure 4 .
We found no evidence of holistic processing in control subjects , that is , there was no significant Congruency ( congruent/incongruent ) Trial Type ( aligned/misaligned/phase-scrambled ) interaction , F ( 2 , 74 ) .32 , p .73 , p2 .009 .
To assess training effects , all analyses were conducted twice , once comparing aligned trials with misaligned trials as the baseline , and once comparing aligned trials with phase- scrambled trials as the baseline .
In all cases , holistic processing was indexed by a Congruency ( congruent/incongruent ) Trial Type ( aligned/misaligned or aligned/phase-scrambled ) interaction .
With each baseline , we first conducted a Condition ( control/diagnos- tic/nondiagnostic ) Congruency ( congruent/incongruent ) Trial Type ( aligned/misaligned , or aligned/phase-scrambled ) analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , treating condition as a between-subjects vari- able even though diagnostic and nondiagnostic conditions were from the same individuals .
The correlation between holistic pro- cessing across conditions was expected to be small ( Ross et al. , 2014 ) , so there should have been a negligible cost in power for this strategy.1 To unpack any interaction with condition , we ran within- subject ANOVAs comparing the diagnostic and nondiagnostic conditions in the trained subjects , and between-subjects ANOVAs comparing each trained condition with the control group .
Misaligned baseline .
The three-way Condition ( control/diag- nostic/nondiagnostic ) Trial Type ( aligned/misaligned ) and Congruency interaction was significant , F ( 2 , 191 ) 3.16 , p .04 , p2 .03 .
With trained subjects only , the Condition Congru- ency Trial Type interaction was only marginally significant , F ( 1 , 77 ) 3.06 , p .084 , p2 .04 , with significant holistic processing ( Congruency Trial Type interaction ) for diagnostic 1 As expected , there was no significant correlation between holistic processing in the diagnostic and nondiagnostic conditions using the mis- aligned baseline ( r .10 , p .37 ) and that using the phase-scrambled baseline was significant but modest in size ( r .36 , p .001 ) .
This could represent an advantage of the phase-scrambled baseline for future work .

As expected , the Condition Congruency Trial Type interaction was not significant when the control group was compared with trained nondiagnostic , F ( 1 , 114 ) 0.59 , p .44 , p2 .001 , indicating that exposure to nondiagnostic parts during training did not result in holistic processing .
In contrast , the same three-way interaction was significant when the control group was compared with trained diagnostic , F ( 1 , 114 ) 4.50 , p .036 , p2 .038 .
This revealed more holistic processing for trained subjects judging diagnostic composites than for the untrained control group .
In summary , with the misaligned baseline , the within-subject training effect was marginal , but only diagnostic composites were pro- cessed holistically by trained subjects and not untrained control subjects .
Phase-scrambled baseline .
The three-way Condition Trial Type Congruency interaction was significant , F ( 2 , 191 ) 6.24 , p .002 , p2 .06 .
With trained subjects only , the Condition Congruency Trial Type interaction was also significant , F ( 1 , 77 ) 9.85 , p .002 , p2 .11 , with significant holistic processing ( Congruency Trial Type interaction ) for diagnostic composites , F ( 1 , 77 ) 8.62 , p .001 , p2 0.20 , but not for nondiagnostic composites , F ( 1 , 77 ) 1.38 , p .24 , p2 .02 .
As expected , the Condition Congruency Trial Type interaction was not sig- nificant when the control group was compared with trained non- diagnostic , F ( 1 , 114 ) 1.31 , p .25 , p2 .001 .
However , this same interaction was significant when the control group was compared with trained diagnostic , F ( 1 , 114 ) 9.97 , p .002 , p2 .08 , with greater holistic processing for diagnostic com- posites than for the control group .
In summary , there was more holistic processing in the diagnostic condition than in the non- diagnostic condition for trained subjects , and untrained control subjects did not process these objects holistically .
Discussion Novel objects like the Greebles used in our study are not processed holistically by novices .
We demonstrated that a his- tory of learned attention to diagnostic Greeble parts was suffi- cient for the acquisition of holistic processing .
This reveals a link between learned attentional strategies and visual object processing .
Accounts of item-specific attentional strategies sug- gest that stimulus features and responses are jointly encoded in memory so that attentional filters are later cued by the percep- tion of features with which they were previously associated ( Crump , Vaquero , & Milliken , 2008 ) .
Here , novices did not process Greebles holistically at all , and trained subjects only exhibited holistic processing for diagnostic Greeble parts .
We propose that when trained subjects were shown Greebles made of diagnostic parts in the composite task , they retrieved an attentional filter related to their past history of devoting atten- tion to those parts .
When both Greeble parts in the composite task are diagnostic , subjects can not selectively attend to one Greeble part , producing face-like holistic processing .
In contrast , no holistic processing was acquired for nondiag- nostic Greeble parts .
However , training did have an impact because there was a main effect of congruency in the trained group not found in Greeble novices , F ( 1 , 114 ) 4.10 , p .05 , p2 .044 .
Nondiagnostic parts may have become associated with an attentional routine to look for more useful information in a different part of the object , consistent with accounts of learned inattention and blocking during learning ( Kruschke & Blair , 2000 ; Kruschke , 2003 ) , whereby people learn to ignore irrelevant cues .
In contrast , the attentional routines that our subjects acquired for diagnostic parts were specific to the aligned configuration , as typically observed for faces ( Richler & Gauthier , 2014 ) .
The configural specificity of these congru- ency effects may be akin to learned attention that is specific to the encoding context ( e.g. , Chun & Jiang , 1998 ) .
However , the composites our subjects were tested with represent a new con- text in many ways : new exemplars were shown in a new task , parts were combined with parts from a different category with which they were never paired during training , and Greebles varied equally in both parts during the composite task , unlike during training .
Despite these changes , the task-irrelevant di- agnostic parts were difficult to ignore when they were aligned with a task-relevant diagnostic part .
This points to spatial configuration as particularly critical for holistic processing , but not because of a special representational status for aligned objects .
Rather , configuration may influence the allocation of attention during composite task judgments , perhaps through object-based attention for parts that are grouped perceptually ( Vecera & Farah , 1994 ; Baker et al. , 2004 ) .
Other work has suggested a role of grouping in the composite task , based on evidence that misaligned colored backgrounds behind aligned face parts reduce holistic processing ( Curby , Goldstein , & Blacker , 2013 ) .
Our effects are similar to those obtained in a number of other paradigms where attention is biased toward information with a history of being attended .
Because our effects are measured as reduced selective attention in a congruency task , they are similar to item-specific control during Stroop tasks ( Cañadas et al. , 2013 ; Bugg et al. , 2011 ) .
Because our effects lead to spatial bias attached to a specific visual context , they evoke contextual cueing in which subjects implicitly learn spatial invariants in visual scenes ( Chun & Jiang , 1998 ) .
However , in contrast to contextual cueing and item-specific control paradigms , our subjects carried attentional settings from a naming task to the composite task .
This renders explanations based on conflict ( which did not exist during naming ) or learned response associations ( because naming responses do not predict congruency ) improbable .
In category learning , attention can shift to a dimension that was useful in a previous categoriza- tion task , and , like our effects , this can occur with transfer objects and a new task ( Goldstone , 1994 ) , and sometimes last for days ( Folstein , Newton , Van Gulick , Palmeri , & Gauthier , 2012 ) .
As in item-specific control , the effects can be stimulus-specific ( Aha & Goldstone , 1992 ; Van Gulick & Gauthier , 2014 ) and may become category specific after multiple exemplars are encoded ( Nosofsky , 1986 ) .
Category-specific ( or context-specific ) control has also been described within Stroop paradigms ( e.g. , Bugg , Jacoby , & Toth , 2008 ) .
Finally , our results are also similar to effects obtained in the task-switching literature , where task-stimulus associations have long-term effects , primarily on trials when there is conflict , as in the composite task ( Waszak , Hommel , & Allport , 2003 ) .
Which of these effects is most similar to holistic processing remains to be determined .
Critically , these attentional accounts do not require encoding of unitary representations , a common account of holistic processing ( Tanaka & Farah , 1993 ) .

727HOLISTIC PROCESSING FROM LEARNED ATTENTION Together with our previous finding that holistic processing was only evident when both parts of a test face benefitted from a history of attention ( Chua et al. , 2014 ) , the present results suggest that failures of selective attention to diagnostic parts are qualita- tively different from those to nondiagnostic parts .
Face-like holis- tic effects appear to require that both the task-relevant and task- irrelevant parts have a history of being attended and that the parts be perceptually grouped , allowing this attentional effect to apply to the entire object .
More work is required to account for this con- figurally specific learned attention in computational models of attention , but our results provide clear answers to the questions that motivated this work : holistic processing can be acquired for non- face objects , and all that is required is a history of attention to parts .

Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process .
As a reviewer , you would gain valuable experience in publishing .
The P & C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process .
If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts , please write APA Journals at Reviewers @ apa.org .
Please note the following important points : • To be selected as a reviewer , you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals .
The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough , objective review .
• To be selected , it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review .
Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research .
• To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript , the editor needs detailed information .
Please include with your letter your vita .
In the letter , please identify which APA journal ( s ) you are interested in , and describe your area of expertise .
Be as specific as possible .
For example , “ social psychology ” is not sufficient—you would need to specify “ social cognition ” or “ attitude change ” as well .
• Reviewing a manuscript takes time ( 1–4 hours per manuscript reviewed ) .
If you are selected to review a manuscript , be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly .
APA now has an online video course that provides guidance in reviewing manuscripts .
To learn more about the course and to access the video , visit http : //www.apa.org/pubs/authors/review- manuscript-ce-video.aspx .
