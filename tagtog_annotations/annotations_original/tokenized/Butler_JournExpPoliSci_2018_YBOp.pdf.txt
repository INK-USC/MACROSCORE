Journal of Experimental Political Science 5 ( 2018 ) 68–70 doi:10.1017/XPS.2017.20 Are Donations to Charity an Effective Incentive for Public Officials ?
Daniel M. Butler∗ and Miguel M. Pereira† Incentivized experiments are frequently used to learn about individuals ’ social , political , and economic behavior .
However , public officials and other individuals are sometimes barred from accepting payment for anything related to their position , so money can not be used in experiments ( e.g. , Butler and Kousser 2015 ) .
We assess whether donations to charity can be used to incentivize public officials , as an alternative to traditional monetary inducements .
We conducted our tests at the National Conference of State Legislatures ( NCSL ) and the National League of Cities ( NLC ) , where we rented a booth in the exhibit hall and recruited attendees to take a survey.1 For the study , we randomized what , if any , incentives the officials received .
One-third of officials were not given any incentive for their performance , another third were told that they would be paid based upon their performance , and the final third were told that money would be donated to a charity of their choice and that the amount of money would depend upon their performance.2 Table 1 presents the effect of different incentives on the two outcomes we looked at.3 Column 1 looks at the results from a quiz designed to measure political The replication archive for this study is available at Journal of Experimental Political Science Dataverse within the Harvard Dataverse Network at : doi : 10.7910/DVN/KSKR7F .

knowledge .
The dependent variable measures , for each individual , the average distance from the correct answers.4 The coefficients for both types of incentives were statistically significant at the 0.05 level and had a negative coefficient around −0.02 , showing that individuals who received the incentives were closer to getting the correct answers .
This effect is smaller than what previous researchers found when studying the effect of incentives on voters ( Bullock et al .
2015 ; Prior et al .
2015 ) , but it is still substantively meaningful .
The average value of the dependent variable was 0.29 .
Thus , receiving the incentives caused respondents to reduce their error rate by 7–9 % ( −0.0210.29 = −0.07 and −0.0270.29 = −0.09 ) .
These findings are consistent with previous results showing that respondents reduce their error rate when they are incentivized ( see review in Morton and Williams 2010 ) .
We also tested whether the types of incentives caused a change in how risk averse the participants were ( see Column 2 ) .
We measured risk aversion using the survey item developed by Eckel and Grossman ( 2002 ) .
The results show that the incentives have no statistically distinguishable effect on officials ’ risk aversion .
There is interest in expanding the types of subject pools we use for experiments ( Kam et al .
2007 ; Grose 2014 ) .
As we expand the subject pool for incentivized experiments , we need to ensure that the type of incentives adopted are effective for the population we are studying ( Morton 2012 ) .
Our results suggest that when direct payments are not possible ( see e.g. , Butler and Kousser 2015 ) , donations to charity are a promising alternative that can be used to incentivize public officials or other participants who can not accept direct payments .
