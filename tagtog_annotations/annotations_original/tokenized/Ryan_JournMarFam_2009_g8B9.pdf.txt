REBECCA M. RYAN AND ARIEL KALIL The University of Chicago LINDSEY LEININGER University of Wisconsin-Madison* Low-Income Mothers ’ Private Safety Nets and Children ’ s Socioemotional Well-Being Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Fami- lies and Child Well-being Study ( N ¼ 1,162 ) and the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies ( N ¼ 1,308 ) , we estimate associations between material and instrumental support avail- able to low-income mothers and young children ’ s socioemotional well-being .
In multivariate OLS models , we find mothers ’ available support is negatively associated with children ’ s behavior problems and positively associated with prosocial behavior in both data sets ; associations between available support and children ’ s internalizing and prosocial behaviors attenuate but remain robust in residualized change models .
Overall , results support the hypothesis that the availability of a private safety net is positively associated with children ’ s socioemotional adjustment .
Since the passage of the 1996 Personal Responsi- bility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ( PRWORA ) , which replaced federal entitlement to cash assistance with time-limited , work-based assistance under Temporary Assistance for Nee- dy Families ( TANF ) , welfare recipients , and low-income parents generally , have had to support their families increasingly through employment and other nonwelfare sources .
Public concern has been raised over families ’ economic and socio- emotional well-being in the wake of these changes ( Duncan & Chase-Lansdale , 2001 ) , particularly because research suggests it is extremely difficult to support a family on TANF benefits or earnings from low-wage work alone ( Edin & Lein , 1997 ) .
As low-income parents struggle to raise children in this policy context , they may turn more often to private sources of material and instrumental support to ease their economic strain and the emo- tional stress that so often accompanies it .
Much qualitative sociological research has described the essential role material and instru- mental support from family and friends can play in low income parents ’ economic survival ( Edin & Lein , 1997 ; Massey & Denton , 1993 ; Wilson , 1996 ) .
Recently , researchers have begun to quan- tify these links using newly available , large-scale data sets of low-income families or longitudinal studies of former welfare recipients ( Harknett , 2006 ; Henly , Danziger , & Offer , 2005 ; Turney & Harknett , 2007 ) .
Although these studies docu- ment the way material and instrumental support can improve low-income parents ’ economic cir- cumstances , they do not examine the implications of that support for children ’ s well-being .
Devel- opmental psychological research explores this link by examining informal support as a mediator between economic hardship and child well- being , but many such studies rely on small , com- munity-based , or cross-sectional samples or a combination of these and do not estimate the The Harris School of Public Policy Studies , The University of Chicago , 1155 E. 60th Street , Chicago IL , 60637 ( rmryan @ uchicago.edu ) .

278 Journal of Marriage and Family 71 ( May 2009 ) : 278–297 direct link between social support and children ’ s well-being with robust controls for endogenous maternal and child characteristics ( Burchinal , Follmer , & Bryant , 1996 ; Jackson , Brooks- Gunn , Huang , & Glassman , 2000 ; McLoyd , Jayaratne , Ceballo , & Borquez , 1994 ) .
We aim to bridge these literatures by estimating the asso- ciation between material and instrumental sup- port and children ’ s socioemotional adjustment in two recent large-scale longitudinal studies of low-income mothers .
In doing so , we aim to high- light an important protective factor for children growing up in low-income families .
Defining Private Safety Nets In the sociology and developmental psychology literatures , ‘ ‘ social support ’ ’ is a broad construct that includes cash , in-kind , and instrumental assistance along with emotional support ( Sarason , Sarason , & Pierce , 1990 ) and the quality and quantity of interpersonal relationships ( Pattison , DeFrancisco , Wood , Frazier , & Crowder , 1975 ) .
We focus here on material support , defined as cash or in-kind financial assistance , and instrumental support , defined as help in care- giving , transportation , and other daily tasks .
By tangibly alleviating the economic strain low- income families experience , cash or in-kind sup- port should have the most direct impact on the material resources available to children .
By meaningfully reducing daily life strains , material and instrumental support should enhance moth- ers ’ emotional resources for parenting .
We bor- row the term ‘ ‘ private safety net ’ ’ from Edin and Lein ( 1997 ) and subsequently Harknett ( 2006 ) to describe this construct because the term emphasizes not only the type of support we exam- ine but also the protective role we believe it could play in low-income families ’ lives .
Our measures of private safety nets tap the availability of support to mothers , rather than its actual receipt .
As in Harknett ( 2006 ) , we conceive of the availability of support as a form of ‘ ‘ insurance ’ ’ against the risks posed by life at the economic margins .
By defining private safety nets as the ability to draw upon support when needed , one better avoids confounding the availability of support—a positive attribu- te—with the immediate need for support—an indicator of risk ( Harknett ; Henly et al. , 2005 ; Sarason et al. , 1990 ) .
Additionally , literature suggests that heavy reliance on private sources of support can strain interpersonal relationships and in so doing may induce as much stress as it alleviates ( Antonucci & Jackson , 1990 ; Howard , 2006 ) .
Perhaps for this reason , some studies have found that it is only the availability of sup- port , and not its actual receipt , that predicts bet- ter economic and emotional outcomes among low-income mothers ( Hashima & Amato , 1994 ; Henly et al .
; Howard , 2006 ; Thoits , 1995 ; We- therington & Kessler , 1986 ) .
By defining safety nets in terms of availability , our measures necessarily reflect mothers ’ percep- tions of that availability .
Insofar as perceiving that support is available enhances mothers ’ emo- tional well-being , which in turn could benefit child development , these perceptions may par- tially , and legitimately , drive positive associa- tions between safety nets and child well-being .
It also may be true , however , that perceptions are driven by maternal characteristics , such as self-esteem and internal locus of control , which are independently linked to children ’ s socioemo- tional well-being ( Downey & Coyne , 1990 ) , and could thus produce spurious associations between private safety nets and child well-being .
To establish that mothers who believe they have strong safety nets actually have greater access to resources than mothers with weak safety nets , we compare our measure of perceived safety net availability to mothers ’ actual receipt of financial assistance from informal sources .
This point will be elaborated upon in the Method section .
Private Safety Nets and Maternal Well-Being Studies examining low-income mothers ’ actual and potential receipt of material and instrumental support have documented links between private safety nets and economic well-being .
Cash assis- tance from friends and family can help mothers pay for essentials , such as food , rent , and utilities , and nonessentials , such as new clothes for chil- dren and meals at inexpensive restaurants ( Edin & Lein , 1997 ) , which can relieve real and perceived economic strain ( Edin & Lein ; Henly et al. , 2005 ; Howard , 2006 ) .
Material support that is delivered in kind , such as diapers , food , and toys , can serve a similar function ( Edin & Lein ) .
Research also documents the importance of instrumental sup- port , such as emergency ( or regular ) help with child care and transportation as key factors in low income mothers ’ ability to find or keep a job ( Henly , 2002 ; Knox , London , & Scott , 2003 ) .
Although debate exists over whether informal support helps low-income mothers improve their Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 279 economic well-being ( Harknett , 2006 ; Henly et al .
) , qualitative and quantitative research indi- cate that such support is crucial to their economic survival .
It is also possible that activating , or simply having the potential to activate , a private safety net in times of need can relieve emotional stress associated with chronic economic strains and periodic financial crises ( Thoits , 1995 ) .
Indeed , receiving material and instrumental support from family and friends has been associated with lower psychological distress among poor and low- income parents ( Jackson et al. , 2000 ; Simons , Lorenz , Wu , & Conger , 1993 ) .
Qualitative re- search also describes how merely believing rela- tives or friends would help if necessary can make mothers feel less hopeless , isolated , and anxious and instill a sense of belonging ( Henly , 2002 ; House , Umberson , & Landis , 1988 ; Howard , 2006 ) .
Thus , whether informal support is real or perceived , it is clear that the availability of a strong private safety net can bolster mothers ’ economic and emotional well-being in the face of financial hardship .
Private Safety Nets and Child Well-Being A large body of research links early childhood poverty and financial hardship with unfavorable socioemotional outcomes in children ( Duncan & Brooks-Gunn , 1997 ) .
Economic theory suggests that low income negatively impacts children ’ s development because it prevents parents from purchasing essential and enriching materials , ex- periences , and services ( Haveman & Wolfe , 1994 ) .
A complementary view exemplified by the family stress model emphasizes how financial pressure or deprivation undermines parents ’ soci- oemotional resources and disrupts parent-child interactions and child development as a result ( Conger & Conger , 2000 ; Dodge , Pettit , & Bates , 1994 ) .
Private safety nets could facilitate low- income children ’ s socioemotional development through both theorized pathways .
By reducing their mothers ’ experience of financial hardship , private safety nets allow mothers to invest more and steadier resources in children , thereby enhancing their socioemotional development .
As well , by bolstering mothers ’ emotional well- being , private safety nets protect against disrup- ted parent-child interactions and , thus , negative socioemotional outcomes .
Existing research provides theoretical and empirical support for this hypothesis .
Studies of low-income parents find that those with strong material and instrumental support interact in more supportive and less punitive ways with their children ( Hashima & Amato , 1994 ; Leinonen , Solantaus , & Punamaki , 2003 ) .
Studies in devel- opmental psychology find that low-income moth- ers ’ perceived instrumental support is associated with children ’ s behavioral adjustment indirectly through improved maternal emotional well-being and parenting quality .
These studies , however , either do not find a direct link between social sup- port and child outcomes ( Burchinal et al. , 1996 ; Jackson et al. , 2000 ) or do not test for one ( McLoyd et al. , 1994 ) .
Moreover , they use small , community-based samples and do not employ robust methods to account for potentially con- founding maternal and child characteristics .
Nonetheless , they provide support for our hypothesis and illuminate mechanisms through which the association between private safety nets and child socioemotional well-being may operate .
Accounting for Endogenous and Simultaneous Associations In addressing this research question , it is impor- tant to consider that observed and unobserved maternal characteristics may bias any association between private safety nets and children ’ s well- being .
Some mothers may have interpersonal or economic strengths that make it easier for them to generate strong private safety nets .
Literature on the importance of reciprocity in social net- works supports this view , for it finds that in order to receive instrumental or material support , one often needs to be able to offer some kind of help in return ( Antonucci & Jackson , 1990 ) .
The indi- vidual strengths mothers use to build strong net- works in turn may be associated with more optimal child behavior through genetic endow- ment , parenting quality , or other aspects of the home environment .
We used two approaches to minimize the threat of endogenous maternal characteristics in our analyses .
First , we included a robust battery of covariates in models to control for observed maternal background , socioeconomic , and per- sonal characteristics , including her parents ’ level of education , whether she lived with both parents at age 15 , her cognitive ability , and her socioemo- tional well-being .
We also controlled for house- hold structure to distinguish the influence of having a private safety net from simply living 280 Journal of Marriage and Family with ready sources of material and instrumental support .
We also included indicators of mothers ’ use of public safety nets such as TANF , the Women , Infants , and Children Program ( WIC ) , and food stamps because these supports could reduce the need for informal support or indicate greater economic disadvantage .
Second , our regression models controlled for earlier measures of each dependent variable to account for unob- served time-invariant maternal and child charac- teristics ( this approach is sometimes called a ‘ ‘ residualized change model ’ ’ ; National Insti- tute for Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network & Duncan , 2003 ) .
Although neither of these approaches can fully account for potential endogeneity in the association between private safety nets and child behavior , they offered more conservative estimations than did previous research .
In addition to endogeneity , simultaneity could bias our estimation of the association between private safety nets and child outcomes , for just as private safety nets could influence children , child well-being could influence mothers ’ access to support .
For instance , if a child behaves very aggressively , it may be difficult for the mother to recruit instrumental support , particularly in the form of emergency child care , because others will not want to interact with the child .
Although it is impossible to rule out this and other scenar- ios , in additional analyses we strive to ensure that child behavior does not wholly drive the hypoth- esized association by predicting child behavioral outcomes from mothers ’ safety net availability at the time of the child ’ s birth , presumably before the child ’ s behavior could have a biasing effect .
The Present Study The present study tests the hypothesis that the availability of private safety nets to low-income mothers is positively associated with their child- ren ’ s socioemotional adjustment .
We draw from two recent , longitudinal studies , the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study ( FFCWS ) and the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies ( NEWWS ) .
Both samples consist of low-income mothers , the former because we restricted the full FFCWS sample to mothers who were unwed and living at 200 % of poverty or below at the child ’ s birth and the latter because as an experimental evaluation of wel- fare programs it included only welfare recipients at baseline .
We restrict the FFCWS sample to unwed births to render our analytic samples more comparable demographically , for all of the NEWWS participants were single mothers at random assignment .
Thus , both data sets pro- vide large samples of economically disadvan- taged families who would theoretically need and benefit from having a private safety net , with the NEWWS sample relevant to mothers leaving the welfare rolls and the FFCWS relevant to a broader population of low-income mothers and their children .
METHOD Data FFCWS .
The FFCWS is a longitudinal birth cohort that began in 1998 and has followed chil- dren and their families for 5 years .
To choose par- ticipating cities , the designers used a stratified random sample of all U.S. cities of 200,000 peo- ple or more .
Unwed families were oversampled by design , creating an ideal data set for examining unwed mothers and children over time ( see Reichman , Teitler , Garfinkel , & McLanahan , 2001 , for a detailed review of the study design ) .
Mothers were initially interviewed in hospitals at the focal child ’ s birth and again when children were 1 , 3 , and 5 years old .
Information on child behavioral outcomes was obtained from mothers during a separate in-home interview at 3 and 5 years for which response rates were lower than for the main telephone interview .
Among the 2,018 mothers who were unwed and living below 200 % of the federal poverty line at the focal child ’ s birth ( in the 18 nonpilot cities ) , 1,481 ( 73 % ) were interviewed in home about child behavior at the 3-year follow up .
Of those families , 1,203 ( 60 % ) were also interviewed in home at the 5-year follow-up , the main criterion for inclusion in our study .
Our final sample was further restricted to those with complete data on all cova- riates at 1 and 3 years ( N ¼ 1,162 ; 58 % ) .
Mothers in our analytic sample had education levels and ages similar to the 856 mothers without full data or who did not participate in the longitudinal follow-ups .
They were , however , more likely to be Black ( 62 % vs. 48 % ) and less likely to be Hispanic ( 24 % vs. 30 % ) ; they were also more likely to receive welfare between baseline and 3 years ( 36 % vs. 29 % ) and more likely to have been consistently unemployed ( 29 % vs. 21 % ) , suggesting mothers in our analytic sample were Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 281 somewhat more disadvantaged than those not in our sample .
NEWWS .
The NEWWS was a random assign- ment intervention designed to assess various welfare-to-work strategies operating under the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training ( JOBS ) program .
Between 1991 and 1994 , the NEWWS enrolled single-parent cash welfare re- cipients in 11 programs at seven sites nationwide ( see Hamilton et al. , 2001 , for a detailed review of the study design ) .
In three sites , mothers with children between the ages of 3 and 5 years were selected at random for inclusion in the Child Out- comes Study ( COS ) , and one age-eligible child per household was randomly selected as the ‘ ‘ focal child. ’ ’ Sample members in the COS com- pleted in-person interviews 2 and 5 years after random assignment ( RA ) .
Of the 3,018 families who participated in the 2-year COS follow-up , 1,982 ( 66 % ) families had full data on all covari- ates at RA and 2 years ; of those families , 1,308 ( 43 % ) also participated in the COS 5-year fol- low-up , when focal children were between 8 and 10 years old .
Overall , analytic sample mem- bers were more advantaged than COS families with missing data ; a higher proportion of mothers had a high school degree at RA , and they had higher employment rates between RA and 2 years ; sample mothers were also more likely to be White ( vs. non-White ) than those excluded .
Measures Private safety nets FFCWS .
The availability of a private safety net was assessed at the 1- , 3- , and 5-year fol- low-ups via six dichotomous items asking moth- ers whether they could count on someone to ( a ) lend them $ 200 , ( b ) lend them $ 1,000 , ( c ) provide them with a place to live , ( d ) help with emergency child care , ( e ) cosign a bank loan for $ 1,000 , and ( f ) cosign a bank loan for $ 5,000 .
Because four of the six items asked about financial support , the scale taps the availability of material more than instrumental support .
Responses to each question were summed ( 1 ¼ yes ; 0 ¼ no ) to create a scale ranging from 0 to 6 ( a ¼ .81 at 1 and 3 years ; a ¼ .82 at 5 years ) .
Although scores were nor- mally distributed ( 3 years : M ¼ 3.51 ; SD ¼ 1.81 ; skew ¼ 0.28 ; kurtosis ¼ 2.11 ) , we tri- chotomized the scale into High ( scores of 5 or 6 ; n ¼ 392 ; 34 % ) , Medium ( scores of 2 – 4 ; n ¼ 583 ; 50 % ) , and Low ( scores of 0 – 1 ; n ¼ 187 ; 16 % ) because we deemed categori- zation more appropriate for what is essentially an interval scale .
In our main OLS models , dummy variables for Medium and Low at 3 years were entered with High as the reference category .
One- and 5-year safety net levels were used in additional analyses .
At the time of the focal child ’ s birth , mothers were asked only three of the six items .
We dichot- omized this scale into High ( score of 3 ; 82 % ) and Low ( scores of 0 – 2 ; 18 % ) .
A dummy vari- able for Low was entered in models predicting age three outcomes , with High as the reference , to rule out the influence of simultaneity in main models .
Although far more mothers reported having High safety nets on this abridged scale than on the full scale , the reliability was compa- rable ( a ¼ .77 ) .
To validate our measure of private safety nets , we compared it to mothers ’ reports of financial support actually received from informal sources at the 3-year follow-up .
We found that nearly 40 % of mothers who reported high safety net availability had received money from friends or family in the past year compared to only 15 % of mothers in the low safety net availability group .
Mothers in the high safety net availability group also reported more sources of support and received far more money than mothers in the low safety net availability group ( $ 511 vs. $ 149 ) .
Mothers in the high and medium safety net avail- ability groups received money in similar propor- tions and from similar numbers of people , but mothers in the medium group were lent or given far less money than those in the high group ( $ 511 vs. $ 253 ) .
Although cash loans or gifts likely represent only a small portion of the help mothers received , these indicators suggest that mothers ’ perceptions do indeed reflect real advantages .
NEWWS .
In the 2-year COS follow-up , mothers were asked to assess the following five statements on a 10-point scale , with 0 represent- ing not true and 10 representing completely true : ‘ ‘ If I need to buy a pair of shoes for my child but I am short of cash , there is someone who would lend me the money ’ ’ ; ‘ ‘ When I have troubles or need help , I have someone I can really talk to ’ ’ ; ‘ ‘ If I need to do an errand , I can easily find a friend or relative living nearby to watch my child ’ ’ ; ‘ ‘ If I needed a ride to get my child to the doctor , there are friends I could call 282 Journal of Marriage and Family to help me ’ ’ ; and ‘ ‘ When my child is sick friends or family will call or come by to check on how things are going. ’ ’ Answers to each of the questions were summed ( range ¼ 0 – 50 ; a ¼ .77 ) .
Because four of the five questions asked about nonfinancial support , unlike the FFCWS measure , this measure more strongly tapped the availability of instrumental rather than material support .
No measure of instru- mental support actually received was available in the NEWWS to validate this measure .
The linear measure was highly left-skewed , suggesting it should not be entered into models in its linear form ( the average value in the analytic sample was 34 , the median value was 37 ; fully 10 % of observations took on the maximum value of 50 ) .
Previous studies investigating social sup- port in the NEWWS address this issue by divid- ing the sample into quartiles of private safety net availability ( see Harknett , 2006 ) .
We fol- lowed this approach to conform to existing liter- ature and to create dosage-based groupings analogous to those we examined in the FFCWS .
In regression analyses , we entered quartile dum- mies with the top quartile as the reference cate- gory , similar to the Medium and Low dummies entered in FFCWS analyses .
It should be noted , however , that results for both data sets were strik- ingly similar when the linear ( continuous ) and categorical versions of safety net measures were used .
Fathers ’ support .
Neither study asked moth- ers to exclude help from children ’ s biological fa- thers in the responses to the perceived support questions ; thus our private safety net measures likely account for potential support from fathers ‘ ‘ in times of need. ’ ’ To distinguish the influence of this support from regular child support and visitation , however , we initially controlled for whether fathers paid any formal or informal child support and whether fathers visited the child ( in both FFCWS and NEWWS ) in the past year .
These variables were not significant across mod- els and did not influence results , so they were dropped in final models .
Child behavioral outcomes .
In both the FFCWS and the NEWWS we examined internalizing and externalizing child behavior problems as well as different measures of positive behaviors so that associations between private safety nets and children ’ s socioemotional development could be assessed across behavioral domains .
Each measure was based on maternal report , and com- plementary measures were available at two time points in both data sets .
FFCWS .
The FFCWS used 26 items from the Age 2 – 3 Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ; Achenbach , 1992 ) at age 3 and 34 items from the 4 – 18 CBCL ( Achenbach , 1991 ) at age 5 that comprised the Anxious/Depressed ( hereafter , internalizing behaviors ) and Aggressive behavior ( hereafter , externalizing behaviors ) subscales .
To compute scores on each subscale , mothers ’ re- sponses to each item ( 0 ¼ not true of my child ; 1 ¼ sometimes/somewhat true ; 2 ¼ very/often true ) were summed ( internalizing : a ¼ .69 at 3 years , .66 at 5 years ; externalizing : a ¼ .86 at 3 years , .85 at 5 years ) .
The internalizing sub- scale ranged from 0 to 19 and externalizing from 0 to 36 , with higher scores representing more behavior problems such as sadness and nervous- ness ( internalizing ) and fighting and bullying ( externalizing ) .
Scores on each subscale were correlated between time points , although exter- nalizing behaviors were more strongly correlated over time than internalizing ( internalizing : r ¼ .36 , p , .001 ; externalizing : r ¼ .56 , p , .001 ) .
Children ’ s positive behaviors were assessed with nine items from the Express subscale of the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory ( ASBI ) at both 3 and 5 years ( Hogan , Scott , & Bauer , 1992 ) , a subscale measuring children ’ s social competence and prosocial skills with adults and peers ( hereafter , Social Competence ) .
Mothers ’ responses were summed , ranging from 0 to 18 .
The alpha coefficient was high at both times ( a ¼ .77 at 5 years ; a ¼ .73 at 3 years ) and com- parable to the full subscale reliability reported for other samples of socioeconomically disadvan- taged preschoolers ( Greenfield , Wasserstein , Gold , & Jorden , 1997 ) .
Scores were significantly positively correlated between time points ( r¼ .35 ; p , .001 ) .
NEWWS .
In the NEWWS , internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were assessed at the 5-year follow-up with items from the Social Skills Rating System ( SSRS ; Gresham & Elliot , 1990 ) .
The internalizing subscale ranged be- tween 0 and 24 ( a ¼ .66 ) , and the externalizing subscale ranged from 0 to 18 ( a¼ .78 ) , with high- er values on both scales reflecting more perceived problems .
At 2-year follow-up , internalizing behavior problems were assessed using the 5-item Depressed/Withdrawn Behavior Problems Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 283 Index ( BPI ) scale ( Zaslow , McGroder , & Moore , 2000 ) .
Externalizing behavior was measured in the 2-year follow-up using items from the Antiso- cial Subscale of the BPI .
Both 2-year measures reflected the mean of item responses on a scale identical to the CBCL ’ s ( range ¼ 0 to 2 ) , rather than total scores , because the raw scores were not publicly available .
Scores on both subscales were correlated between time points , but as in the FFCWS , externalizing behaviors were more strongly correlated than internalizing behaviors ( internalizing : r ¼ .22 , p , .001 ; externalizing : r ¼ .34 p , .001 ) .
Positive behaviors at the 5-year follow-up were assessed with three measures from the Cooperation , Positive Assertion , and Responsi- bility subscales of the SSRS ; these scales assess aspects of social competence similar to those cap- tured in the ABSI Express scale .
They ranged from 1 to 39 , 0 to 30 , and 0 to 27 , respectively , and had high internal consistencies ( a ¼ .85 ; a¼ .83 ; a¼ .80 ) .
Although the scales were inter- correlated ( rs ¼ .64 – .68 ) , correlations were not so high as to obviate their separation .
At the 2- year follow-up , seven items from the Social Competence subscale of the Positive Child Behavior Scale ( Polit , 1996 ) were used to assess children ’ s prosocial skills .
Although items dif- fered from those in the SSRS , the scale was positively correlated with all 5-year positive measures ( rs ¼ .33 , .38 , .32 ) , suggesting it tap- ped similar constructs .
As this was the only pos- itive behavior measure gathered at 2 years , it was used as the earlier measure in models pre- dicting all 5-year positive behavioral outcomes .
Covariates .
We included a wide range of controls in all models , conceptualized in four categories : maternal characteristics , household structure , public safety net use , and child characteristics .
All capture variables that could confound the association between private safety nets and child- ren ’ s behavior in the ways described previously .
In the FFCWS and NEWWS , we chose the most similar measures within each category so that specifications would be maximally analogous across data sets .
In addition to the covariates described below , we controlled for study site ( with 17 indicators for city in FFCWS and 2 site indicators in NEWWS ) in all analyses .
FFCWS .
The maternal characteristics we controlled for included two measures of mothers ’ family background : her parents ’ highest level of education ( less than high school/GED with high school or higher as reference ) and whether she lived with both parents at age 15 .
We included five measures of socioeconomic characteristics : mater- nal race ( coded as three indicators for Black , His- panic , or other race/ethnicity with White as the reference ) , education level at baseline ( coded iden- tically to parents ’ education ) , age at focal child ’ s birth , household income-poverty ratio at 1 and 3 years ( averaged ) , and employment status at 1 and 3 years ( unemployed at both times , with em- ployed at either or both times as the reference ) .
Key indicators of mothers ’ personal characteris- tics , measured at baseline , were maternal health ( mother is in fair/poor health with excellent/very good/good as the reference ) , whether mother smoked during pregnancy , whether she used alco- hol/drugs during pregnancy , and whether she received prenatal care in her first trimester .
We also entered her score on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III ( PPVT ; Dunn & Dunn , 1997 ) , a receptive language assessment adminis- tered at 3 years , as an indicator of cognitive ability .
In robustness checks , we added an indicator vari- able for whether mother had experienced a major depressive episode in the year after the focal child ’ s birth ( using criteria from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview – Short Form ; Kessler , Andrews , Mroczek , Ustun , & Wittchen , 1998 ) .
We controlled for maternal household struc- ture with three indicators : lives with parent ( s ) , lives with child ’ s biological father and parent ( s ) , or lives alone , with lives with child ’ s father only as the reference .
We also included number of children in the household ( two indicator variables for two children or three or more children , with focal child only as the reference ) .
All were mea- sured at 3 years .
We controlled for several indicators of mothers ’ public safety net use : whether she ever received welfare/TANF , assistance from the WIC pro- gram , food stamps , or a housing subsidy or lived in public housing between the 1- and 3-year fol- low-ups .
We also controlled for whether the child had public or private health insurance at 3 years ( separate indicators ) , with no insurance as the ref- erence .
Child characteristics included child was male , child age in months at the 5-year follow- up , and low birthweight status , as a proxy for high child health risk .
NEWWS .
The maternal characteristics we controlled for included two baseline indicators 284 Journal of Marriage and Family of family background : whether the mother lived in a household that received welfare during child- hood and whether the mother first gave birth as a teenager .
We controlled for maternal race using two indicators for Black and non-White/non- Black , with White serving as the reference cate- gory , and for maternal education with an indicator for mother has no high school degree or GED at baseline .
Household income as a percentage of poverty at 2-year follow-up was included , as was the number of quarters she worked between RA and the 2-year follow-up .
To control for mothers ’ personal characteris- tics , we used baseline measures of mothers ’ self-efficacy entered as four indicators of differ- ent dimensions of the construct : feeling pushed around in life ; feeling people like themselves never get a fair chance to succeed ; feeling like they have no control over the things that happen ; and feeling that there is little that can be done to change many of the important things in life .
We also included a dummy variable for scores below sufficiency on a baseline literacy test .
Although we were not interested in assessing treatment im- pacts , we included indicators for treatment group status , with control group membership as the ref- erence category .
In robustness checks , we added a measure of mothers ’ level of depressive symp- toms at the 2-year follow-up using responses to 12 items from the Center for Epidemiologic Stud- ies Depression Scale – Short Form ( CESD-SF ; Radloff , 1977 ; a ¼ .89 ) .
To control for maternal household structure , we entered three indicators of living arrange- ments : living with children and a spouse/partner , living with children and an adult relative , and not living with children at 2-year follow-up , with liv- ing alone with children as the reference .
We also entered two indicators for mother has two chil- dren or three or more children at baseline , with one child as the reference category .
As measures of public safety net use , we included the number of months between RA and 2-year follow-up respondents received food stamps and , separately , cash welfare .
A vector of indicators reflected receipt of the following public assistance programs at the 2-year follow- up : WIC ( anyone in the household ) , Medicaid ( focal child ) , and living in public housing or receiving public housing assistance ( household ) .
We also included controls for whether the focal child was privately insured or uninsured ( two in- dicators ) , with missing insurance status as the ref- erence group .
To control for child characteristics , we include a dummy for child is male .
The most precise information on child age reported in the public use data files was whether the focal child was younger than the median age at RA , so we included this measure as an indicator .
Analytic Strategy Univariate analyses .
We first examined which maternal ( and child ) characteristics were associ- ated with the availability of private safety nets by comparing mothers at the different safety net lev- els across all covariates using one-way analyses of variance ( ANOVA ) for continuous variables and chi-square tests for dichotomous variables .
We also compared children ’ s behavioral scores at both time points across private safety net levels and conducted pairwise contrasts using Bonferroni post hoc adjustments to identify significant be- tween-group differences .
In the NEWWS , these and subsequent analyses were conducted with an analytic weight to account for unequal proba- bility of selection into the COS sample .
Multivariate analyses .
We then conducted the following 3 types of multivariate models .
OLS models .
First , we ran OLS regression models predicting behavioral outcomes from pri- vate safety net levels , holding constant the out- lined set of covariates .
This technique reduces bias induced by observed characteristics of mother and child but does not account for unob- served characteristics of mother and child , such as unmeasured maternal interpersonal skills ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Net- work & Duncan , 2003 ) .
This model took the following form : Yit ¼ a1 1 b1PrSNiðt1Þ 1 b2Mati 1 b3PbSNiðt1Þ 1 b4Childi 1 eit ; ð1Þ where Yit represents a child ’ s score on a particu- lar behavioral outcome at age 5 in the FFCWS and the 5-year follow-up in the NEWWS .
PrSN represents a vector of indicators reflecting moth- ers ’ level of private safety net ( with the highest level as the reference ) at age 3 in the FFCWS and the 2-year follow-up in the NEWWS .
Mat represents a vector of variables for all maternal characteristics , PbSN a vector of indicators for Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 285 mothers ’ public safety net use contemporaneous with private safety net , and Child a vector of co- variates for child characteristics .
b1 through b4 represent the corresponding coefficients .
Residualized change models .
Next , we entered children ’ s scores on earlier measures of the outcome on the right-hand side of Equation ( 1 ) , running what is sometimes called a residual- ized change model ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network & Duncan , 2003 ) .
It is considered a change model because entering the earlier outcome as an independent variable re- duces all other coefficients to estimating their impact on change in the outcome between meas- urements .
Whereas in OLS models safety net co- efficients reflect mean differences in child behavior scores by safety net group at one time point , residualized change coefficients reflect mean differences in the change in scores between time points .
This approach attenuates bias induced by both observed and unobserved time invariant characteristics of mother and child .
It can provide considerably more power than other types of change models to detect associations when outcomes are highly correlated and not measured identically over time ( Cronbach & Fur- by , 1970 ) .
Because including initial level as a pre- dictor likely introduces a biasing correlation between it and the error term , however , the change model may underestimate coefficients ’ confidence intervals .
We use robust standard er- rors to correct for this potential underestimation .
This model took the following form : Yit ¼ a1 1 b1PrSNiðt1Þ 1 b2Mati 1 b3PbSNiðt1Þ 1 b4Childi 1 dYiðt1Þ 1 ei ; ð2Þ where Yi ( t1 ) represents the analogous behavior score at age 3 in the FFCWS and the 2-year follow-up in the NEWWS , and d reflects its coefficient .
RESULTS Univariate Results FFCWS .
As hypothesized , children whose moth- ers reported high levels of perceived safety nets had significantly lower internalizing and exter- nalizing scores at both time points than those in the medium and low groups ( see Table 1 ) .
Although children in the medium safety net group had lower scores than those in the low group , differences were small and nonsignificant .
Children in both the high and medium groups had significantly higher social competence scores than those in the low group at both time points .
Mothers differed in terms of family background and personal characteristics by private safety net level .
Those who reported high levels had more educated parents , were more educated themselves , had higher PPVT scores , and were younger than those in the medium or low groups .
Their house- hold incomes were also higher , and they were less likely to have been consistently unemployed .
Across characteristics , mothers in the medium group fell in between those in the high and low groups but were closer to those in the low group .
Mothers in the high safety net group were also less likely to rely on public programs such as TANF or food stamps and were less likely to live in public housing .
Mothers in the high group were more likely to live with the child ’ s biological father at 3 years and less likely to live alone or with nonrelative adults than those with lower lev- els .
Taken together , these patterns suggest that mothers with higher levels of private safety nets came from more advantaged families , were better off socioeconomically , and may have had more sources of support in the home than those who reported lower levels .
NEWWS .
In the NEWWS , differences in child behavior across levels of mothers ’ private safety nets closely resembled those in the FFCWS ( see Table 2 ) , with children in the top quartile scoring significantly lower on internalizing and external- izing behaviors and significantly higher on all positive behaviors than children in the bottom two quartiles at both time points .
Scores on all outcomes followed a downward trend , with those in the second and third quartiles scoring in between those in the top and bottom quartiles .
Far fewer differences emerged among mothers in the NEWWS in their characteristics and use of public programs , perhaps because mothers were less socioeconomically diverse , and more disad- vantaged , than those in the FFCWS .
Mothers in the top safety net quartile were more likely to be Black and less likely to feel pushed around in life than those in lower quartile , the latter sug- gesting higher self-efficacy in this group .
They were less likely to receive public health insurance and slightly more likely to lack health insurance 286 Journal of Marriage and Family Table 1 .

288 Journal of Marriage and Family for their children than those in the bottom quar- tile .
Similar differences emerged in mothers ’ household structure , with mothers who reported higher levels of safety net availability more likely to live with relatives and less likely to live alone than mothers reporting lower levels .
OLS and Residualized Change Models FFCWS .
Table 3 presents results for both the OLS and residualized change models .
In Model 1 , with all covariates held constant , children scored significantly higher on both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and signifi- cantly lower on social competence in the medium and low safety net groups than in the high safety net group .
The difference between the low and high groups represented about a third of a stan- dard deviation on internalizing problems and a quarter of a standard deviation on externalizing and social competence .
The differences between medium and high groups were smaller ( 0.11 and 0.22 of a standard deviation , respectively ) .
With all other covariates held constant , children of Black mothers scored significantly lower on internalizing and externalizing behaviors than those of White mothers , and boys scored lower on social competence than girls .
Estimates for other covariates are available upon request .
In Model 2 , the analogous age 3 outcomes were entered as covariates in residualized change models .
For internalizing behaviors , coefficients for both low and medium were reduced in size but remained statistically significant .
For social competence , the coefficient for low was reduced but remained statistically significant .
In contrast , for externalizing behaviors , both coefficients were reduced in size by over half and became insignificant .
Few maternal characteristics were signifi- cantly associated with children ’ s behavioral adjustment , except that children of Black mothers had fewer behavioral problems than those of White mothers , and poor maternal health was positively associated with behavior problems .
Likewise , public safety nets variables were largely unrelated to children ’ s behavioral outcomes .
NEWWS .
Results from OLS and residualized change models in analyses using the NEWWS data were strikingly similar to those using the FFCWS ( see Table 4 ) .
In Model 1 , children in the bottom two quartiles of safety net scored sig- nificantly higher than children in the top quartile on both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems .
Differences on internalizing behaviors were larger , representing approximately a third of a standard deviation between the top and bottom quartiles .
Children in the lowest two quartiles also scored significantly lower on cooperation , assertiveness , and responsibility than those in the top , and both bottom and second quartile co- efficients represented a third of a standard devia- tion or greater .
Only results for cooperation are shown because results for other positive behav- iors were similar ( available upon request ) .
With all other covariates held constant , children of Black mothers scored significantly lower on externalizing behaviors and higher on coopera- tion than those of White mothers , and boys scored lower on cooperation than girls .
Once analogous earlier outcomes were entered in Model 2 , children in the bottom quartile still scored significantly higher than those in the top quartile on internalizing behaviors by 0.17 of a standard deviation .
In models predicting exter- nalizing behaviors , safety net coefficients re- duced substantially and became nonsignificant , just as they did in the FFCWS .
Finally , children in the bottom two quartiles still scored signifi- cantly lower than those in the top quartile on all positive behaviors , and safety net coefficients were largely unchanged in these models .
In the NEWWS , as in the FFCWS , public safety net variables were largely unrelated to children ’ s behavioral adjustment .
Of the few public safety net variables that were significant , most were asso- ciated with poorer behavioral outcomes for chil- dren , with the exception of food stamps receipt , perhaps because receipt of public supports indi- cates greater socioeconomic disadvantage .
Threats to Validity Despite including a particularly rich set of covari- ates and employing change models , our study design still faced potential threats to validity .
Pri- marily , we were concerned that the key indepen- dent variable and the outcome measures may have been simultaneously determined .
To test for bidirectional causation , we ran additional models predicting age 3 child outcomes from mothers ’ safety net level at birth—before the child ’ s behav- ior could plausibly influence safety net levels—us- ing FFCWS data ( not shown ) .
In OLS models with child characteristics controlled , low safety net level at birth was associated with greater internalizing Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 289 T ab le 3 .

Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 293 ( b ¼ 0.55 ; SE ¼ 0.24 ; p , .05 ) , externalizing ( b ¼ 1.07 ; SE ¼ 0.43 ; p , .05 ) , and lower social competence ( b ¼ 0.34 ; SE ¼ 0.20 ; p , .10 ) 3 years later , suggesting simultaneity did not strongly bias the main results .
Omitted variables bias was also a concern because neither of our analytic approaches yielded estimates completely free of bias .
As an additional robustness exercise , we estimated a child-level fixed effects model with the two waves of FFCWS data that contain measures of safety net availability and child behavior ( results not shown ) .
The ( con- tinuously measured ) safety net variable was not significant in models predicting internalizing or externalizing behaviors but was significant ( and positive ) at the trend level for social competence .
Large confidence intervals in the fixed effects models suggest that imprecision precludes our knowing if these null results for behavior problems are true .
Furthermore , it may be that the associa- tion between private safety nets and child well- being is relatively stable and cumulative such that short-term changes would not have large effects on outcomes , whereas consistent safety net levels over time would .
Finally , shared method variance between mothers ’ report of safety net availability and children ’ s behavior threatens construct validity .
It is possible , for example , that a depressed mother would perceive more limited support from her social network and perceive higher lev- els of behavior problems in her child than a non- depressed mother , rendering the association between private safety nets and child behavior an artifact of her perceptions .
Encouragingly , our results held when maternal depression was controlled ( in both data sets ) ; in the NEWWS controls also included baseline measures of mothers ’ self efficacy .
Recall too that both data sets allowed us to control for mothers ’ cognitive ability .
Importantly , additional analyses ( not pre- sented here ) showed that mother-reported behav- ior problems predicted objective assessments of children ’ s academic abilities in both data sets in the expected directions .
These associations give us more confidence that our measures of child- ren ’ s behaviors were real and not simply reflec- tions of mothers ’ cognitive or noncognitive characteristics .
DISCUSSION Our findings add to a long tradition of research illustrating the importance of social support , broadly defined , to the economic survival and emotional well-being of low-income families ( e.g. , Edin & Lein , 1997 ; Harknett , 2006 ; Henly , 2002 ; Henly et al. , 2005 ; Howard , 2006 ) .
Specif- ically , we demonstrated a significant and substan- tively important association between the availability of a private safety net and children ’ s internalizing symptoms and positive behaviors .
We did so using two large-scale , high-quality longitudinal data sets and accounting for poten- tial endogeneity and simultaneity biases in esti- mations .
The similarity in the nature and strength of these associations across the two data sets was especially striking given the different ( yet complementary ) operationalizations of pri- vate safety nets in Fragile Families ( which emphasized material support ) and NEWWS ( which emphasized instrumental support ) .
We have thus highlighted an important protective factor for children growing up in economically disadvantaged families , one that may prove espe- cially important in the wake of welfare reform as mothers necessarily rely less on public safety nets , such as cash welfare assistance , and more on their informal networks .
Although we found consistent links between the availability of a private safety net and children ’ s behavioral adjustment in both data sets , we acknowledge that the overall pattern of results was less strong in models that increasingly ac- counted for unobserved heterogeneity .
In residual- ized change models , the association held only for children ’ s internalizing and positive behaviors and not for their externalizing behaviors .
It is pos- sible that children ’ s internalizing symptoms and prosocial skills are simply more strongly associ- ated with mother ’ s private safety net availability than externalizing behaviors .
On the other hand , externalizing behaviors may be more stable over time , as the stronger cross-time correlations for this outcome suggest , rendering it too difficult to estimate the association between safety nets and externalizing behavior over a short period .
Our fixed effects regression strategy , a much more con- servative approach that also relies on changes ( in both safety nets and children ’ s behavior ) to iden- tify impacts , did not yield statistically significant associations for either internalizing or externaliz- ing behavior problems but yielded significant re- sults in models predicting social competence at the trend level .
These results indicate that child- ren ’ s behavioral adjustment may not respond strongly to changes in mothers ’ safety net levels , at least not over a short period of time .
294 Journal of Marriage and Family We hypothesized , and found , a positive associ- ation between private safety nets and children ’ s socioemotional well-being , but a different find- ing could have emerged .
Qualitative literature on the dynamics of social support suggests that because mothers often receive informal support only on the condition of reciprocity , help from others sometimes can induce as much stress as it alleviates ( Antonucci & Jackson , 1990 ; Howard , 2006 ) both because mothers worry about repay- ing their debts ( financial or otherwise ) and because the exchanges can complicate interper- sonal relations .
In these ways , mothers ’ private safety nets could undermine their emotional well-being and consequently their parenting or expose children to negative relationships , either of which could disrupt children ’ s socioemotional development .
We may not have found evidence for this alternative hypothesis because we exam- ined perceived ( rather than received ) support , which necessarily reflects both the availability of support and mothers ’ willingness to use it ; thus our measures capture only the most helpful and least stressful sources of assistance .
It is also pos- sible that the economic and emotional benefits of having a private safety net simply outweigh the costs .
Our descriptive evidence suggests that even within low-income samples , mothers with strong private safety nets are more socioeconomically advantaged than their counterparts .
For example , Fragile Families ’ mothers in the high safety net group came from more educated families , had higher levels of education themselves , and had higher household incomes than other mothers .
These differences could cast doubt on the causal impact of safety nets on child behavior because the positive qualities that allow mothers to create a social network may also enhance children ’ s so- cioemotional development .
Our ability to control for a wide range of observable characteristics and our use of change models help temper this con- cern .
In the NEWWS , a more uniformly disad- vantaged sample in which few socioeconomic differences emerged across safety net levels , find- ings were remarkably similar to those in Fragile Families , which also alleviates concern about the influence of selection bias .
More broadly , our results suggest that a group of low-income mothers exists for whom social isolation and other disadvantages overlap and that children in these families may be particularly at risk for socioemotional difficulties .
As more single mothers enter the labor market under TANF and it becomes increasingly critical to have a private safety net , these mothers and their children may suffer disproportionately .
The obvi- ous next step for research is to investigate the availability and efficacy of community-based programs to enhance financial or instrumental support when mothers can not receive it from their networks .
Examples include programs providing emergency cash assistance and food aid directly as well as programs to foster and perhaps formal- ize the provision of loans , child care , and in-kind assistance among families .
For socially isolated mothers , home visiting programs offering parent- ing and emotional support may be efficacious .
Future empirical research should also investi- gate the mechanisms linking private safety nets to children ’ s socioemotional well-being .
As we described earlier , several possible pathways exist .
Low-income mothers who have access to informal networks may be better able to weather economic difficulties following illness , job loss , or relation- ship dissolution .
In this way , private safety nets might help smooth consumption or sustain hous- ing or child-care arrangements for children .
It fol- lows that minimizing turbulence would help sustain children ’ s emotional well-being in the face of economic shocks .
Private safety nets might also help mothers maintain employment , especially when schedules are erratic and variable , as is char- acteristic of the low-wage labor market ( Presser , 2003 ) .
Indeed , Harknett ( 2006 ) , also using NEWWS , found that private safety nets encour- aged employment and minimized welfare use .
Pri- vate safety nets might also benefit mothers ’ parenting behavior by minimizing parenting stress and maternal depression , both of which can inter- fere with healthy parent-child interactions .
Our ongoing work will investigate these mediating linkages .
Finally , we recognize a need for large-scale studies to gather more detailed information about the dynamics of low-income families ’ private safety nets .
More detailed information about mothers ’ received material and instrumental sup- port would have greatly enriched the validation of our perceived support measures .
If the studies also had included equal numbers of questions about material and instrumental support , we might have disentangled the relative influences of each type of assistance and the degree to which their availability overlapped .
Additionally , ques- tions about mothers ’ willingness to tap potential material and instrumental support might have indicated which sources of support alleviated Private Safety Nets and Child Behavior 295 economic strain and which may have caused emotional stress .
Most research and discussion about children ’ s well-being in the wake of welfare reform focuses on how public programs , such as TANF or other public insurance programs , can enhance child- ren ’ s environments .
Despite the largely accepted notion that social support , variously defined , plays a central role in alleviating the economic and emotional hardship low-income mothers experience , surprisingly little work has examined the social insurance role private safety nets might play in children ’ s development .
In the present study , we found substantively important associa- tions between the availability of private safety nets and children ’ s socioemotional well-being , suggesting more research should be devoted to understanding this important protective factor for low-income children and identifying program- matic ways to expand its availability among low- income families .
