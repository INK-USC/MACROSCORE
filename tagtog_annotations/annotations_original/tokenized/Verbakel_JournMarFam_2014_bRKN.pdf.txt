ELLEN VERBAKEL Radboud University Nijmegen MATTHIJS KALMIJN University of Amsterdam∗ Assortative Mating Among Dutch Married and Cohabiting Same-Sex and Different-Sex Couples The authors compared male and female same- sex and different-sex couples in the Netherlands with respect to age and educational homogamy .
Because many same-sex couples in the Nether- lands are married , differences between married and cohabiting couples were analyzed for all 3 groups .
Analyses of data from the Dutch Labor Force Surveys 2001–2007 ( N = 184,999 cou- ples ) showed that male same-sex couples are less homogamous in terms of age and education than different-sex couples .
Female same-sex couples are less homogamous in terms of age , but not in terms of education .
No meaningful differences were found between married couples and cohab- iting couples .
Partnership status appeared less important than the sex composition of the cou- ple .
Given the relatively tolerant climate toward homosexuals in the Netherlands , the similarity of the results with those yielded by studies con- ducted in the United States may be considered striking .
In this study , we used large-scale random samples to describe patterns in mate selection of male and female same-sex couples in Department of Sociology , Radboud University Nijmegen , P.O .

comparison to different-sex couples , distin- guishing between married and cohabiting couples .
The study of same-sex couples is part of a growing interest in the diversity and accep- tance of nonstandard family types , which have marked the process of family change over the past decades ( Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ) .
For the Netherlands , no previous study on assortative mating among same-sex couples is available , although the Netherlands is a unique case for studying same-sex relationships because it was the first country to introduce legalized same-sex marriages in 2001 .
As a result , this study can go one step further than the few previous studies on assortative mating among same-sex couples and distinguish between married and cohabiting male same-sex , female same-sex , and different- sex couples .
Besides offering new descriptive findings on union types that are rarely studied in the literature , this study also contributes to the literature in a theoretical way .
Existing theoretical ideas about assortative mating are implicitly or explicitly directed at male–female couples .
We systematically put together these existing theories and applied them to same-sex partnerships as well as to married versus cohab- iting partnerships .
Empirically , we were not able to separate the theoretical arguments , but our analyses will make clear whether the commonly supposed marriage–cohabitation distinction in assortative mating patterns is as relevant in same-sex couples as in different-sex couples and whether the distinction by partnership status is as important as the distinction by sexual orientation .
We examined assortative mating with respect to education and age .
Journal of Marriage and Family 76 ( February 2014 ) : 1–12 1 DOI:10.1111/jomf.12084 2 Journal of Marriage and Family Research on assortative mating in same- sex couples is scarce , the main cause being a lack of appropriate data .
One of the most prominent studies on the United States was conducted by Jepsen and Jepsen ( 2002 ) , who analyzed the American 1990 U.S. Census data with logit models .
More recently , Schwartz and Graf ( 2009 ) extended this research by studying the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census .
Both with respect to age and education , male same-sex partners were generally found to be least similar , whereas married different-sex partners were most similar .
Female same-sex couples and cohabiting different-sex partners had intermediate positions .
In some studies , cohabiting couples appear to be closest to married couples , creating a dividing line between same-sex and different-sex couples ; in other studies , cohabiting couples appear to be more similar to female ( and male ) same- sex couples .
In Europe , Andersson , Noack , Seierstad , and Weedon-Fekjær ( 2006 ) used register data for Sweden and Norway to describe the demographics of male and female same- sex couples , including a comparison with different-sex couples for Sweden only .
They showed that female same-sex couples were more homogamous with respect to education and age than male same-sex couples in both countries , and that , in Sweden , male same-sex couples were less homogamous in age and education than different-sex couples , whereas female same-sex couples were less similar in age but slightly more similar in education than different-sex couples .
As mentioned , the Netherlands offers a unique case because of the opportunity it provides to distinguish married and cohabiting same-sex couples .
A few other countries introduced partnership forms that give same- sex couples legal rights that are comparable to those of married different-sex couples as early as or earlier than the Netherlands , for example , Denmark in 1989 ( Boele-Woelki & Fuchs , 2003 ) .
However , same-sex marriage adds symbolic value and solves the disparity in legal rights that are still present in registered partnerships ; the introduction of same-sex marriage was therefore perceived as an extra step in the gay emancipation process of obtaining equal civil rights ( Hekma , 2004 ) .
More generally , the Netherlands is an interesting setting for the study on gay male and lesbian couples because of its high level of tolerance toward members of sexual minority groups ( Kelley , 2001 ) .
The Atlas of European Values shows that , already in 1981 and 1990 , the Netherlands was the most permissive country in Europe in regard to homosexuality ( Halman , Sieben , & Van Zundert , 2011 ) .
In 1999 and 2008 , other European countries became more permissive as well , but the Netherlands was still among the most permissive countries .
A tolerant context may affect the partner selection process of gay men and lesbian women : The pool of potential partners may be somewhat larger than in intolerant contexts , for example , because homosexuals are more likely to disclose their sexual orientation .
More important , if social norms and acceptance in the social context are , in part , causing differences in mate selection , one would not expect large differences in the Netherlands between gay male and lesbian couples on the one hand and heterosexual couples on the other hand .
In this study , we analyzed the Dutch Labor Force Surveys from 2001 through 2007 , using both descriptive techniques and log linear modeling to answer the research question regarding the extent to which educational and age homogamy differ between married and cohabiting male same-sex , female same-sex , and different-sex couples in the Netherlands .
The Dutch Labor Force Surveys comprise a household-level data collection that has large random samples and guarantees sufficient num- bers of same-sex couples with information on both partners and results that are representative of Dutch society .
In line with the previously mentioned American studies , we will use the gender composition of the couple to define the type of couple .
HYPOTHESES Age and Educational Homogamy by Sexual Orientation We systematically put together four existing general theoretical ideas on assortative mating , commonly used to predict patterns among heterosexual couples , and add arguments explicitly directed at gay men and lesbians in order to predict differences in assortative mating patterns between couples with different sexual orientations .
Next , we outline how the same four arguments are expected to predict differences in assortative mating between married and cohabiting couples .
Homogamy in Same- and Different-Sex Couples 3 A first important theoretical reason to expect homogamy concerns meeting opportunities ( Kalmijn , 1998 ) .
This is the argument most fre- quently used in previous literature on differences in educational and age resemblance between couples with different sexual orientations ( Kurdek & Schmitt , 1987 ; Noack , Seierstad , & Weedon-Fekjær , 2005 ; Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ; Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ; Solomon , Rothblum , & Balsam , 2005 ) .
The prevalence rates of gay men and lesbian women are considerably lower than those of heterosexual men and women , which narrows the pool of potential partners .
If the absolute size of the marriage market is smaller , it will be more difficult to find someone who is similar to oneself ( McFarland , 1975 ) .
In addition to this group size argument , one can argue that the local settings of the marriage market of homosexuals and heterosexuals differ .
Because homosexuality is not universally accepted , gay men and lesbian women are less likely to find a mate in the conventional socially homogamous meeting places , such as schools and the workplace ( Blumstein & Schwartz , 1983 ) .
Such meeting settings have been shown to be important causes of homogamy ( Kalmijn & Flap , 2001 ) .
The marriage market of gay men and lesbians tends to center around urban areas , predominantly because urban settings are more tolerant of subcultures that are prohibited else- where ( Black , Gates , Sanders , & Taylor , 2000 ; Fischer , 1995 ; Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ) .
Because urban settings have a more diverse population , meeting a partner with different socioeconomic or demographic characteristics becomes more likely ( Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ; Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) .
In sum , both marriage market arguments lead us to expect lower levels of edu- cational and age homogamy among same-sex couples compared to different-sex couples .
A second mechanism presented in the liter- ature that explains levels of partner similarity is unconventionality .
The general argument is that transgression of social norms in one respect makes it more likely for one to transgress social norms in other respects as well ( Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ; Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) .
Matching can generally be considered the norm ( Blackwell & Lichter , 2000 ) .
In addition , conventional part- nerships consist of a man and a woman .
Because same-sex couples deviate from the conventional pattern promoting a male–female relationship , they are expected to be more likely to deviate from the conventional assortative mating pat- tern as well .
The unconventionality argument thus results in the hypothesis that similarity in education and age is lower in same-sex couples than in different-sex couples .
The third mechanism involves relationship commitment .
Relationships with low levels of commitment are assumed to be less serious relationships lacking a long-term time horizon and relation-specific investments ( Kamp Dush & Amato , 2005 ; Oppenheimer , 1988 ) .
For such relationships , requirements in a potential partner can be less restrictive—implying lower levels of matching—than for highly committed relation- ships ( Blackwell & Lichter , 2000 , 2004 ; Oppen- heimer , 1988 ; Schwartz , 2010 ) .
Gay male and lesbian relationships have been argued to have lower levels of commitment , on average , than heterosexual couples because same-sex couples are often childless and have higher dissolu- tion risks than different-sex couples ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ; Kalmijn , Loeve , & Manting , 2007 ) .
We thus expect , again , lower levels of edu- cational and age homogamy among same-sex couples compared to different-sex couples .
Fourth , we present a plausible argument for why same-sex couples would be more homogamous than different-sex couples : egal- itarian preferences .
Similarity of partners with respect to education and age facilitates an equal division of labor , whereas specialization is more efficient when there are differences between partners with respect to education and age .
Both education and age are important determinants of earnings ( Becker , 1981 ) .
As a result , similarity implies that neither partner has a relative advan- tage in the labor market over the other , making specialization less beneficial .
Egalitarian pre- ferences are claimed to be stronger among same- sex couples than among different-sex couples ( Ciano-Boyce & Shelley-Sireci , 2002 ; Goldberg & Perry-Jenkins , 2007 ; Kalmijn et al. , 2007 ; Sullivan , 1996 ) .
These egalitarian norms may be related to the liberal attitudes in general and to the higher educational levels usually observed among same-sex couples .
They may also result from the simple fact that these couples consist of two persons of the same sex who have both been socialized with the same gender roles ( Jaspers & Verbakel , 2013 ) .
In the partner selection pro- cess , similarity in education and age are arguably more important criteria for equality-minded cou- ples .
Consequently , the egalitarianism hypoth- esis argues that educational and age homogamy 4 Journal of Marriage and Family will be higher among same-sex couples than among different-sex couples .
So far , we have not differentiated male from female same-sex couples .
Application of the above-mentioned arguments to gay male and lesbian couples does not always result in a clear prediction about different levels of assortative mating between these couples .
First , we do not expect major differences in meeting opportunities .
Prevalence rates of gay men hardly deviate from those of lesbians : A slightly higher proportion of Dutch men identify themselves as homosexual compared to women ( 4 % vs. 3 % ) , but more women than men report sexual desire for someone of the same sex ( 18 % vs. 13 % ; Kuyper , 2006 ) .
Second , whether the conventionality argument applies more strongly to gay male couples than to lesbian couples depends on whether male–male partnerships are more or less unconventional than female–female partnerships , and this can not be determined a priori .
Third , relationship commitment may , on the one hand , be argued to be stronger for female–female couples because they have children more often ( Jaspers & Verbakel , 2013 ) .
On the other hand , commitment may be weaker for female–female couples because they have higher dissolution risks , at least in Norway and Sweden ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ) .
Finally , previous literature has suggested that lesbian couples have stronger egalitarian preferences than gay male couples ( Blumstein & Schwartz , 1983 ) ; this leads to the expectation that assorta- tive mating is stronger among female same-sex couples than among male same-sex couples .
Age and Educational Homogamy by Partnership Status Using the same theoretical mechanisms behind assortative mating , we predicted there will be differences between married and cohabiting couples .
On the basis of the marriage market arguments , we expected no differences between cohabiting and married heterosexual couples , because their marriage markets are the same .
To illustrate this point , Schwartz ( 2010 ) showed for the United States that , at the start of a relationship , the educational resemblance between cohabiting partners equals that of married partners ; differences in educational homogamy between cohabiting and married heterosexual couples result from selective exits .
The unconventionality argument predicts that cohabiting couples will be less homogamous than married couples .
Cohabitation can be considered to be a transgression of the standard marriage norm ( Thornton , Axinn , & Hill , 1992 ) ; cohabitors are therefore expected to transgress the matching standard as well , resulting in lower levels of assortative mating .
In the Netherlands , cohabitation is widely accepted , and only a minority of couples marry without cohabiting first ; those who marry directly are more religious and more traditional in their value orientation than others ( Soons & Kalmijn , 2009 ) .
Differences are probably more relevant when looking at the commitment argument .
Cohabiting relationships are often characterized as trial marriages and hence as less committed relationships than marriages ( Oppenheimer , 1988 ) .
Lower levels of matching among cohabitors may then result from the less restrictive requirements in a potential partner .
Finally , on the basis of the specialization argument , we expected—contrary to the previous arguments—that cohabiting partners will be more similar than married partners .
The former have been argued to value equity more strongly than the latter ( Blackwell & Lichter , 2000 ; Schoen & Weinick , 1993 ; Schwartz , 2010 ) .
Because an equal division of labor is more likely if neither partner has a relative advantage in the labor market over the other , we posited that cohabiting couples will express a stronger preference for partner similarity than will married couples .
METHOD Data We used the Dutch Labor Force Surveys that were collected annually by Statistics Netherlands .
To obtain a satisfactory sample size , we pooled seven Labor Force Surveys ( 2001–2007 ) , starting in 2001 , which is the first year in which same-sex couples could legally marry .
The Labor Force Surveys are conducted at the household level ; interviews were conducted with each household member above age 15 .
They are representative of the Dutch population with response rates around 62 % .
We selected households in which exactly two persons indicated their position in the household as “ member of a couple ” ( with or without children ) .
On the basis of the gender composition of the couple , we then considered Homogamy in Same- and Different-Sex Couples 5 the couple as male same sex , female same sex , or different sex .
The household composition was first assessed at the start of the interview , jointly by the trained interviewer and the primary respondent .
Next , each household member ( age 15 and older ) was interviewed separately and asked what position in the household one occupied and what relationship with the primary respondent one had .
The sex of the two respondents was written down by the interviewer in the individual interviews .
Note that the gender composition of the couple does not provide exclusive information on the sexual orientation of the two partners ( e.g. , some may identify themselves as bisexual or as homosexual but being in a heterosexual relationship ) .
After categorizing sex composi- tion , we divided couples by partnership status ( married or cohabiting ) , which resulted in six types of couples .
After selecting couples in which both partners were between the ages of 25 and 65 and after removing couples with missing data on one of the variables of interest , our analyses included 521 cohabiting male same-sex couples , 320 married male same-sex couples , 529 cohabiting female same-sex couples , 323 married female same-sex couples , 25,646 cohabiting different-sex couples , and 157,660 married different-sex couples .
These numbers imply that , in the Labor Force Surveys , about 0.9 % of all couples were same-sex couples .
It is very difficult to say if these numbers are low .
For example , Kuyper ( 2006 ) reported that 4 % of men identified themselves as gay and 2.6 % of women identified themselves as lesbian , but these numbers referred to the total population of men and women , and not only to those living together .
It is possible that gay men and lesbians are less likely to be partnered than heterosexuals ( Sandfort , de Graaf , de Bijl , & Schnabel , 2001 ) .
Potential selective nonresponse by sexual orientation is hard to assess .
One way to get some feel for the severity of nonresponse may be to compare the share of male versus female same-sex married couples in our sample in the period 2001/2002 to their shares in the official marriage statistics .
The assumption , then , is that almost all marriages sealed in that period were intact at the end of 2002 ( this assumption becomes less plausible when the period is extended ) .
The ratio between male and female same-sex couples who sealed their marriage in 2001/2002 is 1.15 ( 2,274/1,978 ; Statistics Netherlands : http : //statline.cbs.nl ) .
The ratio between male and female same-sex married couples in our sample in those years is 1.12 ( 46/41 ) .
Although the numbers are only sugges- tive , they do not point at heavy nonresponse bias between male and female same-sex couples .
The data were cross-sectional , and we had no information on relationship duration .
This implies that we observed all prevailing relationships at a particular point in time without being able to identify short-term or long-term relationships .
Consequently , we could not strictly attribute patterns of couple resemblance to assortative mating ; selective union dissolution and changes in partners ’ char- acteristics during the relationship might have affected homogamy as well .
We did not expect , however , that partners influenced each others ’ highest educational level so much as they had often finished or at least started their educational career when they first met .
Selective union dissolution could obviously still have affected the results .
For the analyses of age homogamy , we relied on age differences rather than associa- tions between partners ’ ages that were invariant to relationship duration ( we explain this in the Design section ) .
The basic descriptive information on the variables of interest is provided in Table 1 .
For different-sex couples , the descriptive information for males and females is reported separately .
For same-sex couples , we randomly selected one of the partners to be the respondent , the other being the spouse .
Therefore , the descriptive information on the respondent and the spouse would be similar .
Education was distinguished in four categories : ( a ) primary , ( b ) lower secondary , ( c ) higher secondary , and ( d ) tertiary .
Using more categories would make the cross-tabulations too sparse for same-sex couples .
The descriptive information in Table 1 demonstrates that men and especially women in same-sex relationships were relatively highly educated .
Ages ranged from 25 through 65 ; the average age in our sample varied from 42.4 for men in same-sex couples to 45.8 for men in different-sex couples .
Note that age refers to current age and not to age at the start of the union .
The fact that men and women in same-sex partnerships appeared to be more highly educated than their counterparts in different-sex partnerships may raise concerns about the selectivity of the sample .
If the overrepresentation of highly educated same-sex couples resulted from the tendency that highly 6 Journal of Marriage and Family Table 1 .

educated individuals were more likely to be overt about their sexuality and hence dared to form a couple ( because forming a couple generally makes one ’ s sexuality visible to the outside world ) , this study would not be affected .
After all , a study on homogamy is , by definition , about couples .
If the overrepresentation of highly educated same-sex couples resulted from highly educated same-sex couples being more likely to disclose their living arrangement to the interviewer than poorly educated same-sex couples , our results could be biased .
We would argue , however , that this bias is limited because it is not plausible that respondents who share a household with someone of the same sex—one of the most explicit ways to show one ’ s homosexuality to the outside world—would be reluctant in his or her openness toward the interviewer .
Comparisons with other Dutch data sources using different sample procedures and interview methods ( Kuyper , 2006 ; Sandfort et al. , 2001 ) and data sets used in comparable international studies ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ; Jepsen & Jepsen , 2002 ; Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) showed similar patterns of educational distri- bution by sexual orientation .
This strengthened our confidence in the quality of our sample and comparability with existing studies .
Design Educational homogamy was analyzed with correlations as well as log linear models .
The latter express the relationship between partners ’ characteristics while eliminating the influence of the marginal distributions .
Partners ’ similarity in educational level was expressed in a uniform association parameter ( Agresti , 2002 ; Goodman , 1979 ; Hout , 1983 ) .
The model is formulated below .
In the formula , R refers to the respon- dent ’ s education ( with i = 1 , .

6 ) ; the six categories were ( a ) married male same sex , ( b ) cohabiting male same sex , ( c ) married female same sex , ( d ) cohabiting female same sex , ( e ) married different sex , and ( f ) cohabiting different sex .
In different-sex couples , the male partner was the respondent and the female partner was the spouse .
In same-sex couples , the respondent and partner were randomly assigned .
The statistic Fijk represents the number of couples in each cell of the cross-tabulation of respondent ’ s education , partner ’ s education , and type of union ( 4 × 4 × 6 = 96 cells ) : ln Fijk = μ + λRi + λPj + λTk + λRTik + λPTjk + ϕkRiPj + eijk Here , μ reflects the grand mean .
The λRi and λPj parameters adjust for the marginal distributions of respondent ’ s and partner ’ s education .
The λRTik and λ PT jk parameters adjust for educational differences in the univariate educational distributions of the respondent and the partner across union types .
The λTk parameter adjusts for the numbers of couples in the different Homogamy in Same- and Different-Sex Couples 7 types .
The association between respondent ’ s and partner ’ s education was captured with a uniform association parameter ϕ .
This uniform association parameter was equal to the log odds ratio of a 2 × 2 sub-table of adjacent cells in the larger table ( Hout , 1983 ) .
The uniform association model was chosen for practical purposes : The tables for the various subgroups were too sparse to analyze more subtle patterns of association in the table .
We allowed the strength of the uniform association parameter to vary among types of unions ( indicated by the subscript k ) .
In practice , this means we estimated the uniform association parameter within each type of union by including interaction terms between the product of respondent ’ s and partner ’ s education ( RiPj ) and dummy variables for each category of T ( excluding a reference category ) .
We made comparisons between different pairs of union types by reestimating the model with a different reference category .
We used a different strategy to analyze sim- ilarity in age .
In the data , no information was available on age at the time of union formation .
If we would instead have used the partners ’ cur- rent age , our results would have been upwardly biased , because couples grow old together .
For example , in a cross-sectional survey in the Netherlands ( Dykstra et al. , 2004 ) , the correla- tion between married partners ’ current ages was r = .92 , whereas the correlation between their ages at the time of marriage was r = .75 ( authors ’ own calculations ) .
For this reason , we needed to look at the age difference between partners .
This difference was not affected by marriage duration , because the age difference is constant as couples grow older .
We presented absolute age differ- ences for the six types of unions , and we reported t tests that assessed whether age differences var- ied significantly by sex composition and by partnership status .
In addition , we presented a cross-tabulation to assess how common large age differences were in the six types of unions .
RESULTS Educational Homogamy The association between partners ’ educational levels by sex composition and partnership status is reported in Table 2 .
When we calculated zero-order correlations with the four-category education variables treated as linear variables ( see upper panel of Table 2 ) , we observed that the correlation between spouses ’ education was weakest in male–male couples .
Female–female couples and different-sex couples were more or less equally homogamous with respect to education .
These crude measures suggested no substantial difference in assortative mating between married and cohabiting couples ; only among female same-sex couples did educational similarity seem a bit larger in married couples , although this difference was not statistically significant .
Next , we turned to log linear modeling to demonstrate the tendency to have a partner with a similar educational level while taking into account the marginal distributions of education .
The cell distributions that form the basis for this analysis can be found in the Appendix .
We first estimated a model with one uniform association parameter ( for all types of unions ) .
This model had a fit of χ2 ( 53 ) = 5,033.4 .
Adding interaction of uniform association and type of union led to a model with a fit of χ2 ( 48 ) = 4,992.3 .
This was a significant improvement in fit , χ2 ( 5 ) = 41.1 .
According to these fit measures , the model we used fit the data poorly ( p < 0.0001 ) , but because of the enormous number of cases in this sample the model fit was not a relevant instrument on which to judge the model , because even the smallest deviations were to be found significant .
Therefore , more interesting than these fit values were the parameter estimates and the statistical and numerical differences between groups .
These are presented in the bottom panel of Table 2 .
The association parameters confirmed the conclusions based on the zero-order correla- tions : The overall association between partners ’ education was significantly weaker in male same-sex couples than in different-sex couples , and this was true regardless of whether we compared married or cohabiting couples .
The difference was substantial : The odds ratio was 22 % lower when we looked at cohabiting couples ( e0.521 for male same-sex couples vs. e0.768 for different-sex couples ) and 18 % lower when looking at married couples ( e0.516 for male same-sex couples vs. e0.712 for different-sex couples ) .
Female same-sex couples did not have a weaker uniform association than different-sex couples .
A comparison by partnership status revealed no significant difference between mar- ried and cohabiting couples in male and female same-sex couples .
In different-sex couples , we found a significant difference , but this was due 8 Journal of Marriage and Family Table 2 .

Numerically , the difference was not important .
Note , however , that cohabiting couples tended to be more similar than married couples .
Overall , we conclude that male same-sex couples have lower levels of assortative mating than female same-sex and different-sex couples and that sex composition of the couple appears to be a much stronger divide than partnership status .
Age Similarities As shown in Table 3 , age differences were much larger in same-sex couples than in different-sex couples .
The absolute age difference amounted to 5.9 years in male–male couples and to 4.8 in female–female couples , which were 82 % and 46 % larger , respectively , than the age difference in male–female couples ( 3.3 years ) .
Also , the difference between male and female same-sex couples was significant and substantial : The age difference in male same-sex couples was one quarter larger than in female same-sex couples .
With respect to age , we found that married couples tended to be more similar than cohabiting couples .
For example , married partners in different-sex couples differed , on average , 3.2 years versus 4.0 years for cohabiting partners .
The same pattern , but with age differences much smaller in size and not reaching the level of significance , was observed in male and female same-sex couples .
Therefore , we again conclude that men in same-sex couples are least homogamous and that the sex composition of the couple is a much stronger determinant for assortative mating than partnership status .
To evaluate the magnitude of these patterns , we also presented age differences in a discrete fashion .
Among male partners in same-sex relationships , 17 % differed 11 or more years in age , and another 24 % differed 6 to 10 years .
Compared to female same-sex couples ( 11 % and 22 % , respectively ) , but especially com- pared to different-sex couples ( 4 % and 13 % , respectively ) , these numbers showed that large age differences are all but uncommon among male–male couples .
DISCUSSION We studied assortative mating among cohabiting and married male same-sex , female same-sex , and different-sex partners in the Netherlands using large-scale nationally representative sur- veys .
The explicit inclusion of same-sex couples extends our knowledge about assortative mating in small groups .
The opportunity to distin- guish between married and cohabiting couples in same-sex partnerships is a unique contribution to the literature .
The comparison of these six types of couples was not only of value in a descriptive sense but also provided room for an exercise to extend existing theoretical explanations on part- ner similarity and on differences between mar- riage and cohabitation to a special case , that is , to same-sex couples .
We focused on assortative mating with respect to education and age .

The first important finding is that similarity in both education and age was weakest among male same-sex couples .
Female same-sex couples did not differ from different-sex couples with respect to educational assortative mating , but they did have larger age differences .
Our finding of weaker educational homogamy among male–male couples is consistent with earlier research on the United States and Scandinavian countries ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ; Jepsen & Jepsen , 2002 ; Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) .
Because the Dutch context is characterized by high levels of tolerance toward homosexuality , the similar- ity of our results to those yielded by research in the United States is interesting .
Together with the Scandinavian findings , there seems to be an emerging pattern of “ similar differences ” in “ different contexts. ” If these country compar- isons are used to speculate on the validity of our theoretical arguments , they may suggest that the most culturally based argument—the notion of unconventionality—may be less relevant for the way partners select each other compared to the more culturally neutral arguments , such as the small size of the group or perhaps lower levels of stability .
Note that this tentative conclusion generalizes across societies and does not take into account regional differences in the acceptance of homosexuality within countries , which is , one would presume—especially in the United States—very large .
An important and interesting observation we would like to point out is the universal pattern that , even in very small groups , where meeting and mating in the conventional meeting settings is less likely , assortative mating is clearly strong and present .
Because such conventional meeting settings are central determinants of homogamy ( Kalmijn & Flap , 2001 ) , this also suggests that preferences for educational similarity are an important explanation for homogamy .
The second important finding is that part- nership status does not have a clear effect on assortative mating .
Married different-sex couples were somewhat more similar in age than cohabiting couples , but they were somewhat less similar in education .
These differences were small , however .
For same-sex couples , differences between married and cohabiting couples were absent .
In comparison , results on different-sex couples in the United States are mixed , but studies tend to find the opposite , namely , that cohabitors are less likely to resem- ble each other in education than married couples 10 Journal of Marriage and Family ( Schwartz , 2010 ) .
The small differences between Dutch married and cohabiting couples suggest that cohabitation in the Netherlands is not so much of a trial marriage as it is in , for example , the United States .
Our finding that different-sex cohabiting couples were less similar in age than their married counterparts may be the result of the fact that second unions more often are cohabiting unions , and second unions are also characterized by larger age differences ( Gelis- sen , 2004 ) .
This study demonstrates that the sex composition of the couple is more important than partnership status for assortative mating .
The validity of the theoretical mechanisms behind assortative mating could not be directly assessed by empirical tests .
When comparing the expected and actual differences between relationship types , we had to conclude that the theoretical arguments about marriage markets , unconventionality , and relationship commitment can in principle explain the weaker age similar- ity in male and female same-sex couples and the weaker educational similarity in male same-sex couples as compared to different-sex couples .
However , these same arguments could not satis- factorily explain the position of female same-sex relationships , which appeared not to differ in educational assortative mating from different- sex couples .
The significantly higher educational and age similarity between female partners com- pared to male partners would be consistent with the argument that lesbian women select more strongly on education and age because they attach more value to an egalitarian relation- ship , our fourth theoretical argument ( Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) .
But this does not explain why female–female couples were similar to male–female couples .
An explanation is needed to explain why male same-sex couples stand out .
It may be that other traits in the marriage mar- ket play a role and that these traits overrule or compensate for educational differences .
Future research is needed to provide a more complete view of the assortative mating process .
Future research could focus on longitudinal data .
In our cross-sectional study , we observed only unions that had not dissolved until the moment of the interview .
A study conducted by Kalmijn et al .
( 2007 ) demonstrated that same- sex couples in the Netherlands are indeed more likely to experience a union dissolution .
If disso- lution is also more likely among heterogamous couples , then we would overestimate the levels of assortative mating among same-sex couples because we observe only intact relationships that—following this assumption—will be rel- atively more homogamous because of selec- tive exits .
This scenario would further increase the gap between male same-sex couples and different-sex couples , but it could explain why female same-sex couples are so similar in educational assortative mating as different-sex couples , especially because , in Scandinavian countries , female–female couples were shown to have the highest dissolution risks ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ) .
The assumption that dissolution risks are negatively related with educational and age homogamy has not been proven ; research on this relationship has produced mixed results .
To assess this alternative explanation , data that record partners ’ attributes at the start of the rela- tionship are essential , but unfortunately these are not yet available with sufficient sample sizes .
