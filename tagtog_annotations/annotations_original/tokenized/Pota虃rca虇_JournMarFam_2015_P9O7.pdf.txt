Gina Potârcă University of Lausanne Melinda Mills University of Oxford/Nuffield College∗ Wiebke Neberich Affinitas GmbH∗∗ Relationship Preferences Among Gay and Lesbian Online Daters : Individual and Contextual Influences There is currently little knowledge about what gay men and lesbians seek in a romantic rela- tionship .
This study extends the literature on gay men and lesbians ’ partnership preferences by engaging in the first large-scale empiri- cal study of the long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs of gay and lesbian online daters across 53 regions in 8 European countries ( N= 24,598 ) .
Looking at profile and preference information , the authors examined both individual and contextual determinants in a series of multilevel logistic regression analyses .
They show that lesbians give more importance to monogamy but show less interest in starting a long-term relationship .
The data also reveal the importance of life course aspects such as relationship history and presence of children .
Finally , the authors empirically demonstrate that social tolerance and legal recognition of same-sex unions are associated with higher long-term dating intentions and stronger monogamy beliefs .

Key Words : gay , lesbian , mate selection , multilevel models , online dating .
The past decades have witnessed a continued rise in the visibility and legal rights of same-sex unions ( Peplau & Fingerhut , 2007 ; Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ) .
Although gay men and lesbian women establish various types of relationships “ from courtship to cohabitation to marriage-like unions with high commitment ” ( Kurdek , 2005 , p. 254 ) , the topic remains largely empirically unexplored .
Little is known about the relation- ship preferences that members of these sex- ual minority groups have in the initial stages of mate selection .
Several studies have exam- ined attractiveness standards and aspects that gay men and lesbians find desirable in a roman- tic partner ( e.g. , Gobrogge et al. , 2007 ; Ha , van den Berg , Engels , & Lichtwarck-Aschoff , 2012 ; Lippa , 2007 ) .
The knowledge about what gay men and lesbians seek and value in a relation- ship , however , is underdeveloped .
In the current study we focused on two aspects of relationship preferences , namely ( a ) long-term dating intentions ( i.e. , interest in starting a long-lasting relationship ) and ( b ) belief in monogamy ( i.e. , sociosexuality ) .
Inter- est in long-term partnerships is generally found to correlate with strong norms favoring sexual exclusivity ( Simpson & Gangestad , 1991 ) .
This study jointly labels long-term dating intentions and strong beliefs in monogamy as high ( or demanding ) partnering standards .
There is evi- dence , however , that willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations does not neces- sarily exclude long-term partnering intentions Journal of Marriage and Family 77 ( April 2015 ) : 523–541 523 DOI:10.1111/jomf.12177 524 Journal of Marriage and Family ( Gangestad & Simpson , 1990 ) .
This suggests that the two constructs might tap into different facets of mating preferences .
Exploring an intentional as well as an attitudinal component of mating strategies will provide more depth into the understanding of gay men and lesbians ’ relationship preferences .
Any examination of the partnering standards of the two sexual minority groups needs to take into account the particularities of their dating markets ( Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) .
Gay men and lesbians tend to reside in heterogeneous neigh- borhoods located in large urban centers ( Peplau & Fingerhut , 2007 ; Rosenfeld & Kim , 2005 ) .
They also have increased geographical mobility , which reduces the immediate influence of family and friends ( Schwartz & Graf , 2009 ) .
Apart from residing in different social settings ( Kurdek , 2004 ) , the limited size of their dating market means that they are also more prone to resort to nontraditional means for finding a partner .
An increasingly popular way for gay men and lesbians to find available partners is via Internet dating ( Peplau & Fingerhut , 2007 ; Rosenfeld & Thomas , 2012 ) .
Here they have greater chances of initiating romantic encounters by “ minimiz- ing their efforts and exposure to overt social scrutiny ” ( Lever , Grov , Royce , & Gillespie , 2008 , p. 284 ) .
The Internet therefore increases the level of access , affordability , and privacy in searching for romantic and sexual encounters as well as providing a wider variety of prospective partners ( Tikkanen & Ross , 2003 ) .
Despite the growing popularity of digital mating markets among individuals with same-sex preferences , no studies have yet examined gay men and les- bians ’ relationship intentions and values when searching for a partner online .
Moreover , the partnering intentions and beliefs of gay men and lesbians have rarely been studied across differ- ent contextual settings .
Because of the diverse levels of acceptance and legal recognition of same-sex relationships across different countries and subregions , we anticipated particular ties between contextual settings and gay men and lesbians ’ dating intentions and values .
The aim of this study was to examine how both individual and contextual determinants are related to the long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs of gay and lesbian online daters .
At the individual level , we analyzed the links between life-course factors such as previous union experience and presence of children and gay men and lesbians ’ relationship preferences .
At the contextual level , we took into account variations in attitudes toward same-sex couples and legal recognition of same-sex part- nerships across 53 regions in eight countries in Europe , namely , the Netherlands , Sweden , Spain , France , Germany , Austria , Switzerland , and Italy .
Using data provided by a multina- tional online dating platform , we analyzed the preferences and sociodemographic information provided by members who filled in an online dating profile .
On the basis of the preference for a partner ’ s gender expressed on users ’ profiles , we labeled women seeking women as lesbians and men seeking men as gay men .
Despite the fact that seeking a same-sex partner on an online dating platform is not an unequivocal measure of sexual identity as enduring attraction toward the same sex , we believe that it does represent an active expression of one ’ s ( same-sex ) sexual orientation .
Our study contributes to the existing literature in several ways .
First , we extend the handful of literature on gay men and lesbians ’ partnering preferences with a large-scale empirical analy- sis .
A second innovation is the examination of how relationship history or presence of children is related to the relationship values of gay men and lesbians , known to have distinct legal and reproductive contexts for both partnering and parenting .
Third , because of the comparative aspect of this study , it is the first to examine how the long-term dating intentions and the monogamy beliefs of gay men and lesbians are shaped by both individual characteristics and dating market conditions .
This answers the call by Meier , Hull , and Ortyl ( 2009 ) , who emphasized the need to study relationship val- ues among sexual minorities across different social , legal , and cultural contexts .
Because of the lack of cross-regional and cross-national comparative data on gay men and lesbians , this study is the first to provide unique insights into whether gay men and lesbians ’ dating intentions and monogamy beliefs vary across local and national settings .
Fourth , research has yet to address this topic by looking at real-life choices and a genuine dating environment .
During the past decade there has been a surge in studies examining various aspects of same-sex partnerships , such as division of household labor ( Kurdek , 2006 ) , relationship satisfaction ( Otis , Rostosky , Riggle , & Hamrin , 2006 ) , or partnership stability ( Andersson , Noack , Seierstad , & Weedon-Fekjaer , 2006 ; Kalmijn , Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 525 Loeve , & Manting , 2007 ) .
The limitation of previous studies is that they generally have relied on small convenience samples based on snowballing methods that usually target maga- zine readers or members of gay organizations , which often lead to an underrepresentation of non-White or low-socioeconomic-status gay men and lesbians ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ; Jepsen & Jepsen , 2002 ) .
This study is pioneer- ing in that it relies on unique large-scale data that permit a more robust and detailed exam- ination of gay men and lesbians ’ relationship goals and beliefs .
Furthermore , the nonreactive nature of the data ( i.e. , data gathered from a naturalistic setting ) has the potential to offer a more truthful assessment of gay men and lesbians ’ intentions and beliefs in the initial stages of dating .
Finally , because of the weak public visibility of gay and lesbian communities in certain countries ( e.g. , Italy ) , this is among the first studies to examine the mate selection patterns of gay men and lesbians within such restrictive contexts .
Background Short- Versus Long-Term Mating Strategies and Monogamy Beliefs Sexual strategy theory ( Buss & Schmitt , 1993 ) assumes that both men and women develop a plural set of approaches to mating , including long-term as well as short-term partnering .
Buss and Schmitt ( 1993 ) proposed that short-term mating is pursued because it has several advan- tages for men ( e.g. , an increased number of children ) as well as for women ( e.g. , immedi- ate access to men ’ s resources , the possibility of assessing the intentions and mate value of poten- tial long-term partners ) .
Long-term strategies , on the other hand , guarantee women a constant provision of men ’ s resources and investments in rearing children .
Long-term mating for men usually involves partnering with women of bet- ter mate value , avoiding the efforts of constantly pursuing potential partners , increasing the genetic quality of offspring , providing paternity certainty , dividing domestic and nondomestic labor tasks , and so forth .
According to this theory , individuals select either one of the two mating tactics of short- versus long-term part- nering depending on both gender and context ( Asendorpf , Penke , & Back , 2011 ; Buss & Schmitt , 1993 ; Gangestad & Simpson , 2000 ) .
An additional concept used to capture indi- vidual differences in human mating strategies is sociosexuality , which gauges variability in the disposition individuals have toward sexual relations outside of committed rela- tionships ( Simpson & Gangestad , 1991 ) .
The two extremes on the sociosexual orientation continuum distinguish first between restricted individuals who place emphasis on sexual exclusivity , lengthy courtship , and substantial emotional investments in long-term relation- ships .
The other extreme consists of unrestricted individuals who are more prone toward multi- ple sexual partners , more spontaneous sexual relations , and lower levels of investments and intimacy in relationships ( Schmitt , 2005 ; Simp- son & Gangestad , 1991 ) .
In the current study , we focused on the attitudinal component of sociosexuality , which is the belief that a rela- tionship should be exclusive and thus refers to the normative endorsement of committed sex ( Penke & Asendorpf , 2008 ) .
We hereafter refer to it as monogamy attitudes or beliefs .
The theoretical arguments presented until now , however , are largely based on heterosexual men and women and center around reproduction .
The evidence regarding gay men and lesbians ’ mating strategies and monogamy is scarce , with the few studies that have examined this topic producing conflicting findings .
In the absence of direct theories and research that address the actual partnering preferences of gay men and lesbians in genuine dating situations , we focus here on studies that have examined generic relationship values or levels of commitment and stability of established same-sex couples .
Meier and colleagues ( 2009 ) found no significant differences between gay men and lesbians in the way they rated lifelong commitment and faithfulness as important components of a suc- cessful relationship .
Bryant and Demian ( 1994 ) likewise demonstrated that gay and lesbian couples displayed similar levels of relationship commitment ; nevertheless , lesbians were more likely to form sexually exclusive partnerships and rarely violated monogamy agreements .
In fact , norms regarding sexual restrictiveness seem to distinguish gay men and lesbians the most .
Gay men generally score higher in terms of interest in and acceptance of noncommitted sexual relations and non-monogamous part- nerships ( Bailey , Gaulin , Agyei , & Gladue , 1994 ) .
Moreover , Schmitt ( 2005 ) revealed that gay men have significantly higher levels of 526 Journal of Marriage and Family non-monogamous relationships , possibly related to having access to a dating market with poten- tial partners with similar open attitudes toward uncommitted sex .
Relationship commitment among same-sex couples is also assumed to depend on the barri- ers individuals encounter when ending a partner- ship ( Kurdek , 2000 ; Peplau & Spalding , 2000 ) .
The level of relationship dependence and com- mitment decreases when the barriers that pre- vent a person from dissolving a union are low and the quality of alternatives to maintaining it is high ( Etcheverry & Agnew , 2004 ; Rhoades , Stanley , & Markman , 2010 ) .
Lau ( 2012 ) con- tended that female same-sex couples are more stable than male same-sex couples due to the fact that lesbians perceive more barriers to end- ing a relationship ( e.g. , lesbian households are more likely to include children ) and greater ben- efits from being in a relationship ( e.g. , women ’ s lower income levels make it more advantageous to pool financial resources than for men ) as well as scarcer partner alternatives ( e.g. , les- bians are less likely to inhabit large cities than gay men ) .
Nevertheless , evidence is again incon- clusive .
Among same-sex couples , Andersson and colleagues ( 2006 ) found that female partner- ships had higher divorce risks than male couples in Sweden and Norway , whereas Kalmijn et al .
( 2007 ) and Lau ( 2012 ) have revealed greater sta- bility for female same-sex partnerships in the Netherlands and the United States , respectively .
On the basis of previous research related to both relationship values and stability , we did not hypothesize dissimilarities between gay and lesbian daters in terms of willingness to start a long-term relationship .
Nevertheless , exist- ing evidence regarding monogamy led us to expect a stronger belief in sexual exclusivity among lesbian women compared to gay men ( Hypothesis 1 ) .
Life-Course Determinants of Gay Men and Lesbians ’ Dating Intentions The life-course aspects of relationship history and presence of children can influence the views and expectations that people have when initiating new partnerships ( Poortman , 2007 ) , but this association has yet to be explored in relation to gay men and lesbians .
The general lack of empirical evidence concerning the disso- lution and repartnering process of gay men and lesbians is related to the difficulty of assessing their pre- and postdissolution relationships and parenting arrangements .
The relationship expe- rience of gay and lesbian parents often refers to unions and children born with different-sex partners ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ; Lau , 2012 ; Peplau & Fingerhut , 2007 ) .
Nevertheless , the dissolution of same-sex partnerships and the for- mal ties to children born or adopted within such unions are surrounded by a great deal of legal ambiguity , particularly in contexts where the legalization of same-sex unions is not permitted ( Goldberg & Allen , 2013 ) .
When a same-sex relationship dissolves , nonbiological parents often risk losing the relationship with their children who are legally bound only to the biological parent ( Allen , 2007 ) .
When institutional support to guide the commitments and obligations between previ- ous partners , on the one hand , and between ex-partners and their children , on the other hand , is missing , gay and lesbian parents have to self-determine child custody and visitation as well as stepfamily formation decisions ( Allen , 2007 ; Goldberg & Allen , 2013 ) .
Even in coun- tries that grant the legalization of partnerships for same-sex couples , parenting rights remain restrictive .
Switzerland , for instance , provides legal recognition for same-sex unions via reg- istered partnerships , but it does not entitle same-sex couples to joint or second-parent adoption ( i.e. , the legal process that allows same-sex partners to adopt their partner ’ s bio- logical or adopted child without ending the first parent ’ s legal status as a parent ) .
Despite the particularities of gay men and lesbians ’ socially and legally disputed family formation ( Allen , 2007 ) , we drew on the literature that addresses the impact of life course factors on heterosexu- als ’ partnering .
We therefore assumed that basic experiences such as forming partnerships and having children shape the dating agenda of indi- viduals consistently across sexual orientation groups .
On the basis of sometimes-conflicting empirical evidence related to the influence of life-course aspects on the repartnering process of heterosexuals , there is a series of competing expectations that we now specify for gay men and lesbians jointly .
Relationship History Compared to the never-married , divorced individuals are often older .
They also face a more constrained partnership market ( i.e. , a Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 527 short supply of available and suitable potential partners ) , leading to a particular set of rela- tionship needs and criteria for partner selection ( de Graaf & Kalmijn , 2003 ; Shafer , 2013 ; Sweeney , 1997 ) .
Frazier , Arikian , Benson , Losoff , and Maurer ( 1996 ) found that people who experienced divorce hade weaker marital intentions than those who had never married , which likely can be attributed to previous neg- ative marital experiences .
People with previous union experience are less emotionally engaged and make fewer investments in subsequent relationships ( Poortman , 2007 ) .
In particular among separated individuals—who are not legally divorced and therefore unable to enter or invest in a formalized union—demanding partnering arrangements would be even less preferred .
If we consider separated individuals who exit a cohabiting union , we would also expect lower relationship demands given their tendency to form a union with lower levels of commitment and investment than marriage to begin with ( Brines & Joyner , 1999 ; Cherlin , 2004 ; Poortman & Mills , 2012 ) .
Therefore , we anticipate that divorced—and , even more so , separated—individuals to have lower long-term dating intentions and weaker monogamy beliefs than those who had never married ( Hypothesis 2A ) .
A competing hypothesis is that , provided a wide enough pool of potential candidates , individuals with union experience fine-tune their preferences toward a better suited part- ner , entailing more selectiveness and higher requirements from subsequent relationships ( Gelissen , 2004 ) .
This could translate into a greater concern for starting a long-term relationship and a stronger belief in sexual exclusivity compared to the never-married ( Hypothesis 2B ) .
In regard to widowed persons , research shows a strong preference for dating instead of traditional long-lasting partnerships ( Carr , 2004 ; McWilliams & Barrett , 2014 ) .
Reasons for avoiding long-term relationships include concern for losing newly found autonomy ( McWilliams & Barrett , 2014 ) ; reluctance to engage in emotional and instrumental caregiving for a new , possibly unhealthy spouse ( Davidson , 2001 ; Talbott , 1998 ) ; potential deprivation of social security benefits associated with the deceased spouse upon remarriage ; unwanted prospect of residential relocation ( Carr , 2004 ) ; or opposition of children to widowed parents ’ repartnering ( Moorman , Booth , & Fingerman , 2006 ) .
Alterovitz and Mendelsohn ( 2013 ) showed that older ages are associated with less interest in sexual aspects and more concern with having a companion with whom to share activities .
We would therefore expect fewer long-term dating intentions and weaker beliefs in sexual exclusivity among widowed daters in comparison to those who have never been married ( Hypothesis 2C ) .
Presence of Children Having children could also shape the dating priorities of individuals looking for a new part- ner .
On the one hand , the presence of children can be perceived as a constraint to repartner- ing .
Across various national settings , multiple studies have found that resident children have a negative effect on parents ’ repartnering chances and the quality of their new match , especially among women ( e.g. , de Graaf & Kalmijn , 2003 ; Goldscheider & Kaufman , 2006 ; Qian , Lichter , & Mellott , 2005 ; Sweeney , 1997 ) .
In addition to restricting the time and opportunities to find a partner , the presence of children is believed to decrease parents ’ mate value and their ability to attract suitable partners ( Qian et al. , 2005 ) .
Prospective partners could perceive nonbiological children as a potential source of relationship conflict ( de Graaf & Kalmijn , 2003 ) and undesired financial and caring responsibil- ities ( Stewart , Manning , & Smock , 2003 ) .
In comparison to childless daters , gay and lesbian parents who wish to start a new relationship might therefore anticipate unfavorable mating prospects and express less demanding dating preferences , meaning weaker long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs ( Hypothesis 3A ) .
On the other hand , the presence of chil- dren has also been shown to enhance parents ’ repartnering prospects , particularly among men ( Wu & Schimmele , 2005 ) .
A positive perception of own mate value for men and the motivation to ensure a proper parenting environment for both men and women could attract a certain level of cautiousness in selecting a new part- ner ( Bzostek , McLanahan , & Carlson , 2012 ) .
Because of heightened expectations , the dating priorities of gay men and lesbians with resident children could point toward more long-term mating strategies and more value attached to sexual exclusivity in comparison to individuals without children ( Hypothesis 3B ) .
528 Journal of Marriage and Family Contextual Determinants of Gay Men and Lesbians ’ Dating Intentions A thorough understanding of the complexity of same-sex partnering behavior should take into account the multitude of factors that shape the manner in which romantic unions are ini- tiated , maintained , and ended ( Kurdek , 2004 ) .
Sexual strategy theory suggests that the choice between short- and long-term mating strategies is highly dependent on context ( Buss & Schmitt , 1993 ) .
Adopting a certain orientation to com- mitment and monogamy is also sensitive to the characteristics of the environment ( Schmitt , 2005 ) .
Therefore , when analyzing gay men and lesbians ’ dating intentions it is essential to account for contextual influences .
This study focused on two types of contextual aspects : ( a ) the normative climate toward same-sex couples and ( b ) the legal context of initiating same-sex relationships .
The normative contextual pre- dictor was addressed at the regional instead of the national level because of significant local variations in normative attitudes toward same-sex partnerships within the same national borders ( see Online Appendix Table OA1 on the Journal of Marriage and Family website [ http : //onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/ ( ISSN ) 1741-3737 ] ) .
The legal context was examined at the national level given that , in the European context , the same set of legal rights for same-sex unions often apply across all regions within a country .
Social and Legal Recognition of Gay Men and Lesbians Across Europe Gay men and lesbians ’ partnering preferences and beliefs are influenced by the level of informal ( attitudes ) and formal ( legislation ) tolerance toward same-sex unions within their environment ( Lau , 2012 ) .
After examining the U.S. context , Patterson ( 2000 ) asserted that the transformation in societal attitudes and legal regulations of same-sex partnerships during the last few decades have strongly influenced the outlook of gay men and lesbians ’ daily lives .
To help readers grasp the variability in legal regulations of same-sex partnerships , we outline below an overview of different national contexts .
The European countries under focus in this study provide diverse landscapes of lesbian and gay rights and , more specifically , of legal recognition for same-sex couples .
A summary of same-sex partnership and parenting rights across countries is provided in Table 1 .
In 2001 , the Netherlands was the first country that provided same-sex couples access to civil marriage .
In Spain , mar- riage became available for same-sex couples in 2005 , and in Sweden it became legal in 2009 .
The second group of countries that do not pro- vide same-sex couples access to civil marriage but do allow for registered partnerships ( i.e. , legally recognized forms of partnership similar to marriage , also referred to as civil unions ) is represented by France , Germany , Austria , and Switzerland .
In France , lesbian and gay couples Table 1 .

aCohabiting same-sex couples have virtually the same rights as cohabiting different sex couples .

cLimited rights .
dLegalized since 2013. eAllowed since 2013 .
Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 529 have been able to benefit from a legal arrange- ment similar to marriage through the Civil Pact of Solidarity since 1999 .
Same-sex marriage actually became legal in France as of May 2013 , but , given that the time of data access for this study is September 2011 , France is included in the group of countries that allow for registered partnerships only .
The Civil Pact of Solidarity allows couples , irrespective of gender compo- sition , to sign a contract that defines their part- nership along various aspects such as property , taxation , health insurance , and so on .
Never- theless , couples in registered partnerships have no rights of shared parental authority , adop- tion , or access to medically assisted reproduction ( Waaldijk , 2009 ) .
In Germany , registered life partnerships for same-sex couples have been per- mitted since 2001 , providing them several of the rights and benefits that married ( different-sex ) couples have , except for presumption of pater- nity or joint adoption .
Since 2004 , same-sex cou- ples in Germany have been eligible to apply for second-parent adoption of each other ’ s bio- logical children , although the responsibilities assigned to the adopting parent remain limited ( Waaldijk , 2009 ) .
In Austria , same-sex couples have been able to register their partnership since 2010 , benefiting from rights similar to those of married couples with the exception of fertil- ity treatments or joint adoption ( second-parent adoption for same-sex couples was eventually enforced in August 2013 ) .
Switzerland has rec- ognized same-sex registered partnerships since 2005 , ensuring the same rights as marriages in terms of social security , insurance , taxation , or property .
Swiss same-sex couples are not enti- tled , however , to fertility treatments or to joint or second-parent adoption rights .
A third category examined in this study and , represented by Italy , includes countries that do not recognize any type of same-sex unions or provide any parenting rights to same-sex cou- ples .
Italy was one of the first European coun- tries to decriminalize same-sex sexual behavior in the second half of the 19th century .
Never- theless , any attempt at legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples in this staunchly Catholic country has failed .
In Italy , same-sex partner- ing is therefore “ neither persecuted nor protected by law , and it must remain private ” ( Lingiardi , Falanga , & D ’ Augelli , 2005 , p. 91 ) , leading to a repressed public awareness of gay and lesbian rights as well as a closeted life for same-sex couples .
The societal climate and degree of legal recognition of same-sex couples define gay men and lesbians ’ uniqueness in the way they initi- ate , maintain , and negotiate their partnerships ( Lannutti , 2007 ) .
Social and legal sanctions are also believed to shape individual variation in mating strategies ( Buss & Schmitt , 1993 ) .
The lack of legal recognition of same-sex part- nerships has the potential to make gay men and lesbians less willing to invest in long-term arrangements because of increased uncertainty regarding the relationship ’ s time horizon ( Lau , 2012 ) .
Furthermore , the social marginaliza- tion of same-sex partnering often leads to the concealing of relationships for gay men and lesbians ( Otis et al. , 2006 ) as well as negative perceptions of relationship quality and longevity ( e.g. , Frost , 2011 ; Frost & Meyer , 2009 ) .
The legal possibility of marrying a same-sex part- ner alters individuals ’ expectations about their future , leading to a potential reconsideration of relationship values ( Lannutti , 2007 ) .
Given increased relationship rewards and heightened feelings of security and stability , formalized same-sex partnerships are associated with higher levels of relationship commitment and investments ( Fingerhut & Maisel , 2010 ) .
As opposed to homophobic environments , which might add multiple relationship stressors and uncertainty about the future among members of same-sex couples ( Frost , 2011 ; Otis et al. , 2006 ) , societal acceptance could lead to less ambiguity for long-term prospects , more visible partnering behavior , and greater relationship investments .
Contexts of both social and legal recognition of same-sex couples should there- fore encourage gay men and lesbians to pursue longer term relationships and favor monogamy ( Hypothesis 4 , Hypothesis 5 ) .
Method Data and Sample We analyzed anonymous profile and preference information of 24,598 gay and lesbian members registered at the eDarling online dating site in the following countries : the Netherlands , Sweden , Spain , France , Germany , Austria , Switzerland , and Italy .
In an agreement with the company , data were accessed in September 2011 .
Launched in early 2009 , eDarling is an online dating company that provides online matchmaking services targeted at a broad audi- ence , allowing searches for different-sex as 530 Journal of Marriage and Family well as same-sex partners ( the website does not provide specific services for individuals with a bisexual orientation ) .
It is currently based in 20 countries in Europe and Latin America , includ- ing the eight countries under focus in this study , and it had an active website and comparable database of users at the time of data access .
The company is one of the largest European partner agencies on the web .
In Germany , for instance , eDarling tops the ranking of online dating services , having roughly twice as many users as their main competitor ( Süllhöfer , 2013 ) .
Online Appendix Table OA2 provides infor- mation about the sample distribution across countries and subregions within countries for the full sample and the samples by sexual orientation .
The gender distribution across regions is mostly balanced , with some excep- tions of overrepresentation of gay men in Zurich ( Switzerland ) or Insular Italy ( the islands of Sicily and Sardinia ) , as well as an overrepre- sentation of lesbian women in northwestern Switzerland .
Because of the absence of official statistics concerning the size and composition of sexual minority groups across Europe ( Festy , 2007 ) , it was difficult to assess how representa- tive our sample of online daters is of the entire lesbian and gay population in each of the eight countries .
Nevertheless , a comparison using U.S. data of gay men and lesbians who met their partner through online dating sites versus elsewhere ( e.g. , via family , friends , school , religious venues , the workplace , etc . )
showed few differences , although gay and lesbian online daters tend to be younger and non-White ( see Online Appendix 3 ) .
The eDarling website provides the possibility of enrolling as either a nonpremium ( free ) or a premium ( paid ) member .
Nonpremium mem- bership includes registration , filling in an entry questionnaire of 283 questions , and the chance of browsing through the proposed profiles of candidates without being able to inspect their photos or exchange e-mails .
To gain access to pictures and to establish and react to con- tacts , a monthly subscription fee is required ( premium membership ) .
Because the data were accessed at one point in time , it may be that some nonpremium members eventually became premium members .
The entry questionnaire includes a personality test , personal details ( e.g. , age , occupation , education level , race , religion , marital status , height , lifestyle habits , etc .
) , and importance awarded to partner ’ s characteristics ( e.g. , education , physical appearance ) , as well as preferences for potential partners in terms of age , height , geographical location , fertility history and plans , lifestyle habits , and race .
The data analyzed in this study focused on the user profile information and the dating preferences and beliefs that people express when filling in the entry questionnaire .
More precisely , we looked at how interested daters were in pursuing long-term relationships and their monogamy beliefs as main dependent variables as well as at their sociodemographic descriptors as either explanatory or control factors .
We used the postal code information in the data set to link individuals to a certain region within a particular country .
We then attached macro-level variables that measure contextual aspects referring to attitudes and legal recogni- tion of same-sex partnerships , which are taken from statistical offices or cross-national surveys , described in more detail below .
The regional units correspond to the Eurostat ’ s Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units classification scheme ( NUTS ) .
In order to comply with data confidentiality agreements , we coded regions at the NUTS-1 level , which corresponds to large-scale regions ( ranging from 3 million to 7 million inhabitants ) , which led to a classification of 53 regions .
Measures Individual-level variables .
Long-term dating intentions are measured on the eDarling site via the item “ I am looking for a long-term relationship , ” which was rated along a 7-point scale ( ranging from 1= not at all through 4= somewhat to 7= very much ) .
The belief in monogamy is measured on the same type of scale with the item “ I believe a serious relation- ship needs to be exclusive ( i.e .
monogamous ) . ” For both variables , most responses clustered at the right extreme of the distribution , with approximately three quarters of daters choosing 5 , 6 , or 7 on the scale .
Given that not all of the seven categories contained enough cases ( only 3.6 % of individuals mentioned being “ not at all ” [ value 1 ] interested in a long-term relationship , and 4.4 % believed a serious relationship needs to be “ not at all ” exclusive ) to support multilevel regression analyses with interaction terms ( as described later ) , we opted to dichotomize the scale .
Individuals who were highly interested in long-term dating and held strong beliefs in Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 531 monogamy ( 5–7 on the original scale ) were coded as 1 , whereas those who had low or only moderate long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs ( 1–4 on the original scale ) were coded as 0 .
Gender was created by combining the infor- mation on gender and the type of partner the online dater was seeking ( man or woman ) and was categorized as gay man ( reference category ) and lesbian woman .
Previous union experience was gauged by looking at the answers to the following question : “ Which of the following statements applies to your marital status ? ” Online daters could choose among four dif- ferent options : “ I have never been married , ” “ I ’ m divorced , ” “ I live in separation , ” or “ I am widowed. ” No information is provided about whether the separation refers to a formal or informal union or whether people left a union with a different-sex or same-sex partner .
Res- ident children was measured via the question “ How many children under 18 live with you ? ” , with the following four options : “ no children ” ( reference ) , “ one child , ” “ two children , ” and “ three or more children. ” As stated previously , this measure does not actually require the child to be biologically or legally related to any of the adults in the household .
Finally , we took into account a set of control variables that have been found to be important predictors from previous studies , including educational level ( Alston & Tucker , 1973 ) , age ( Ha et al. , 2012 ) , race ( Harris & Lee , 2006 ) , religion ( Nock , Sanchez , & Wright , 2008 ) , and type of membership .
For educational level , we harmonize and group each country ’ s par- ticular categorization for education according to the International Standard Classification of Education ( ISCED ) code .
We differentiated between three educational levels and created three dummy variables , which range between ( a ) the reference category of low ( ISCED Levels 0 [ preprimary education ] , 1 [ primary education or first stage of basic education ] , and 2 [ lower sec- ondary or second stage of basic education ] , ( b ) medium ( ISCED 3 [ upper secondary education ] and 4 [ postsecondary nontertiary education ] ) , and ( c ) high ( ISCED 5 [ first stage of tertiary education ] and 6 [ second stage of tertiary edu- cation ] ) .
Age was a continuous variable ranging from 18 to 95 years .
Race was a categorical vari- able with the following values : European , His- panic ( Latin American ) , Arabic , Asian , African , or other .
The initial categorization included Indian as racial group , but it was later recoded into the broader Asian category given that the differentiation between the two groups is not explicit .
Religion distinguished among Christian ( reference ) , Muslim , Buddhist , atheist , nonreli- gious believer ( also referred to as spiritual with- out adhering to a particular religion ) , and other denominations .
Finally , we controlled for user ’ s type of membership , nonpremium or premium .
Contextual-level variables .
The first contextual- level independent variable referred to general attitudes towards same-sex couples , for which we used data from the 2008 wave of the Euro- pean Values Study ( 2011 ) and the item “ Homo- sexual couples should be able to adopt children. ” Because the measure addressed same-sex cou- ples ’ parenting rights , it appropriately gauges the degree of tolerance and acceptance of same-sex partnering at a tangible level , which in this case is family formation .
The variable was measured on a 5-point Likert scale , ranging from 1 ( agree strongly ) to 5 ( disagree strongly ) .
We reversed the scale and computed an aggre- gated mean score at the regional level so that high values represent positive attitudes towards same-sex couples .
To facilitate the interpretation of results , this measure was centered around the mean .
Second , we used the information about the legal recognition of same-sex couples described in Table 1 .
We differentiated between no legal recognition ( reference category ) , registered partnerships , and legal marriage .
Analytical Procedure The first step in the analyses was to examine the main sociodemographic characteristics of the gay men and lesbian women in our sam- ple .
Using runmlwin ( Leckie & Charlton , 2013 ) in Stata , we then engaged in multilevel logistic regression analyses ( Bryk & Raudenbush , 1992 ; Snijders & Bosker , 2012 ) for the two binary out- comes described above .
We estimated random intercept models with two levels that account for the existence of variation in long-term dat- ing intentions and monogamy beliefs across the 53 regions .
This allowed us to take into consid- eration the hierarchical nature of our data and adjust standard errors for the nonindependence of observations ( i.e. , individuals ) nested within the same context ( i.e. , region ) .
We first looked at associations between each outcome variable and gender , previous 532 Journal of Marriage and Family union experience , resident children , and con- trol measures ( Model 1 ) .
Despite formulating hypotheses that broadly referred to both gay men and lesbians , we were nonetheless empiri- cally interested in assessing further similarities and differences between the two groups .
To see whether the link between life course characteris- tics and relationship preferences differs between gay men and lesbians , we subsequently included interactions of the main individual-level predic- tors by gender ( Model 2 ) .
This was followed by the introduction of contextual-level variables .
The correlation between the macro-level mea- sures of attitudes toward same-sex couples and legal recognition of same-sex partnerships was moderately high ( r = .66 , p < .01 ) .
Diagnostic checks using the collin option in Stata detected multicollinearity issues if both predictors were included in the same model .
To avoid biased results , we estimated the two contextual pre- dictors in separate models ( Models 3 and 4 ) .
Finally , to examine whether the association between contextual aspects and relationship preferences differed between gay men and lesbians , we ran additional analyses in which we tested cross-level interactions between each macro-level measure and gender ( Models 5 and 6 ) .
To reduce potential bias due to compositional effects , we also controlled for the regional level composition of the website by including aggre- gated percentages of key sociodemographic variables ( i.e. , education , age ) .
All models were fitted using 10,000-iteration Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimations , which lead to more accurate results when multilevel nonlinear anal- yses are run ( Browne , 2009 ) .
To compare the overall fit of models , we used the Deviance Information Criterion ( DIC ) diagnostic ; models with lower DIC values were preferred over models with higher values .
Results Descriptive Results Descriptive statistics for the individual-level variables used in the analyses of long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs are presented in Table 2 .
First , we found that gay men had slightly higher long-term dating inten- tions , whereas lesbians rated monogamy as important to a somewhat higher extent .
The cor- relation between the two outcome variables was significantly positive for both gay men and les- bians .
This demonstrated that individuals who preferred long-term dating indeed also tended to have positive attitudes toward monogamy ( Simpson & Gangestad , 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , the modest correlation scores confirmed that the two variables captured distinct concepts of relationship preferences .
Moreover , the data in Table 2 indicate that gay men were less likely to have been previously married ( 74.1 % compared to 66.7 % for lesbian women ) .
Lesbian women had more formalized relationship experiences , with 29.1 % of them being either divorced or separated .
Lesbian women were also more likely to have had resident children ( cumulated 21.1 % ) , whereas gay men more often declared the absence of any resident children ( 89.7 % ) .
Gay men were slightly more likely to be highly educated ( 32.2 % ) .
The majority of online daters were young ( mean age of approximately 35 years ) and of European ancestry .
Finally , both gay men and lesbians reported being Christian or atheist to the largest extent .
Multivariate Results The estimated coefficients for Model 1 , which tested the association between outcome vari- ables and gender , previous union experience , and resident children while controlling for vari- ous other characteristics are reported in Table 3 .
Our first hypothesis proposed that lesbians have stronger monogamy beliefs than gay men .
The results presented in Table 3 provide clear evi- dence to support this expectation .
Lesbian online daters indeed displayed a stronger belief in sex- ual exclusivity .
Although no explicit theoreti- cal expectation was proposed with respect to long-term dating intentions , the results show that lesbians had significantly fewer long-term plans than gay men .
The following set of hypotheses proposed that gay men and lesbians with past union expe- rience ( e.g. , divorce , separation ) would have weaker ( Hypothesis 2A ) or stronger ( Hypothesis 2B ) long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs than the never-married .
We also antici- pated that there would be a negative association between relationship preferences and being widowed ( Hypothesis 2C ) .
Model 1 indicated virtually full support for Hypotheses 2A and 2C .
We found that separated and widowed indi- viduals were less likely to pursue a long-term relationship or to value monogamy .
Model 2 added an interaction between previous union experience and gender , which proved significant Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 533 Table 2 .

The results indicated that union experience differ- ences in relationship demands were greater for lesbians than for gay men .
In particular , divorced lesbians showed higher long-term dating intentions and stronger monogamy beliefs than both never-married lesbians and those who were currently separated or wid- owed .
Among gay men , on the other hand , the divorced , separated , and widowed were similar in having less demanding relationship prefer- ences than the never-married .
Model 2 finally showed that the previous finding of lesbians being less likely to prefer long-term dating than gay men applied only to the never-married .
Contrary to this , divorced lesbians displayed higher long-term dating intentions than divorced gay men .

In the third set of hypotheses we tested whether daters with resident children would have weaker ( Hypothesis 3A ) or stronger ( Hypothesis 3B ) long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs compared to those without resident children .
Model 1 provided nearly full support for Hypothesis 3A .
Individ- uals who had at least two coresident children had a significantly lower interest in starting a long-term partnership and weaker beliefs in Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 535 monogamy than those without children .
The negative association between resident children and relationship preferences became significant and larger when the number of resident children increased .
Therefore , the more children present in the household , the less likely gay men and lesbians were to pursue long-term relationships and hold strong monogamy beliefs .
The addition of an interaction of resident children× gender in Model 2 proved to be nonsignificant , indicating a more robust association between relationship preferences and presence of children across gender categories .
We also tested for cumula- tive effects of union experience and resident children on long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs .
Additional analyses ( avail- able on request ) including interaction terms of previous union experience and presence of resident children showed that the two factors operated independently .
We now turn to the findings related to contex- tual factors .
In Table 4 we report the estimated associations between daters ’ relationship pref- erences and attitudes toward same-sex couples as well as legal recognition of same-sex unions .
The fourth hypothesis suggested that more positive attitudes toward same-sex couples in a region would be related to stronger long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs among gay men and lesbians .
The data entirely sup- ported this expectation .
Across all models , the results indicated that the more favorable the attitude toward same-sex couples , the more likely gay men and lesbian daters were to prefer long-term dating and to value monogamy .
The inclusion of gender interactions in Model 5 was nonsignificant , suggesting that there were no major differences between gay men and les- bians when it came to the association between relationship preferences and normative climate toward same-sex partnering .
The fifth and final hypothesis proposed that the legal context of same-sex partnerships would also be linked to gay men and lesbians ’ dating intentions and monogamy beliefs .
More precisely , we argued that gay men and lesbian women living in countries that legally rec- ognize same-sex unions would have stronger long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs compared to those living in countries that do not recognize same-sex unions .
The data again provided almost unequivocal support for the hypothesis .
The results in the left panel of Table 4 demonstrate that the legal recognition of same-sex unions ( as registered partnerships and/or marital unions ) was related to a signifi- cant increase in the intention to start a long-term relationship .
The right panel also indicates a positive association between monogamy beliefs and legal recognition of same-sex marriage .
Interactions with gender in Model 6 were non- significant , showing that the connection between relationship preferences and formal acceptance toward same-sex unions was also consistent across gender categories .
Finally , to make inferences about which con- textual predictor had a more substantial link to gay men and lesbians ’ relationship preferences , despite the inability of estimating them within the same model ( as described previously ) , we could nonetheless draw on goodness-of-fit com- parisons .
Whereas for long-term dating inten- tions the model including legal recognition of same-sex unions displayed a smaller DIC value , for monogamy beliefs a better fitting model was the one that included attitudes toward same-sex couples .
Effect sizes ( e.g. , the effect of legal recognition was more prominent for long-term dating intentions than for monogamy beliefs ; the effect of social acceptance for monogamy beliefs was twice as strong as for long-term dating inten- tions ) also led us to conclude that legal recog- nition of same-sex unions was more strongly associated with daters ’ long-term plans , whereas social tolerance was a better predictor of gay men and lesbians ’ monogamy beliefs .
Discussion This study expands research on gay men and lesbian women ’ s relationship intentions and values by drawing on unique data from Internet daters ’ preference profiles .
The handful of ear- lier studies that have examined the partnering behavior of sexual minorities have mainly relied on small-scale convenience samples or focused on a single geographical context .
Looking at a real-life dating environment , this study analyses the long-term dating intentions and monogamy beliefs of gay men and lesbians across 53 regions in eight European countries .
We also extended existing research by examining not only the influence of individual factors but also contextual determinants .
In line with theoretical expectations and previous empirical studies , we found that , compared to gay men , lesbians hold a stronger belief in the importance of monogamy .
We also demonstrated that , among 536 Journal of Marriage and Family Table 4 .

These results are in line with previous research showing that lesbians are less likely to enter registered partnerships ( Andersson et al. , 2006 ) and suggest that , when no marital history or ties to previous partnerships are present , lesbians perceive fewer benefits and have less interest in long-term commitments than gay men .
Our results further confirm that separation and widowhood among gay men and lesbians are linked with the least demanding partnering Relationship Preferences of Gay and Lesbian Daters 537 standards ( Brines & Joyner , 1999 ; Carr , 2004 ) .
We also unraveled differences between gay and lesbian daters in relation to divorce .
Similar to heterosexual divorcees ’ repartnering patterns , the experience of marital dissolution has dif- ferent implications for women than for men ( Holden & Smock , 1991 ; Sweeney , 1997 ) .
Whereas for divorced gay men marital history is connected with lower long-term dating inten- tions , divorced lesbians display more stringent partnering demands ( Gelissen , 2004 ) by prefer- ring long-term arrangements and placing more emphasis on sexual exclusivity .
This finding could be related to the more economically vul- nerable position that divorced women generally hold in the partnership market ( e.g. , Sweeney , 1997 ) and a thus greater urgency to reenter a formalized union compared to divorced men .
The presence of children also had a strong association with gay men and lesbians ’ relation- ship preferences .
Having at least two resident children was connected to both lower interest in long-term dating and weaker monogamy beliefs .
This reveals a self-evaluation of parenthood as a constraint on the partnership market , particularly as the number of children increases .
The lack of gender differences illustrates that the “ child burden ” effect ( Jansen , Mortelmans , & Snoeckx , 2009 , p. 1285 ) is valid for both gay men and lesbians .
Furthermore , our findings support previous research , which has shown that mating strate- gies as well as monogamy attitudes are subject to contextual influences ( Buss & Schmitt , 1993 ; Schmitt , 2005 ) .
First , the normative climate toward same-sex couples was highly related to daters ’ relationship preferences .
Residing in a supportive environment was associated with an increase in long-term dating intentions and in the value attached to sexual exclusivity for both gay men and lesbians .
The level of formal tol- erance toward same-sex couples has an even stronger link to gays and lesbians ’ long-term plans and monogamy beliefs , particularly in countries where same-sex marriage is legal- ized ( e.g. , the Netherlands , Sweden ) .
The offi- cial recognition of same-sex partnerships indeed allows a longer horizon for pursuing long-term and monogamous relationships for both sexual minority groups ( Lau , 2012 ) .
Additional analy- ses , available on request , also showed that the difference in dating intentions and monogamy beliefs between heterosexual online daters and those with a same-sex orientation is lower in countries that legalize same-sex partnerships .
Therefore , in contexts that legally recognize same-sex unions , gay men and lesbians have partnering values and priorities similar to those of heterosexuals .
The findings of this study have deep impli- cations in support of bringing same-sex part- nerships from “ outlaw to in-law ” ( Rydström , 2004 , p. 175 ) in both normative and institu- tional terms .
The prospect of being able to have a socially and legally accepted union , in par- ticular , a marital contract , provides gay men and lesbians the instruments to better define their partner roles ( Powell , Bolzendahl , Geist , & Carr Steelman , 2010 ) .
It also ensures the secu- rity to envision a sexually committed relation- ship in which relationship-specific investments can also be made .
Moreover , this study ques- tions the validity of previous hypotheses sug- gesting that gay men ’ s preference for casual sex with multiple partners is related to their inherent inability to fulfill typical masculine gender roles and the subsequent desire to reassert their mas- culinity ( Rhodes , McCoy , Hergenrather , Omli , & Durant , 2007 ) .
Our findings show that in contexts where same-sex marriage is legally recognized , gay men distance themselves from the stereotypical image of being prone to only short-term and sexually uncommitted relation- ships .
In addition to providing novel insights into gay men and lesbians ’ dating strategies and monogamy beliefs , this study has several limi- tations .
First , we were constrained by being able to derive individuals ’ same-sex orientation only from whether they searched for a same-sex part- ner online instead of relying on self-identified measures of sexual identity .
Second , the user profile data we used in the analyses did not include information regarding the exact previ- ous union trajectories of gay and lesbian online daters .
Furthermore , we could not make distinc- tions between types of resident children ( e.g. , biological , adopted , pertaining to a previous different-sex or same-sex union ) Given the lack of studies using European large-scale comparative data on these rather marginalized groups , the current research rep- resents a significant leap .
Despite these lim- itations , the current study presents innovative results and draws a comprehensive picture of both individual- and contextual-level determi- nants in the primary phase of the mate selec- tion process of gay and lesbian daters .
Future 538 Journal of Marriage and Family studies could extend this research by using more refined measures of dating intentions and atti- tudes toward monogamy that could address more than one dimension of intentional commitment and relationship values ( Rhoades et al. , 2010 ) .
An additional avenue for research would be a longitudinal examination of whether dating pref- erences and beliefs evolve on the basis of experi- ence on the website .
Moreover , other contextual aspects , such as overall religiosity or economic development , could be examined at the regional level .
Finally , future work might also adopt a two-sided perspective on gay men and lesbians ’ online dating by focusing on the actual contact- ing behavior and matching between members .
