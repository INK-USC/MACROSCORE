We estimate that 8–10 % of the Hadza 's total diet was acquired with the help of honeyguides .
Contrary to most depictions of the human-honeyguide relationship , the Hadza did not actively repay honeyguides , but instead , hid , buried , and burned honeycomb , with the intent of keeping the bird hungry and thus more likely to guide again .

Introduction When searching their woodlands for nests of honey bees , Hadza hunter-gatherers are often helped by the Greater Honeyguide ( Indicator indicator , hereafter ‘ honeyguide ’ ) , a bird that flies ahead of them , leading them to nests of the honey bee , Apis mellifera .
In this article , we 1 ) describe howHadza and honeyguides interacted ; 2 ) test whether honeyguides changed the Hadza ’ s efficiency at finding honey ; 3 ) estimate the fraction of the Hadza ’ s diet that was acquired with honeyguides ’ help ; 4 ) examine how and why the Hadza manipulate honeyguides ; 5 ) discuss the evolution of this relationship .
These research questions arise as part of our ongoing studies of Hadza behavioral ecology ( Marlowe , 2003 , 2010 ; Marlowe & Berbesque , 2009 ; Pontzer et al. , 2012 ; Raichlen et al. , 2014 ; Wood , 2006 ; Wood & Marlowe , 2013 ) .
Here , we are guided by theories of the evolution and maintenance of social foraging strategies , using rates of energy capture as a proxy variable for fitness benefits ( Smith & Winterhalder , 1992 ; Winterhalder , 1996 ) .
We definemutualism in the standard manner as an interaction that provides net benefits to both parties , and commensalism as an interaction which provides net benefits to one party and does no harm to the other ( Boucher , James , & Keeler , 1982 ; Connor , 1995 ) .
We use the term manipulation here to refer to an act by partner A that causes partner B to alter its behavior in a way that is beneficial to A and marginally costly to B.Archaeologists have paid special attention to the role of mutual- istic interactions between humans and other species , largely in order to understand the processes of plant and animal domestication ( Rindos , 1980 ) .
One goal of this paper is to provide a case study of cooperation between humans and a wild animal partner .
We hope this study will help foster an appreciation for the diverse ways in which people like the Hadza engage and influence their ecosystems , embedded in a full suite of species interactions including but not restricted to predation.1.1 .
Hadza , honey , and honeyguides The Hadza are an ethnic group that has traditionally subsisted from hunting and gathering who live in northern Tanzania near Lake Eyasi ( latitude −3.3 to 4.0 ; longitude 34.6–35.6 ; elevation 1200–1600 m ) .
Today there exist approximately 1200 speakers of the Hadza language , among whom about 250 continue to hunt and gather with traditional technologies for approximately 95 % of their total diet .
More ethno- graphic details and information about Hadza subsistence can be found in other publications ( Marlowe , 2010 ; Wood & Marlowe , 2013 ) .
In cultures around the world , honey is highly prized as food and medicine , and there is no known culture with a taboo prohibiting its consumption1 .
Honey forms an important part of the diet of manyh of 258 cultures coded in eHraf World Cultures .

With its warm temperatures , adequate rainfall , wide diversity of flowering plants , and many trees suitable for bee nests , the Hadza ’ s environment is very favorable to bee life and honey production .
Unlike their pastoralist or agricultur- alist neighbors , the Hadza do not construct beehives , but there are standing trees in Hadza country that individuals harvest honey from over many years , even generations .
After the Hadza cut open a tree to access a bee nest , they subsequently place stones into the opening to encourage bees to re-occupy the same tree .
In this way , Hadza honey- hunters contribute both to the destruction and construction of bee nests .
The Hadza recognize 7 species of honey producing bees , six of which are small stingless bees .
The large stinging Apis mellifera ( ‘ awawa ’ to the Hadza ) is by far themost important species in terms of honey production , which reaches its peak during the late wet season ( March-May ) , in synch with peak plant flowering and nectar production .
During this time , ~20 % of the food that Hadza bring back to camp , by weight , is honey ( Marlowe & Berbesque , 2009 ) .
Based on foods brought into Hadza camps , Marlowe et al .
( 2014 ) estimate that 15 % of the total yearly calories that Hadza consume in camp is honey .
Apis mellifera nests are often located high in baobab trees , and can therefore be difficult to spot and access .
Falling from trees while harvesting honey is a major source of injury and death for Hadza men ( Bennett , Barnicot , Woodburn , Pereira , & Henderson , 1973 ; Blurton Jones & Marlowe , 2002 ) .
A. mellifera typically mount a fearsome defense of their colonies , but with the use of smoke , and a high tolerance for bee stings , Hadza men climb into trees and raid their nests .
Women sometimes accompany men on honey hunting trips , helping to search for bee nests , light and tend fires , and process the honey that men extract .
Women will also occasionally chop open the nests of small stingless bees ( Meliponini ) and harvest their honey , but long-term data indicate that men acquire the vast majority of all honey ( Marlowe , 2010 ; Marlowe et al. , 2014 ) .
In all our observations , men have carried out the dangerous work of climbing trees , disturbing A. mellifera colonies , and extracting honey from the colony ’ s nest .
Interviews with Hadza indicate that both men and women prefer honey over all other food types ( Berbesque & Marlowe , 2009 ) .
While honey collecting is most profitable during the wet season , men consistently forage for honey throughout the year , and it is normal for men to carry , along with their bow and arrows , an ax and a container for carrying honey .
When men return to camp with honey , there is a high public demand for sharing , but men often place all the honey they have brought back to camp directly into their households , or hand it all to their wives .
Quantitative analysis of sharing patterns by married men shows that they preferentially share with their wives , children , and relatives living in other households ( Wood & Marlowe , 2013 ) .
Cooperation between African honey-hunters and honeyguide birds caught the attention of early European explorers of East and Southern Africa , who published accounts of honeyguides leading people to nests of honey bees ( Dos Santos , 1891 ; Spaarman , 1777 ) .
In modern times , this intriguing relationship has been featured in textbooks , trade books , magazines , and films to illustrate interspecific cooperation ( Bernard & Bennett , 1996 ; Danchin , Giraldeau , & Cézilly , 2008 ; Flannery , 2011 ; Friedmann , 1954 , 1955 ; Grunton , 1990 ; Orians , 2014 ; Queeny , 1952 ; Sayre & Schindler , 2000 ; Stone , 2011 ) .
Honeyguides are the only wild animal known to actively guide people to sources of food .
A somewhat analogous case of interspecific cooperation has been reported in Brazil and Myanmar , where wild dolphins ( Transiops truncates and Orcaella brevirostris , respectively ) drive fish towards fishermen ’ s nets , a joint foraging tactic that seems to mutually benefit both parties ( Pryor & Lindbergh , 1990 ; Zappes , Andriolo , Simões-Lopes , & Di Beneditto , 2011 ) .
These dolphin-humanpartnerships are reported from only two riverine/estuary systems , and the Brazilian example is documented to have arisen in 1847 .
Isack and Reyer ( 1989 ) provide an in-depth study of communica- tion between honeyguides and Boran pastoralists of Kenya , providing quantitative support for honey-hunters ' claims that they can deduce the direction and distance to bee nests based on honeyguide flight patterns .
The fact that Hadza follow honeyguides has been noted in a few publications ( Crittenden , 2011 ; Marlowe , 2010 ; Wrangham , 2011 ) , and a staged depiction of a Hadza “ repaying ” a honeyguide appears in a film ( Benenson , 2014 ) .
Here , we provide the first quantitative , naturalistic study of Hadza honeyguide interactions .
While foraging , theHadza try to attracthoneyguidesby shouting and whistling particular melodies ( for a recording , see Wood , 2013b ) .
Honeyguides emit a characteristic chatter or “ guiding call ” while leading Hadza , and they also use this call in ways that attracts people and compels them to begin following the bird .
We observed two occasions ( in camps # 3 and # 6 , Table 1 ) inwhich a honeyguideflewdirectly into a Hadza camp andperched on aprominent tree , emitting its characteristic guiding call .
This immediately caught the attention of those in camp who started whistling and talking to the bird ( “ Wait !
Wait ! ” ) .
Honeyguides more commonly attract honey-hunters outside of camp , by flying nearby , emitting their guiding call , whethermen are whistling at the time or not .
These observations generally correspond to reports from other study sites , where honey-hunters whistle and shout to attract honeyguides , and birds are also described as seeking out people to guide ( Dean , Siegfried , & MacDonald , 1990 ; Isack & Reyer , 1989 ) .
During a typical guiding sequence , a honey-hunter follows the bird as it swoops , widely fanning its feathers , from one perch to another , and the two engage in an ongoing exchange of whistles and chatter ( for a recording , see Wood , 2013b ) .
The honeyguide eventually perches near the nest of an A. mellifera colony , which is usually inside a tree .
The honey-hunter then conducts a final search for the exact tree and nest location .
After finding the nest , the honey-hunter lights a torch , climbs up to the nest entrance , blows in smoke to subdue the bees , chops open the tree with an axe , and reaches in for the honeycomb .
While this happens , the honeyguide usually perches quietly nearby .
The special nature of the Hadza-honeyguide relation- ship is attested to by the fact that honeyguides often perch comfortably within arrow-shot distance of Hadza , even though men hunt other bird species of similar size .

Materials and methods The data reported here were collected during focal-individual observations carried out between 2006 and 2013 following 22 different Hadza men as they foraged for wild foods , on 40 separate trips , for a total of 212 hours .
The average age of subjects was 32 years ( n = 40 , range = 17–54 ) on a per-observation basis , and 33 years on a per-subject basis ( n = 22 , range = 17–54 ) .
These focal-individual observations took place in 8 different Hadza camps ( Table 1 ) .
The criteria for selecting a Hadza camp in which to collect data were two- fold : 1 ) that the Hadza living in the campwere foraging and subsisting on a diet of wild foods , rather than engaged in ethno-tourism orwage- labor , and 2 ) that the total set of camps was distributed across the regions that the Hadza occupy .
Though our sample sizes are small for any given year or camp , we think they are broadly representative of Hadza habitats and foraging behavior because the observations are spread out among different years , seasons , regions , camps , individ- uals , and ages ( Table 1 ) .
During focal individual follows , a researcher observed a Hadza subject from the time he left camp to the time he returned to camp , continuously recording relevant behavioral data .
Ourmethods involved the researcher quietly following and observing a single subject from an appropriate distance , providing no direction whatsoever to the subject as to where or how to forage or act .
Where needed , and when doing so would not disturb the events taking place , the researcher asked the Table 1 Camps , years , regions , seasons , and subjects of data collection .
Numbered camps correspond to specific Hadza settlement locations .
Regions are Hadza terms for prominent geographic areas , within which camps are found .
Seasons are defined keeping with Marlowe and Berbesque ( 2009 ) as : early wet ( Dec–Feb ) , late wet ( Mar–May ) , early dry ( Jun–Aug ) and late dry ( Sept–Nov ) .

All of this was done in a quite and discrete manner to minimize observer effects .
The data reported here only include behaviors involving interactions with honeyguide birds and the harvesting of bee nests .
In general , we believe these behavioral domains are minimally influenced by the presence of the researcher : we did not increase or decrease the chance of a subject finding a nest , nor did we provide any direction to the subject before , during , or after the harvesting of bee nests .
During focal individual observations , the researcher recorded how many individuals were in a foraging party when the subject left camp , but thereafter , only recorded continuous observations of the focal individual .
The presence of others was noted if there was a significant social interaction , such as when two individuals shared food with one another , or engaged in other acts of cooperation .
The data recorded included times and locations of the following events : when subjects left camp ; each instance in which a tree was inspected for the presence of a bee nest ; whether tree inspections resulted in the subject finding a bee nest or not ; encounters between honey-hunters and honeyguide birds ; the start and finish of honeyguide follows ; the species of bees in discovered nests ; whether bee nests were harvested or not .
When liquid honey was removed from a nest it ’ s volume was visually estimated , and it was noted whether such honey was placed into a storage vessel or was eaten .
Any later eating of honey held in a storage vessel was similarly noted .
These methods allow us to estimate the total caloric yield from each bee colony , and the fraction of all honey acquired that was eaten by subjects before retuning to camp .
To help calibrate visual estimates of volumes , we used graduated cylinders to measure the volume of more than a hundred different food containers used in Hadza camps , and took pictures of these containers being held .
This resulted in a reference set of scaled photographs of known volumes , which was carried by the researcher and referred to as needed during focal individual observations .
Volumes of honey were converted to weights assuming a density of 1.4 g/ml , ( the average value reported in Ayodele , Folarin , and Oluwalana ( 2006 ) ) and converted to caloric values followingnutritional analyses of Hadza honey reported in Murray , Schoeninger , Bunn , Pickering , andMarlett ( 2001 ) .When a combcontaininghoney or brood , or both , was removed from a nest it was recorded in terms of its length and width , and the percent of the comb filled with honey or brood .
In 2012 , working in camp # 6 , measurements were made of honeycomb that men had brought back to camp , in order to develop Hadza-specific conversion factors between honeycomb sizes and caloric values .
We first measured and weighed 10randomly selected samples of brood-filled comb , and then weighed the wax that Hadza subjects expelled after eating the brood in these samples .
From these data , we calculated that 1 square inch of comb contains 4.7 grams of brood on average , or 5.3 kcal following Finke ( 2005 ) .
Similarly , we measured and weighed 10 randomly selected samples of honey filled comb before the honey was eaten , and then weighed the wax that was expelled by Hadza after they had eaten the honey .
These data indicate that 1 square inch of honey on comb contains 6.9 grams of honey on average , or 25.1 kcal following Murray et al .
( 2001 ) .

Results During 18 of the 40 focal individual observations , the subject followed a honeyguide at least once .
Among all observations , subjects followed honeyguides 26 times , for a total of 329 minutes ( 3 % of observed time ) , and found 18A.melliferanestswith the bird ’ s help , 16of which they harvested ( two were not harvested immediately because of aggressive bees and the hunter not carrying an axe , respectively ) .
There were 13 unique Hadza foragers in the set of 18 focal individual observations in which the subject followed a honeyguide at least once .
Nine unique Hadza foragers harvested the 16 A. mellifera nests found with honeyguides .
Among the 18 focal individual observations in which honeyguides were followed , 15 of these were of a honey-hunter who foraged solitarily throughout the entire period of observation .
In two cases , the focal subject was traveling with a single other companion , and in one of those cases , they jointly followed the honeyguide bird .
Finally , in one instance , the focal subject left camp with five other men , with the intention of cooperatively hunting zebra .
This group only briefly followed a honeyguide bird , and then scared the bird away so that it ’ s guiding call would not alert the nearby herd of zebra to the hunters ’ presence .
Table 1 shows that 71 % ( 10/14 ) of wet season focal individual observations included the subject following a honeyguide bird , while only 31 % ( 8/26 ) of dry season observations did , indicating an unsurprising seasonal difference in honeyguide following ( comparing dry vs. wet : X2 = 4.5 , df = 1 , p b .05 ; comparing across four seasons : X2 = 10.3 , df = 3 , p b .05 ) .
Just as honey production and acquisition typically increase in the wet season ( Marlowe et al. , 2014 ) , so too do interactions with honeyguides .
By all measures , honeyguides greatly increased men 's rates of finding and acquiring honey .
When not led by honeyguides , Hadza encountered honey bee nests at a rate of 0.5 nests/hour , but while guided at a rate of 3.3 nests/hour , a 560 % increase .
Men inspected 554 543B.M .
Wood et al .
/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 540–546trees for the presence of bee nests .
When not guided , they experienced a 19 % success rate of finding a nest upon tree inspection ( 101/523 tree inspections ) ; while being guided , they had a signifi- cantly higher , 58 % success rate , discovering 18 nests from 31 tree inspections ( Χ2 = 24 ; df =1 ; p b 0.001 ) .
Honeyguides ’ only led men to A. mellifera colonies , which produce the largest stores of honey of the 7 local bee species ( others include small stingless bees in the genera Trigona and Lestrimellitta ) .
This selectivity by the bird created a notable “ honeyguide premium ” : men extracted on average 7,480 kcal ( se = 1,790 ) from A. mellifera nests foundwith thehelp of honeyguides , compared to1,390 kcal ( se = 277 ) from all nests ( A. mellifera , Trigona spp. , and Lestrimellitta spp . )
found without honeyguides ( Wilcoxon rank sum W = 1225 ; n1 = 16 , n2 = 88 , p b 0.001 ) .
Focusing only upon A. mellifera nests , we find that honeyguides led Hadza to significantly higher-yielding nests than those they found without honeyguides , which yielded a lower 2,320 kcal on average ( Figure , Wilcoxon rank sum W = 206 ; n1 = 16 , n2 = 17 , p b .05 ) .
The nest yield data underlying these analyses are provided in the supplementary material , available on the journal 's website at www.ehbonline.org .
Because honey production , acquisition , and honeyguide bird encounters all increased in the wet season , it is worth investigating how nest yields varied by season .
The 20 A. mellifera nests harvested in the wet season had an average caloric yield of 5,270 ( se = 1,100 ) and the 13 harvested in the dry season had an average yield of 4,130 kcal ( se = 2,020 ) , a non-significant difference ( Wilcoxon rank sum W =91 ; n1 = 20 , n2 = 13 , p = .15 ) .
In a multiple linear regression analysis of A. mellifera nest yields with season ( dry vs. wet ) and honeyguide-assistance as independent variables , season had a non-significant effect upon nest yield ( estimated effect of ‘ wet season ’ = -1,230 , p = .57 ) while the assistance of honeyguides did have a significant effect ( estimated effect of ‘ helped by honey- guide ’ = 5,660 , p b .05 , model adjusted R2 = 0.15 ) , supporting the hypotheses that honeyguides led men to higher-yielding nests of A. mellifera than those that men found on their own .

In our observations , 49 % ( 119,720/241,860 kcal ) of all the honey and brood calories that men acquired came from nests found with honeyguides ’ help .
Marlowe et al .
( 2014 ) estimate that 15 % of the total food calories that Hadza consume in camp is honey .
Because much honey is eaten outside of camp , the contribution of honey to the total Hadza diet is higher than the in camp figure .
In our observations , men ate 27 % of the total honey and brood they harvested out of camp ( 66,040/241,860 kcal ) .
We therefore estimate that honey and brood comprises 16–20 % of the total yearly diet of foraging Hadza , and that 8-10 % of their total diet is acquired with the help of honeyguides .
Many depictions of the human-honeyguide relationship feature honey-hunters placing aside honeycomb for the bird ’ s consumption after being led to a bee nest ( e.g .
Benenson , 2014 ; Chapin , 1924 ; Flannery , 2011 ; Grunton , 1990 ; Orians , 2014 ; Roosevelt , 1988 ; Spaarman , 1777 ; Stone , 2011 ; van der Post , 1962 ; Wrangham , 2011 ) .
Surprisingly , not once during this study did a Hadza ever place aside honeycomb for a honeyguide , or actively repay one in any way ; on the contrary , if they ever acted to influence the bird ’ s payoff , it was to reduce it .
After Hadza men harvested honey from A. mellifera nests , they often fastidiously collected the honeycomb that remained lying about , and also hid , buried and burned honeycomb to prevent its consumption by the honeyguide ( Table 2 , and see Wood , 2013c for a video of such ) .
BW first observed a Hadza honey-hunter burying A. mellifera honeycomb in 2006 , in camp # 1 .
The follow subject was asked why he was doing this and he simply responded – “ Tikiliko ” ( the Hadza name for I. indicator ) .
Interestingly , in this particular case the honey-hunter had not been led to the bee nest by a honeyguide bird , and there was no honeyguide immediately present .
However , this subject had followed a honeyguide bird earlier that day , and did so again later that day .
Even when men find an A. mellifera nest on their own , and there is no honeyguide immediately present , they will carefully collect pieces of honeycomb that would otherwise remain discarded at the harvesting site .
By doing so , the Hadza generally limit the meals that honeyguides foraging in the area might find and consume , which the Hadza believe increases the bird ’ s hunger andmotivation to guide .
During our observations , when men carefully collected pieces of honeycomb at honey harvesting sites , it was not always clear whether this represented active suppression of the bird ’ s potentialmeal , or was done simply because the follow subject himself could later eat or share the honeycomb– both considerations were probably at work .
In other cases , however , it was unambiguous that men were actively working solely to suppress the bird 's food intake .
In these cases , men collected honeycomb and then hid it in bushes , buried it , or burned it .
We observed 7 such unambiguous cases , carried out by 5 individuals , in 4 camps , in which men clearly worked to limit honeyguide meals .
Manipulating honeyguides in this way requiresminimal work ; it takes only a few seconds to collect , hide , bury , or burn honeycomb .
These observations are tabulated in Table 2 .
It is worth noting that in 6 out of these 7 cases , the subject followed a honeyguide later on the same day , so the practice certainly did not preclude future honeyguide following .
Practicing the methodology of focal individual observations , we followed Hadza subjects when they walked from harvested bee nests , and thus we have no measures of the payoffs realized by honeyguides after men harvested the bee nests .
Even so , we believe that the Hadza ’ s expert ecological knowledge should be taken seriously , and that their calculated manipulation of honeyguides is likely to have the effect they believe it does .
Each of the five subjects who was observed to hide , bury , or burn honeycomb explained to us , in discussions during the focal individual observation and in semi-structured interviews back at camp , that the reason they did so was to keep honeyguides ’ hungry , and thus more eager to guide them ( for a video Table 2 Observations of men actively limiting honeyguide meals .

Other Hadza who have been asked about this practice echo the same stated reasons .
3.1 .
Discussion : interspecific mutualisms We have shown that the Hadza benefited from the bird ’ s assistance ; what did the honeyguides recoup from the relationship ?
Since our data were collected in a Hadza-centric manner , we unfortunately are not able to calculate the effect that Hadza had on the honeyguide ’ s diet ; but we can offer some relevant observations .
Even though Hadza honey-hunters only acted to limit rather than increase the birds ’ payoff , they could not possibly have prevented honeyguides from eating all the scraps of honey or brood or wax that remained inside the now-exposed nests or scattered upon the ground .
Honeyguides are small birds ( ~50 g , Friedmann , ( 1955 ) ) and even a small intake of such scraps could compensate for the bird 's guiding efforts .
We agree with Sachs , Mueller , Wilcox , and Bull ( 2004 ) that an important reasonwhy the human-honeyguide partnership is robust is because the bird is usually assured a benefit simply by the honey- hunter opening the nest entrance , allowing the bird to access honeycomb that would otherwise be inaccessible .
Comparative data indicate that interspecific mutualisms do not require active investments between the partners to evolve or be maintained ( Connor , 1995 ) .
The cooperation between dolphins and fishermen that occurs in Myanmar and Brazil persists without any active “ payments ” by fishermen to their dolphin partners .
Pryor and Lindbergh ( 1990:79 ) state that dolphins herd fish towards fishermen casting nets and then “ take advantage of the confusion which the falling nets cause among the fish schools to catch fish for themselves ” and that following a catch , fishermen “ never give them fish ” .
The benefits to the dolphins appear to be incidental by-products of the self-serving behavior of the fishermen , a form of “ by-product mutualism ” .
Even if they do not provide active food repayments , the fishermen in Myanmar , like the Hadza , provide a less overt form of investment into the well being of their animal partners , in the form of strategically restrained predation ( Tun , 2004:47 ) .
Of course , people extensivelymanipulate the diets of domesticated animals , and suppressing the diet of a hunting or guiding animal might be an especially useful tactic .
In a manner somewhat analogous to the Hadza ’ s treatment of honeyguides , in a variety of cultures , hunting dogs are sometimes “ kept hungry ” prior to a hunt ( Herzog & Vasyukov , 2010 ; Menache , 1998 ) .
3.2 .
Discussion : the evolution of human–honeyguide interactions Dean et al .
( 1990 ) show that even though a supposed partnership between honey-badgers and honeyguides has often been repeated in print , actual credible observations of such are non-existent .
A possibility not considered by Dean et al .
( 1990 ) is the idea proposed by Friedmann ( 1954 ) – that baboonsmight partnerwith honeyguides .
Again , no credible observations of this partnership have beenpublished .
We contacted six principal investigators at sites of long- term baboon research and asked whether they had ever observed baboons interacting with honeyguides , and all six reported never witnessing such ( J. Altman , S. Alberts , R. Palombit , R. Cheney , D. Seyfarth , and L. Swedell , personal communication , 2013 ) .
In summary , there exist no credible first-hand reports of any species other than humans having been led to a bee nest by a honeyguide .
Since humans are the only species attested to partner with honeyguides , this would suggest that humans , or our ancestors , were the partners of proto-honeyguides as the habit evolved .
This idea was first proposed by Hoesch ( 1937 ) , was seconded by Dean et al .
( 1990 ) and recently endorsed by Wrangham ( 2011 ) .
The ecological and technological factors that contributed to the evolution of this relationship are unknown , but the behavioral ecology of non-human primates , hunter-gatherers , and bees does offer some clues , which we use as the basis for an evolutionary model .
Even without any way to directly assess human-honeyguide interactions in the past , we believe it is still credible to propose that the relationship has , over time , evolved from one that is simple and common in nature – commensalism – to one that ismore complex and rarer : manipulative mutualism ( Connor , 1995 ) .
We propose that in a first , commensal phase , honeyguides preyed upon the bee nests and discarded honeycomb that hominins made available through their honey hunting .
In a second , mutualistic phase , honeyguides evolved the habit of actively leading hominins to bee nests .
Finally , in a third phase of manipulative mutualism , hominins began to actively change the payoffs received by honeyguides – either by actively “ rewarding ” them or by reducing their immediate payoff .
The Hadza we observed did not actively reward honeyguides , but such may occur in other contexts .
Below , we provide suggestions for how these interactions initially arose , and how transitions between the three stages took place , based on theory and available evidence .
Based on within-species mtDNA variation , Spottiswoode , Stryjewski , Quader , Colebrook-Robjent , and Sorenson ( 2011 ) conser- vatively estimate that I. indicator is at least 3million years old ( see also Wrangham , 2011 on this topic ) .
We think it is reasonable to assume that an initial commensal association between hominins ( Ardipithecus ramidus or an Australopithicine ) and honeyguides arose in the Pliocene .
Humans , chimpanzees , orangutans , and capuchins have all been observed in the wild using sticks to probe and extract honey from the nests of small stingless bees ( Meliponinae ) ( Brewer & McGrew , 1990 ; Moura & Lee , 2004 ; Sanz & Morgan , 2009 ; van Schaik , Fox , & Sitompul , 1996 ) .
Chimpanzees prey upon A. mellifera colonies more frequently than any other non-human primate ( Wrangham , 2011 ) , and they use distinct tools to probe , open , extract honey and brood from nests , swat away , and kill bees ( Boesch & Boesch , 1990 ; Sanz & Morgan , 2009 ; Wrangham , 2011 ) .
An early hominin such as Ardipithecus ramidus , which possessed both arboreal and bipedal adaptations at 4.4 MYA ( White et al. , 2009 ) , probably also actively foraged for the honey of stingless bees and occasionally that of A. mellifera , aided by simple tools .
545B.M .
Wood et al .
/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 540–546Environmental changes during the last three million years may have led to an increase in the availability of A. mellifera honey in the range of hominins , and corresponding increases in honey consump- tion and commensal interactions with honeyguides .
During the Pliocene , a climatic shift towards drier and cooler conditions led to the expansion of more open , savanna habitats across many parts of Africa ( deMenocal , 1995 ) .
These large-scale changes in plant communities would have altered the biogeography of insect pollina- tors , including bee species .
Standing trees are the preferred nest locations for nearly every species of honey-producing bee in Africa ( Hepburn & Radloff , 1998 ) .
More open habitats , with more widely spaced nest locations , would give pollinators with wider foraging ranges a relative advantage over those with smaller ranges .
Foraging range is known to scale positively with body size among bee species ( Greenleaf , Williams , Winfree , & Kremen , 2007 ; Zurbuchen et al. , 2010 ) , and A. mellifera is larger than all other honey producing bees in Africa ( Michener , 2000 ) .
Single colonies of A. mellifera in Botswana have been recorded to forage over areas 55–80 km2 ( Schneider , 1989 ) and honey bees have been reported to have a maximum foraging radius of 13.5 km ( von Frisch , 1967 ) .
Its wide foraging range , generalist foraging habits , and complex social behavior would have given A. mellifera an advantage in open habitats over its competitors , including the smaller stingless bees .
While A. mellifera and stingless bees are found in both forests and more open savanna habitats , stingless bee diversity is greatest in moist tropical forests ( Michener , 1979 ) .
Across Africa today , the principal plant genera that A. mellifera forages upon are more abundant in savanna environments than in forests ( Hepburn & Radloff , 1995 ) .
Most chimpanzee communities live in forests , but those of Mt .
Assirik , Senegal , occupy an open habitat , with over half of the study area covered with grassland , and only 3 % by forest ( McGrew , Baldwin , & Tutin , 1981 ) .
Interestingly , these savanna-dwelling chimps appear to eat more A.mellifera products than forest-living chimps .
A.mellifera remains were found in 23 % of Assirik chimp feces ( McGrew , 1983 ) , while fecal analyses of forest chimpanzees in both theDemocratic Republic of Congo and Uganda revealed bees or bee products in only 3 % of their feces ( Stanford , 2006 ; Wrangham , 2011 ; Yamagiwa & Basabose , 2006 ) .
Today , Greater Honeyguides avoid lowland forest habitats , and occupy only savannah , shrubland , forest edges , and open woodlands ( Short & Horne , 2001 ) .
The earliest interactions of hominins and proto-honeyguides probably occurred in such habitats .
It is likely that proto-honeyguides would not have led , but instead followed and scrounged from early hominins , as they inadvertently dropped honeycomb to the ground or left it behind in partially harvested nests .
When Chimpanzees attempt to harvest honey from A. mellifera nests , they commonly abandon the nest before exhausting its stores of honey and brood due to attacking bees ( Goodall , 1986 ) .
If early hominins foraged for A. mellifera in a similar manner , then they would have provided rich opportunities for scrounging proto-honeyguides .
The hypothesis that drier , more open habitats led to a competitive advantage for A. mellifera and an increased availability of honey in the range of hominins deserves further scrutiny .
If true , then hominins occupying these habitats would have likewise increased their consumption of highly nutritious and easily digestible A. mellifera honey , resulting in increased interactions with proto-honeyguides .
For at least 2.6 million years , hominins have manufactured stone tools ( Plummer , 2004 ) , which surely enhanced their ability to access A. mellifera nests .
The control of fire and smoke , which is at least 1 million years old ( Berna et al. , 2012 ) , would have further increased hominin ’ s honey-hunting capacity , giving them a means to calm the bees while destructively opening up their nests ( Wrangham , 2011 ) .
As hominins became more technologically adept at opening and exhausting the nests of A. mellifera , the payoff to proto-honeyguides that simply scrounged from hominins would have declined .
In this context , the guiding habit is likely have been positively selected , because as per-nest payoffs to the bird declined , so too did themarginal benefits of accessing second or subsequent nests .
Active guiding would permit the bird to have realized these gains , and would also have provided a mutualistic benefit to the honey-hunter .
A third phase , of manipulative mutualism , arose when humans began actively changing the payoffs that honeyguides received – by investing either in the bird ’ s increased or decreased food intake after nests were harvested .
Either of these strategies might be useful in different contexts .
Ecologically , we would expect that people who regularly harvest honey from the same area , and who experience greater food scarcity , should be more likely to limit the bird ’ s payoff , in order to maximize their own long term diet drawn from the local area .
Individuals who less frequently harvest honey from a locale , or who have greater food security , should be more likely to leave rewards for honeyguides , perhaps as a way to develop a bird ’ s latent guiding habit or to re-enforce one infrequently expressed .
Effective foraging for high quality but difficult-to-acquire foods has been proposed as one of the selective forces underlying the expansion of human brain size over the last two million years ( Kaplan , Hill , Lancaster , & Hurtado , 2000 ) .
On this note , Hadza honey-hunters ’ interactions with honeyguides clearly illustrate an appreciation of the bird ’ s motives , and a cunning application of social intelligence.4 .
Conclusion Our data show that when Hadza followed Greater Honeyguides , their honey-finding efficiency greatly increased , and the bird lead Hadza to higher-yielding nests of A. mellifera than they found without the help of honeyguides .
We estimate that 8-10 % of the Hadza ’ s total diet is acquired with the help of honeyguides , illustrating the importance of this relationship .
First-hand reports only attest to humans being led by honeyguides , and so humans or our hominin ancestors appear to be the most likely partners of proto-honeyguides , as the habit evolved .
Our interpreta- tion of available evidence leads us to suggest that the earliest associations of hominins and honeyguides probably occurred during the Pliocene , and then steadily increased in frequency as savanna habitats expanded , hominins began fashioning stone tools , and gained control over fire .
Honeyguides are proposed to have initially associated with hominins as commensals , and to later have evolved the active guiding habit as Apis mellifera honey became a larger part of the hominin diet .
Themanipulation of honeyguides that wewitnessed probably arose relatively late , after the guiding relationship had evolved between the bird and a less cognitively sophisticated hominin .
The fact that the Hadza do not actively repay honeyguides but instead suppress their diets illustrates that cooperation can endure between people and other species under a robust range of conditions.Supplementary Materials Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http : //dx .
