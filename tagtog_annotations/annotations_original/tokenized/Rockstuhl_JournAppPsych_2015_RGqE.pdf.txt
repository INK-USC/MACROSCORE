Putting Judging Situations Into Situational Judgment Tests : Evidence From Intercultural Multimedia SJTs Thomas Rockstuhl , Soon Ang , and Kok-Yee Ng Nanyang Technological University Filip Lievens Ghent University Linn Van Dyne Michigan State University Although the term situational judgment test ( SJT ) implies judging situations , existing SJTs focus more on judging the effectiveness of different response options ( i.e. , response judgment ) and less on how people perceive and interpret situations ( i.e. , situational judgment ) .
We expand the traditional SJT paradigm and propose that adding explicit assessments of situational judgment to SJTs will provide incremental information beyond that provided by response judgment .
We test this hypothesis across 4 studies using intercultural multimedia SJTs .
Study 1 uses verbal protocol analysis to discover the situational judgments people make when responding to SJT items .
Study 2 shows situational judgment predicts time-lagged , peer-rated task performance and interpersonal citizenship among undergraduate seniors over and above response judgment and other established predictors .
Study 3 shows providing situational judgment did not affect the predictive validity of response judgment .
Study 4 replicates Study 2 in a working adult sample .
We discuss implications for SJT theory as well as the practical implications of putting judging situations back into SJTs .
Keywords : situational judgment test , intercultural skills , performance , verbal protocol analysis Most people remember having to solve story problems on math tests .
Solving these problems requires complex interme- diate judgments to arrive at the final response ( Newell & Simon , 1972 ) .
For example , students first make judgments about the situation in the story ( e.g. , representing the situation as a set of equations ) before applying mathematical reasoning to solve the equations .
Nevertheless , grades typically depend only on whether final responses are correct .
This is problematic because feedback that focuses only on final responses provides little diagnostic information about intermediate judgments .
Tracing intermediate judgments illuminates individual differ- ences in judgment and suggests interventions to improve such judgment ( Weber & Johnson , 2009 ) .
Similar to math problems in school , selection and assessment procedures such as situational judgment tests ( SJTs ) typically focus on final responses .
SJTs ask test-takers to rate the quality of multiple response options or identify the best option to written or video-based work-related situations ( Weekley & Ployhart , 2006 ) .
Although rating response options requires complex judgments about both the situation and possible responses ( Ployhart , 2006 ; Schmitt & Chan , 2006 ) , SJTs typically capture information about the final response only .
As a result , we do not know much about the judgments that people make of the situation that lead to their final response .
Noting this limitation , SJT scholars have repeatedly called for research to examine the intermediate judgments that people make about the situation when responding to SJT items ( Ployhart , 2006 ; Whetzel & McDaniel , 2009 ) .
For example , Ployhart ( 2006 ) called for research to open the black box of situational judgment in SJTs .
Whetzel and McDaniel ( 2009 ) noted that “ research into the factors considered by a respondent in evaluating an item may prove useful in understanding the constructs assessed by the item and may lead to novel ways of scoring SJT items ” ( p. 199 ) .
Ployhart ( 2006 ) further suggested that to open the black box of situational judg- ment , “ it would be informative to conduct a protocol tracing analysis as respondents complete SJTs .
Test takers could describe orally what they are doing mentally as they complete the SJT ” ( p. 102 ) .
In sum , SJT research stands to benefit substantially from a better understanding of how people subjectively interpret situa- tions in SJTs .
In fact , one may even argue that the term situational judgment test is a misnomer without an explicit assessment of judgments about the situation .
In this article , we build on the strong foundation of existing SJT research and propose that adding an assessment of how people per- ceive and interpret situations ( situational judgment ) to SJTs will provide incremental information beyond the typical focus on choosing the best response ( response judgment ) .
We demonstrate the value of this novel approach with four studies and multiple samples .

We draw upon the results from Study 1 to operationalize situational judg- ment in subsequent studies .
In Study 2 , we examine the incremen- tal validity of situational judgment over and above response judg- ment in predicting task performance and interpersonal citizenship ( organizational citizenship behavior [ OCB ] ) .
We focus on task performance and interpersonal OCB for two reasons .
First , meta- analyses show that SJTs are important predictors of both types of performance ( Christian , Edwards , & Bradley , 2010 ) .
Second , as- sessing the contributions of situational judgment and response judgment to predicting task performance and interpersonal OCB may deepen our understanding of why SJTs predict both types of performance .
In Study 3 , we assess whether adding situational judgment in SJTs could inadvertently affect the predictive validity of response judgment , for example , due to cognitive fatigue , learn- ing , context- , or accessibility effects ( e.g. , Feldman & Lynch , 1988 ) .
In Study 4 , we replicate and extend Study 2 by testing hypotheses with a different population and controlling for addi- tional individual characteristics .
Overall , this set of four studies should contribute to existing SJT research in three key ways .
First , we expand the SJT paradigm by putting situational judgment back into situational judgment tests .
We do this by asking people explicitly to make judgments about the situation , in addition to making response judgments .
Second , we test and show incremental predictive validity of situational judgment , over and above response judgment .
Third , we compare and show the relative importance of situational judgment and response judgment as predictors of two key performance out- comes : task performance and interpersonal OCB .
The nature and type of situations tested by any SJT represent boundary conditions ( Schmitt & Chan , 2006 ) .
Most SJTs focus on interpersonal situations ( Christian et al. , 2010 ) .
In this research , we focus specifically on intercultural interpersonal situations .
This is because intercultural interactions present especially challenging interpersonal situations ( Ang & Van Dyne , 2008 ; Gelfand , Erez , & Aycan , 2007 ) and are prone to misjudgments ( Earley & Ang , 2003 ; Triandis , 2006 ) .
The difficulty of judging intercultural sit- uations makes such situations an appropriate context to uncover types of situational judgments .
Moreover , with the growing diver- sity in the workplace ( Shore et al. , 2011 ) , having an intercultural SJT that predicts performance outcomes in culturally diverse con- texts should make a significant practical contribution to the selec- tion literature ( Lievens , 2006 ) .
Theory and Hypotheses What Is Situational Judgment ?
Motowidlo and colleagues ( Motowidlo & Beier , 2010 ; Motow- idlo , Hooper , & Jackson , 2006 ) proposed that the typical assess- ment of response judgment in SJTs measures “ procedural knowl- edge about effective action in work situations described by the SJT ” ( Motowidlo & Beier , 2010 , p. 321 ) .
Thus , response judg- ments in SJTs focus on assessments of the appropriateness of various response options presented for a specific situation .
Recent theorizing about SJTs suggests that response judgment represents only one aspect of judgment in SJTs ( Ployhart , 2006 ) .
For instance , Ployhart ( 2006 ) suggested that before respondents can arrive at a response judgment , they must first comprehend the situation , especially when the situation in the SJT is filled with ambiguous cues and incomplete information .
These initial attempts to comprehend the situation represent situational judgments , which according to attribution theory ( Heider , 1958 ; Weiner , 1995 ) are distinct from response judgments .
Drawing upon attribution theory , we refer to situational judg- ments as individuals ’ sense-making of a situation , which enables them to comprehend , explain , attribute , extrapolate , and predict situations .
Response judgments , on the other hand , refer to judg- ments about the most appropriate response after evaluating the costs and benefits of available response options .
Although distinct , the two types of judgment are related .
As Heider ( 1958 ) noted , “ a person reacts to what he thinks the other person is perceiving , feeling , and thinking ” ( p. 1 ; emphasis added ) .
This highlights that a person ’ s situational judgments ( e.g. , what I think the other person is perceiving , feeling , and thinking ) play a critical role in shaping the person ’ s response judgments ( e.g. , what is an appropriate action to take ; Jansen et al. , 2013 ) .
The distinction between situational judgment and response judg- ment suggests that both types of judgment provide unique and complementary information about individuals .
In support of this argument , Magnusson and Ekehammar ( 1975 ) empirically found two forms of judgments—judgments of the situation and judg- ments of responses to the situation .
In some instances , people judge the situation differently but respond similarly ; in other instances , people may judge the situation similarly but respond differently .
Accordingly , a central hypothesis in our research is that people ’ s judgments of the situation provide incremental ex- planatory power , over and above their response judgments , in predicting job performance .
Below , we elaborate on the relation- ships between situational judgment and response judgments in predicting task performance and interpersonal OCB in intercultural situations , which provide the context to our study .
Situational Judgment and Task Performance As noted above , Heider ( 1958 ) suggested that judgments about interpersonal situations involve judgments about what others are perceiving , feeling , and thinking .
People make these judgments to understand others ’ expectations about appropriate behaviors , which helps them to weigh the benefits and costs of different response options ( Jansen et al. , 2013 ) .
Understanding others ’ expectations is particularly important in intercultural situations because culture influences expectations of what is an appropriate behavior in different contexts ( Triandis , 2006 ) .
For example , research shows that culture influences expec- tations about appropriate leadership ( House , Hanges , Javidan , Dor- fman , & Gupta , 2004 ) and team ( Gibson & Zellmer-Bruhn , 2001 ) behaviors .
At the same time , people often do not directly commu- nicate their expectations of effective behaviors , thus making inter- cultural interactions particularly challenging ( Molinsky , 2013 ) .
To effectively fulfill role expectations related to task performance , individuals first need to infer accurately what culturally diverse others consider as appropriate behaviors .
Hence , we expect that keen situational judgment will predict task performance in intercultural contexts , above and beyond re- sponse judgment .
The more accurately individuals can observe , T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

465JUDGING SITUATIONS IN SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT TESTS interpret and explain what is happening in the situation ( i.e. , situational judgment ) , the more they can adjust their behaviors according to role expectations to achieve their work outcomes ( Stone-Romero , Stone , & Salas , 2003 ) .
For example , a Western manager with keen situational judgment might be sensitive to the appropriate time to speak up during meetings with Asians .
Like- wise , an Asian manager with keen situational judgment might deduce when Western managers prefer to make decisions on the spot and minimize the time spent involving others in discussion .
In sum , we expect individuals with better situational judgment to be more effective in their tasks in intercultural situations , after taking into account response judgment .
Hypothesis 1 : Situational judgment predicts task performance over and above response judgment .
Situational Judgment and Interpersonal OCB Situational judgments about what others are perceiving , feeling , and thinking should also complement response judgment as a predictor of interpersonal OCB .
In their meta-analysis of the predictive validity of SJTs , Christian et al .
( 2010 ) suggested that response judgments in interpersonal SJTs relate to interpersonal OCB to the extent that they “ reflect the ability to perceive and interpret social dynamics in such a way that facilitates judgments regarding the timing and appropriateness of contextual behaviors ” ( p. 92 ) .
This reasoning implies that response judgments in inter- personal SJTs inherently involve situational judgments , and that situational judgments are critical in helping individuals know when and how to engage in interpersonal citizenship behaviors such as helping .
Knowing when and how to help others is particularly relevant in intercultural contexts because cultural differences in emotional expressions ( Elfenbein & Ambady , 2002 ) and communication directness ( Spencer-Oatey , 2008 ) can make it hard to judge when others need help .
Cultural differences also affect expectations about what constitutes appropriate helping ( Farh , Zhong , & Organ , 2004 ) .
Building on Christian et al. ’ s ( 2000 ) arguments , we expect situational judgment to predict interpersonal OCB in intercultural contexts , even after controlling for response judgment .
Individuals who can more accurately observe , interpret , and explain behaviors in intercultural situations are more likely to discern when cultur- ally diverse others would appreciate help and what kinds of help would be appropriate .
Hypothesis 2 : Situational judgment predicts interpersonal OCB over and above response judgment .
Study 1 As highlighted in the introduction , we do not know much about the nature of situational judgment in SJTs or how to operationalize situational judgment .
To better understand the nature of situational judgment in SJTs , we conducted a verbal protocol analysis ( Eric- sson & Simon , 1993 ) of people ’ s thought processes as they com- pleted the SJT .
Specifically , we asked individuals to “ think out loud ” as they decided how to respond to various SJT items .
This verbal protocol approach allowed us to access the thought pro- cesses of SJT respondents in real time .
We then content-analyzed transcriptions of these verbal protocols to uncover the kinds of situational judgments that respondents make .
Our goal was to identify which aspects of the situation in the SJT items respondents used to help them arrive at a possible response to the situation .
We used the results from Study 1 to guide our operationalization of situational judgment in subsequent studies .
Method Participants .
Twelve international managers with profes- sional links to the university ’ s research center provided data for Study 1 .
Managers ( 50 % female ; mean age 30.6 years ; SD 5.88 years ) came from a variety of Asian and Western countries : China ( two ) , France ( one ) , Germany ( two ) , Japan ( one ) , Malaysia ( one ) , Philippines ( one ) , Singapore ( two ) , and the United States ( two ) .
On average , managers had 5.6 years ( SD 5.30 ) of previ- ous international work experience .
Procedure .
The 12 managers came to the experimental labs at the university and learned to produce verbal protocols .
Each ses- sion consisted of 20-min practice verbal protocol exercises adapted from Ericsson and Simon ( 1993 ) .
Next , they completed verbal protocols on four randomly ordered , multimedia SJT items depict- ing intercultural situations ( the Appendix describes the develop- ment of the intercultural SJT ) .
Managers first watched an inter- cultural SJT item .
We then asked them to “ think aloud : What would you do next in the situation you have just seen ? ” We gave managers as much time as they needed .
Verbal protocols lasted between 2 and 8 min ( M 4.27 min ; SD 2.43 min ) for each SJT item .
Coding .
The 12 managers generated 48 verbal protocols ( 12 managers 4 SJT items ) .
We audio-recorded the verbal protocols .
A professional transcription service then transcribed the verbal protocols .
The first two authors randomly selected one transcribed verbal protocol at a time and identified categories of situational judgment types .
We first independently read each verbal protocol and then discussed types of situational judgment from that proto- col. By the end of the sixth protocol , we had identified 11 situa- tional judgments ( see Table 1 for definitions and examples ) and reached theoretical saturation , as we could no longer find addi- tional situational judgment categories ( Strauss & Corbin , 1990 ) .
We then recruited and trained two research assistants ( Raters A and B ) with the six protocols used to generate the 11 categories .
Each rater then independently coded the remaining 42 transcribed protocols .
The first author met with the two raters regularly to assess interrater agreement and resolve differences .
All 11 situa- tional judgment categories yielded acceptable interrater agreement using Cohen ’ s kappa ( range : .74–.93 ; see Table 1 ) .
All agreement indices exceed the .60 threshold ( Landis & Koch , 1977 ) .
The overall Cohen ’ s kappa across all 48 verbal protocols and 11 situational judgment types was .81 .
Results and Discussion Table 1 summarizes the coding results .
Three hundred twelve , or approximately 82 % , of the 382 situational judgments reflect three dominant categories : 1. intentions ( n 158 ; 41.4 % ) ; 2. emotions ( n 90 , 23.6 % ) ; and T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

The remaining 70 ( approximately 18 % ) situational judgments clustered into eight other categories reflecting 4. the relationship between the parties ( n 20 , 5.2 % ) ; 5. situational constraints faced by the parties ( n 18 , 4.7 % ) ; 6. parties ’ traits ( n 14 , 3.7 % ) ; 7. parties ’ knowledge about the situation of their counter- part ( n 5 , 1.3 % ) ; 8. parties ’ abilities ( n 4 , 1.0 % ) ; 9. parties ’ effort ( n 4 , 1.0 % ) ; 10. prior behaviors ( n 3 , 0.8 % ) ; and 11. situational forecasting ( n 2 , 0.5 % ) .
Given that intentions , emotions , and thoughts composed 82 % of the situation judgments made by respondents in Study 1 , we assessed situational judgment in our subsequent studies by asking participants to describe the thoughts , emotions , and intentions of the parties in the intercultural SJT items .
In the next study , we test whether situational judgment predicts task performance and inter- personal OCBs beyond response judgment typically used in SJTs .
Study 2 Method Participants .
One hundred thirty-two ( n 132 ) university seniors participated in this study .
They were drawn from an inter- national organizational behavior course at a large business school in Singapore .
Participant ’ s mean age was 22 years ( SD 1.4 years ) , and 67 % were female .
Participants were diverse , represent- ing 24 countries across five continents .
On average , each partici- pant had 3.9 years ( SD 1.28 years ) of previous work experience and had traveled to 10 countries ( SD 7.67 ) ; 94 % of them spoke at least two languages .
Procedures .
We randomly assigned students to 19 culturally diverse teams ( six to eight members per team ) .
Teams were highly diverse in national cultures ( average Blau ’ s [ 1977 ] index of het- erogeneity .82 , SD 0.12 ) .
Teams were self-managed and were not assigned formal leaders .
Teams worked on an intensive 3-month team project .
The goal of the project was to produce a 10-min multimedia dramatization of a challenging intercultural interaction .
We collected data at three points during the course .
At Time 1 ( beginning of the course ) , team members completed online surveys of personality , cognitive ability , and demographic characteristics .
At Time 2 ( 2 weeks into the course , at the beginning of their project ) , they completed the intercultural SJT .
At Time 3 ( at the end of their project ) , peers rated task performance and interper- sonal OCB of team members using a full round-robin design ( i.e. , Table 1 Interrater Agreement and Frequencies of Situational Judgment Types in Verbal Protocol Analysis ( Study 1 ) Type of situational judgment Definition Example from verbal protocols Cohen ’ s Overall frequency 1 .

Measures .
Unless otherwise indicated , we measured all vari- ables using Likert-type scales anchored at 1 strongly disagree and 7 strongly agree .
Criterion measures : Task performance and interpersonal OCB .
Team members assessed task performance with three in- role behavior items ( e.g. , fulfilled responsibilities of the project ; rWG ( J ) .90 ; .89 ) adapted from Williams and Anderson ( 1991 ) .
Team members rated interpersonal OCB using three items ( e.g. , assisted other group members with their work ; rWG ( J ) .85 ; .80 ) from Van Dyne and LePine ( 1998 ) .
We conducted confirmatory factor analyses of both criterion measures using LISREL 8.8 ( Jöreskog & Sörbom , 1996 ) .
The hypothesized two-factor model ( task performance and interper- sonal OCB ) showed excellent fit : 2 ( 8df ) 3.97 , ns ; 2/df .50 , IFI .99 , RMSEA .01 .
All factor loadings were statistically significant ( .72 – .96 , p .01 ) .
The two-factor model showed significantly better fit than a single-factor model , 2 ( 1df ) 141.12 , p .001 .
Predictor measures : Situational judgment and response judgment .
The intercultural SJT ( see Appendix ) contained seven multimedia items that participants watched in randomized order .
After each SJT item , they answered two constructed- response ( open-ended ) questions—one assessing situational judg- ment and the other , response judgment .
On the basis of the results from Study 1 , we elicited situational judgment with the following question : “ What are the thoughts , feelings , and intentions of the people in the video ? ” We elicited response judgment with the following question : “ What would you do next in the situation you have just seen ? ” We employed four research assistants , all blind to the hypoth- eses , for Study 2 .
The original two raters , A and B , from Study 1 rated the quality of situational judgment .
Raters scored situational judgment using the following holistic rating scale ( e.g. , Byham , 1977 ) : “ To what extent does this response demonstrate under- standing of the thoughts , feelings , and intentions of the parties in the vignette ?
( 1 not at all ; 2 little ; 3 moderate ; 4 well ; 5 very well ) . ” Raters C and D rated response judgments , using the following holistic rating scale : “ To what extent does this response effectively resolve the situation depicted in the vignette ?
( 1 not at all effective ; 2 slightly effective ; 3 somewhat effective ; 4 effective ; 5 very effective ) . ” We provided frame-of-reference training to all raters according to procedures outlined by Pulakos ( 1984 ) .
We provided raters with definitions and scale anchors , as well as annotated scripts and behavioral examples ( Smith & Kendall , 1963 ) of effective and ineffective situational and response judgments for each SJT item .
For situational judgment , we generated behavioral examples of effective responses based on point of view interpretations of each culture depicted in each item .
For response judgment , we gener- ated behavioral examples of effective and ineffective responses based on the dual concern model of conflict management ( Thomas , 1976 ) .
Next , raters discussed the information .
We then presented and discussed example responses that represented different levels of performance ( i.e. , good situational and response judgments vs. poor situational and response judgments ) .
Raters then practiced making ratings in response to practice responses , and we provided them with feedback .
Each rater then independently began rating actual responses .
We met with all raters after the first 10 responses to assess interrater agreement and resolve differences .
We assessed interrater agreement between Raters A and B as well as between Raters C and D using intraclass correlations ( ICC2.1 ; Shrout & Fleiss , 1979 ) .
The average intraclass correlation was .88 for situational judgment and .77 for response judgment .
These ICC2.1 statistics met LeBreton and Senter ’ s ( 2007 ) cutoff of .70 .
We averaged ratings of situational judgment across Raters A and B ( .92 ) , and ratings of response judgment across Raters C and D ( .79 ) .
Table 2 shows that the hypothesized two-factor ( situational judgment and response judgment ) measurement model with cor- related uniqueness factors between indicators from the same SJT items ( Lance , Woehr , & Meade , 2007 ) showed good fit to the data : 2 ( 69df ) 88.73 , ns ; 2/df 1.29 , IFI .98 , RMSEA .05 .
All factor loadings were statistically significant ( .46–.86 , p .01 ) .
We compared the hypothesized model with alternative models .
The hypothesized two-factor model was a significantly better fit than ( a ) a two-factor model that did not allow for correlated uniqueness factors ( Model 2 : 2 ( 7df ) 71.14 , p .001 ) ; ( b ) a single-factor model with correlated uniqueness factors ( Model 3 : 2 ( 1df ) 28.65 , p .001 ) ; and ( c ) a single-factor model without correlated uniqueness factors ( Model 4 : 2 [ 8df ] 101.96 , p .001 ) .
Together , these results support the discriminant validity of situational judgment and response judgment .

468 ROCKSTUHL , ANG , NG , LIEVENS , AND VAN DYNE SJT research ( Lievens , Peeters , & Schollaert , 2008 ; McDaniel , Hartman , Whetzel , & Grubb , 2007 ) .
We measured cognitive abil- ity with the Wonderlic Personnel Test ( Wonderlic , 1999 ) ; Big Five personality traits with Goldberg ’ s ( 1999 ) 50-item IPIP-FFM : ex- traversion ( 10 items , .90 ) , agreeableness ( 10 items , .76 ) , conscientiousness ( 10 items , .81 ) , emotional stability ( 10 items , .88 ) , and openness to experience ( 10 items , .84 ) .
We also controlled for gender ( 0 male , 1 female ) , language proficiency ( total number of languages spoken ) , and international experience ( number of countries visited ) .
Analytic strategy .
We used the software program SOREMO ( Kenny , 1995 ) for social relations model analyses of the round- robin ( i.e. , peer ) data on task performance and interpersonal OCB .
SOREMO calculates target scores , which are an index of how that individual was perceived by others in the group , for each partici- pant .
In calculating target scores , SOREMO removed group dif- ferences ( i.e. , subtracting the group mean from the average of all peer ratings for a target person ) , making target scores statistically independent of group membership and thus appropriate for statis- tical procedures that assume independence ( see Kenny & La Voie , 1984 ) .
To support the estimation of individual target scores , SOREMO partitions the overall variance in the dependent variable into vari- ance attributable to different sources .
The proportion of the total variance in peer ratings that is attributable to group effects is referred to as group variance .
The proportion of the total variance in peer ratings that is attributable to characteristics of targets ( i.e. , focal team members ) is referred to as target variance ( Kenny & La Voie , 1984 ) .
SOREMO also produces a significance test for these variances based on a Z test ( Kenny , 1995 ) .
Nonsignificant group variances support the removal of group differences , whereas sig- nificant target variances indicate substantial interrater agreement and support the estimation of individual target scores ( Kenny & La Voie , 1984 ) .
Group variances were not significant for either task performance ( group variance .12 , Z 1.60 , ns ) or interpersonal OCB ( group variance .11 , Z 1.60 , ns ) .
At the same time , target variance was statistically significant for task performance ( target variance .13 , Z 3.67 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( target variance .09 , Z 3.13 , p .01 ) .
We therefore estimated individual target scores for both task performance and interpersonal OCB .
We tested our hypotheses using hierarchical regression analyses .
We entered control variables ( i.e. , gender , language proficiency , in- ternational experience , work experience , cognitive ability , and Big Five personality ) in the first step , response judgment in the second , and situational judgment in the third .
We conducted relative weights analysis ( Johnson & LeBreton , 2004 ) to assess the relative importance of situational judgment vis-à-vis response judgment .
Results and Discussion Descriptive statistics .
Means , standard deviations , and corre- lations appear in Table 3 .
Situational judgment was positively related to task performance ( r .40 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( r .38 , p .01 ) , providing preliminary support for the role of situational judgment in predicting performance outcomes .
Response judgment correlated positively with task performance ( r .44 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( r .28 , p .01 ) .
These findings are consistent with prior SJT research .

469JUDGING SITUATIONS IN SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT TESTS meta-analyses of SJT research ( based on interpersonal SJTs and supervisor ratings of performance ) reported correlations of .21 between response judgment and task performance , and .25 be- tween response judgment and contextual performance ( Christian et al. , 2010 ) .
Hypotheses tests .
We proposed that situational judgment would predict task performance ( H1 ) and interpersonal OCB ( H2 ) , over and above response judgment .
Results support H1 .
Situational judgment predicted task performance ( .26 , p .01 ; Model 3 , Table 4 ) and explained an additional 4 % variance in task perfor- mance ( p .01 ) over and above response judgment and controls .
Relative weights analysis shows that response judgment accounted for 25.3 % ( 95 % CI 8.3 % , 38.6 % ; p .05 ) and situational judgment accounted for 24.5 % ( 95 % CI 5.5 % , 55.1 % ; p .05 ) of explained variance in task performance .
Relative weights for situational and response judgments were not significantly different from each other ( 95 % CI 41.3 % , 27.5 % ; ns ) , suggesting that the two judgments are not significantly different in their impor- tance as predictors of task performance .
Results without control variables replicated these findings .
Our results also support H2 .
Situational judgment predicted interpersonal OCB ( .24 , p .05 ; Model 6 ) , explaining an additional 4 % variance ( p .01 ) over and above response judg- ment and controls .
Relative weights analysis shows situational judgment accounted for 30.0 % ( 95 % CI 9.1 % , 64.6 % ; p .05 ) of explained variance in interpersonal OCB .
By contrast , response judgment accounted for 11.5 % ( 95 % CI 3 % , 41.8 % ; ns ) .
This difference in relative weights between situational and response judgment approached the traditional level of statistical significance ( 90 % CI 51.0 % , 4.4 % ; p .06 ) , suggesting that situational judgment may be a more important predictor of interpersonal OCB than response judgment .
Results without control variables repli- cated these findings .
Taken together , these analyses support a key assumption moti- vating our research—namely , that adding an explicit assessment of situational judgment provides incremental validity for predicting two key types of performance ( task performance and interpersonal OCB ) .
The pattern of findings also suggests that beyond the joint variance shared between situational and response judg- ments : ( a ) both situational and response judgments significantly predict unique variance in task performance ; and ( b ) situational judgment significantly explains unique variance in interper- sonal OCB but response judgment does not .
These results provide initial support for our argument that response judgment in SJTs might predict interpersonal OCB because it inherently assesses situational judgment .
We realize that typical SJTs ask only about response judgment .
It is therefore possible that adding situational judgment may have affected the predictive validity of response judgment in this study .
For example , this could be due to cognitive fatigue , learning , context , or accessibility effects ( e.g. , Feldman & Lynch , 1988 ) .
Thus , we wanted to explore whether asking respondents to make situational judgments might have eroded the predictive validity of response judgment in Study 2 .
To this end , we conducted Study 3 with a similar sample and had respondents make response judg- ments but not make situational judgments .
Study 3 Method Participants .
Eighty-nine ( n 89 ) university seniors from a different cohort of the same international organizational behavior course as Study 2 provided data .
Participants ’ mean age was 22 years ( SD 1.5 years ) , and 55 % were female .
Participants were diverse , representing 17 countries across five continents .
On av- erage , each participant had 4.2 years ( SD 2.06 years ) of previous work experience and had traveled to 13 countries ( SD 8.30 ) ; 91 % spoke at least two languages .
Procedures .
We used the same task , procedures , and mea- sures as Study 2 .

470 ROCKSTUHL , ANG , NG , LIEVENS , AND VAN DYNE .86 , SD 0.10 ) produced multimedia dramatizations of challeng- ing intercultural interactions .
Time 1 data included personality , cognitive ability , and demo- graphics .
At Time 2 , participants completed intercultural SJT response judgment but did not complete situational judgment .
At Time 3 , peers provided round-robin ratings of task performance and interpersonal OCB .
Measures .
We used the same measures as Study 2 for sub- stantive constructs .
Table 5 reports descriptive statistics , internal consistency reliability ( alpha ) coefficients , and correlations .
Criterion measures : Task performance and interpersonal OCB .
Peers rated task performance ( rWG ( J ) .87 ; .91 ) and interpersonal OCB ( rWG ( J ) .81 ; .85 ) .
Group variances were not significant for either task performance ( group variance .09 , Z 1.05 , ns ) or interpersonal OCB ( group variance .10 , Z 1.21 , ns ) , supporting the removal of group differences for the estimation of target scores .
In addition , target scores showed agreement between peer-ratings and statistically significant amounts of target variance for task performance ( target variance .19 , Z 3.12 , p .01 and interpersonal OCB ( target variance .14 , Z 2.89 , p .01 ) .
Predictor measure : Response judgment .
Two research as- sistants assessed the quality of response judgment .
Interrater agreement exceeded .70 ( ICC2.1 .81 ) so we averaged ratings of response judgment ( .75 ) across raters .
Control measures .
We controlled for cognitive ability ( Wonderlic , 1999 ) , Big Five ( .72 – .90 ) , previous work experience , international experience , number of languages spo- ken , and gender .
Analytic strategy .
Following recommendations of Byrne , Shavelson , and Muthén ( 1989 ) , we conducted a series of mul- tigroup confirmatory factor analyses to assess the equivalence of response judgments across the samples in Studies 2 and 3 .
First , we tested the hypothesized model for each sample sepa- rately .
Second , we tested for configural invariance between the samples .
Third , we tested for metric invariance of response judgment between samples by fixing factor loadings to be equal across the samples .
Finally , we tested for predictive invariance by fixing relationships of response judgment with task perfor- mance and interpersonal OCB to be equal across both samples .
Results and Discussion Descriptive statistics .
Table 5 reports means , standard de- viations , and correlations .
Response judgment was positively related to task performance ( r .38 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( r .29 , p .01 ) .
The strength of these correlations is not significantly different from those observed in Study 2 ( task performance : r .44 , Z .52 , ns ; interpersonal OCB : r .28 , Z .08 , ns ) .
Multivariate regression analyses .
Table 6 summarizes re- sults of hierarchical linear regression .
Response judgment pre- dicted task performance ( .33 , p .01 ; Model 2 , Table 6 ) and interpersonal OCB ( .26 , p .05 ; Model 4 , Table 6 ) , after accounting for the controls .
Relationships were similar to those in Study 2 ( task performance : .33 , p .01 ; inter- personal OCB : .19 , p .01 ) .
Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses .
The hypothe- sized three-factor model ( task performance , interpersonal OCB , and response judgment ) had good fit to the data in both samples ( Study 2 : 2 [ 62df ] 87.54 , p .05 , 2/df 1.41 , IFI .97 , RMSEA .06 ; Study 3 : 2 [ 62df ] 97.08 , p .01 , 2/df 1.57 , IFI .95 , RMSEA .08 ) .
Results further show configural invariance between both samples : 2 [ 124df ] 144.18 , ns , 2/df 1.16 , IFI .98 , RMSEA .04 as well as metric invariance ( 2 [ 6df ] 3.98 , ns ) .
Fixing relationships of re- sponse judgment with task performance and interpersonal OCB to be equal across the two samples did not worsen fit ( 2 [ 2df ] 4.91 , ns ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that asking respondents to make situational judgments first ( as in Study 2 ) did not significantly alter the predictive validity of response judgments .
In our final study , we sought to replicate and extend Study 2 using a sample of working adults to strengthen confidence in the Table 5 Means , Standard Deviations , and Correlations ( Study 3 ) Variable M SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Criterion measures 1 .

471JUDGING SITUATIONS IN SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT TESTS generalizability of the findings .
We also expanded the controls to rule out alternative explanations .
Study 4 Method Participants .
One hundred eighty-eight ( n 188 ) working adults from a master of business administration ( MBA ) course on international business with an overseas consulting assignment , offered by a large business school in Singapore , participated in the study .
Mean age was 33 years ( SD 5.36 years ) , and 38 % were female .
Participants were diverse , representing 26 countries across five continents .
On average , each had 9.2 years ( SD 5.27 ) of previous work experience and had traveled to 11 countries ( SD 7.86 ) ; 95 % spoke at least two languages .
Procedures .
Participants formed their own culturally diverse consulting teams ( average team size of four ; average index of nationality heterogeneity .81 , SD 0.21 ) .
Teams worked on an intensive 3-month consulting project where they negotiated access to an organization outside of Singapore and completed a project on specific intercultural management challenges in the target organi- zation .
Teams consulted with a wide range of industries ( e.g. , manufacturing , retail , information , finance , insurance , service , professional service , etc . ) .
They also researched their organization and conducted interviews through on-site visits with executives , middle managers , and employees to understand the intercultural challenges faced by members of the organization .
At the end of the project , teams prepared written reports ( average number of pages 116 , SD 23.64 ) and made a formal presentation to the organization .
This included a comprehensive analysis of the inter- cultural and institutional challenges faced by the organization and recommendations for the organization to consider .
We obtained archival data on cognitive ability ( Graduate Man- agement Admissions Test [ GMAT ] from participants ’ MBA ap- plication records ) and collected data from participants at three points in time .
At Time 1 ( beginning of the course ) , participants completed online surveys of personality and demographic charac- teristics .
At Time 2 ( 2 weeks into the course , and at the beginning of their project ) , participants completed the intercultural SJT .
At Time 3 ( at the end of their project ) , peers rated task performance and interpersonal OCB of team members using the same round- robin design as Studies 2 and 3 .
Measures .
Unless otherwise noted , we measured all variables using a 7-point Likert-type scale ( 1 strongly disagree , 7 strongly agree ) .
Criterion measures : Task performance and interpersonal OCB .
Team members assessed task performance ( rWG ( J ) .84 ; .91 ) and interpersonal OCB ( rWG ( J ) .76 ; .90 ) with the same items as Studies 2 and 3 .
Group variances were again not significant for either task performance ( group variance .04 , Z .76 , ns ) or interpersonal OCB ( group variance .05 , Z .86 , ns ) , supporting the removal of group differences for the estimation of target scores .
Target scores indicated agreement between peer ratings and showed statistically significant amounts of target vari- ance for task performance ( target variance .38 , Z 5.83 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( target variance .26 , Z 5.23 , p .01 ) .
Confirmatory factor analyses of the hypothesized two-factor model ( task performance and interpersonal OCB ) showed excel- lent fit : 2 [ 8df ] 10.16 , ns ; 2/df 1.27 , IFI .99 , RMSEA .04 .
All factor loadings were statistically significant ( .88 – .99 , p .01 ) , and the two-factor model showed significantly better fit than a single-factor model ( 2 [ 1df ] 111.00 , p .001 ) .
Predictor measures : Situational judgment and response judgment .
We employed the same four research assistants as in Study 2 for scoring situational and response judgments .
Interrater agreement exceeded .70 ( situational judgment : ICC2.1 .92 ; response judgment : ICC2.1 .80 ) .
We averaged ratings of situ- ational judgment ( .83 ) and response judgment ( .75 ) across both raters .
Control measures .
We controlled for cognitive ability ( GMAT ) , Big Five ( .74–.89 ) , previous work experience , international experience , number of languages spoken , and gender .

472 ROCKSTUHL , ANG , NG , LIEVENS , AND VAN DYNE We also included additional controls in Study 4 to rule out alter- native explanations based on individual characteristics .
Given that our operationalization of situational judgment parallels the broader trait of empathy , defined as the tendency to perceive how the world appears to others and to feel compassion for them , we controlled for two types of empathy with four items each adapted from Davis ( 1983 ) .
An example item for intercultural cognitive empathy is “ I try to understand people from other cultures better by imagining how things look from their perspective ” ( .80 ) , and an item for intercultural affective empathy is “ I ’ m often quite touched by things that I see happen in intercultural interactions ” ( .72 ) .
Self-efficacy , defined as perceived capability to enact a specific behavior ( Bandura , 1997 ) , is an important predictor of perfor- mance ( Stajkovic & Luthans , 1998 ) .
Accordingly , we also con- trolled for intercultural self-efficacy ( e.g. , “ I know how to put people from different cultures at ease in intercultural situations ” ; .90 ) with six items adapted from Van Dyne et al .
( 2012 ) .
Table 7 summarizes results of confirmatory factor analyses and shows that the hypothesized five-factor measurement model ( sit- uational judgment and response judgment with correlated unique- ness factors between indicators from the same SJT items ; cognitive and affective empathy ; and intercultural self-efficacy ) had good fit to the data : 2 [ 333df ] 553.41 , p .01 ; 2/df 1.66 , IFI .94 , RMSEA .06 .
All factor loadings were statistically significant ( .45 – .80 , p .01 ) .
Comparison with alternative models demonstrated that the hy- pothesized five-factor model was a significantly better fit than ( a ) a five-factor model that did not allow for correlated uniqueness factors ( Model 2 : 2 [ 7df ] 60.83 , p .001 ) ; ( b ) a four-factor model with correlated uniqueness factors that combined both sit- uational judgment and response judgment ( Model 3 : 2 [ 1df ] 23.74 , p .001 ) ; ( c ) a four-factor model without correlated uniqueness factors that combined both situational judgment and response judgment ( Model 4 : 2 [ 8df ] 85.62 , p .001 ) ; ( d ) a two-factor model combining situational judgments and response judgments versus all self-reported measures ( Model 5 : 2 [ 4df ] 54.22 , p .001 ) ; and ( e ) a single-factor model ( Model 6 : 2 [ 11df ] 221.65 , p .001 ) .
Together , these results support the discriminant validity of all five constructs .
Results and Discussion Descriptive statistics .
We report descriptive statistics , inter- nal consistency reliability ( alpha ) coefficients , and correlations in Table 8 .
Situational judgment was positively related to task per- formance ( r .41 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( r .37 , p .01 ) .
Response judgment was positively related to task perfor- mance ( r .37 , p .01 ) and interpersonal OCB ( r .22 , p .01 ) .
Hypotheses tests .
We proposed that situational judgment would predict task performance ( Hypothesis 1 ) and interpersonal OCB ( Hypothesis 2 ) , over and above response judgment .
Results support Hypothesis 1 .
Situational judgment predicted task perfor- mance ( .25 , p .01 ; Model 3 , Table 9 ) and explained an additional 4 % of variance in task performance ( p .01 ) over and above response judgment and the controls .
Relative weights anal- ysis shows situational judgment accounted for 21.0 % ( 95 % CI 6.8 % , 31.0 % ; p .05 ) and response judgment accounted for 15.3 % ( 95 % CI 6.3 % , 26.8 % ; p .05 ) of explained variance in task performance .
Relative weights for situational and response judgments were not significantly different from each other ( 95 % CI 17.8 % , 10.7 % ; ns ) .
This replicates results of Study 2 and suggests that both situational judgment and response judgment are not significantly different in their importance as predictors of task performance .
As in Study 2 , results without control variables replicated these findings .
Our results also support Hypothesis 2 .
Situational judgment predicted interpersonal OCB ( .32 , p .01 ; Model 6 ) .
Situ- ational judgment explained an additional 6 % of variance in inter- personal OCB ( p .01 ) over and above response judgment and controls .
Relative weights analysis shows situational judgment accounted for 32.6 % ( 95 % CI 15.4 % , 55.0 % ; p .05 ) of explained variance in interpersonal OCB .
By contrast , response judgment accounted for 7.0 % ( 95 % CI 1.8 % , 22.1 % ; ns ) .
This difference in relative weights between situational and response judgment is statistically significant ( 95 % CI 50.0 % , 6.8 % ; p .05 ) .

474 ROCKSTUHL , ANG , NG , LIEVENS , AND VAN DYNE judgment .
As in Study 2 , results without control variables repli- cated these findings .
In sum , results from Study 4 replicated the key findings from Study 2 with working adults and a broader range of control variables .
Thus , Study 4 strengthens the generalizability of our results and supports further our assumption that adding situational judgment to SJTs provides valuable information beyond that pro- vided by response judgment .
General Discussion In this research , we expanded the SJT paradigm and made three key contributions .
First , following the suggestions of Ployhart ( 2006 ) , we used verbal protocol analysis to open the black box of SJTs and examined the types of situational judgments made by SJT respondents .
Our findings show that understanding the inten- tions , emotions , and thoughts of the parties in the situation were the dominant types of situational judgments made by our partici- pants .
This is important because it is the first study to illuminate how people perceive and interpret situations presented in SJTs .
Knowing how people perceive and interpret the situation is im- portant because it deepens our understanding of why some people make better or worse response judgments than others .
Second , results demonstrated that situational judgment incre- mentally predicted both task performance and interpersonal OCB—over and above response judgment .
This result holds even after ruling out a possible alternative explanation in Study 3—that is , that assessing situational judgment might affect the predictive validity of response judgment due to cognitive fatigue , learning , context , or accessibility effects .
Taken together , these findings attest to the usefulness of complementing response judgment with situational judgment in SJTs .
Third , both situational judgment and response judgment signif- icantly predicted task performance .
However , in the case of inter- personal OCB , situational judgment emerged as the only signifi- cant predictor when controlling for both situational and response judgment .
Theoretical Implications and Future Research Directions In a recent review of the SJT literature , Ployhart and MacKenzie ( 2011 ) noted that the role of judgment in SJT research and practice is a neglected issue .
To address this gap , we took a novel approach to SJTs by expanding on the type of judgments measured by SJTs from a focus on response judgments , to include a focus on situa- tional judgments .
Our primary theoretical contribution lies in put- ting judging situations back into SJT theorizing .
Reconnecting SJT theorizing with situational judgment grounds SJTs more firmly in an interactionist paradigm ( Campion & Ployhart , 2013 ) , which emphasizes the importance of both situational judgments and response judgments .
In so doing , we show how we can expand the SJT paradigm and provide a foundation for future SJT research to advance our understanding of judgment processes in SJTs .
To deepen our understanding of situational and response judg- ments in SJTs , future research could examine cognitive mecha- nisms that help explain the processes respondents use to arrive at situational and response judgments .
For instance , Ployhart ( 2006 ) suggested that memory retrieval is one psychological mechanism underlying judgments in SJTs .
Consistent with this notion , our verbal protocol results provide anecdotal evidence that people draw on their previous experiences with similar situations when making situational and response judgments .
Thus , future studies could compare situational and response judgments of people with more or less experience relative to the situations presented by a SJT .
Given the promising role of situational judgments in predicting performance , future research could also examine factors that affect Table 9 Hierarchical Linear Regression Results and Relative Weights Analysis ( Study 4 ) Variable Task performance Interpersonal OCB Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 RW Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 RW Sex .14 .12 .10 3.6 % .04 .02 .00 0.7 % Number of Languages Spoken .13 .12 .12 5.0 % .09 .09 .08 3.7 % Work Experience .06 .03 .02 0.3 % .04 .01 .00 0.8 % International Experience .13 .11 .07 2.0 % .20 .18 .13 8.6 % Extraversion .27 .28 .27 11.0 % .20 .20 .19 4.8 % Agreeableness .16 .18 .14 5.8 % .21 .22 .17 12.3 % Conscientiousness .23 .19 .21 13.1 % .13 .10 .13 8.1 % Emotional Stability .04 .04 .04 0.5 % .00 .01 .00 0.5 % Openness to Experience .04 .01 .02 1.0 % .05 .04 .00 1.4 % Cognitive Ability .23 .17 .14 10.3 % .02 .06 .09 1.0 % Intercultural Cognitive Empathy .05 .03 .03 1.8 % .10 .09 .01 4.3 % Intercultural Affective Empathy .00 .04 .08 2.4 % .05 .07 .12 8.1 % Intercultural Self-Efficacy .19 .14 .15 6.6 % .13 .09 .10 5.9 % Response Judgment .25 .15 15.3 % .17 .05 7.0 % Situational Judgment .25 21.0 % .32 32.6 % F 6.38 ( 13,174 ) 7.28 ( 14,173 ) 7.92 ( 15,172 ) 3.28 ( 13,174 ) 3.48 ( 14,173 ) 4.55 ( 15,172 ) R2 .32 .37 .41 .20 .22 .28 R2 .05 .04 .02 .06 adjusted R2 .27 .32 .36 .14 .16 .22 Note .

475JUDGING SITUATIONS IN SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT TESTS situational judgments .
For instance , attribution theory suggests that situational cues about internal versus external causes of behavior , controllability of behavior , and the stability of behavior influence situational judgments ( Weiner , 1995 ) .
Future SJT research could systematically vary the amount and presence of such situational cues and examine their influence on situational judgments , as well as response judgments .
Further , research could also examine in- teractions between situational features and personality traits in affecting situational judgment .
For example , individuals ’ need for closure , which refers to the epistemic desire to seize immediately on a firm answer to an ambiguous situation and to subsequently neglect consideration of alternative answers ( Kruglanski & Web- ster , 1996 ) , may interact with situational cues to affect situational judgment .
By identifying situational and response judgment as two key constructs measured by our SJT , this study shed greater light on why SJTs predict task performance and interpersonal OCB .
This is important , as Christian et al .
( 2010 ) noted that “ identifying the constructs measured by selection tests such as SJTs is important for theory testing and understanding why a given test is or is not related to the criterion of interest ” ( p. 85 ) .
Our findings suggest that SJT scores might relate to task performance and interpersonal OCB based on different types of judgments assessed in the SJTs .
For task performance , we found that both situational judgment and response judgment contributed unique variance .
For interpersonal OCB , however , only situational judgment contributed unique vari- ance while response judgment did not .
By explicitly measuring situational judgment in addition to response judgment , we found empirical evidence that supports Christian et al. ’ s speculation that SJTs relate to interpersonal OCB because SJTs assess to some extent the “ ability to perceive and interpret social dynamics in such a way that facilitates judgments regarding the timing and appro- priateness of contextual behaviors ” ( p. 92 ) .
Future research could further open the black box of the effects of situational judgment on task performance and interpersonal OCB .
For task performance , future research could draw on our arguments that situational judg- ment facilitates understanding others ’ role expectations and exam- ine role expectations as a possible mediator of the relationship between situational judgment and task performance .
For interper- sonal OCB , future research could draw on Christian et al. ’ s argu- ments and examine appropriateness of timing and nature of help offered as potential mediators of the relationship between situa- tional judgment and interpersonal OCB .
Finally , our research should also have implications for perfor- mance outcomes across a wide range of jobs because situational judgments about intentions , emotions , and thoughts are crucial to performance in many jobs that involve interpersonal relationships .
For example , physicians need to relate to their patients ( Silvester , Patterson , Koczwara , & Ferguson , 2007 ) ; or service providers need to understand the concerns of their clients ( Parker & Axtell , 2001 ) .
Thus , future research could examine situational judgment about others ’ intentions , emotions , and thoughts as predictors of task performance and interpersonal OCB in a wide variety of jobs and domains .
Implications for Selected-Response SJTs We have discussed the implications of our findings on situa- tional judgments and response judgments in expanding future SJT research .
At the same time , our results should be interpreted in the context of our constructed-response ( i.e. , open-ended ) methodol- ogy , which differs from the “ selected-response ” methodology ( i.e. , close-ended questions ) commonly adopted in the extant SJT liter- ature ( Motowidlo , Dunnette , & Carter , 1990 ) .
Our choice was predicated on the notion that a constructed-response format might provide greater response fidelity ( i.e. , the extent to which the response format corresponds to similar real-life ways of respond- ing ; Sackett , 1987 ; Weekley , Ployhart , & Holtz , 2006 ) than the selected-response format .
As Ryan and Greguras ( 1998 ) noted , “ life is not multiple choice ” ( p. 183 ) .
Further , a constructed- response format avoids cuing respondents about the correct solu- tion ( Thornton & Rupp , 2006 ) , which we felt was particularly important for an intercultural SJT because intercultural interac- tions are prone to misjudgments ( Earley & Ang , 2003 ) .
Thus , an important caveat of this study is that our findings on situational judgments and response judgments are based on “ constructed-response ” format , which may not necessarily gener- alize to SJT studies using the selected-response format .
As such , we recommend three key areas for future research to better under- stand selected- versus constructed-response SJTs .
First , future research could test the generalizability of our find- ings to selected-response SJTs .
This requires future studies to assess whether situational judgments predict task performance and OCB over and above response judgments , using a selected- response format to measure both the situational and response judgments .
Second , future research could explore the differential effects of construct ( situation judgment vs. response judgment ) versus method ( selected response vs. constructed response ) by employing a 2 ( construct ) 2 ( method ) research design , with SJT item stems held constant .
Such a design allows us to determine , for instance , whether the options provided in the selected-response SJTs might be incomplete compared to judgments obtained in the constructed- response SJTs .
These findings will have implications on the pre- dictive validity of the two types of SJTs .
Future research could also use verbal protocols to compare the cognitive processes underlying the generation of situational and response judgments across the four cells in the 2 2 research design .
This will deepen our understanding of the effects of different response formats on the cognitive processes in SJTs .
Third , future research could examine the utility of constructed- versus selected-response SJTs , to better inform SJT practitioners on the pros and cons of the different types of SJTs .
We note that while the constructed-response format offers greater response fi- delity than selected-response formats , it is more time and resource consuming .
For example , our respondents took an average of 3.7 min ( SD 42 s ) to complete each constructed-response question , and our raters took on average 1 min to score each response .
Selected-response SJTs on the other hand , are “ easier to score and implement in large-scale testing programs , making them attractive options for early stages of recruitment and selection ” ( Weekley & Ployhart , 2006 , p. 5 ) .
They also offer the possibility of immediate feedback .
Therefore , we recommend that future studies assess the incremental validity of constructed situational judgment over and above ( a ) selected response judgment , ( b ) selected situational judgment , and ( c ) selected response and situational judgment .
Such research may further our understanding of the benefits pro- vided by greater response fidelity of a constructed-response format T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

476 ROCKSTUHL , ANG , NG , LIEVENS , AND VAN DYNE relative to the benefit of easier scoring associated with a selected- response format .
Practical Implications To date , SJTs only assess response judgment .
Our finding that situational judgment predicts task performance and interpersonal OCB over and above response judgment reinforces the value of assessing both forms of judgments in SJTs .
This finding also has practical implications for other assessment and selection tech- niques where candidates are required to respond to situations , such as situational interviews ( Latham , Saari , Pursell , & Campion , 1980 ) .
For instance , managers could ask candidates to provide situational judgments in addition to response judgments during situational interviews to better assess the qualities of the candi- dates .
In light of the different advantages that selected-and constructed- responses offer , organizations may consider developing SJTs that contain items with selected-response formats and items with constructed-response formats .
This may allow organizations to strike a balance between concerns associated with the greater testing and scoring time required for constructed-response SJTs and their benefits in terms of response fidelity .
Notably , constructed-response formats need not be limited to the written responses used in our research .
For example , a growing body of SJT research demonstrates the feasibility of using webcam based constructed-response formats to enhance the response fidelity of SJTs ( e.g. , Lievens , De Corte , & Westerveld , in press ) .
Our study also highlights the potential usefulness of verbal protocols in uncovering situational judgments made by respon- dents .
Thus , verbal protocols could be deployed in other assess- ment contexts that require situational responses , such as assess- ment centers .
Similarly , verbal protocol analysis could be useful as a prescreening tool in the development of SJT items , especially for text-based SJT items .
McDaniel , Psotka , Legree , Yost , and Week- ley ( 2011 ) noted that text-based SJT items are often ambiguous , requiring respondents to make additional assumptions about the presented situation .
As item ambiguity reduces the predictive validity of SJT items ( McDaniel et al. , 2011 ) , we recommend that test developers use verbal protocol analysis to discover the kinds of assumptions that respondents make , which can be used to identify and improve ambiguous SJT items .
Finally , having an intercultural SJT that predicts performance outcomes in culturally diverse contexts makes a significant prac- tical contribution .
As noted by Deardorff ( 2009 ) , “ Intercultural competence is a very complex concept with a variety of compo- nents and aspects .
One tool or method does not provide a com- prehensive measurement of the complexity of this concept ” ( p. 486 ) .
Given that current measures of intercultural competence are dominantly based on self-reported instruments ( Leung , Ang , & Tan , 2014 ) , the intercultural SJT provides an alternative performance-based assessment tool that has good predictive valid- ity .
Organizations may complement validated report-based mea- sures of intercultural competence ( e.g. , Ang et al. , 2007 ) with our intercultural SJT to enhance their selection for international as- signments ( Leung et al. , 2014 ) or global leadership positions ( Rockstuhl , Seiler , Ang , Van Dyne , & Annen , 2011 ) .
Strengths and Limitations A methodological strength of our study is the use of verbal protocols to clarify the nature of situational judgments made by respondents .
To date , researchers have often attempted to un- derstand judgments in SJTs based on relationships of SJT performance with established predictors such as cognitive abil- ity ( Weekley & Jones , 1997 ) , personality ( McDaniel et al. , 2007 ) , job experience ( Motowidlo & Beier , 2010 ) , or job knowledge ( Clevenger , Pereira , Wiechmann , Schmitt , & Schmidt-Harvey , 2001 ) .
Verbal protocols complement such ef- forts because they offer a unique opportunity for directly ex- amining the judgments made by SJT respondents .
As our results show , such an approach holds great potential to deepen our understanding of the constructs assessed by SJTs .
Examining respondents ’ situational judgments should allow SJT research- ers to uncover alternative question prompts beyond asking respondents what they would do .
Our lagged , multisource design is another methodological strength that responds to calls in the SJT literature for greater use of predictive validity designs instead of concurrent validity designs ( Whetzel & McDaniel , 2009 ) .
Additionally , replicating our results across two lagged , multiple source studies strength- ens the confidence in the generalizability of our findings .
We note a few limitations in our study .
First , our focus here is on interpersonal intercultural SJTs .
Hence , our findings that situational judgments mainly involve judgments of someone ’ s intentions , emotions , and thoughts may not generalize to other types of SJTs .
We encourage future studies to extend this research to other types of SJTs , such as SJTs that assess knowledge and skills and basic personality tendencies ( Chris- tian et al. , 2010 ) .
We expect that SJTs that are less interpersonal and more focused on a task may require different situational judgments .
Second , our measure of situational judgment in Study 2 and Study 4 combined judgments of thoughts , emotions , and inten- tions , in order to reduce the administration time for participants .
However , combining these different judgments precludes us from examining which judgment ( i.e. , thoughts , emotions , intentions ) might be most important when judging a situation .
To deepen our understanding of the relative importance of these judgments , we recommend future studies to assess judgments of thoughts , emo- tions , and intentions separately and to compare their predictive validity .
Third , our studies relied on undergraduate and MBA students , which may evoke questions regarding the external validity of the findings .
However , we note that despite being students , our par- ticipants worked in teams similar to teams in real-world contexts .
For instance , participants had to work interdependently within their team on a high-stakes task under time pressure .
In Study 4 , teams also had to present their project to an external client .
Nonetheless , future research could replicate our findings with managerial samples to strengthen the external validity of our results .
Finally , results from Study 3 strengthen the internal validity of our findings by addressing questions about inadvertent effects of priming respondents to make situational judgments on the predic- tive validity of response judgments .
At the same time , respondents in Study 2 and Study 4 consistently provided situational judgments T hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e A m er ic an Ps yc ho lo gi ca l A ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

477JUDGING SITUATIONS IN SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT TESTS before making response judgments .
The order in which respon- dents provide situational- and response judgments might therefore affect the incremental validity of situational judgment over and above response judgment .
Thus , future research could further strengthen the internal validity of our results by replicating our findings while asking respondents to generate situational judg- ments after providing response judgments .
Conclusion SJT scholars have repeatedly called for research to open the black box of situational judgment in SJTs ( Ployhart , 2006 ; Schmitt & Chan , 2006 ; Whetzel & McDaniel , 2009 ) .
Our study responds to these calls and reinvigorates SJT research by highlighting the importance of putting situational judgments back into SJTs .
Spe- cifically , results of our verbal protocol analysis of SJT responses identified the dominant types of situational judgments made .
More important , results of two time-lagged , multiple-source studies demonstrate the value of asking respondents to make both situa- tional judgments and response judgments .
Results consistently show that situational judgment predicts task performance and interpersonal OCB over and above response judgment and other established predictors .
Overall , our results provide timely insights to situational judgment in SJTs and suggest promising benefits— both theoretical and practical—for future research on SJTs .

Appendix Development of the Intercultural SJT Ang , Rockstuhl , and Ng ( 2014 ) presented a detailed report of the development and validation of the intercultural SJT used in this research .
The intercultural SJT depicts intercultural interpersonal interactions at work using multimedia vignettes .
We chose to develop a multimedia rather than a text-based SJT because multi- media SJTs are of higher fidelity and greater validity ( Chan & Schmitt , 1997 ; Christian et al. , 2010 ) .
Script Development We followed Weekley et al. ’ s ( 2006 ) recommendations for scripting multimedia SJT items .
First , we constructed a taxonomy of the situational domain of an intercultural SJT .
We then collected critical incidents from interviews with subject matter experts ( SMEs ; executives in international assignments , experienced cross-cultural researchers and trainers ) and from extensive reviews of the literature .
We identified prototypical incidents for scripting .
Specifically , we focused on interactions between individuals from two different cultural backgrounds including North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and the Middle East .
A professional scriptwriter drafted and revised scripts using input from SMEs ( executives from the countries depicted in the scripts and experienced cross-cultural researchers ) .
We produced vignettes in authentic , work-related settings using professional actors from countries and ethnicities depicted in the scripts .
We deployed intercultural experts during the film production to assure cultural fidelity of the multimedia vignettes .
As a final manipula- tion check , subject matter experts not involved in the SJT devel- opment independently mapped each multimedia vignette to the underlying situational taxonomy .
The Cohen ’ s kappa agreement between expert ratings and the intended situational domain aver- aged .92 ( range from .83 to 1 ) .
