Framing may induce choice inconsisten- cies and generate anomalous behavior.1 How far will anomalies of choice persist in transparent settings ?
This is an empirical question because the normative equiva- lence of two separate decisions can not be made perfectly transparent .
Even in de- cision experiments where subjects make repeated i.i.d .
decisions among pairs of lotteries without any alteration , non-negligible numbers of subjects report differ- ent decisions over repetition ( Hey and Orme 1994 ; Loomes and Sugden 1998 ) .2 Choice inconsistencies of this sort are generally considered as “ errors ” adding noise to the results or merely discarded from further analysis ( Camerer 1989 ; Starmer and Sugden 1989 , and Wu 1994 ) .3 It is certainly true that people make errors by lack of attention .
However , since the purpose of economic incentives is to boost attention , it is worth asking whether choice inconsistencies are not partly systematic anomalies .
In the present study , we aim at contributing to the existing literature by examining to what extent framing violates normative rationality , affecting both risk aversion and consistency of decisions , in a transparent setting : the well-known lottery random pro- cedure elicited by Holt and Laury ( 2002 ) for measuring risk aversion .
We chose to 1Given the fact that EU theory has rapidly become the standard in decision theory , a huge amount of theo- retical and empirical effort has been devoted to test the robustness of EU and to develop alternative models to this theory ( see Starmer 2000 , for an extensive and interesting survey of key theoretical developments in the area ) .
A large body of these studies has focused on the violation of independence axiom .
Although the Allais ( 1953 ) paradox was initially designed to violate the independence axiom , Kahneman and Tver- sky made the more general point that the problem with EU theory lied with the postulate of presenta- tion and procedure invariance .
What choice anomalies have demonstrated is that individuals often exhibit preferences that deviate from normative preferences in systematic ways ( Tversky and Kahneman 1981 ; Kahneman and Tversky 1984 ) .
Two normatively equivalent pairs of lotteries presented under different frames may give rise to different choices .
2For instance , Hey and Orme ( 1994 ) report that about 75 % of subjects only made identical decisions when asked to choose repeatedly between the same lotteries .
3With the notable exception of Chew et al .
( 1991 ) , Loomes ( 2005 ) , Loomes et al .
( 2002 ) and Blavatskyy ( 2007 ) , the stochastic nature of choice under risk and uncertainty has largely been ignored in most of decision theories .
130 L. Lévy-Garboua et al .
investigate the consistency of the Holt and Laury ( HL ) ’ s measure of risk aversion and its sensitivity to framing , because their method has been rapidly adopted in decision research and it lends itself easily to the manipulation of frames .
In the original HL design , the subjects are confronted with ten choices among two bets yielding positive outcomes : R is a risky bet with payoffs $ 3.85 and $ 0.10 ; and S is a safe bet with payoffs $ 2 and $ 1.60 .
Probabilities of the higher payoffs are equal for the two bets ( p ) and vary by steps of 0.10 from 0.10 to 1.00 .
Subjects should normally switch only once from R to S , or from S to R , for an intermediate value of this probability and the latter determines their risk aversion in a simple way .
The crossover or equiv- alent probability discrete index of risk aversion can then be converted into a CRRA4 interval .
This crossover probability is unique for consistent subjects , taking values between 0.10 and 1.00 .
In their experiment Holt and Laury found however that a non-negligible part of subjects exhibited inconsistency.5 In this experiment , we investigate whether changing the order of the probabili- ties of winning p and the presentation of the ten lottery-choices might influence the level of inconsistency .
To do so , we replicate the HL ’ s procedure for measuring risk aversion under various frames .
Probabilities of winning p were presented either in increasing , decreasing or in random order .
We also varied framing by presenting the ten lottery choices either simultaneously or sequentially .
We conjecture that a sequential framing of choices might induce more inconsistencies and errors than a si- multaneous framing by restricting the amount of information gathered before making decisions .
We also suspect that variations in the order of presentation of win probabil- ities may also affect consistency by introducing either randomness—when probabil- ities are presented in a random order—or anchoring biases—when probabilities are ranked in monotonous order .
If these conjectures are confirmed by the data , framing might also have an impact on the probability of choosing the safer lottery through its effects on the perception of probabilities and on the level of inconsistency .
To our knowledge , we are the first to study these questions in the context of the simple HL ’ s procedure .
A notable exception is Masclet et al .
( 2009 ) who also exam- ined the effect of sequentiality on risk aversion .
However this study was not aimed at testing the inconsistency of decisions .

No subject participated in more than one session .
None of the subjects had participated in a similar economic experiment .
Our design consists of 20 sessions ( with 12 subjects each ) of a lottery choice ex- periment .
We ran different treatments by manipulating three variables in a factorial 2 × 3 × 2 design : the presentation of the ten lottery-choices ( simultaneously or se- quentially ) , the order of the probabilities ( increasing , decreasing , or random order ) and the size of payoffs ( low and high payoff condition in which all payoffs are mul- tiplied by a factor of 10 ) .
Our Baseline treatment , called SIMINC , is a replication of HL “ low real payoff ” treatment in which we merely substituted Euros ( € ) for Dollars ( $ ) .
In this treatment , the participants are confronted with ten simultaneous choices between two lotteries : a “ safe ” lottery S ( payoffs of 2.00 € or 1.60 € ) and a “ risky ” lottery R ( payoffs of 3.85 € or $ 0.10 € ) with equal probabilities of winning ranked from 10 % to 100 % in 10 % -intervals ( see Table 1 ) .
The SIMDEC and SIM- RAND treatments are identical to the SIMINC treatment presented above except that the winning probabilities are ranked in the table in decreasing and in random order , respectively .
In a fourth treatment called SEQINC , participants play exactly the same treatment as the baseline treatment except that the ten decisions are not presented si- multaneously but given sequentially with probabilities ranked in a similar increasing manner from 10 % to 100 % .
The SEQDEC and SEQRAND treatments are also de- signed in a sequential way but with probabilities ranked in decreasing or in random order respectively .
In each session , subjects were confronted with 3 or 4 successive treatments .
To control for a potential order effect,6 we varied the order of the treatment across ses- sions .
Table 2 contains summary information about sessions of our 2 × 3 × 2 ex- 6Previous results on the effect of prior experience on subsequent choices are mixed .
Harrison et al .
( 2005 ) suggest that making decisions in the low payoff treatment has an effect on subsequent choices in the high payoff treatment ( the order effect increases risk aversion ) ; while Holt and Laury ( 2005 ) suggest that the order effect is not clear-cut .

The three ( or four ) last columns of Table 2 indicate the treatment in effect in each segment of the session .
2.2 Procedures Sessions 1–8 comprise four treatments , the first three being with low payoffs and the last one with high payoffs ; and sessions 9–20 comprise three treatments , half of which are with low payoffs only and the other half with high payoffs only .
In sessions 9–20 , subjects were informed that three sets of lottery choices would be successively implemented .
However , to control for wealth effects , subjects were informed that only one of the three treatment payoffs would be chosen for payment at the end of the experiment .
Similar rules were implemented in sessions 1–8 .
In particular , subjects were not informed at the beginning of the experiment that an additional fourth treatment would be played .
At the end of the third treatment , subjects were informed of their final payment for the experience chosen among the three treatment payoffs .
Then subjects were asked to give up what they had earned in the previous treatments in order to participate in the high payoff treatment .

On average , a session lasted for about an hour and 20 minutes , including the initial instructions and payment of subjects .
Each participant earned 20 € on average .
3 Results on inconsistency The HL procedure is based on a menu of lottery pairs that follow a regular pattern which can be made more or less transparent by changing the frame .
Choice consis- tency implies here that the probability-set over which an individual chooses a risky lottery be connected and includes the 100 % -winning probability .
A consistent sub- ject uniformly would prefer risk at high probabilities of winning and would usually switch to a safe choice at low probabilities of winning without ever switching back to the risky lottery .
Thus , consistent individuals must choose the risky option if they are sure to win and can not switch to the safe option more than once .
Accordingly , we qualify all observed behaviors that violate either one of these two conditions of in- consistent .
For instance , we consider inconsistent behaviors as the repetitive switches from one option ( safe or risky ) to the other .
Subjects who first choose the safe ( risky ) option and then switch to the risky ( safe ) option before switching back to the safe ( risky ) option are inconsistent .
Besides , we assume that subjects who always choose the safe option are inconsistent , as such behavior implies that they prefer less money to more with certainty ( 2 € instead of 3.85 € ) .
In line with previous results in the literature , we found that almost all subjects chose the safe option for small probability of the high payoff , and then switched to the riskier option when the probability of the high payoff increased sufficiently .
However , our results also indicate that in all treatments a non negligible part of players exhibited inconsistent behavior .
Tables 3a and 3b report the respective frequencies of subjects and choice sequences that exhibit inconsistency across treatments .
We define a choice sequence as the set of ten choices a subject makes in a given treatment .

1 Distribution of the number of switches for inconsistent choice sequences Result 1 The rate of inconsistency is lower under ( 1 ) a decreasing frame , ( 2 ) a si- multaneous frame , ( 3 ) a high payoff condition and ( 4 ) with repetition .
Support for result 1 Table 3b indicates that , on average , there are more inconsis- tencies under the INC frame than under the DEC frames .
According to a Wilcoxon signed rank test on the fact of being inconsistent at the sequence level , the differ- ence between the INC and DEC treatments is significant ( z = −2.722 ; p < 0.01 ) .
No significant difference is found between the INC and the RAND treatments.7 Ta- bles 3a and 3b also indicate that in all sessions , 30 percent of subjects ( and 15.6 percent of choice sequences ) were inconsistent in the simultaneous frame .
In the sequential frame , the corresponding figures are 37.5 percent of subjects ( and 19.4 percent of choice sequences ) who were inconsistent .
According to a Mann-Whitney test and after controlling for order effects , these differences are statistically signifi- cant but for the high payoff condition only ( z = −1.723 ; p = 0.08 ; two-tailed ) .
Our data also indicate that inconsistency decreases over repetition .
A Wilcoxon signed rank test shows that the difference of inconsistency is significant between order 1 and order 2 ( z = 3.571 ; p = 0.0004 ) as well as between order 2 and order 3 ( z = 2.694 ; p = 0.0071 ) .
Finally both Fig .
1 and Tables 3a and 3b indicate that sub- jects are more inconsistent under low incentive than under high payoff condition .
Figure 1 displays the proportion of inconsistencies for low and for high payoffs .
It shows that most inconsistencies consist of at least 3 switches and that the level of inconsistencies is smaller for high payoffs .
Table 3a indicates that 36.9 % of subjects were inconsistent under low incentives versus 19.0 % under high incentives .
Table 3b shows that 20.4 % of choice sequences were inconsistent under low incentives versus 13.4 % under high incentives .
A Mann-Whitney test shows that these differences are statistically significant , ( z = 1.942 ; p = 0.0521 ; two-tailed ) .
The larger rate of incon- sistency when incentives are weak could be interpreted as a lack of motivation and attention under the low payoff condition compared to the high condition .
7A significant difference is found between the DEC and RAND but only for the low payoff condition ( z = 1.768 ; p = 0.077 ) .

Standard errors in parentheses *p < 0.1 ; **p < 0.05 ; ***p < 0.001 To provide more formal evidence for results 1 , we estimated regressions on the probability of being inconsistent .
Table 4 consists of two models .
The first model corresponds to a Random effect Probit model on the probability of being inconsistent .
The dependent variable takes value 1 if a player is inconsistent and zero otherwise .
The second model is an Ordered Probit model on the numbers of switches , at the sequence level .
The independent variables include dummy variables for presentation ( simultaneous or sequential ) , probability ranking ( increasing , decreasing or random ) and incentives ( high or low payoffs ) .
We also introduced variables that control for potential order effects .
The variables order 2 , order 3 , and order 4 indicate the order in which treatments were played by the subject ( order 1 is the reference ) .

Another important result provided by Table 4 is that , after controlling for several other variables , the simultaneous frame tends to facilitate consistent choices relative to the sequential frame .
The coefficient associ- ated to the variable “ high payoff ” is negative and highly significant , confirming our previous findings that increasing payoffs reduces inconsistency level .
Thus , it seems that strong pecuniary incentives help individuals pay more attention to each decision and make less error .
Finally Table 4 also provides interesting results concerning the effects of repetition of the tasks .
Consistent with previous observations obtained from Table 3b , it shows that inconsistencies strongly decline with repetition .
4 Results : choosing the safe option In this section , we investigate to what extent framing also affects the attitude of sub- jects toward risk .
As mentioned above , framing might affect the propensity of choos- ing the safe option in two different ways .
First , framing may have a direct impact on this propensity if subjects are sensitive to information brought about by the frame or by experience .
Second , framing may also indirectly influence the proportion of safe choices through the induced level of inconsistencies .
Following HL , we describe the risk attitude of subjects by the number of safe choices they made .
Accordingly , we display the proportion of safe choices for low payoff and for high payoff and we analyze the effect of framing for each payoff level .
Table 5 shows the average number of safe choices by treatment.8 The latter is al- ways slightly higher in sequential than in simultaneous treatments , and in decreasing than in increasing probability treatments .
It is also substantially higher with high pay- offs than with low payoffs .
The effects of framing on risk aversion are summarized in result 2 .
8Averages are computed here on consistent subjects in order to facilitate comparisons with previous results in the literature .

3 The proportion of safe choices in each decision : simultaneous vs sequential frames Result 2 The proportion of safe choices is larger under ( 1 ) a sequential frame ( 2 ) a random frame and under a ( 3 ) high payoff condition .
To a lesser extent , a decreasing frame also induces a higher proportion of safe choices .
Support for result 2 Figure 2 shows the proportion of safe choices among subjects with the probability of winning the higher payoff in the low and high payoff condi- tions .
It shows that the percentage choosing the safe option falls as the probability of winning the higher payoff increases .
Consistent with previous studies , we find that individuals tend to exhibit higher risk aversion under the high payoff conditions .
A Mann-Withney test between the low payoff and high payoff conditions reject the hypothesis that the proportion of safe choices are equal in the low and high payoff conditions ( z = −3.152 ; p = 0.0016 ; two-tailed ) .9 Figure 3 shows that the proportion of safe choices increases under a sequential frame .
A Mann-Whitney test on the total number of safe choices over ten periods rejects the null hypothesis of equal means between the simultaneous and sequential 9All tests on risk aversion are run on consistent players only .

Figure 4 displays the proportion of safe choices in random , decreasing and increasing treatments .
A Wilcoxon Signed rank test on the total number of safe choices rejects the null hypothesis of equal means between the increasing and decreasing treatment ( z = 2.315 , p = 0.020 ; two-tailed ) .
This test provides similar results between the increasing and random treatments ( z = 2.000 ; p = 0.045 ; two tailed ) .
In order to provide further evidence of a varying ( elicited ) risk-aversion across the frames , we estimated two structural models of probabilistic choice under risk .
The first model is the Fechner ( 1860 ) model of random errors as used , for example , by Hey and Orme ( 1994 ) .
This model states that the Sure ( S ) lottery will be chosen over the Risky ( R ) lottery with probability ( U ( S ) − U ( R ) σ ) where ( . )
is the standard normal c.d.f , σ is the standard deviation of the random errors , and U ( . )
is a vNM utility function .
The second—more recent—model is due to Blavatskyy ( 2010 ) .
His model has the advantage of satisfying first order stochastic dominance , weak stochastic transitivity , and also account for common behavioral regularities .
Define lottery S ∧ R as the lottery that is stochastically dominated by S and R , and such that no other lotteries at the same time is stochastically dominated by S and R but dominates S ∧ R ( see Blavatskyy 2010 for details ) .
Then the probability of choosing S over R is given by ϕ ( U ( S ) − U ( S ∧ R ) ) ϕ ( U ( S ) − U ( S ∧ R ) ) + ϕ ( U ( R ) − U ( S ∧ R ) ) where ϕ ( . )
is a non decreasing function with ϕ ( 0 ) = 0 , and U ( . )
is again a vNM utility function .
In our estimations , we use a CRRA utility function for the outcomes V ( x ) = x1−ρ1−ρ where ρ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion ( ρ = 1 ) .
Moreover , following Blavatskyy ( 2010 ) , we define ϕ ( x ) = exp ( λx ) − 1 where λ is a parameter to be esti- mated jointly with ρ .
The estimations were performed using maximum likelihood .
140 L. Lévy-Garboua et al .
Table 6 gives the estimated parameters for the coefficient of relative risk aversion .
The top panel refers to the Blavatskyy ( 2010 ) model , while the bottom panel refers to the Fechner ( 1860 ) model .
The three columns correspond to three different sub samples .
As can be seen from Table 6 , our results are fairly robust across models and sam- ples .
They show that the sequential frame leads to a significantly higher coefficient of risk-aversion ( 16 to 19 % higher than in simultaneous frames ) .
The random and decreasing frame also lead to an increase in the coefficient of risk-aversion , but the effect is smaller ( 11 to 13 % ) than for the sequential frame .
Moreover , the decreasing frame has an insignificant impact in two out of three sub samples .
Table 6 confirms and quantifies the respective effects of framing and incentives on the elicited risk aversion .
Incentives , sequential choices and random or decreasing probabilities of winning tend to generate higher risk aversion .
One might argue that these results merely reflect the higher level of inconsistencies under sequential framing .
To test this hypothesis , we replicated previous results for consistent subjects .
These estimates show very similar patterns .
Overall these findings seem to indicate that inconsistency is not the main reason behind higher risk aversion when framing induces less information .
5 Discussion Previous results have shown the importance of framing effects that strongly influence both inconsistency and risk aversion levels .
In this section we propose possible in- terpretations of these findings , underlying the role played by information , experience and incentives .
One main finding obtained in this study is that simultaneous frames induce signif- icantly less inconsistency than sequential frames .
How could we make sense of these results ?
A possible explanation may rely on the intuition that simultaneous framings convey “ more information ” than sequential framings by showing the whole menu of lottery pairs from the outset and making thus the regular pattern they form more trans- parent .
This renders the pattern of subsequent choices particularly transparent under a simultaneous frame .
Another possible interpretation of this finding is that subjects may understand they should switch only once but are uncertain of where to switch .
While the simultaneous frame allows subjects to amend their previous choices before submitting their final choices , this is no more possible under a sequential framing , which may lead to higher inconsistencies.10 Another important finding is that both repetition and high payoffs reduce inconsistency , significantly .
It could be possible that subjects devote more attention to the tasks when payoffs are high and/or when they acquire experience through the repetition of identical choices .
Our data also indicate that the decreasing win probability frame generally en- hances consistency relative to an increasing or random frame .
This is an intriguing result because neither the amount of information conveyed by the treatment nor the lack of attention which may be caused by weak incentives should be affected by 10We thank an anonymous referee for this helpful remark .

However , they do choose R when they are sure of winning ( i.e .
probability of winning = 1 ) the use of an increasing or decreasing frame .
However , a simple explanation can be found .
This explanation relies on the idea that the first decision may give an anchor , which may be more or less strong , depending on the framing .
In the decreasing prob- ability frame , the anchor is obvious since subjects start with a certain win probability of 100 % for which the “ risky lottery ” R should be an obvious choice .
So subjects who begin with the risky bet in first decision should exhibit less inconsistent behav- ior over the rest of the sequence .
The anchor is , to some extent , less obvious in the 142 L. Lévy-Garboua et al .
increasing frame where subjects start with a win probability of 10 % .11 Consequently , subjects may be less certain about their preferences in the increasing frame , which would induce more inconsistencies over the entire sequence.12 But why should a decreasing frame induce a higher estimate for risk aversion ?
Our findings indicate that the difference between increasing and decreasing fram- ings is partly due to inconsistencies since the framing variable is no more significant for consistent players ( see Table 6 ) .
A possible explanation could be the following .
If subjects are more inconsistent under the increasing framing , they may opt for R too early under the increasing frame .
Assume , for instance , that an individual is risk- neutral and should make four safe choices and six risky choices in the HL experiment .
If uncertain about his preferences , he might opt for R too early under the increasing frame , say after only two safe choices , and revert to S for a win probability of 0.4 .
His menu of choices would then be : SS/R/S/RRRRRR , which generates a down- ward bias in estimated risk aversion for an increasing frame .
Hence , the risk aver- sion estimate tends to be higher with decreasing probabilities than with increasing probabilities and the magnitude of this gap is a measure of an individual ’ s degree of inconsistency .
6 Conclusion Evidence for the role of framing effects in influencing behavior remains elusive .
Framing effects are pervasive both in real life and in experiments , but they are usually ignored by economic analysis because they violate principles of normative rationality .
In this paper we have looked for effects of framing in the context of a random lottery procedure elicited for measuring risk aversion .
This was done by replicating the well-known experiment by Holt and Laury ( 2002 ) under various framings .
The lottery choices were presented either simultaneously or sequentially ; the payoff prob- abilities were presented either in increasing , decreasing , or in random order .
We have three key findings .
First , we find that inconsistency is significantly higher in sequential than in si- multaneous treatments , particularly for high payoff treatments .
It is also higher in in- creasing than in decreasing treatments .
One methodological implication of our work 11In the increasing frame , a symmetric situation would be a situation in which subjects would start with a certain win probability of 0 percent .
This situation for which the “ safe lottery ” S would become the obvious choice was not available in the increasing frames .
12Our explanation in terms of anchoring effects requires that a majority of subjects makes a ‘ correct ’ choice in the first decision ( i.e .
the risky option when p = 1 in the decreasing frame and the safe option when p = 0.1 in the increasing frame ) .
Our data indicate that this is the case since ‘ correct ’ first decision is observed in a 93 % and 95 % of cases in the decreasing and increasing frames , respectively .
Surprisingly , less ‘ correct ’ first choices are observed in the decreasing frame .
There might be several plausible expla- nations , like making purely random choices , a lack of attention , a misunderstanding of the significance of the probabilities associated to the outcomes ( in particular for outcome associated to the zero probability in the decreasing frame ) , etc .
However one should probably not pay too much attention to this finding since it concerns only very few people .
More important is the fact that among the huge majority of choice sequences starting with a first ‘ correct ’ choice , the decreasing frame seems to give a stronger anchor for the rest of the sequence .
Indeed we find that among these choice sequences , 17.9 % were inconsistent in the increasing treatment and 10.5 % only in the decreasing treatment .
Risk aversion and framing effects 143 is that combining a simultaneous presentation of the ten connected lotteries with a de- creasing probability frame would probably add further consistency to the procedure by avoiding a few strongly inconsistent choices .
Second , the implicit experience acquired by subjects and more salient incentives induce a dramatic decrease in inconsistent behaviors .
Last , framing also strongly affects individual risk aversion .
Indeed risk aversion levels are significantly higher in sequential than in simultaneous treatments and in decreasing and random than in increasing treatments .
This does not only reflect dif- ferences of inconsistency levels , at least for the sequential and random frames , since similar results were found for consistent individuals .
These findings thus contribute to the existing literature showing that framing affects behavior in the context of trans- parent lottery choice procedures .
There are a number of explanations of the framing-sensitivity of decisions .
A pos- sible explanation relies on the role of random errors on observed behavior .
However randomness alone does not seem to be sufficient to predict systematic inconsisten- cies and their gradual elimination by experience .
Another possible explanation of our results is that frames differ by their informational content .
“ Good ” frames convey more information or make choices more obvious to individuals than “ bad ” frames and economize on experience and incentives .
They help people make normatively consistent choices under risk , which means that they made inconsistent choices with a bad frame by lack of information .
Bringing imperfect information into the Expected Utility theory might probably help explain these observed anomalies .
