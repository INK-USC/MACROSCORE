BRIEF REPORT Attention Goes Both Ways : Shifting Attention Influences Lexical Decisions Mark Mills , Paul Boychuk , Alison L. Chasteen , and Jay Pratt University of Toronto Spatial components of concepts can influence the speed with which peripheral targets are responded to ( e.g. , the word God speeds responses to targets presented above fixation ; devil speeds responses to targets presented below fixation ) .
The basic premise underlying these conceptual cueing effects is that thinking of a spatial metaphor activates an internal spatial representation which in turn influences the allocation of attention in the visual field .
An important step forward in understanding conceptual cues is deter- mining whether the underlying process is bidirectional : Do shifts of attention facilitate activation of corresponding conceptual information ?
To test this , a peripheral cue was used to induce shifts of attention to a peripheral location , and the effect of this shift on concept processing was measured with a standard lexical-decision task in which participants made word/nonword responses to a letter string presented at fixation ( Experiments 1 and 3 ) , or with a modified lexical-decision task in which participants made English/Dutch judgments of a word presented auditorily ( Experiment 2 ) .
If shifts of attention activate spatially compatible concepts , then shifting attention to a peripheral location should speed lexical decisions for spatially compatible concepts such that leftward shifts lead to faster lexical decisions of left relative to right concepts ( and likewise for rightward , upward , and downward shifts ) .
Our results support this prediction , suggesting that behaviors in the visual field can influence the activation of internal representations .
Keywords : spatial attention , conceptual cueing , congruency effects , embodied cognition Conceptual cueing of visual attention refers to an effect of conceptual processing on the allocation of attention in the visual field .
The most concrete example of this is the use of explicit directional cues .
For example , Hommel , Pratt , Colzato , and Godijn ( 2001 ) presented a centrally located directional arrow ( , ) or word ( left , right ) which was followed by a peripheral target re- quiring a simple detection response .
Targets were detected faster when appearing at locations indicated by the cue ( compatible condition ) than at another location ( incompatible condition ) .
This occurred even though these cues were entirely irrelevant to the detection task and observers were explicitly told that the cues did not predict the location of the target , suggesting that processing concepts involves automatic activation of corresponding sensori- motor spatial components .
Similar results have been observed for a myriad of concepts , including those with implicit spatial meaning such as valenced concepts ( e.g. , polite , rude ; Meier & Robinson , 2004 ) , time-related concepts ( e.g. , tomorrow , yesterday ; Weger & Pratt , 2008 ) , concepts of number ( Fischer , Castel , Dodd , & Pratt , 2003 ) and letter ( Dodd , Van der Stigchel , Adil Leghari , Fung , & Kingstone , 2008 ) , words referring to concrete concepts with a typical location in space ( e.g. , hat , boot ; Estes , Verges , & Barsa- lou , 2008 ) , as well as abstract religious ( e.g. , god , devil ; Chasteen , Burdzy , & Pratt , 2010 ) and political ( e.g. , liberal , conservative ; Mills , Smith , Hibbing , & Dodd , 2015 ) concepts .
The implicit assumption underlying these studies is that conceptual cues invoke shifts of visual attention .
That is , the processing of a concept activates a corresponding internal spatial representation that in turn causes attention to be oriented to the spatially compatible region of the visual field .
An important step forward in understanding conceptual cues is examining the directionality of their association with space .
So far , studies of conceptual cueing have been unidirec- tional : A conceptual cue is centrally presented and the effect of that cue on some measure of peripheral attention is examined .
If , however , concepts cause shifts of attention , then it may be possible for shifts of attention to activate spatially compatible concepts ( e.g. , shifting at- tention up should activate upper regions of the visual field , which in turn should facilitate lexical access to concepts explicitly or implicitly associated with up ) .
That is , the relationship between conceptual cues and space in the visual field may be bidirectional .
If so , then moving attention leftward should improve processing for spatially compatible concepts in much the same way as processing a concept improves attentional performance .
Experiment 1 To test whether the relationship between conceptual cues and space in the visual field is bidirectional , a classic peripheral cue ( i.e. , flash of light ) is used to induce shifts attention to a peripheral Mark Mills , Paul Boychuk , Alison L.

Thus , participants oriented to a peripheral cue and then performed a word/nonword judgment of a letter string presented at fixation .
If shifts of attention activate spatially compatible concepts , then shifting attention to a peripheral location should lead to faster word/nonword judgments of spatially compatible concepts .
For example , leftward shifts of attention should lead to faster word/ nonword judgments of left relative to right concepts ( and likewise for rightward , upward , and downward shifts ) .
Method Participants .
Participants were required to be English-first speakers and to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision .
During data collection , however , we discovered that although all partici- pants were English-first speakers , more than half were multilin- gual .
As such , we doubled our target sample size to evaluate multilingualism as a potential between-subjects covariate .
Accord- ingly , 48 undergraduates from the University of Toronto partici- pated in exchange for course credit ( see Table 1 for demograph- ics ) , each of which was naïve to the purpose of the experiment and was informed of their rights of participation according to the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto .
Apparatus .
Testing took place in a dimly lit , sound attenuated room .
Participants were seated 48 cm from a 60-Hz CRT monitor ( 1,024 768 resolution ) , with chin/forehead rests to maintain their viewing position and distance .
An IBM compatible Pentium- equipped PC running Experiment-Builder 1.10.1241 ( SR Research Ltd. , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) controlled stimulus presenta- tion .
All stimuli were displayed on a black background ( 1.25 cd/m2 ) .
Stimuli and procedure .
Appendices A and B lists the word and nonword lexical decision stimuli , respectively .
Figure 1 illus- trates the procedure .
Each trial started with a gray fixation cross ( 45.6 cd/m2 , 1° 1° with 0.04° thickness ) in the center of the display along with two gray peripheral placeholders ( 45.6 cd/m2 , 4° 4° with 0.04° thickness ) for 750 , 1,000 , or 1,250 ms .
The distance between fixation and the center of each placeholder was 8° of visual angle .
Subsequently , one of the placeholders was brightened and thickened ( 87.7 cd/m2 with 0.32° thickness ) .
Par- ticipants were instructed to fixate the location of this peripheral cue , which could appear along either the vertical or horizontal axis .
Vertical and horizontal cues were blocked , with block order coun- terbalanced across participants .
After 100 ms , the display was cleared and a lexical decision stimulus was presented in the center of the display .
Lexical decision stimuli were letter strings and consisted of pronounceable nonwords ( e.g. , jur , ryped , scrorched ) and four different conceptual word categories : words associated with up ( e.g. , bird , lord , ceiling ) , down ( e.g. , ants , hell , basement ) , left ( e.g. , enter , birth , before ) , and right ( e.g. , exit , death , after ) .1 Letters were capitalized ( Times New Roman font ) , gray in color ( 45.6 cd/m2 ) , and measured 0.80° of visual angle .
By pressing the “ F ” or “ J ” key on a keyboard , participants made speeded word/ nonword judgments ( response key mappings were counterbal- anced across participants ) .
Letter strings were presented for 4,000 ms or until a response was registered , after which the display was cleared .
The intertrial interval was 1,500 ms. Design .
Each participant completed two blocks of 200 trials .
One block contained vertical peripheral cues and up/down con- ceptual words , whereas the other contained horizontal peripheral cues and left/right conceptual words .
Within each block there were 100 nonwords and 100 conceptual words ( 50 conceptual words per dimension ) .
In each trial within a block , the peripheral cue location ( above , below/left , right ) and type of letter string ( word , nonword ) were equally likely .
Within the word condition , each word cate- gory ( up , down/left , right ) was equally likely .
1 Pronounceable nonwords were generated as follows .
First , Medler and Binder ’ s ( 2005 ) online tool MCWord was used to compute the word length ( number of characters in a letter string ) , number of orthographic neighbors ( number of different words that can be generated by changing only a single letter ) , and summed frequency of orthographic neighbours ( how often an orthographic neighbor is used in speech/text per 1,000,000 words ) for each conceptual word .
Next , Rastle , Harrington , and Coltheart ’ s ( 2002 ) ARC Nonword Database was used to generate pronounceable nonwords that matched the conceptual words on the parameters above .
Thus , words and nonwords were matched on word length ( M 5.8 / 2.1 letters ) , number of orthographic neighbors ( M 4.2 / 5.6 neighbors ) , and summed frequency of orthographic neighbors ( M 176.4 / 2007.1 occur- rences ) .

283SHIFTING ATTENTION , LEXICAL DECISIONS Results and Discussion Incorrect responses ( 5.12 % ) and responses less than 250 ms or greater than 2,000 ms ( 1.17 % ) were discarded .
Correct response times ( RTs ) were analyzed with a 2 ( block : vertical , horizontal ) 3 ( cue-word compatibility : compatible , incompatible , nonword ) 2 ( language : unilingual , multilingual ) linear mixed effects model with crossed random intercepts for subjects and words and random subject slopes for the effects of block , cue-word compatibility , and their interaction ( Barr , Levy , Scheepers , & Tily , 2013 ; Hoffman , 2014 ) .
Effect size was assessed using pseudo-R2 statistics ( Singer & Willett , 2003 ) , which express the proportion of variance reduced in a given variance component after inclusion of a relevant fixed effect .
Figure 2 shows the mean RTs , collapsing across the multilin- gualism factor .
Critically , there was a significant main effect of cue-word compatibility , F ( 2 , 123.4 ) 18.77 , p .001 , pseudo- R2 19.2 % , where responses were faster in the compatible ( M 661 ms ) than in the incompatible ( M 680 ) condition , t 2.00 , p .049 .
This is the predicted cue-word compatibility effect .
Responses were also faster in the compatible and incompatible conditions than in the nonword ( M 727 ms ) condition , ts 4.34 , ps .001 , which is the typical lexical decision result .
The main effect of block was not significant , F ( 1 , 96.0 ) 1.96 , p .165 , pseudo-R2 1.5 % , and did not interact significantly with cue- word compatibility , F ( 2 , 173.2 ) .30 , p .743 , pseudo-R2 1.0 % .2 Looking at Figure 2 , however , it is somewhat surprising that the main effect of block was not significant given that re- sponses appear to be consistently faster in the vertical relative to horizontal block .
A post hoc power analysis conducted with GPower 3.1 software ( Faul , Erdfelder , Lang , & Buchner , 2007 ) indicated that the statistical power of this test was .69 , which is slightly less than ideal and thus may reflect a type II error .
In sum , Experiment 1 investigated whether the processes under- lying conceptual cueing effects are bidirectional .
Specifically , if conceptual processing activates internal spatial representations that in turn influence behaviors in the visual field , do behaviors in the visual field also influence the activation of internal representa- tions ?
The results suggest this is the case : lexical decisions were speeded when preceded by a spatially compatible behavior ( e.g. , the word up preceded by an up behavior ) than an incompatible one ( e.g. , the word up preceded by a down behavior ) .
Experiment 2 Before we can reasonably conclude that shifts of attention modulated lexical access , one potential alternative must be ad- dressed .
Specifically , because lexical decision stimuli were pre- sented at fixation , participants had to shift attention to the cued location then back to fixation .
As such , it is unclear whether the speeding of lexical decisions is attributable to a spatially compat- ible behavior .
Our interpretation , however , is not that the shift of attention per se was responsible for activating spatially compatible concepts but rather that selection of a particular region of space— via a shift of attention—was responsible .
To rule out the possibility that a shift of attention from a peripheral location back to fixation was somehow responsible for the cue-word compatibility effect , a second experiment was conducted in which a shift back to fixation was not required .
This was achieved by presenting lexical decision stimuli auditorily .
Thus , rather than responding to lexical decision stimuli at fixation ( Experiment 1 ) , responses were to auditory stimuli ( Experiment 2 ) , which obviates the need to shift attention back to fixation .
In addition , because of difficulty in generating nonwords that a computer program could pro- nounce , rather than word/nonword responses to letter strings non-Dutch speakers instead discriminated whether auditory stimuli were English or Dutch words .
Method Participants .
Participation criteria were the same as Experi- ment 1 with the addition that participants were non-Dutch speakers ( effectively making Dutch words ‘ nonwords ’ ) .
An a priori power analysis conducted with GPower 3.1 software ( Faul et al. , 2007 ) indicated that with an alpha level of .05 and a power level of .80 , a sample size of 24 would be necessary to observe an effect size of pseudo-R2 19.2 % ( i.e. , the size of the cue-word compatibility effect in Experiment 1 ) .
Because of this , and the fact that multi- lingualism did not influence the size of the cue-word compatibility effect in Experiment 1 and therefore was not considered in this experiment , 24 undergraduates from the University of Toronto participated in exchange for course credit .
Two participants were excluded from analysis for responding incorrectly on 75 % of trials .
The error rate for each of the 22 remaining subjects was 18 % ( see Table 1 for demographics ) .
All participants were naïve to the purpose of the experiment and were informed of their rights of participation according to the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto .
Apparatus , stimuli , procedure , and design .
Auditory stim- uli were presented binaurally with iCAN headphones in the range of 60–70 dB ( peak volume ) .
English words were the same con- 2 A possible moderating role of multilingualism was examined given the reliance of the present experiment on linguistic ability .
This turned out to be a rather inconsequential factor , however .
There was a significant lan- guage by block interaction , F ( 1 , 46.6 ) 4.23 , p .045 , pseudo-R2 7.2 % , such that the effect of block ( horizontal minus vertical ) was larger for multilinguals ( M 33.23 , t 2.52 , p .014 ) than unilinguals ( M 3.19 , t .22 , p .827 ) , but no other effects were significant ( Fs 1 , pseudo-R2s 1.0 % ) .
Thus , multilinguals were significantly faster to respond in the horizontal versus vertical condition , whereas unilinguals did not differ in speed of response between horizontal and vertical conditions .
Uni- and multilinguals , however , did not differ on the size of the cue-word compatibility effect .

Appendix C lists the Dutch words used in place of nonwords for the modified lexical-decision task .
As participants did not speak Dutch , English and Dutch words were matched only on spoken duration ( MEnglish 712 / 136 ms ; MDutch 739 / 158 ms ) .
Auditory stimuli were generated using developer tools within Google Translate ( https : //translate.google.ca ) .
All other aspects were the same as Experiment 1 .
Results and Discussion Response times were defined as the time interval between the onset of the auditory stimulus and the response.3 Incorrect re- sponses ( 6.45 % ) were omitted from analysis .
Correct RTs ( see Figure 3 ) were analyzed with the linear mixed effects model of Experiment 1 , but omitting multilingualism .
There was a signifi- cant main effect of cue-word compatibility , F ( 2 , 58.8 ) 11.35 , p .001 , pseudo-R2 16.0 % , where responses were faster in the compatible ( M 901 ms ) than in the incompatible ( M 925 ) condition , t 2.09 , p .040 ; this replicates the effect from Experiment 1 with slightly different stimuli , suggesting a robust effect .
Responses were also faster in the compatible and incom- patible conditions than in the Dutch word ( M 983 ms ) condition , ts 3.32 , ps .001 , which is similar to the typical lexical decision result .
The main effect of block was not significant and did not interact significantly with cue-word compatibility ( Fs 1 , pseudo-R2s 1.0 % ) .
Experiment 3 Two concerns warrant further consideration.4 First , there are legitimate concerns about replication in areas related to conceptual cueing ( e.g. , Doyen , Klein , Pichon , & Cleeremans , 2012 ; Meier , Fetterman , & Robinson , 2015 ) .
Indeed , effect size estimates for conceptual cueing effects can change drastically when sample sizes are increased .
For example , Meier et al .
( 2015 ) conducted a replication of one of their earlier studies and found that the effect size in the high-powered study was about half of that in their earlier study .
It seems prudent , therefore , to conduct a high- powered replication .
Second , there is concern that the nature of a concept—whether concrete or abstract—may differentially affect the relationship between space and concepts .
Experiments 1 and 2 examined the relationship between conceptual cues and space without regard to the specific nature of the concept—that is , whether the concept was abstract ( e.g. , God ) or concrete ( e.g. , roof ) in nature was not directly considered .
Accordingly , the purpose of Experiment 3 was to conduct a high-powered replica- tion with better control over the specific nature of the concept .
To that end , 100 subjects participated in Experiment 3 , in which abstract and concrete concepts associated with vertical space were tested .
Method Participants .
Participation criteria were the same as Experi- ment 1 .
The initial sample consisted of 115 undergraduates from the University of Toronto who participated in exchange for course credit .
Fifteen of these were not English-first speakers and were discarded , resulting in a sample size of 100 ( see Table 1 for demographics ) .
All participants were naïve to the purpose of the experiment and were informed of their rights of participation according to the Research Ethics Board at the University of To- ronto .
Apparatus .
Testing took place in a dimly lit , sound attenuated room , with participants seated 57 cm from a 144-Hz LCD monitor ( 2,560 1,440 resolution ) .
Chin/forehead rests were used to maintain viewing position and distance .
An IBM compatible Pentium-equipped PC running Experiment-Builder 1.10.1241 ( SR Research Ltd. , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) controlled stimulus presentation .
All stimuli were displayed on a black background ( 1.25 cd/m2 ) .
Stimuli and procedure .
These were the same as in Experi- ment 1 with two exceptions .
First , only the vertical dimension was used .
The horizontal dimension was not included here because most of the horizontal word items were abstract and therefore did not permit strict control over the balance of concrete versus ab- stract items .
Second , the word and nonword lexical decision stim- uli were only a subset of those used in Experiment 1 rather than the full set .
Again , this was necessary to ensure balance in the number of concrete and abstract items .
There were 20 up words ( concrete : SKY , CLOUD , BIRD , HEAD , EYES , ROOF , HAT , HELICOPTER , CHIMNEY , ATTIC ; abstract : ALMIGHTY , GOD , HEAVEN , CREATOR , LORD , JOYOUS , HAPPY , JOLLY , GLAD , CHEERFUL ) and 20 down words ( concrete : GROUND , FISH , ROOTS , TOES , FLOOR , BOOTS , BASEMENT , SUBMARINE , RUG , TIRES ; abstract : DEVIL , HELL , SATAN , LUCIFER , DEMON , MELANCHOLY , SORROW , DEPRESSED , SAD , UNPLEASED ) .5 Words and nonwords were matched on word length ( M 5.6 / 1.9 letters ) , number of orthographic neighbors ( M 5.9 / 6.7 3 We also analyzed response times defined as the time interval between the offset of the auditory stimulus and the response .
This analysis yielded identical inferential statistics as those reported in the text .

285SHIFTING ATTENTION , LEXICAL DECISIONS neighbors ) , and summed frequency of orthographic neighbors ( M 42.9 / 102.8 occurrences ) .
Design .
Each participant responded to each of 80 unique lex- ical decision items ( 20 concrete words , 20 abstract words , and 40 nonwords ) twice , once with an above peripheral cue and once with a below peripheral cue , for a total of 160 trials .
In each trial , the peripheral cue location ( above or below fixation ) and type of letter string ( word or nonword ) were equally likely .
Within the word condition , the nature of the concept ( abstract or concrete ) was equally likely .
Results and Discussion Incorrect responses ( 3.0 % ) and responses less than 250 ms or greater than 2,000 ms ( 1 % ) were discarded .
Correct RTs were analyzed with a 3 ( cue-word compatibility : compatible , incompat- ible , nonword ) 2 ( word group : abstract , concrete ) nested linear mixed effect model ( the effect of word group was nested within the compatible and incompatible conditions of cue-word compatibility given that nonwords are neither abstract nor concrete ) with crossed random intercepts for subjects and words and random subject slopes for the effect of cue-word compatibility and its interaction with word group .
Figure 4 shows the mean RTs .
Once again , there was a signif- icant main effect of cue-word compatibility , F ( 2 , 119.0 ) 22.15 , p .001 , pseudo-R2 34.3 % , where responses were faster in the compatible ( M 631 ms ) than in the incompatible ( M 650 ms ) condition , t 3.05 , p .003 .
This is the predicted cue-word compatibility effect .
Responses were also faster in the compatible and incompatible conditions than in the nonword ( M 716 ms ) , which is the typical lexical decision result .
Notice that the effect size for the cue-word compatibility effect was nearly twice as large as in Experiments 1 and 2 , likely owing to the reduced set of word items .
Critically , the nested effect interaction of cue-word com- patibility ( compatible , incompatible ) and word group ( abstract , concrete ) was not significant , F ( 2 , 96.1 ) .47 , p .627 , pseudo- R2 1.0 % , indicating the magnitude of the cue-word compatibil- ity effect did not reliably differ between abstract ( M 22 ms ) and concrete ( M 16 ms ) conceptual word groups .
These results replicate and extend Experiments 1 and 2 by demonstrating that the nature of the internally represented concept—whether concrete or abstract—does not differentially impact the relationship be- tween space and concepts .
General Discussion Direct experience with the physical dimension of space is thought to structure our understanding of concepts for which direct sensory experience is unavailable ( e.g. , to be divine is to be up in space ; to be conservative is to be right in space ) , and previous evidence suggests that conceptual processing indeed biases visual attention toward spatially compatible locations ( e.g. , Chasteen et al. , 2010 ; Dodd et al. , 2008 ; Estes et al. , 2008 ; Fischer et al. , 2003 ; Hommel et al. , 2001 ; Meier & Robinson , 2004 ; Mills et al. , 2015 ; Weger & Pratt , 2008 ) .
The present study examined whether the processes underlying these conceptual cueing effects are bidirec- tional : can shifts of attention to a particular location in the visual field facilitate the processing of corresponding concepts ?
Experi- ment 1 observed a cue-word compatibility effect such that lexical decisions were speeded when preceded by a spatially compatible cue ( e.g. , the word up preceded by an up cue ) than an incompatible one ( e.g. , the word up preceded by a down cue ) on both vertices .
Thus , just as activated internal representations are capable of influencing behaviors in the visual field , behaviors in the visual field can also influence the activation of internal representations .
Because Experiment 1 required a shift of attention to the loca- tion of the peripheral cue then back to fixation , it is unclear whether the speeding of lexical decisions is attributable to a spatially compatible behavior .
To rule out this possibility , Exper- iment 2 presented lexical decision stimuli auditorily , thus remov- ing the need to shift attention back to fixation .
Again , a cue-word compatibility effect was observed .
Our interpretation , therefore , is not that the shift of attention per se was responsible for activating spatially compatible concepts but rather that selection of a partic- ular region of space—via a shift of attention—was responsible .
The present work contributes to the conceptual metaphor and embodied cognition literature ( Barsalou , 1999 , 2008 ; Gozli , Chas- teen , & Pratt , 2013 ; Lakoff & Johnson , 1980 , 1999 ; Landau , Meier , & Keefer , 2010 ) by demonstrating how visual positioning of information along the vertical or horizontal dimension can affect accessibility of conceptual representations .
In the literature , two interrelated mechanisms are discussed as underlying these language-space associations ( compatibility effects ) : ( a ) metaphor- ical mapping and ( b ) automatic reactivation of experiential traces during language understanding .
Conceptual metaphor theory ( La- koff & Johnson , 1980 , 1999 ; Landau et al. , 2010 ) focuses on how people perceive and represent items that have no direct sensory experience .
It proposes that the human cognitive system is struc- tured around a set of concepts that emerge directly from experi- ence .
The general principle of conceptual metaphor theory—that less concrete concepts can be understood metaphorically in terms of more concrete ones—implies a unidirectional nature to compatibility effects .
Indeed , as remarked by Landau et al .
( 2010 ) , “ metaphorical mappings between dissimilar concepts tend to go in the direction of a concrete source concept to a relatively more abstract target concept , but not the other way around ” ( pp .
1052 ) .
Support for the metaphor account ( i.e. , unidirectional mapping ) is found in Meier and Robinson ( 2004 ; Experiment 3 ) .

In contrast to the present findings , Meier and Robinson failed to observe a compatibility effect between the location of the prime and the meaning of the word such that participants were no faster to evaluate positive words when preceded by a prime appearing above fixation than when the prime appeared below fixation ( and likewise for negative words—participants were no faster to eval- uate negative words when preceded by a prime appearing below fixation than when the prime appeared above fixation ) .
Thus , whereas the present results suggest a bidirectional relationship between concepts and space , the Meier and Robinson study sug- gests a unidirectional one whereby affective judgments activate spatial attention , but this does not prime evaluations .
According to Meier and Robinson ( 2004 ) , this was attributable to the asymmet- rical nature of affective metaphor .
Individuals can use their sen- sory system to determine the location of an item in space and , as such , do not need to borrow metaphor to achieve an understanding of vertical position .
The present study questions the general valid- ity of the metaphor view , as the findings suggest that perception and cognition may have a common neuronal basis , thereby allow- ing for a bidirectional relationship between the two .
This common neuronal basis is consistent with notions that action and perception share representations .
In this perspective , conceptual processing is thought to automatically activate percep- tual features associated with the meaning of the concept ( i.e. , simulation ; Barsalou , 1999 , 2008 ) .
Thus , activating a concept representation also activates a corresponding spatial representation stored during experience of the concept ’ s referent , which in turn causes attention to be shifted to the spatially compatible region of space .
The implication is that conceptual processing invokes brain activity associated with the processing of spatial information ( Bar- salou , 1999 , 2008 ) .
If so , then the relationship between conceptual and perceptual representations should be bidirectional : activating a spatial representation ( e.g. , via shift of spatial attention ) should also activate corresponding conceptual representations , which in turn should facilitate access to conceptually compatible concepts .
This is precisely what was found in the present study—shifting attention facilitated lexical access when the spatial aspects of the behavior and the lexical item matched ( e.g. , the word up followed by a behavior that activates upward space ) .
The present findings are in line with a recent study by Berndt , Dudschig , and Kaup ( 2016 ) .
They examined bidirectionality be- tween space and concepts using perceptual cues in which anagram problems ( e.g. , dolphin “ dplhion ” or cloud “ cdulo ” ) were presented at different locations in the visual field ( top or bottom of the display ) .
They found that anagrams were solved faster when the position of the anagram was compatible with the typical location of the solution ’ s referent in the real world ( cloud is top ; dolphin is bottom ) .
Importantly , however , this effect depended on the presence of a background ocean-sky picture , suggesting that experiential traces can activate associated concepts only within a supporting context .
Berndt et al .
( 2016 ) therefore interpret these findings as reflecting a mixture of automatic activation processes and the integration of the context information provided by the background picture .
It is unclear why a supporting context was not necessary to obtain a compatibility effect in the present studies .
A likely possibility may have to do with the difference between studies in how attention was shifted to peripheral locations .
Spe- cifically , the manner by which attention is shifted ( either via endogenous task-goals in Berndt et al .
or exogenous stimulation in the current study ) may impact the relationship between space and concepts .
Despite all this evidence that activating experiential traces in- deed activates related concepts , there is a remaining possibility that language use might account for concept-space mappings , such that conceptual cueing effects are driven by the frequent use of spatial terms with target concepts ( e.g. , God above ; Goodhew , McGaw , & Kidd , 2014 ; Louwerse , 2008 ) .
Thus , participants may shift their attention upward upon processing God because they have fre- quently and systematically been exposed to the term in conjunction with above and up , such that this spatial information has become associated with the concept itself .
Such accounts predict that the magnitude of conceptual cueing effects is explained by linguistic collocations of the concept word and spatial words ( i.e. , frequency of use of the words together ) .
The present study can not rule out this account ; however , it seems that such an account requires two associations ( upper space with the word above , and the word above with the word ‘ God ’ ) , whereas our interpretation requires only one ( that upper space be associated with the word ‘ God ’ ) and is therefore more parsimonious and thus preferred , at least for the time being .
Context of the Research Spatial representation is critical for perceiving and acting on objects in the world given that identifying and/or acting upon an object usually requires that the object first be located in space .
Recent work indicates that spatial representations continue to influence higher cognition , such as conceptual understanding .
This is evident in studies demonstrating that processing concepts refer- ring to objects with typical locations in space ( e.g. , head , foot ) or abstract concepts that are metaphorically associated with locations in space ( e.g. , God , Devil ) influence where attention is allocated in the visual field .
Consistent with the essential role of perceptual ( spatial ) features in concept representation , the present studies found that cueing location ( up , down , left , and right ) influenced the processing of semantically related concepts .
This work helps es- tablish boundary conditions in embodied cognition as it challenges explanations that have been offered for conceptual cueing , such as conceptual metaphor theory , which assume a unidirectionality of this effect .
