DAVID EGGEBEEN The Pennsylvania State University JEFFREY DEW University of Virginia* The Role of Religion in Adolescence for Family Formation in Young Adulthood This paper examines the role of religion in ado- lescence for shaping subsequent family forma- tion .
Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( N ¼ 13,895 ) .
We explored the role of three dimen- sions of religious life—affiliation , attendance , and religious fervor—both singly and in combi- nation for the transition to either marriage or cohabitation .
Although each dimension pre- dicted subsequent union formation , it was the particular combination of these dimensions that was important for understanding the likelihood of cohabiting .
We also found evidence that pat- terns of religious identity , attendance , and fer- vor in adolescence were associated with the length of cohabitation , the likelihood of the cohabitation ending in marriage , and beliefs about the purpose of cohabitation .
Young adulthood is in themidst of a demographic revolution .
Delays in marriage , rising rates of cohabitation , high rates of nonmarital childbear- ing , and delays in marital births combined with changing patterns of schooling and work have meant that the movement into adulthood has become even less a predictable sequence of events that it once was ( Arnett , 2004 ; Settersten , Furstenberg , & Rumbaut , 2005 ) .
The purpose of this paper is to examine a potentially important factor in the changing landscape of young adult- hood : the role of earlier religious beliefs and behavior in shaping subsequent family formation choices .
The connections between religion and family life are receiving renewed attention from schol- ars .
Recent work has examined the role religious practices and beliefs play in parenting behavior ( Ellison , Bartkowski , & Segal , 1996 ; Wilcox , 1998 , 2004 ) , marriage ( Xu , Hudspeth , & Bartkowski , 2005 ) , intergenerational ties ( King & Elder , 1999 ; Pearce & Axinn , 1998 ) , and de- mographic behavior ( Lehrer , 2004 ; McQuillan , 2004 ) .
Scholars are finally turning their attention to the role of religion in the lives of adolescents and young adults .
Work by Smith ( 2003 , 2005 ) has clearly demonstrated the centrality , and the complexity , of religious beliefs for American adolescents .
Religious practices and beliefs also have been shown to powerfully shape adolescent sexual values and practices ( Regnerus , 2007 ) .
Finally , some recent work has begun to address the role of religion in the post-teenage years , when youth are laying the foundations for their subsequent adult lives bymaking decisions about romantic relationships , cohabitation , and mar- riage ( Arnett & Jensen , 2002 ; Thornton , Axinn , & Xie , 2007 ) .

Most of these studies use sim- ple indicators of religion , focusing on one or two dimensions of religious experiences , or combine several dimensions into a single scale .
Where union formation patterns are the focus , data have mainly been drawn from older cohorts , reflecting a time period when religious influences may have been stronger ( Lehrer , 2000 ) .
Finally , with the exception of thework of Thornton and colleagues ( 2007 ) , none of these studies have gone beyond the initial transition to examine the effect of reli- gion on subsequent patterns of union stability or dissolution .
This paper addresses these gaps in the litera- ture .
Making use of the first and third Waves of the National Study of Adolescent Health ( Add- Health ) , we examine how three dimensions of religious beliefs and behavior in adolescence affect the likelihood of cohabitation andmarriage in young adulthood .
It is our contention that understanding the effects of religion on family formation behavior must consider the multidi- mensional nature of religiosity .
To fully under- stand how religious identity , the extent or importance of religious beliefs , and how often the person attends places of worship influence family formation choices , it is important to take into account not only the effect of each of these dimensions but also the interplay between them .
Specifically , we expect that adolescents who reg- ularly attend churches that emphasize the sanctity of marriage and whose beliefs are held to be very important are the most likely to make a transition to marriage and the least likely to make a transi- tion to cohabitation over the next 5 years , relative to other combinations of religious beliefs and experiences .
We also examine how religious behavior and beliefs in adolescence , as measured in these three dimensions , might be related to specific patterns of cohabitation experiences .
Previous work has demonstrated that religious identity and religios- ity reduce the odds of the first union being cohab- itation ( Lehrer , 2004 ) .
Nevertheless , a significant proportion of religiously inclined youth still choose to cohabit ( Thornton et al. , 2007 ) .
There has been little exploration of whether early reli- gious experiences shape subsequent patterns of cohabitation .
We anticipate that the particular combinations of religious identity , attendance , and fervor in adolescence aremore likely be asso- ciated with briefer spells of cohabitation that are more likely to end in amarriage and be associated with the view that cohabitation without marriage in mind is unacceptable .
Put another way , cohab- iting young adults who were regularly attending churches as teenagers with distinctive teachings about marriage and cohabitation and whose reli- gious beliefs as teens were very important are substantially more likely to use cohabitation as part of the marriage formation process .
RELIGION AND THE FORMATION OF INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS How might the religious life of teenagers affect their subsequent union formation ?
At the most general level , Smith ( 2003 ) identifies nine possi- ble sources of religious influences on adoles- cents , which combine into three domains : moral order , learned competencies , and social and orga- nizational ties .
Of particular interest for us in this paper is the moral order .
Smith ( 2003 ) notes that religion can promote ‘ ‘ specific cultural moral di- rectives of self-control and personal virtue grounded in the authority of long historical tradi- tions and narratives , into which members are in- ducted , such that youths may internalize these moral orders and use them to guide their life choices and moral commitments ’ ’ ( p. 20 ) .
These can be accomplished , according to Smith ( 2003 ) , through moral directives , spiritual experiences , and role modeling .
In this paper we identify three dimensions of religious experience as reported by the adolescent that approximate several dimensionsof the cultural moral order : the denominational identity—and thus , after a fashion , the particular teachings about marriage ; the pattern of exposure to these teach- ings as measured by church attendance ; and the relative importance of religion to the youth as indi- cated by their self-report of the importance of their beliefs and as well how often they engage in pri- vate religious practices like prayer .
Religious Identity Particular religions , religious bodies , or religious leaders can have a direct effect on decisions about marriage or cohabitation by their doctrines or their teaching , and there are distinct differences among denominations in their teachings or emphasis , or both , on marriage .
Mormons and Evangelical Protestants have strongly advocated marriage as God ’ s design for intimate relation- ships and that marriage , as a sacred institution , is the cornerstone of family life ( Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints , 2004 ; Dobson , 2004 ; Teenage Religiosity and Future Family Formation 109 Southern Baptist Resolutions , 2004 ) .
As a result , Evangelical Christians and Mormons have con- sistently discouraged premarital sex and cohabi- tation and encouraged marriage ( Heaton , 1992 ) .
Of course conservative denominations may not uniformly ‘ ‘ practice what they preach. ’ ’ Chaves ( 1997 ) notes , for example , that public stances of particular religious bodies are often only loosely coupled to concrete practices .
Support for this observation come from an analysis of family pro- gramming practices of various religious tradi- tions where the most conservative religious traditions ( Conservative Protestant and Catholic ) were no more likely than more liberal denomina- tions to be offering traditional family program- ming ( Wilcox , Chaves , & Franz , 2004 ) .
Nevertheless , there is empirical evidence that Conservative Protestants and Mormons are sig- nificantly more likely to marry and less likely to cohabit than other types denominational affi- liations ( Lehrer , 2000 , 2004 ; Xu et al. , 2005 ) .
Identifying with a Conservative Protestant denomination may also influence union forma- tion indirectly by affecting choices in other do- mains that influence the likelihood and timing of marriage .
For example , some research shows that Mainline Protestants have higher levels of educational attainment than Conservative Protes- tants ( Lehrer , 2000 ) .
The relatively low priority Conservative Protestants give formal education has been linked with their comparatively early age at marriage ( Darnell & Sherkat , 1997 ) .
Sim- ilarly , the strong emphasis on high fertility among Mormons predisposes individuals to con- sider early marriage ( Heaton , 1986 ) .
We hypoth- esize , then , that adolescents whose religious identity or affiliation is Conservative Protestant are more likely to marry and less likely to cohabit in young adulthood .
In a similar fashion , the Roman Catholic Church is ‘ ‘ promarriage ’ ’ in its theology and teach- ings .
It has long held that marriage is a sacrament and that sexual behavior is only appropriatewithin marriage ( Ellingson , Van Haitsma , Lauman , & Tebbe , 2004 ; U.S. Catholic Conference , 1977 ) .
Some research , however , suggests that Catholics ’ behavior is less consistent or predictable than one would expect given the Church ’ s emphasis on marriage .
Although Catholic adolescents are less likely than Evangelical Protestant adolescents to be sexually active , a sizable minority end their teenage years as nonvirgins ( Regnerus , 2007 ) .
Several studies have also found that Catholics are less likely than Conservative Protestants or Mormons to enter marriage early ( Lehrer , 2004 ; Xu et al. , 2005 ) .
Why do Catholics seemingly avoid marriage despite the strong pro-marriage emphasis of their faith ?
Lehrer ( 2004 ) observes that , compared to other faiths , the costs of divorce for Catholics are particularly high .
These higher costs , she suggests , may lead to a greater hesi- tancy to enter into marriage quickly .
Consistent with this idea , she finds evidence that Catholics tend to enter marriage at an intermediate age , avoiding both early and late marriage .
Given this , we expect that Catholic youth will be less likely than Conservative Protestants to marry but equally likely to avoid cohabitation .
In contrast to Evangelicals , Mormons , and Catholics , Protestants from the mainline de- nominations have become increasingly distinc- tive in their teachings .
While continuing to emphasize the importance of strong and vital family relationships , Mainline Protestants have put less emphasis on restrictive teachings con- cerning sex outside of marriage , been more toler- ant of divorce , and have been more accepting of alternatives to the traditional family than Evan- gelical Protestants ( Edgell , 2005 ; Hargrove , 1983 ) .
The higher levels of educational attain- ment among Mainline Protestants might also be associated with delays in marriage ( Lehrer , 2000 ) .
Given this , we might expect to find that youth from Mainline Protestant backgrounds are less likely than Conservative Protestants to marry but more likely to cohabit .
In contrast to youth who identify with a reli- gious tradition , those with no religious affiliation are not as likely to be exposed to a compelling vision of how to behave when it comes to mar- riage and cohabitation .
Consistent with what others have found , we expect these youths to be the least likely to marry and the most likely to cohabit ( Thornton et al. , 2007 ) .
Attendance Religious identity is far from the whole story , however .
For the particular beliefs and teachings of a religious group to exert an influence , individ- uals must be exposed to these messages .
Most typically this means they must attend religious services .
We should expect then that the more teenagers attend services or participate in church related ministries like young groups or youth services , or both , the more likely , all things being equal , they are likely to hear and absorb teachings about what is appropriate sexual behavior , what 110 Journal of Marriage and Family are appropriateways to conduct intimate relation- ships , and the meaning and purpose of marriage .
Of course , the relationship between church atten- dance and behavior is more complicated for ado- lescents than adults .
As some scholars have noted , adolescent attendance at religious services may reflect the expectations or pressure from parents or the momentum of long-standing habit , rather than an authentic desire to worship God or understand and follow church teachings ( Regnerus , 2007 ; Smith , 2005 ) .
Nevertheless , a number of studies find that church attendance remains a significant predictor of youth behavior ( Regnerus ; Regnerus & Elder , 2003 ) .
We hy- pothesize that church attendance will be posi- tively related to the likelihood of marriage and negatively related to the likelihood of cohabiting .
The Importance of Religious Beliefs A third dimension of religion that has consequen- ces for subsequent marriage and cohabitation among youth is that of the importance they place on their beliefs .
The messages , beliefs , and doc- trines they are exposed to must be meaningful to them ; they must take their religion seriously .
Wimberley ( 1989 ) argues that religious identity includes both norm adherence and identity salience .
Religious norm adherence includes such publicly visible aspects of religious experi- ence as church attendance and knowledge of church tenets or doctrine .
Religious salience , on the other hand , is the internal aspects of religious experience—private religion—and ‘ ‘ concerns the extent to which the religious identity is dom- inant among other identities that make up the self ’ ’ ( Wimberley , p. 130 ) .
In part , salience is measured by how important individuals say their religion is to them .
Salience , however , is also anchored in the extent to which individuals prac- tice their beliefs apart from extrinsic motivations .
This could mean the extent to which they engage in private religious practices like prayer , medita- tion , or scripture reading .
It could also mean the extent to which their identity as a religious adher- ent ‘ ‘ wins out ’ ’ over competing identities ( e.g. , macho football player ) for influencing sexual behavior , for example ( Regnerus , 2007 ) .
Norm adherence does not necessarily lead to salience .
An adolescent might be knowledgeable about Catholic teaching on marriage and sexuality and may regularly attend Mass , but these activities may say little about the extent to which the ado- lescent ‘ ‘ takes his Catholicism to heart ’ ’ when it comes to making decisions about sexual behav- ior .
On the other hand , Regnerus argues , high salience can act as a ‘ ‘ stimulant to religious be- liefs or cognitive structures , a light switch of sorts that turns on the force of religious belief ’ ’ ( p. 48 ) .
We hypothesize that the greater the importance of religion to the adolescent , the greater the likeli- hood of marriage and lower the likelihood of cohabitation .
The Interplay Between Identity , Attendance , and Salience Thus far we have argued that religiosity is multi- dimensional , and that each of these components independently affects family formation behavior .
It is , however , how these three dimensions inter- act together that may tell us more about how reli- gion influences subsequent behavior .
Put another way , the ‘ ‘ punch ’ ’ of religion on future marriage or cohabitation ismuchmore powerfulwhen ado- lescents identify themselves as members of a par- ticular church with distinctive teachings about marriage , and they are regularly attending church services or youth groups , and their religious be- liefs are important to them .
Most of the research that has attempted to link religion and family behavior has focused on affil- iation , attendance , or religiosity , but rarely more than one of these dimensions .
One exception is the work of Lehrer ( 2004 ) , who examined the interaction between two of these dimensions : religious affiliation ( Mainline Protestants , Con- servative Protestants , and Catholics ) and reli- gious attendance at age 14 .
She found that patterns of entry into marriage do not vary signif- icantly by frequency of attendance at services for any of the three religious groups .
She did , how- ever , find evidence of an interaction between affiliation and attendance when it came to cohab- itation , with high attending Conservative Protes- tants the least likely to cohabit .
Recent work by Thornton et al .
( 2007 ) identified three dimensions of religiosity in a fashion similar to what is pro- posed in this paper ; distinguish between affilia- tion ( Catholic , Nonfundamentalist Protestant , Fundamentalist Protestant or Baptist , other , and none ) , and two dimensions of religiosity—parti- cipation and importance .
Interestingly , contrary to what they had expected , they found no evi- dence that the effects of participation and impor- tance on likelihood of cohabitation or marriage varied significantly between these religious groups .
These findings , however , were based on Teenage Religiosity and Future Family Formation 111 a sample of heavily Catholic respondents from the Detroit metropolitan area who entered young adulthood around 1980 , making generalizations difficult ( Pearce & Thornton , 2007 ; Thornton et al. , 2007 ) .
Given the above considerations , we anticipate several patterns in the interplay between affilia- tion , attendance , and salience .
We expect to find that variations in attendance and fervor will pre- dict differences within denominations in the likelihood of marriage or cohabitation .
We also expect that the differences between denomi- nations in the likelihood of marriage and co- habitation will be considerably moderated by differences in attendance and fervor .
Specifically , we expect that adolescents who identify them- selves as Conservative Protestants who regularly attend worship services or youth groups and who report their beliefs are very important will be sig- nificantly more likely than other Conservative Protestant adolescents to marry and will be sig- nificantly less likely to cohabit .
Furthermore , we anticipate that these adolescents ( high attend- ing , high salience , Conservative Protestants ) will the most likely of all the groups to marry and the least likely to cohabit .
We also expect Mainline Protestant and Catholic youths to be less likely to marry than Conservative Protestant youth ( for the different reasons outlined above ) regard- less of their level of attendance or fervor .
We expect , however , that the likelihood of cohabita- tion among Mainline Protestant and Catholic youth to be lowest among those who frequently attend religious services and for whom religion is important—although less than that of high attending , high fervor Conservative Protestant youths .
In sum , we anticipate that religious iden- tity , attendance at religious services , and fervor , separately and in concert , should affect union formation .
Religion and the Nature of Cohabitation One of the earliest questions in the research liter- ature on cohabitation in the United States revolved around whether the explosive growth of cohabitation in the 1970s and 1980s repre- sented an emerging stage in the courtship process or a substitute for marriage ( Smock , 2000 ) .
More recent work suggests that both types of cohabita- tions are practiced today in the United States ( Casper & Bianchi , 2002 ; Smock & Manning , 2004 ) .
A significant fraction of cohabiting cou- ples end up marrying , but there are also a number of cohabiting unions where the individuals indi- cated they have no desire to marry , that are of long duration , or that are settings for bearing and rearing children ( Brown & Booth , 1996 ; Bumpass & Lu , 2000 ) .What factorsmight differ- entiate between these two types of cohabitations has not received much attention beyond basic demographic characteristics such as race or socioeconomic status ( Blackwell & Lichter , 2000 ; Smock , 2000 ) .
What role might religion play in the expectations or meaning of a cohabit- ing experience ?
One possibility is that adolescent religion has little or no effect on the course of cohabitation in young adulthood .
Given the strong prohibition against nonmarital cohabitation among Conser- vative Protestants and Catholics , the effect of this particular religious background on current behavior may be small , once an individual has made the choice to cohabit .
That is , once an indi- vidual has ‘ ‘ fallen away , ’ ’ the movement away from a religiously based lifestyle may be quite far .
We do know , for example , that once individ- uals cohabit , their religious behavior declines ( Thornton , Axinn , & Hill , 1992 ) .
If this dynamic is common , we would expect few differences by adolescent religious experiences on the likeli- hood of the cohabitation ending in marriage , views on the meaning of cohabitation , or the length of first cohabiting spell .
An alternative possibility builds on the idea that religion in general , apart from any particular doctrines or teachings , tends to be correlated with conventional beliefs and lifestyles ( Mahoney et al. , 1999 ) .
Although this conventionalization process is likely to select many individuals into marriage rather than cohabitation as a first union , it may also have an effect on those who subse- quently cohabit as well .
Thus cohabiting young adults with some religious roots ( regardless of specific identity , attendance , or fervor ) are likely to view cohabitation as most appropriate if it points to marriage and treat their own cohabiting experiences accordingly .
If religious convention- alization is the predominant pattern , we would expect to find no differences among the various combinations of identities , fervor , and atten- dance .
The major difference in cohabitation pat- terns , then , is between those who indicate no religious preference in adolescence , relative to all the others .
A third possibility is that particular religious beliefs and behavior evident in childhood and adolescence continue to have an effect into 112 Journal of Marriage and Family young adulthood .
Specifically , youth who faith- fully attended Conservative Protestant or Catho- lic churches and who indicated their beliefs are important—a pattern that we hypothesize should exert the most influence on subsequent family formation behavior—are more likely than other young adults with differing identities , atten- dance , and levels of fervor to conduct their sub- sequent cohabitation as if it were part of the courtship process .
If this pattern predominates , we would expect to find that cohabiting young adults who were devout , high attending Conser- vative Protestants or Catholics as adolescents have shorter spells of cohabitation , have higher odds of exiting those cohabitations into mar- riage , and are more likely to hold to the value that cohabitation is most appropriately done with marriage in mind .
In sum , we propose three competing hypothe- ses about the link between adolescent religious experiences and subsequent cohabitation pat- terns : ( a ) Religious experiences will have no effect on patterns and beliefs about cohabitation ; ( b ) all religious experiences in adolescence will be associated with shorter cohabitation spells that most likely end in marriage as well as the belief that cohabitation should end in marriage ; or ( c ) only those adolescents who were Catholic or Conservative Protestant youth who attended reg- ularly andwhose beliefswere importantwill have shorter cohabiting spells that typically end in marriage and believe that cohabitation should end in marriage .
METHOD Data The data for this study were drawn from the first and third waves of the National Study of Adoles- cent Health .
TheAdd-Health survey is a longitu- dinal nationally representative sample of 20,745 middle and high school students first inter- viewed in 1995 – 1996 .
A second wave of inter- views was conducted 1 year later , and a third round of 15,170 persons was interviewed in 2001 .
Response rates for Waves 1 and 3 were 78.9 % and 77.4 % , respectively .
Attrition ana- lyses suggest that the effect of nonresponse on representativeness was minimal ( Chantala , Kalsbeek , & Andraca , 2004 ) .
We restricted the sample to respondents who participated in both Waves 1 and 3 , who had not been in a cohabiting or marriage union prior to the first survey , and who gave information on their religious affilia- tion at Wave 1 , for a final sample of 13,895 .
The analyses in this study were all weighted using the Wave 3 weights , adjusting the sample to be nationally representative .
A more detailed description of the data can be found in Harris et al .
( 2003 ) .
Measures Religion .
We measured three dimensions of reli- gious beliefs and behaviors : religious affiliation or identity , fervor or devoutness , and religious attendance .
In Wave 1 , respondents were asked to identify their particular denominational affilia- tion ( e.g. , Adventist , Assemblies of God ) .
We re- coded these 29 choices into five categories : No religious affiliation , Conservative Protestant , Mainline Protestant , Catholic , and Other , using a classification scheme derived from two sources : the RELTRADmethod of classifying denomina- tions described in Steensland et al .
( 2000 ) and a scheme used by Smith ( 2005 ) .
These schemes allowed us to categorize specific denominations into groups that share a common underlying theo- logical or doctrinal similarity when it comes to perspectives on marriage and sexual behavior .
Catholics are distinguished because of their size ( they represent 22 % of the sample ) .
All other reli- gious or denominational affiliations that could not be classified into the above three groups are lumped together in the ‘ ‘ other ’ ’ category ( 4 % ) .
Regrettably , wewere not able to distinguishMus- lims ( n ¼ 33 ) or Jews ( n ¼ 108 ) in these analy- ses , given their small sample sizes .
Finally , about 14 % of the respondents indicated they had no religious identify or affiliation , and were classified as ‘ ‘ none. ’ ’ Two Wave 1 questions were used to construct our measure of religious fervor : ‘ ‘ How important is religion to you ? ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ How often do you pray ? ’ ’ Responses were combined to form a scale ranging from 2 to 9 ( mean 6.54 ) , with higher scores indicating higher fervor or religiosity .
Chronbach ’ s alpha for this scale was .75 , indicat- ing that combining measures of belief and prac- tice makes reasonable empirical as well as theoretical sense .
The third dimension of religion we employed was worship service attendance .
Attendance was drawn from theWave 1 question : ‘ ‘ In the past twelve months , how often did you attend reli- gious services ? ’ ’ Answers ranged from 1 ( once a week or more ) to 4 ( never ) .
This variable was Teenage Religiosity and Future Family Formation 113 reverse coded , such that higher values indicated greater attendance .
We also created a composite variable with cat- egories that represent combinations of affiliation , high and low fervor , and high and low atten- dance .
Utilizing a mean split on fervor , individu- als with a score of 7 or above were coded as being in the high group for this variable , and those below 7 had low fervor .
Similarly , individuals who attended worship services more than once per month ( a score of 3 or 4 ) were put in the high attendance group and individuals who attended once per month or less were in the low attendance group .
Thus , we divided Conservative Protes- tants into four groups : those with high attendance and high fervor , those with low attendance and high fervor , those with high attendance and low fervor , and those with both low attendance and low fervor .
We divided Catholics and Mainline Protestants in the same fashion.We did not divide respondents who are in the ‘ ‘ other ’ ’ or ‘ ‘ none ’ ’ affiliation categories .
There were too few re- spondents in the ‘ ‘ other ’ ’ affiliation category to divide into four groups , and those who had no religious affiliation have virtually no distribution on the attendance and fervor variables .
Religious identity , attendance , and fervor are combined into a composite variable with 16 categories .
Other independent variables .
Other Wave 1 var- iables included in the multivariate models were age ( measured in years ) , race ( EuropeanAmerican , African American , Hispanic American , Other ) , total family income , mother ’ s education ( less than high school , high school graduate , some col- lege , and college graduate ) , region of resident at Wave 1 ( South , non-South ) , respondent ’ s educa- tion as of Wave 3 ( less than high school , high school graduate , some college , and college grad- uate ) , family structure ( two-parent biological , two-parent stepfamily , single mother , single father , and other ) , and gender .
Descriptive statis- tics of these and the key independent variables are displayed in Table 1 .
Dependent variables .
The key dependent vari- able for the analyses in Tables 2 through 4 is the transition to first union , defined here is as either marriage or cohabitation .
The Wave 3 questionnaire collected cohabitation and mar- riage histories , from which we were able to determine the timing and type of union transi- tion for the respondents .
By Wave 3 , 9.6 % ( 1,436 ) of respondents hadmarriage be their first union transition , 39.0 % ( 5,223 ) had cohabita- tion as a first union , and 51.5 % ( 7,236 ) had no union transition .
Participants ’ attitudes on the acceptability of cohabitation without plans to marry ( Table 5 ) were measured at Wave 3 with the following question : ‘ ‘ How much do you agree or disagree with the statement ‘ It is all right for an unmarried couple to live together even if theyaren ’ t interested Table 1 .

114 Journal of Marriage and Family in considering marriage ’ ? ’ ’ The scale ranged from 1 ( strongly agree ) to 5 ( strongly disagree ) .
The responses were reverse coded so that higher responses indicated higher acceptability of cohabitation without plans to marry .
Analytic Approach Following previous work by Lehrer ( 2000 , 2004 ) , Cox proportional hazards models were estimated that treat marriage and cohabitation as competing risks .
That is , we model the hazard of first union transition for both marriage and cohabitation , while statistically accounting for the fact that couples may choose to enter either type of union first .
The analyses used the Efron method for handling ties .
We began by examining the effect of each dimension of religion separately ( Table 2 ) .
Each model in Table 2 also controlled age , race , gen- der , family income , parent ’ s education , and fam- ily structure .
Although our intent in this paper is to examine overall relationships between reli- gious factors and family formation outcomes , we did explore whether there were significant ge- nder differences in ourmodels towarrant separate analyses .
Although a few scattered gender 3 religion interactions existed , the basic relation- ships appeared to be similar .
Following the models estimating each dimension of religion separately , we explore the effect of various com- binations of the three dimensions of religious be- liefs and behavior for time to first union .
Table 3 contains a series of dummy variables represent- ing the 14 combinations of the affiliation , atten- dance , and fervor , as well as the set of control variables .
Using three-way interaction variables produced results similar to those using the 14 combination variables .
The combination vari- ables were ultimately more interpretable and so were favored over presenting the three-way inter- actions .
Finally , among thosewhosefirst transition Table 2 .

116 Journal of Marriage and Family RESULTS Turning first to Table 2 , we find , consistent with other work , that affiliation , attendance , and reli- gious fervor all strongly related to making a tran- sition to either marriage or cohabitation .
As expected , the greater the attendance at worship services at Wave 1 , the higher the hazard of mar- rying at every person-month interval following Wave 1 .
Attendance at worship services also reduced the hazard of cohabitation .
We also found that the stronger the religious fervor , the higher the hazard ratio of marriage and the lower the hazard ratio of cohabiting .
The effects of affiliation were somewhat unex- pected , however .
Not surprisingly , Conservative Protestants were significantly more likely to marry at every person-month interval that fol- lowed Wave 1 .
Contrary to what was expected , however , Catholics were significantly less likely to enter a marriage or a cohabiting union than Conservative Protestants .
This difference is clear in the last column , which displays the percent in marriage or cohabiting for each affiliation group .
Only 7.5 % of Catholics had entered marriage and only 33.6 % were in a cohabiting union by the third interview wave .
In contrast , nearly 14 % of Conservative Protestants had entered marriage , and over 40 % , surprisingly , had transitioned to a cohabiting union as a first union—a proportion that is the highest among all the groups except those of no affiliation .
The analyses in Table 3 help clarify the picture .
This table displays the hazard ratio of transition to marriage or to cohabitation for 13 combinations of the three religion dimensions , relative to Con- servative Protestants who are high attendees and have high fervor .
Focusing first on the three groups of Conservative Protestants , we see that high attendance , high fervor , or both had to be in play for identifying as a Conservative Protes- tant to matter for the transition to marriage .
We also observed distinct differences in the hazard of cohabitation among Conservative Protestants , depending on their attendance and fervor .
Rela- tive to those who frequently attended services and evidenced high fervor , Conservative Protes- tants who were less faithful were significantly more likely to cohabit .
We observe similar pat- terns for Mainline Protestants and Catholics .
Members of these groups whowere high attendees andwho evidenced high fervor depart significantly from their less faithful brethren when it comes to cohabitation .
Interestingly , these devout were sig- nificantly less likely than devout Conservative Protestants to be in any kind of union .
In sum , we found that affiliation , attendance , fervor , and their interplay were all predictive of first union transitions .
Adolescents who identi- fied themselves as Conservative Protestants who reported high attendance and high fervor were significantly more likely than other Conser- vative Protestant adolescents to transition to mar- riage and less likely to transition to cohabitation .
This pattern of within group variability was somewhat evident for Mainline Protestant and Catholic youth .
As predicted , when comparing across religious identities , Conservative Protes- tant youth , especially those who were devout , were by far the most likely to move into marriage as a first union transition in early adulthood .
Sim- ilar across group patterns were also found for cohabitation .
One of the more remarkable findings was that significant fractions ( approximately a third ) of religiously inclined youth entered cohabiting unions .
Among thosewho have cohabitated , does the effect of adolescent religious affiliation on cohabitation experiences vary by level of religiosity ?
Tables 4 and 5 address this question .

Teenage Religiosity and Future Family Formation 117 Table 4 displays the relationship between the combinations of the three dimensions of religion and likelihood that a first cohabitation ended in marriage at different points in the cohabitation .
To fully evaluate whether religion influences cohabitation , we switched the reference group in this analysis to cohabiting individuals who had no religious affiliation in adolescence .
There was some evidence that religious beliefs and behavior in adolescence affect the likelihood that the first cohabitation will end in marriage .
Contrary to our first hypothesis , religious re- spondents were significantly more likely to end their first cohabitation inmarriage relative to indi- viduals with no religious affiliation .
The first three columns of coefficients in Table 4 , for example , show that a fair proportion of the indi- viduals in the different combinations of Conser- vative and Mainline Protestants were more likely to end their first cohabitation in marriage at some point than were individuals with no affil- iation .
Cohabiting Catholic youth , however , showed little inclination ( relative to the nonreli- gious ) to turn their cohabitations into marriages .
Consistent with the second hypothesis , there are some differences among the religious groups .
Both Conservative Protestant and Mainline Prot- estant cohabiting youth show a tendency to turn their cohabitations into marriages .
Table 5 provides additional evidence that ado- lescent religious experiences moderated subse- quent patterns of union formation .
Opinions about the meaning of cohabitation among those whose first transition was into cohabitation were strongly influenced by adolescent religiosity— especially if they were Conservative Protestants who were high attendees and evidenced high fer- vor .
These individuals appear most weakly attached to the position that cohabitation without plans to marry is acceptable .
That religion had been measured a number of years prior to assess- ing attitudes about cohabitation and that these in- dividuals had already been in cohabiting unions before being asked about cohabitation shows the strength of these relationships .
Taken together , the patterns evident across these two tables suggest that religious experience in adolescence matters in subsequent cohabiting experiences .
Furthermore , the fact that those re- spondents who were more devout as adolescents , especially those from Conservative Protestant backgrounds , weremuchmore likely to be under- standing that their cohabitation wasmeant to lead to marriage , strongly suggests that religious ex- periences in adolescence play an important role in the union formation process beyond the nature and timing of the first union .
DISCUSSION Young adults are engaging in union formation practices that are markedly different from those of their parents .
The fundamental change has been the delay in age at marriage and its replace- ment with cohabitation in the early 20s .
Much of the demographic literature has focused on socio- economic predictors of this change .
The purpose of this paper was to explore the extent to which religious factors might be a part of the explana- tion .
We found evidence that religious identity , attendance at worship services , and the impor- tance of religion all mattered for subsequent union formation .
The interaction between these three domains provides additional insight , how- ever .
Consistent with our main hypothesis , we found that adolescents who were Conservative Protestants were distinctive from adolescents of other religious identities in the likelihood of sub- sequently marrying only to the extent that they also were high attendees and evidenced high reli- gious fervor .
The interplay between these three dimensions was also found to be important for understanding the likelihood of transitioning to cohabitation with a few exceptions .
This work clearly shows , as some scholars have recently argued , the multidimensional nature of religion ( Regnerus & Burdette , 2006 ) .
Individuals vary not only in religious identity or affiliation but also in their practice or attendance and in the impor- tance they attach to the religious part of their lives .
Treating any one of these dimensions as a proxy for ‘ ‘ religion , ’ ’ as is commonly done , would appear to misspecify the nature of the rela- tionship between religion and behavioral out- comes .
More important , our findings suggest that the effect of religion is best understood as the interaction between dimensions of faith , prac- tice , and belief .
Contrary to our expectations , we found that devout Conservative Protestants were not the least likely to cohabit .
Catholic youth who were high on attendance and evidenced high fervor were found to be less likely than devout Conser- vativeProtestant youth to subsequentlyenter a co- habiting union .
In addition , Mainline Protestant youth who were devout were not significantly different from Conservative Protestants in the likelihood of cohabiting .
In light of the 118 Journal of Marriage and Family importance Conservative Protestant denomina- tions have placed on sexuality and marriage , this finding comes as a surprise .
Other evidence , how- ever , suggests that this lack of distinctiveness on the part of Conservative Protestants probably should not be unexpected .
Recent work by Regnerus ( 2007 ) , for example , shows that Con- servative Protestant youth are not avoiding sexual behavior .
He finds that Evangelical Protestant adolescents were far from distinctive when it came to rates of nonvirginity , with rates that were higher than both Catholic and Mainline Protes- tant youth .
Perhaps it is a short step from being sexually active as a teenager to cohabiting as a young adult .
Further analyses of these data re- vealed that devout Conservative Protestant ado- lescents are not especially good at holding onto their faith in their young adult years .
Only about 26 % of Conservative Protestant adolescents who were high attendees and reported high fervor re- mained this devout 5 years later .
This fraction is roughly similar to the declines among devout Mainline Protestants ( 29 % ) but significantly high- er than that of devout Catholic adolescents ( 14 % ) ( analyses not shown ) .
Perhaps , as Regnerus ( 2007 ) has argued , we are overestimating the force of denominational identity as a cause of behavior .
Although religious identity is not irrelevant when it comes to family formation behavior—witness the substantial differences by identity when it comes to marriage—the link- age between choices about forming intimate unions and religious identity , behavior , and belief is more complex , subtle , and probably dynamic than as is often portrayed .
Clearly , future work should move beyond using religious identity as a sole indicator of religiosity .
However , under- standing the role of religion in the lives of young adults will require a careful examination of the form and structure of changing religious beliefs and behavior over this developmental period .
The fact that religiously inclined youth are co- habiting raises questions about the nature of these unions .
Our admittedly exploratorywork focused on three competing hypotheses : ( 1 ) Adolescent religious experiences have no effect on subse- quent cohabitation experiences , ( 2 ) any religious identity in adolescence is associated with shorter cohabitation spells , or ( 3 ) devout Conservative Protestants and Catholics are more likely to have shorter cohabitation spells that end in marriage .
We found that cohabiting young adults who were devout Conservative Protestants or Main- line Protestants were more likely to turn their cohabitation into marriage than other youth .
Furthermore , cohabiting youth who were devout Conservative Protestant adolescents were signif- icantly more likely to subscribe to a ‘ ‘ traditional ’ ’ view of cohabitation—that it should be linked to plans to marry .
The evidence here is not over- whelming , but it is consistent with our predic- tions about the ‘ ‘ legacy ’ ’ of adolescent religious beliefs and experiences .
Previous works by Thornton and colleagues ( 1992 , 2007 ) have high- lighted the dynamic interplay between religious beliefs and cohabiting experiences .
To wit , reli- giously inclined youth are less likely to cohabit , but once they cohabit , their religiosity declines .
Our work shows , however , that the power of reli- gion to influence behavior does not disappear completely .
There are some limitations to this study .
The denominational detail in the first Wave of the Add-Health data is quite paltry , making subtle but important distinctions among some denomi- nations difficult .
As a result , we have probably misclassified some Conservative Protestants as Mainline Protestant and vice versa .
Others have pointed out that adolescents who answered ‘ ‘ no religion ’ ’ to the religious affiliation questionwere not asked the subsequent religious questions on service attendance or importance ( Smith , Denton , Faris , & Regnerus , 2002 ) .
The implication is we have underestimated to some degree the religious experiences of adolescents .
We also have not taken into account the dynamic nature of reli- gious behavior and beliefs .
There is good reason to believe that the transition to adulthood is marked not only by considerable experimenta- tion with relationships but also with religious be- liefs and behavior .
As youthmove out from under the eyes of their parents , they are likely to ‘ ‘ fall away ’ ’ from the religious practices and beliefs of their parents .
For some , religion may recede in importance in their lives and have few implica- tions for their union formation behavior .
For others , young adulthood may be time of religious experimentation , of trying different religious identities or belief systems .
There is some evi- dence of a growing interest in being ‘ ‘ spiritual ’ ’ among young adults , which is not necessarily tied to regular church attendance or identificationwith a particular denomination ( Marler & Hardaway , 2002 ) .
The implications of religious experimen- tation on union formation deserve attention .
In conclusion , an often overlooked or unappre- ciated aspect of American adolescents is that religion has a significant presence in their lives .
Teenage Religiosity and Future Family Formation 119 A sizable fraction of teenagers attend religious services , identify themselves asmembers of com- munities of faith , and profess that their religious faith is important in their lives ( Smith , 2005 ) .
Fur- thermore , there is an emerging body of evidence that adolescent religious beliefs and behavior are associated with a variety of important life out- comes for these teens .
Religious beliefs and behavior have been implicated in the physical and emotional health of children and adolescents , educational aspirations and attainment , delin- quency , criminal behavior , and sexual behavior ( see Regnerus , Smith , & Fritsch , 2003 , for a review of this literature ) .
Our findings build on this work .
Religion not only has implications for the immediate lives of adolescents but , as our work here clearly indicates , continues to echo through the course of young adulthood , shaping initial and subsequent family formation choices .
