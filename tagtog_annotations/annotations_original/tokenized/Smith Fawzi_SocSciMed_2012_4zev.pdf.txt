This requires a paradig- matic shift in service provision for those affected by HIV/AIDS in low-resource settings .
Although there is a need for psychosocial support interventions for HIV-affected youth and their caregivers , to date there has been limited empirical evidence on the effectiveness of curriculum-based psychosocial support groups in HIV-affected families in low-income countries .
Therefore , the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and assess the preliminary effectiveness of a psychosocial support group inter- vention for HIV-affected youth and their caregivers in central Haiti .
The study was conducted at six Partners In Health-affiliated sites between February 2006 and September 2008 and included quantitative as well as qualitative methods .
HIV-affected youth ( n ¼ 168 ) and their caregivers ( n ¼ 130 ) completed a baseline structured questionnaire prior to participation in a psychosocial support group intervention .
Ninety-five percent of families completed the intervention and a follow-up questionnaire .
Psychological symptoms , psychosocial functioning , social support , and HIV-related stigma at baseline were compared with outcomes one year later .
Qualitative methods were also used to assess the participants ’ perspectives of the intervention .
Comparing pre- and post-intervention assessment , youth affected by HIV experi- enced decreased psychological symptoms as well as improved psychosocial functioning and social support .
Caregivers ( 95 % HIV-positive ) demonstrated a significant reduction in depressive symptoms , improved social support , and decreased HIV-related stigma .
Although further study is needed to assess effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial , corroborative findings from qualitative data reflected reduced psychological distress , less social isolation and greater hope for the future for families affected by HIV/AIDS following the intervention .
2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Introduction Since the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria ( GFATM ) and the U.S. President ’ s Emer- gency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) in 2002 and 2003 , respectively , the number of individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in the developing world has dramatically increased .
By 2008 , moreepartment of Global Health mith-fawzi @ hms.harvard.edu All rights reserved.than fourmillion people in low- andmiddle-income countries were receiving ART , reflecting a ten-fold increase in five years ( WHO , UNAIDS , & UNICEF , 2009 ) .
Although there is still major progress that needs to bemade in access to ART in the developing world , HIV is no longer a fatal disease but a chronic illness that requires lifelong care and support .
The care should focus on not only attending to the physical consequences of having a chronic illness but the psycho- social needs for people living with HIV and their families .
Children affected by HIV often face considerable uncertainty about their parent ’ s disease , having concerns about the recurrence of significant and life-threatening symptoms or premature death .
Girls in particular may take on the role of caregiver in the house- hold , caring for their ill parent or assuming greater responsibilities M.C .

In addition , chil- dren affected by HIV must often cope with HIV-related stigma in the community ( Reyland , Higgins-D ’ Alessandro , & McMahon , 2002 ) .
Children orphaned by HIV in particular suffer from the tremendous loss of one or both parents in their lives ( Cluver & Gardner , 2007 ) .
These factors are compounded by poverty in resource-limited settings , where economic instability is coupled with uncertainty related to their parent ’ s HIV status ( Cluver , Gardner , & Operario , 2009 ) .
Child abuse and neglect have also been associated with emotional distress among children orphaned by HIV in South Africa ( Cluver & Gardner , 2007 ) .
Related to the broad range of stressors that can impact children affected by HIV in the developing world , these youth may experience psychological distress , such as depression and anxiety , or may be more likely to engage in high risk behavior related to problems with conduct , unprotected sex , and substance abuse ( Brown & Lourie , 2000 ; Cluver , Operario , & Gardner , 2009 ; Nyamukapa et al. , 2010 ) .
Evidence has been accruing in recent years that psychosocial support initiatives for HIV-affected youth have been effective .
Earlier evidence was based on a randomized controlled trial in the U.S. by Rotheram-Borus , Stein , and Lin ( 2001 ) , who implemented and evaluated the Project TALC ( Teens and Adults Learning to Communicate ) intervention in New York City .
After six years of follow-up , youth reported less substance use ; in turn , lower levels of substance use were related to higher future expectations and reduced HIV risk behaviors .
Positive relationships between youth and parents were associated with lower emotional distress and optimistic future expectations ( Rotheram-Borus , Lee , Lin , & Lester , 2004 ; Rotheram-Borus , Stein , & Lester , 2006 ) .
An adapted version of Project TALC has also been evaluated in Thailand using a randomized controlled trial ; the authors observed a positive effect of the intervention on general as well as mental health status among HIV-affected families in this middle-income country setting ( Li et al. , 2010 ) .
In addition , a mentoring program for youth-headed households affected by HIV resulted in a reduction in depressive symptoms among intervention participants in Rwanda ( Brown et al. , 2007 ) .
In a randomized controlled trial in Uganda , a school-based peer group support intervention with youth orphaned by HIV demonstrated reductions in depression , anger , and anxiety ( Kumakech , Cantor- Graae , Maling , & Bajunirwe , 2009 ) .
In contrast , an art therapy intervention program among HIV-affected youth in South Africa did not result in reductions in depression or behavior problems .
However , there appeared to be a protective effect on self-efficacy among bereaved youth .
HIV-related stigma and violence at community and household levels were associated with poor psychological health outcomes in this population ( Mueller , Alie , Jonas , Brown , & Sherr , 2011 ) .
In light of the increasing evidence of effectiveness of psycho- social interventions among youth affected by HIV and contrasting evidence on the potential impact on psychological symptoms , the current study addresses a gap in our understanding of how to reduce psychological distress among the broader population of children affected by HIV in the community .
Given the effectiveness of the TALC intervention in the U.S. and the middle-income country setting of Thailand , the present study examines the use of this curriculum-based intervention in a low-income country setting .
As described below the intervention was adapted for families who have experienced HIV as a chronic conditionwith increasing access of ART in the developing world .
Finally , although family-based interventions have been effective with primary prevention of HIV among youth as well as with HIV-positive youth ( Bhana , McKay , Mellins , Petersen , & Bell , 2010 ) , the present study provides preliminary data on the effectiveness of a family-focusedintervention for the broader community of HIV-affected youth , with a primary focus on the potential impact on psychological distress and psychosocial functioning among HIV-affected youth and their caregivers .
The purpose of this paper is to document the feasibility of implementing such a program in central Haiti and to describe preliminary findings of the effect of this intervention on psychosocial health-related outcomes , including psychological symptoms , HIV-related stigma , social support , and psychosocial functioning , among HIV-affected youth and their parents .
Methods Setting The setting for this project is in central Haiti , where Partners In Health/Zanmi Lasante ( PIH/ZL ) , a non-governmental organization ( NGO ) , is based .
The study was implemented at six PIH/ZL sites providing ART in Haiti ’ s Central Department from February 2006 to September 2008 , five of which are public facilities operated by the Haitian Ministry of Health with support from PIH/ZL .
In 1998 , PIH/ ZL started the HIV Equity Initiative , a program to provide ART free of charge to people in the late stages of AIDS .
This program , one of the first in the developing world , demonstrated the feasibility of providing therapy in such a setting and documented dramatic recoveries among the patients ( Farmer et al. , 2001 ) .
ART was provided for free at PIH/ZL for thosewho required treatment during the study .
Study population and design In an effort to broaden the HIV care at PIH/ZL to address psychosocial issues , including those that impact HIV-affected children , an intervention was introduced to “ high risk ” families at six hospitals and clinics in the Central Department .
Caregiver- child pairs were identified as high risk and included in the inter- vention if at least one of the following criteria was present : 1 ) child ’ s psychological symptoms impacted his/her psychosocial functioning ( child or caregiver report ) ; 2 ) youth affected by HIV/ AIDS was being abused ( child or caregiver report ) ; 3 ) child did not live with mother and father ( child or caregiver report ) ; 4 ) youth affected by HIV/AIDS was being underfed due to his/her ‘ HIV- affected ’ status ( child or caregiver report ) ; 5 ) child reported ‘ having no friends ’ ; and 6 ) caregiver reported 'thoughts of suicide ’ ( for him/herself ) .
These criteria were identified as clinically rele- vant in the local context through review of results by the Haitian psychologist directing psychological services at Zanmi Lasante of a baseline survey administered by trained Haitian social workers ( Smith Fawzi et al. , 2010 ) .
Based on responses from 492 youth and their caregivers in a baseline survey , 210 youth met these criteria .
A detailed description of the recruitment process for the 492 youth at base- line , implemented between February 2006 and January 2007 prior to the intervention has been documented previously ( Smith Fawzi et al. , 2010 ) .
Among these 210 , there were only two refusals to participate ( one caregiver and one youth ) .
However , due to children being out of the catchment area ( primarily for secondary school or living with other family members due to economic reasons ) , 168 of these youth participated in the intervention .
For these 168 youth , 130 caregivers participated ( due to some caregivers having more than one child participating in the intervention ) .
All of the HIV- positive participants ( over 95 % of caregivers and less than 5 % of youth ) that required HIV treatment received ART through clinical services at PIH/ZL .
For this study population , pre- versus post-intervention assessments ( one year apart ) were compared for levels of M.C .
Smith Fawzi et al .

For caregivers , severity of depressive symptoms , level of role functioning , degree of social support , and HIV-related stigma were compared pre- and post-intervention ( see measures section below for detail ) .
Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval was obtained from Harvard Medical School ( Office for Research Subject Protection ) and the Zanmi Lasante ethics committee .
Intervention A psychosocial support group intervention for youth affected by HIV and their caregivers was based on “ Project TALC ” developed by Rotheram-Borus et al .
( 2001 ) .
The intervention relies on social cognitive theory with a focus on enhancing coping skills and increasing social support .
This original curriculum was adapted by a Haitian professional psychologist and social workers for use in central Haiti using focus groups and qualitative interviews .
One adaptation involved the timing of the support groupsdrather than meetings held once a week for six months , the sessions were implemented over a one year period ( held bi-monthly ) .
The groups included 12e15 partici- pants ( or parent-child pairs ) and were facilitated by trained professional social workers .
The organization and format of the sessions were largely retained from the initial TALC project .
The adapted curriculum included the first two of the three phases of the intervention .
Phase 1 consisted of eight group sessions of HIV-positive caregivers , focusing on healthy lifestyles , coping with negative feelings , disclosing their HIV status , along with other challenges of being HIV-positive .
Phase 2 included an initial set of sessions with HIV-positive parents/caregivers and children meeting separately followed by eight sessions of children meeting with their caregivers .
For the caregivers during the first part of Phase 2 , caregivers met for six sessions and discussed ways to support their children , in particular focusing on awareness of children ’ s needs , active listening , and building problem-solving skills .
Children during the first part of Phase 2 met for seven sessions and focused on strategies for reducing emotional stress , developing a broader range of coping strategies , and reducing HIV risk behavior .
During the second part of Phase 2 , children and their caregivers met together for eight sessions and focused on parentechild communication , conflict resolution , as well as prevention of risk behaviors related to early pregnancy , transmission of HIV and other STDs , as well as drug and alcohol abuse .
Given that a large percentage of the caregivers were HIV- positive ( 95 % ) , Phase 3 from the original curriculum was not adapted for the present feasibility study .
Other changes from the original curriculum included providing food at meetings , incorpo- rating Haitian Creole proverbs , as well as revising and removing sections that were not relevant to the local context .
In particular , the sections on preparing for your parent ’ s death and custody planning were omitted in light of access to ART in the study pop- ulation .
Elements that were added to the original curriculum included : greater detail on ‘ taking care of myself , ’ such as the importance of adherence to ART ; additional content on HIV prevention and reduction of risk behaviors among the youth ; and a greater focus on HIV-related stigma and the cultural meanings of HIV within the Haitian context .
Since open discussion and dialog with one ’ s children was a new concept for many parents in this setting , talkingwith one ’ s healthcare provider was used as an ‘ entry point ’ for understanding how to talk with one ’ s children .
The adapted curriculum in Haitian Creole is available by request from the authors.Measures A one-hour structured questionnaire was administered by trained Haitian social workers with HIV-affected youth and their caregivers at baseline and after the intervention ( one year later upon completion of the intervention ) that included assessment of socio-demographic , economic , and psychosocial variables .
The measures were translated into Haitian Creole by the Haitian psychologist directing psychological services at Zanmi Lasante .
Assessments for youth included measures from the peer-reviewed literature and were as follows : 1 ) Goodman ’ s Strengths and Diffi- culties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) to assess level of psychological symp- toms ( Goodman , 2001 ) ; 2 ) extended version of the SDQ to examine degree of psychosocial functioning ; a lower level of psychosocial functioning was defined as the caregiver or child self-report of difficulties related to emotions , concentration , behavior , or getting along with others ( Goodman , 1999 ) ; and 3 ) Provisions of Social Relation ( PSR ) to assess extent of social support from family and friends ( Turner , Frankel , & Levin , 1983 ) .
For caregivers , we used the following measures : 1 ) depression sub-scale from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 ( HSCL-25 ) ( Derogatis , Lipman , Rickels , Uhlenhuth , & Covi , 1974 ) ; 2 ) social support assessment by Gielen , McDonnell , Wu , O ’ Campo , and Faden ( 2001 ) to examine having a confidant , network size , and level of instrumental support ; 3 ) ACTG Short Form-21 ( SF-21 ) to assess role functioning of parents/ caregivers ( i.e .
the extent to which health status keeps them from performing daily activities ) ( Crystal , Fleishman , Hays , Shapiro , & Bozzette , 2000 ) ; and 4 ) HIV-related stigma questionnaire devel- oped by Berger , Ferrans , and Lashley ( 2001 ) .
Although validating these measures in Haitian Creole was outside the scope of the present study , the reliability and validity of these measures have been reported in the original publications ( Berger et al. , 2001 ; Crystal et al. , 2000 ; Derogatis et al. , 1974 ; Gielen et al. , 2001 ; Goodman,1999 , 2001 ; Turner et al. , 1983 ) .
In particular , the measures of psychological symptoms , the SDQ and HSCL-25 have demonstrated validity and reliability in other cultural or resource-limited settings ( Bolton , 2001 ; Du , Kou , & Coghill , 2008 ; Kaaya et al. , 2002 ; Mullick & Goodman , 2001 ) .
Qualitative methods During the intervention , at the conclusion of each support group session , group facilitators held a brief focus group to compile feedback on participants ’ impressions of the session , their sugges- tions for improvement , and the information that they had learned during each session .
This information was compiled by social workers at the end of each phase of the support groups and used to improve the adapted version of the TALC curriculum .
In addition , at the conclusion of the intervention period , individual interviews were held with five caregivers and five youth from each study site to examine the participants ’ overall perspectives of the psychoso- cial support groups .
Although there are limitations with purposive sampling in terms of generalizability , recruitment for these final interviews was based on this sampling method to demonstrate the range of experiences the participants may have had during the intervention .
The analysis was based upon a grounded theory approach ( Glaser & Strauss , 1967 ) in which there was no a priori assumption about themes that would emerge from the data .
Themeswere empirically derived from the data and reflected a high frequency and level of agreement among the participants .
Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics , frequencies , means , ranges and standard deviations were calculated at baseline .

Mixed effect models ( PROC MIXED ) were used to run linear regression for continuous variable outcomes , and logistic regressionwas performed using the GENMOD procedure in SAS to account for the correlation between siblings within families .
An exchangeable varianceecovariance structure was used .
Socio-demographic variables , including age , sex , and socioeconomic status ( SES ) , were controlled for in the multivariate analyses .
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.1 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) .
Results Descriptive statistics Among the youth enrolled in psychosocial support groups in this study , nearly 60 % were female , with older children ( ages 14e17 years ) representing a slightly larger portion of the sample ( 54.8 % ) compared to the younger age group ( 10e13 years ) .
Socio-demographic and economic characteristics indicated that the youth lived in extreme poverty .
Among their parents/care- givers , who were predominantly female ( 76.2 % ) with a mean age of 39.4 years , over 70 % reported a monthly income of less than or equal to $ 50/month .
Most families lived in substandard housing , with 14.6 % living in a house with a thatched roof and less than half ( 42.3 % ) having a latrine .
Food insecurity was significant with over 90 % spending at least half of their income on food and 41.1 % indicating that they spent all of their income on food ( see Tables 1and 2 ) .
Univariate analyses of psychological symptoms While the youth showed very high levels of self-reported psychological symptoms at baseline , univariate analyses comparing the pre- versus post-intervention assessment indi- cated significant changes .
For the overall SDQ score , based on self-report , the mean total score decreased from 14.7 to 11.1 ( p < 0.0001 ) .
The most common symptom reported at baseline among the youth enrolled in groups was headaches/stomach- aches ( 90.5 % ) , which decreased to 45.2 % ( p < 0.0001 ) at follow- up .
The most prevalent self-reported depressive symptoms reflecting social withdrawal among the youth significantlydecreased at follow-up , which included getting along better with adults than with children of own age ( 79.2 % e60.7 % ; p ¼ 0.001 ) and preferring to be alone than with people of own age ( 61.9 % e43.2 % ; p ¼ 0.0007 ) .
However , while nearly 90 % of youth initially reported constant fidgeting or squirming , youth indicated similar levels at follow-up ( 88.3 % ) .
Similarly , 61.3 % of youth reported worrying a lot at baseline and did not demon- strate significant change at follow-up ( 63.9 % ) ( see Fig .
1 ) .
Among the parents/caregivers , the mean total score for the HSCL depression sub-scale decreased from 38.9 to 32.1 ( p < 0.0001 ) .
One of the most prevalent depressive symptoms reported at baseline among caregivers that showed the largest decline at follow-up was feeling everything is an effort ( 74.6 % e43.9 % ; p < 0.0001 ) .
Other prevalent symptoms that showed significant decreases from baseline to follow-up were feeling worthless ( 56.2 % e26.2 % ; p < 0.0001 ) and loneliness ( 70 % e41.5 % ; p < 0.0001 ) ( see Fig .
2 ) .

/ Social Science & Medicine 74 ( 2012 ) 1494e15031498Multivariate analyses After adjusting for demographic variables , linear regression models indicated a significant change in the level of children ’ s psychological symptoms .
When comparing pre- versus post- intervention assessment , we observed a significant change in the level of the children ’ s self-report of psychological symptoms ( b ¼ 3.42 ; SE ¼ 0.54 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
This was also indicated in the caregiver report of their child ’ s psychological symptoms ( b ¼ 3.80 ; SE¼ 0.54 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
Improvement in social support from friends ( b ¼ 1.39 ; SE ¼ 0.67 ; p ¼ 0.04 ) and relatives ( b ¼ 1.10 ; SE ¼ 0.38 ; p¼ 0.005 ) was also indicated in the multivariate analysis .
Similarly , after adjusting for demographic variables , we observed a significant change in the level of the caregivers ’ depressive symptoms , comparing pre- versus post-intervention assessment ( b ¼ 5.61 ; SE ¼ 1.08 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
We also saw a significant change in theFig .

Findings from the multivariate analyses also suggested improvements in psychosocial functioning of youth , comparing baseline to follow-up data .
We observed a 68 % reduction in self- reported impairment in psychosocial functioning , comparing pre- versus post-intervention assessment ( adjusted OR ¼ 0.32 ; 95 % CI : 0.18e0.57 ; p ¼ 0.0001 ) .
This was also evident in the caregiver ’ s report of their child ’ s psychosocial functioning ( adjusted OR¼ 0.20 ; 95 % CI : 0.10e0.34 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
Of the social variables , the chil- dren ’ s report on the number of friends ( ‘ 0 ’ versus ‘ 1 or more ’ ) showed a significant change , comparing pre- versus post- intervention assessment ( adjusted OR ¼ 0.41 ; 95 % CI : 0.23e0.72 ; p ¼ 0.002 ) .

Qualitative findings Complementary qualitative data supported the quantitative data in the potential improvement in quality of life of the HIV- affected youth and their caregivers .
One of the caregivers repor- ted a renewed sense of hope after the intervention : “ My heart was closed , I had asked my body to die .
The support groups gave us courage to live with our illness , and they gave us hope. ” Another caregiver expressed that the groups helped them learn how to cope : “ I used to feel sorry for myself , as if I was at a loss for life , but when I started the groups I started listening to other people and that helpedme a lot .
the groups have helped me to learn how to cope with my problems. ” In addition , HIV-affected youth also described a greater ability to cope with adversity and plan for the future : “ As a teenage girl , I learned how to protect myself and cope with things on my own and continue with school. ” Youth had also expressed interest in pro- tecting themselves from HIV : “ I learned so much in the support groups , such as how I can protect myself from illnesses you can get from having sex and how I can chase bad ideas from my head. ” These qualitative findings corroborate the results from the quantitativedata that demonstrated a reduction in psychological distress and an improvement in psychosocial functioning among the HIV-affected youth and their caregivers comparing pre- and post-intervention assessment .
A second complementary theme that emerged was a greater confidence in coping with HIV-related stigma in the community .
One caregiver stated : “ Before I had a lot of problems because my friends and neighbors talked badly about me .
They called me ‘ SIDAyis ’ ( person with HIV ) .
Now I feel comfortable , I don ’ t let things like this give me problems anymore. ” Another mother reported : “ I felt embarrassed because people said bad things about me , I was very discouraged .
Now I feel as though I have more strength , and I don ’ t think about what others have to say about me. ” Youth also expressed similar feelings : “ Before I started in the support groups , my experience was that I thought everyone was always talking about my mother , but now I am not afraid of anyone and I do not let them bother me. ” Another theme that emerged from both caregiver and youth interviews was greater capacity to communicate with each other and a stronger sense of family cohesion .
One youth mentioned : “ Before I always used to be afraid to speak to my mother about my thoughts , but now I feel more comfortable speaking with her. ” Another stated : “ I really liked the work that we did in the support groups .
I now understand my mother better and I am able to better support her. ” Caregivers expressed similar sentiment : “ We learned how we can Table 4 Generalized linear models of effect of intervention on children ’ s and caregivers ’ psychosocial categorical outcomes .

Before I was in the groups , I spoke with my children as my parents did to me ( in an authoritative way ) .
Now , when I speak with my children they listen to me and I listen to them. ” Another caregiver-reported a transition from using corporal punishment to non-violent approaches to conflict : “ Before the [ support groups ] I used to treat my children very badly ; I would hit them .
and yell at them .
But now , thanks to our good God , the support groups have brought a different feeling to me andmy children are nowmy friends because I treat themmuch better. ” Discussion Although HIV is no longer a death sentence for those who have access to ART , youth affected by HIV and their parents/caregivers face significant challenges in their daily lives as they cope with chronic illness .
The present study demonstrated that a psychosocial support group intervention for HIV-affected youth and their care- givers was feasible in central Haiti , where people often travel for long distances to access healthcare facilities , as reflected by a high retention rate ( 95 % ) .
Factors that promoted retention in the groups included : participant satisfaction with content of support groups ; the coverage of transportation costs ; changing the frequency of the sessions from once per week to twice per month ; and the provision of food at the sessions .
Although other studies have demonstrated the feasibility of psychosocial support programs for HIV-affected youth in developing countries ( Brown et al. , 2007 ; Kumakech et al. , 2009 ) , this study documents the feasibility of implementing a structured curriculum and family-based psychosocial support group intervention for HIV-affected youth and their caregivers in a low-income country .
Preliminary results demonstrated a decreased burden of psychological symptoms among HIV-affected youth .
In particular , significant reductions were observed for somatic and depressive symptoms , such as having headaches or stomachaches or prefer- ring to be alone than with people their own age .
One consideration regarding a reduction in somatic symptoms in youth ( i.e .
headaches or stomachaches ) is the potential for these symptoms to be explained by circumstances other than the intervention , such as food insecurity and/or underlying HIV disease .
However , it is unlikely that this significant reduction in headaches/stomachaches could be completely explained by these factors , since the preva- lence of HIV among the youthwas low ( less than 5 % ) and aside from the food provided at bi-monthly meetings , food aid was not a part of the specific program .
Although some families may have received food assistance or cash transfers through PIH ’ s broader program on social and economic rights , this would have not necessarily changed prior to or during the psychosocial intervention period .
In addition , improvement was observed for ‘ easily distracted , difficulty concentrating. ’ Although therewas a significant reduction in ‘ having many fears , easily scared ’ ( 62.5 % e50.3 % ; p ¼ 0.01 ) , there was no significant reduction in ‘ worrying a lot ’ ( 61.3 % e63.9 % ) .
This persistent anxiety may be due in part to the high levels of food insecurity in this population .
Given that the intervention did not focus on improvement in socioeconomic conditions , it is possible that these symptoms persisted given youths ’ uncertainty about the economic situation in their families ( Weinreb et al. , 2002 ; Whitaker , Phillips , & Orzol , 2006 ) .
A number of depressive symptoms among the caregivers also decreased significantly , including feeling sad , crying easily , and feeling hopeless about the future .
In some cases , symptoms were reduced by more than half , such as feeling worthless ( 56.2 % e 26.2 % ) .
Notably , caregivers had a marked decrease in “ thoughts of ending your life ” from 27.7 % to 8.1 % .
Other studies of group psychosocial support in resource-poor settings have demon- strated improvements in depressive symptoms among adults ( Bolton et al. , 2003 ) as well as youth ( Bolton et al. , 2007 ) .
In particular , Bolton et al .
( 2007 ) observed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms among youth who were survivors of war and displacement in northern Uganda related to participation in group interpersonal psychotherapy .
HIV-related stigma also demonstrated a reduction comparing pre- versus post-intervention assessment among the HIV-positive parents .
This effect may also significantly improve the quality of life for HIV-positive patients .
In a study of HIV-related stigma in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa ( Lesotho , Malawi , South Africa , Swaziland , and Tanzania ) , HIV-positive individuals experienced a significant reduction in overall perceived stigma , workplace stigma , as well as negative self-perception and improvement of self-esteem following a stigma reduction intervention ( Uys et al. , 2009 ) .
Youth showed improvement in psychosocial functioning comparing pre- and post-intervention assessment .
At initial follow- up ( up to two years ) , Rotheram-Borus et al .
( 2001 ) reported a lower level of problem behaviors in youth enrolled in the TALC program , suggesting a higher level of psychosocial functioning .
For example , six years after the intervention Rotheram-Borus et al .
( 2004 ) observed that adolescents who participated in the TALC program were more likely to be employed or in school ( 82.6 % ) compared to those in a control group ( 68.9 % ) .
There are a number of limitations in our study , including the small sample size , particularly for the number of caregivers ( n ¼ 130 ) .
In addition , there was some loss to follow-up during the intervention for the caregivers ( from n ¼ 130 to 123 ) and youth ( from n¼ 168 to 155 ) , although these losses are small in magnitude ( 95 % and 92 % retention , respectively ) .
The study can only offer preliminary results on the effectiveness of the intervention , given that the design is a pre- versus post-test analysis , rather than a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) .
Although performing a RCT was outside the scope of the present study , having a control group would have provided a more definitive evaluation of the inter- vention .
However , it is unlikely that broader improvements in the environment could account for the decrease in psychological symptoms in the study population .
During the time of the inter- vention and follow-up interviews the target area was affected by a severe hurricane season that resulted in significant flooding and concomitant economic vulnerability .
An alternative explanation for the positive findings could be related to access to ART among the HIV-positive members of the groups .
While this is unlikely to have affected the children ’ s responses , since less than 5 % were HIV-positive ; this may have affected our findings among the caregivers , which were over 95 % positive .
However , recruitment occurred among patients who had initiated ART starting as early as 1998 .
Since enrollment was based on patients starting ART between 1998 and 2007 ( a ten year period ) , we anticipate that the effects of initiation of ART may have not entirely explained the positive findings from our study .
Qualitative findings suggesting improvement in psychological well-being also corroborate the quantitative results .
Although there is also limitation in the qualitative findings : since participants were asked at the end of the intervention to provide feedback on the intervention , they may have also been responding to the “ perfor- mative ” demands of the narrative in this context of open-ended discourse , potientially biasing the results toward more positive reflections on the intervention .
This was also demonstrated through feedback from annual surveys among women affected by lymphatic filariasis enrolled in support groups conducted in Haiti .
Women generally provided positive feedback of the intervention ( Coreil & Mayard , 2006 ) , which may be related to the significant adaptation of this intervention to the Haitian setting , as well as the general expectation that participants should frame their responses M.C .
Smith Fawzi et al .
/ Social Science & Medicine 74 ( 2012 ) 1494e15031502in a positive manner .
Constructive feedback from these groups reflected an interest in more practical activities related to crafts , sewing , cooking , and forming a credit association ( Coreil & Mayard , 2006 ) .
Similarly , at the end of the current program , participants voiced a strong interest in employment and microfinancing opportunities .
Future psychosocial support groups should consider addressing the important issue of economic security for families affected by HIV .
Also , given the need for professional social workers for this adapted intervention , for resource-limited settings it is likely that this intervention may need to be linked with a clinical facility or other service-related program that either provides care free of charge or is government sponsored .
However , further study would allow programs to evaluate the effectiveness of groups facilitated by professional social workers versus lay community health workers .
Finally , the present study was limited in examining outcomes post-intervention .
Future studies would benefit from following the group participants for a longer follow-up period after the end of the psychosocial support group meetings to assess the potential for an effect of the intervention in the long-term .
In conclusion , the results demonstrated feasibility and prelimi- nary effectiveness of a psychosocial support group intervention for HIV-affected youth and their caregivers in a low-income country .
In addition , prior to the study therewere limited empirical data on the burden of psychological symptoms among HIV-affected youth and their caregivers in central Haiti .
The findings demonstrated very high rates of symptoms at baseline in this at-risk population .
Through the implementation of a psychosocial support interven- tion , significant reductions in psychological symptoms among youth and depressive symptoms among caregivers were observed .
However , symptoms of anxiety persisted among this youth .
It is possible that pervasive poverty and food insecurity in central Haiti may play a role in the sustained level of anxiety .
In addition , from the multivariate analyses , lower socioeconomic status was associ- ated with a higher level of caregiver depressive symptoms , lower self-report of social support from children ’ s friends , and a lower level of psychosocial functioning among the youth .
This suggests that after controlling for the effect of the intervention , that low socioeconomic status continued to have an impact on psychosocial well-being in this population that bears a high burden of poverty .
Although caregivers reported improved financial social support following the intervention ( i.e .
self-report of having someone whom you can get money from when you need it ) , this was insufficient to offset the highly vulnerable economic situation experienced by the families .
Psychosocial support programs in low-resource contexts may also consider implementing and evaluating an additional program component to address the underlying economic and food insecurity that are common in these settings .
Although future studies should evaluate additional program components of improving economic security , these preliminary findings suggest it is feasible to imple- ment a family-focused , curriculum-based psychosocial support group intervention that may reduce the burden of psychological symptoms and potentially impact psychosocial functioning among HIV-affected families in Haiti and similar resource-limited settings .
