Adams ) .One of the most replicable findings reported in the social psychological literature is the cross-race mem- ory effect .
We argue this effect derives from higher-order interactions among social cues that determine the perceived relevance of a face to an observer .
The current research tested this hypothesis by examining the combined influences of eye gaze direction and race on face memory .
The physical subtlety of eye gaze belies its powerful influence on social perception , and in this case helps specify the relevance of same- versus other-race faces .
We found that only in faces making direct eye contact—not those displaying averted eye gaze—was the cross-race memory effect evident .
Likewise , only in same-race faces did direct relative to averted-gaze enhance face memory .
These findings have implications for our general under- standing of the combinatorial nature of social perception and help clarify the underlying cause of the cross-race memory effect .
2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Introduction The proportionally large size of the human brain is some- times explained as a consequence of social memory require- ments ( e.g. , Dunbar , 1992 , 1995 , 1998 ) .
To keep track of relatively large social networks , people possess an extraordinary ability to remember faces .
By the same token , social memory can not be entirely indiscriminate ; for example , it is more impor- tant to remember the identity of a spouse than a cashier .
Gener- ally , people should better remember those whose actions are likely to be relevant to their own wellbeing ( Maner et al. , 2003 ; Mealey , Daood , & Krage , 1996 ; Oda , 1997 ; Rodin , 1987 ) .
Such a functional account has been invoked to explain several biases in face memory , including those favoring same-race faces ( e.g. , Shriver , Young , Hugenberg , Bernstein , & Lanter , 2008 ) .
In- deed , the cross-race effect ( CRE ) in memory is well chronicled ( cf .
Meissner & Brigham , 2001 ) and is often cited to explain alarming racial inequities in faulty eyewitness testimony ( Inno- cence Project , 2007 ) .
If the CRE stems from the perceived relevance of ingroup faces , non-race facial cues that influence perceived relevance , such as eye contact , should impact the presence or absence of the CRE .
Extending the functional approach in this way assumes that the combined processing of social cues is adaptive , facilitating the detection of self-relevant information signaled by the face ( Adams , Franklin , Stevenson , & Nelson , in press ) .
Facial cues canll rights reserved.signal sexual opportunities ( Rule & Ambady , 2008 ) , shared social categories ( Rule , Ambady , Adams , & Macrae , 2007 ) , potential health of shared offspring ( Maner , Gailliot , & DeWall , 2007 ) , pos- sibility for affiliation ( Mason , Tatkow , & Macrae , 2005 ) , the pres- ence of environmental danger and its source ( Adams & Kleck , 2005 ) , and so on .
Same-race , attractive , angry , and direct-gaze faces can all be considered relevant to the self .
The perceived rel- evance of these cues in combination , however , will vary across individuals .
For example , should we expect an attractive woman with direct gaze to be perceived similarly by both heterosexual men and women ?
Research suggests not ( Mason et al. , 2005 ) .
Similarly , fearful relative to happy faces only seem to elicit nega- tive affect when displayed by someone of the same race as the perceiver ( Weisbuch & Ambady , 2008 ) .
In other words , evalua- tions of faces appear to derive from the integrated meaning of the face and its relational value to the perceiver rather than to particular cues in isolation .
Here we examine the influence on memory of two facial cues that have independently received extensive empirical attention : race and eye gaze .
Cross-race memory Over one hundred studies spanning four decades document a surprisingly replicable out-group homogeneity effect in face mem- ory , the so-called ‘ ‘ cross-race ” effect ( CRE ) .
In a recent meta-ana- lytic review , it was reported that the probability of accurate cross-race identification was less than half that of same-race iden- tification ( Meissner & Brigham , 2001 ) .
An enduring explanation for this effect is that of perceptual expertise , which has been demon- R.B .
Adams et al .
/ Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 46 ( 2010 ) 478–481 479strated in some studies by showing that increased contact with other racial groups is related to decreased CRE ( e.g. , Chiroro & Val- entine , 1995 ; Cross , Cross , & Daly , 1971 ; Feinman & Entwisle , 1976 ; Hancock & Rhodes , 2008 ; Sangrigoli , Pallier , Argenti , Ven- tureyra , & de Schonen , 2005 ; Valentine & Endo , 1992 ) .
In their re- view , however , Meissner and Brigham ( 2001 ) found that the variance accounted for by interpersonal contact in the CRE was vir- tually negligible .
MacLin and Malpass ( 2001 , 2003 ) offered an alternative mechanism linking cross-race memory to social categorization .
They found that identical racially ambiguous faces were differen- tially encoded and remembered based on perceived racial cate- gories determined by the application of race prototypical hairstyles .
More recent studies have revealed comparable effects , whereby participants exhibit diminished memory for own-race faces believed to belong to salient outgroups ( i.e. , University affiliation ; Bernstein , Young , & Hugenberg , 2007 ; sexual orienta- tion ; Rule et al. , 2007 ; class ; Shriver et al. , 2008 ) , and improved memory for out-group faces with increased motivation to indi- viduate these faces ( Hugenberg , Miller , & Claypool , 2007 ; Pauker et al. , 2009 ) .
Such findings point to the powerful role of per- ceived social relevance in the CRE.Eye contact and social perception Of the many facial cues that signal social relevance , none may be more powerful than eye gaze .
Direct-gaze signals an in- creased likelihood for social engagement ( Cary , 1978 ; Ellsworth & Ross , 1975 ; Grumet , 1999 ) , captures attention ( see Frischen , Bayliss , & Tipper , 2007 for review ) , is associated with greater galvanic skin response ( Nichols & Champness , 1971 ) , greater EEG arousal ( Gale , Kingsley , Brookes , & Smith , 1978 ; Gale , Lucas , Nissim , & Harpham , 1972 ; Gale , Spratt , Chapman , & Smallbone , 1975 ) , increased heart rate ( Kleinke & Pohlen , 1971 ) , and in- creased amygdala responsivity in the perceiver ( Kawashima et al. , 1999 ) .
Humans are sensitive to eye gaze from birth ( Far- roni , Csibra , Simion , & Johnson , 2002 ) and cross-species evidence reveals this sensitivity is not unique to humans ( Emery , 2000 ) suggesting that it may be innately prepared .
It is perhaps not surprising then that faces with direct gaze are found more easily in an array ( Von Grünau & Anston , 1995 ) , are more quickly categorized by perceivers ( Macrae , Hood , Milne , Rowe , & Mason , 2002 ) , are more likely to elicit affiliative feelings ( Mason et al. , 2005 ) , and , critically , are better remembered than faces exhibiting averted gaze ( Hood , Macrae , Cole-Davies , & Dias , 2003 ; Mason , Hood , & Macrae , 2004 ; Smith , Hood , & Hector , 2006 ) .
The direct-gaze bias in face memory is apparent in both children and adults , and exerts its influence at both the encoding and retrieval phase of face memory ( Hood et al. , 2003 ) .
In short , perceivers are extremely sensitive to direct gaze as a signal of so- cial relevance.The current work In every study on the CRE that we could locate , stimulus faces were displayed with direct gaze .
Given the functional approach de- tailed here , we expect that only when paired with direct gaze will the CRE be apparent .
In the current study , White participants stud- ied Black and White faces displaying either direct or averted gaze .
If faces are prioritized for memory based on independent influ- ences of social cues , we would expect to find only main effects , the CRE and direct-gaze memory biases previously reported in the literature .
However , if faces are prioritized for memory on the basis of integrated social relevance , as predicted here , such main effects should be qualified by an interaction.Method Participants Sixty-five White undergraduates were recruited in exchange for partial course credit or payment ; six expressed suspicion during debriefing concerning the gaze direction manipulation and thus were dropped from the analysis , leaving a total of 59 participants ( 40 female , 19 male ) .
Facial stimuli Neutral displays of 40 White and 40 Black males were obtained from the NIMSTIM face set ( Tottenham et al. , in press ) , the Mon- treal Set of Facial Displays of Emotion ( Beaupré & Hess , 2005 ) , and a set developed by Chiao and Ambady ( 2001 ) .
Gaze direction was manipulated using Adobe Photoshop , resulting in 80 laterally averted-gaze and 80 direct-gaze images .
Images were grayscale , presented against a gray background , cropped to display head and hair only , and presented in a uniform size of 3.5 4.9 in .
Procedure Participants were seated approximately 24 in .
from a computer monitor and presented with facial images using Superlab—their task was simply to remember each face presented .
Participants were randomly assigned to see direct-gaze ( n = 27 ) or averted-gaze ( n = 32 ) faces .
In the learning phase , participants viewed 20 Black faces and 20 White faces for 3.2-s each .
Each trial began with a 790-ms fixation point that was immediately replaced by a 10-ms blank screen preceding stimulus onset .
Upon completion of the learning phase , participants were given a distracter task ( word search ) for 5 min .
Participants were then presented with the same 40 faces randomly intermixed with 40 new foil faces ( faces used as targets and foils were counterbalanced across participants ) .
Partic- ipants were instructed to indicate as quickly and accurately as pos- sible whether or not they had seen each face before , after which the next stimulus face was presented.Results Data transformation We used a signal detection measure of sensitivity ( d0 ) as our in- dex of recognition performance .
Hits and false alarms from the face recognition task were combined into d0 scores , where d0 is equiva- lent to z-score for hits minus z-score for false-alarms .
In cases where the proportion of hits or false alarms equals zero or one , d0 can not be calculated due to an inability to calculate a z-score for these values .
Thus , we calculated corrected proportions based on the number of signal or noise trials ( n = 40 ; Stanislaw & Todo- rov , 1999 ) .
When the proportion of hits or false alarms equaled zero , the value was recoded as 0.5/n , and when the proportion of hits or false alarms equaled one , the value was recoded as 1 ( 0.5/n ) .
Finally , we calculated a measure of each participant ’ s response bias criterion ( c ; Macmillan & Creelman , 1990 ) .
For the ideal observer c = 0 ; when the observer adopts a more liberal strat- egy c is negative , and when the observer adopts a more conserva- tive strategy c is positive .
Preliminary analyses revealed no reliable main effects or inter- actions as a function of participant gender , so analyses were col- lapsed across this variable .
d0 Scores were then used to compute a 2 ( target race : Black or White ) 2 ( eye-gaze : direct or averted ) mixed-model ANOVA .
From this , a main effect of race was found , thereby replicating Table 1 Mean recognition memory , hit rates , false alarm rates , and criterion scores , for White and Black faces as a function of averted- and direct-gaze .
Averted-gaze Direct-gaze White faces Black faces White faces Black faces d0 ( recognition memory ) 1.27 ( .561 ) 1.11 ( .479 ) 1.7 ( .62 ) 1.22 ( .642 ) Hit rate 0.638 ( .151 ) 0.698 ( .150 ) 0.651 ( .152 ) 0.648 ( .179 ) False alarm rate 0.213 ( .112 ) 0.309 ( .126 ) 0.136 ( .131 ) 0.246 ( .145 ) c ( response bias criterion ) 0.246 ( .360 ) 0.02 ( .353 ) 0.421 ( .453 ) 0.160 ( .448 ) Note : Larger d0 indicates greater recognition performance .
c < 0 indicates a more liberal criterion , c > 0 indicates a more conservative criterion ( Macmillan and Creelman , 1990 ) .

Adams et al .
/ Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 46 ( 2010 ) 478–481the CRE : same-race faces were better remembered than other-race faces , F ( 1 , 57 ) = 18.69 , p < .0001 , partial g2 = .25 .
A main effect of gaze was also found , thereby replicating the previously reported gaze effect : direct-gaze faces were better remembered than averted , F ( 1 , 57 ) = 4.33 , p = .042 , partial g2 = .07 .
Critically , these ef- fects were qualified by the interaction of interest , F ( 1 , 57 ) = 4.79 , p = .033 , partial g2 = .08 .
In order to examine the nature of this target race by eye-gaze interaction more closely , direct contrasts were computed .
These revealed that direct-gaze/own-race faces were remembered signif- icantly better than all other conditions including : ( 1 ) direct-gaze/ other-race faces , t ( 26 ) = 4.39 , p < .0002 , d = 1.72 ; ( 2 ) averted- gaze/own-race faces , t ( 57 ) = 2.81 , p < .01 , d = .74 ; and ( 3 ) averted- gaze/other-race faces , t ( 57 ) = 4.12 , p < 0.0005 , d = 1.09 .
No other comparisons for recognition accuracy yielded significant results .
In addition , main effects were found for both false alarm rates and response bias ( c ) including for target race ( Fs ( 1 , 57 ) > 19.35 , ps < .0001 , partial g2s > .25 ) and eye-gaze ( Fs ( 1 , 57 ) > 4.20 , ps < .05 , partial g2s > .06 ) , such that participants displayed more false alarms and more liberal criterions ( tended to say yes more ) to both averted- versus direct-gaze faces and to Black versus White faces ( see Table 1 for d0 , hits , false alarms , and c means ) .Discussion As previously documented , the current study revealed main ef- fects of both gaze and race on recognition accuracy in face mem- ory .
Critically , these effects were qualified by the predicted interactive influence of race and gaze .
Same-race faces were better remembered than other-race faces , but only when exhibiting direct eye gaze .
Likewise , direct-gaze faces were better remembered than averted , but only when displayed on same-race faces .
Thus , low-le- vel perceptual expertise in face processing and exogenously med- iated visual attention ( i.e. , direct-gaze attention capture ; Senju & Hasagewa , 2005 , and averted-gaze attention shift ; Driver et al. , 1999 ) are insufficient to explain these results .
The current findings suggest that the meaning of facial cues are integrated or bound with respect to their adaptive relevance .
This insight is consistent with the ecological approach to visual and social perception ( Gib- son , 1979 ; see also Zebrowitz , 2006 ) .
It is also important to note that we utilized photographs of faces in this study , which can introduce qualities such as lighting and perspective factors that do not directly represent live faces and can contribute to picture-matching strategies in memory .
Although picture-matching can influence memory independent of face processing per se , such influences are necessarily unrelated to those of social cues signaled by the face , as examined here .
Moreover , neither picture presentation ( pictures versus live faces ) nor similarity of pictures at learning versus test phase ( identical versus different ) has been previously found to moderate cross-race discrimination accuracy ( Meissner & Brigham , 2001 ) .
Given that we presented the same pictures during learning and testing , how- ever , does limit the conclusions we can draw regarding the influ-ence of social cues at encoding versus retrieval .
Our hypotheses , however , were not contingent on stages of processing , and thus such important questions await future research efforts .
Two previous studies examined the combined influences of race and gaze ( Richeson , Todd , Trawalter , & Baird , 2008 ; Trawalter , Todd , Baird , & Richeson , 2008 ) .
These studies found that for White participants , Black relative to White faces generated more amyg- dala responsivity and selectively captured attention to a greater degree .
Like the current study , however , this effect was only evi- dent for faces coupled with direct relative to averted gaze .
They ar- gued that direct gaze compounded the threatening approach- oriented signal value of Black faces , and that the perceived threat was more clearly directed at the observer ( see also Adams & Kleck , 2003 , 2005 for similar rationale ) —this explanation is quite consis- tent with the current functional approach outlined here .
Also re- lated is research demonstrating that White participants ’ memory for Black versus White faces increases when coupled with angry versus neutral displays , an effect that was argued to be due as well to the functional value of perceiving compound threat cues ( Acker- man et al. , 2006 ; but see Corneille , Hugenberg , & Potter , 2007 ) .
Perhaps the most striking finding of the current work is that such a subtle cue—irises shifted only millimeters to the left or right—was enough to eliminate the otherwise robust and highly replicable CRE in memory .
It is plausible that early categorization of a face gates the perceptual processes devoted to it , thereby resulting in direct-gaze facilitating an exclusive process of individ- uation for own-race faces .
This finding is consistent with recent work on race perception ( e.g. , MacLin & MacLin , in press ) suggest- ing that early racial categorization of faces influences not just the level of processing but the type of processing engaged .
Also consis- tent with this view is evidence that activation in the fusiform gyrus – critical for face processing – is not only greater when viewing di- rect versus averted-gaze faces , but also differentially coupled with activation in other brain regions ( George , Driver , & Dolan , 2001 ) .
When viewing direct-gaze faces , fusiform activation was found to be correlated with amygdala responses , reflecting stimulus sal- ience ; however , when viewing averted-gaze faces , it was corre- lated with activity in the intraparietal sulcus , essential for gaze following .
Future research efforts are obviously necessary to understand the exact nature of these mechanisms .
It is clear from the current work , however , that only by examining such cues in combination will the cross-race and direct-gaze memory biases be fully understood .
As such , the current work provides a new con- text for evaluating previously reported cross-race and direct-gaze memory biases , and offers a framework for future investigation that will likely illuminate more general processes by which per- ceivers bind adaptive meaning across facial cues .
