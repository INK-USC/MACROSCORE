Fifty-eight bilinguals within the single-language context ( SLC ) and 75 bilinguals within the dual-language context ( DLC ) were compared in a typical task-switching paradigm .
Given that DLC bilinguals switch between languages within the same context , while SLC bilinguals speak only one language in one environment and therefore rarely switch languages , we hypothesized that the two groups ’ stark difference in their interactional con- texts of conversational exchanges would lead to differences in switch costs .
As predicted , DLC bilinguals showed smaller switch costs than SLC bilinguals .
Our diffusion-model analyses suggest that DLC bilin- guals ’ benefits in switch costs are more likely driven by task-set reconfiguration than by proactive inter- ference .
Our findings underscore the modulating role of the interactional context of conversational exchanges in task switching .

Introduction Bilinguals are unique in their practice of flexible language- switching between two or more languages .
Given that the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie bilinguals ’ language switching and task switching are partially shared ( e.g. , Abutalebi & Green , 2007 ; Weissberger , Gollan , Bondi , Clark , & Wierenga , 2015 ) , the question arises as to whether bilinguals ’ qualitatively different language-switching practices affect their task-switching ability to switch back and forth between multiple tasks , operations , and mental sets ( Monsell , 2003 ) .
Bilinguals ’ task-switching abilities have been studied by using a typical task-switching paradigm that considers both switch costs and mixing costs , which have been found to implicate different control mechanisms ( Braver , Reynolds , & Donaldson , 2003 ) .
Specifically , switch costs—i.e. , the actual cost of switching between different task sets—arise from local control mechanisms that involve transient task-set reconfiguration ( Rogers & Monsell , 1995 ) and proactive interference from previous task sets ( Wylie & Allport , 2000 ) .
Mixing costs—i.e. , the cost of monitoring andcoordinating multiple streams of incoming information—entail activation of global and sustained control mechanisms ( Rubin & Meiran , 2005 ) .
Because of the conceptual overlap between bilinguals ’ language- and task switching , it has been suggested that bilingualism attenuates task-switching costs .
In recent years , however , the question of whether bilingualism confers benefits on task switching has been debated , and findings have been inconsistent .
For instance , some studies have found bilingual advantages in switch costs ( Prior & MacWhinney , 2010 ) , while others report bilingual advantages in mixing costs ( Gold , Kim , Johnson , Kryscio , & Smith , 2013 ; Wiseheart , Viswanathan , & Bialystok , 2014 ) .
Moreover , recent attempts to replicate these effects found neither switch- nor mixing-cost advantages , even among bilinguals who frequently switch languages ( Hernández , Martin , Barcelo , & Costa , 2013 ; Paap & Greenberg , 2013 ; Paap & Sawi , 2014 ) .
These inconsistencies highlight the need for a more rigorous , theory-driven approach .
The adaptive control hypothesis ( Green & Abutalebi , 2013 ) pos- tulates that bilinguals ’ interactional contexts of conversational exchanges implicate different demands on bilinguals ’ language control and adaptively alter their cognitive-control abilities .
Specifically , ( a ) the dual-language context ( DLC ) —in which bilinguals use two languages within the same context ( e.g. , both L1 and L2 at home and work ) —requires a more taxing level of Fig .

Diffusion process underlying the diffusion model .
The model assumes that decisions are based on the accumulation of information over time until a response boundary is reached and a motor response elicited ( Ratcliff , 1978 ) .
By using both response latency and accuracy , the diffusion model decomposes the decision process into several meaningful parameters .
Specifically , drift rate ( v ) quantifies the speed of information uptake and stimulus difficulty , which map onto participants ’ processing ability ; larger values represent fast and accurate responses .
The drift rate is the mean slope of the counter , and differences in drift rate between switch trials and non-switch trials are thought to reflect proactive interference in task switching .
Boundary separation ( a ) quantifies the speed–accuracy trade-off , with a larger value indicating a conservative decision characterized by slow reaction time and high accuracy .
Starting point ( zr ) quantifies a priori bias in decision thresholds , ranging from 0 to 1 , with a value of 0.5 indicating the absence of a priori decisional bias .
The decision process begins at the starting point , where information is accumulated until a response boundary is reached .
Lastly , non-decision time ( t0 ) quantifies the duration of all non-decisional processes , such as encoding and response execution .
Non-decision processes occur before and after the actual decision phase and are thought to reflect the reconfiguration processes in task switching ( see Voss et al. , 2013 , for a practical introduction to diffusion models ; see Schmitz & Voss , 2012 , for their use in a task-switching paradigm ) .

Yang / Cognition 150 ( 2016 ) 10–19 11language control , and therefore should better facilitate task- switching performance than either ( b ) the single-language context ( SLC ) —in which bilinguals speak only one language in one environ- ment and therefore rarely switch languages ( e.g. , L1 at home and L2 at work ) —or ( c ) the dense code-switching context ( i.e. , intrasen- tential code-switching ) —in which bilinguals routinely mix linguis- tic elements ( e.g. , words ) of two languages within a single utterance .
To test those theoretical predictions , we operationalized bilin- guals ’ interactional contexts according to two primary perspectives that closely reflect the complexity of bilingualism in Singapore .
First , we assume that DLC bilingualism is the bipolar opposite of SLC bilingualism , both of which fall along a bipolar continuum .
Namely , each point on the continuum is influenced by the extent of both DLC and SLC bilingualism : If one ’ s DLC bilingualism is high , his or her SLC bilingualism is likely low .
Second , because of the prevalence of English-based creole in Singapore,1 both DLC and SLC bilinguals likely perform intrasentential code-switching , which signifies the dense code-switching context ; in particular , DLC more likely implicates the dense code-switching context .
Therefore , DLC or SLC are not clearly separable from the dense code-switching con- text , and dividing bilinguals into three groups according to different interactional contexts is not straightforward .
Because of these constraints , we examined the impact of bilin- guals ’ interactional contexts as follows .
First , we examined whether DLC and SLC differ in switch costs .
Consistent with the adaptive control hypothesis , we expected that DLC bilinguals would have smaller switch costs than SLC bilinguals , because DLC bilinguals ’ complex language-set reconfiguration should be conducive to transient task-set reconfiguration , which is regarded as the primary mechanism of switch costs .
Second , given that both DLC and SLC are related to the dense code-switching context , we used regression analysis to examine its relative importance to DLC and SLC in predicting switch costs , while controlling for important individual factors.1 Singapore bilinguals speak an English-based creole language , ‘ ‘ Singlish , ” which has been substantially influenced by loan words from Mandarin dialects , Malay , and Tamil ( Wong , 2004 ) .
Therefore , Singlish involves frequent practice of intrasententia code-switching in everyday conversation .
For example , bilinguals in Singapore may sometimes insert a Malay word , makan , into a single English utterance—e.g. , ‘ ‘ Let ’ s find some place to makan [ eat ] . ” 2 Five participants were excluded from the analysis for the following reasons .
Two had extremely high mixing costs ( 5.6 and 4.8 SD from the overall mean of mixing costs ) ; two violated the model fit when running the diffusion-model analyses ( p = .005 and .013 ) ; and one had substantial negative switch costs ( 190 ms ) in non- decision parameters ( t ) .l Our other important goal was to elucidate the cognitive pro- cessing that underlies switch costs in particular .
Although the multiple-component model of task switching proposes that switch costs arise from task-set reconfiguration and proactive interference ( Mayr & Kliegl , 2003 ; Ruthruff , Remington , & Johnston , 2001 ) , the literature on bilingualism has not clearly identified the specific cognitive components linked to bilingual advantages in task switching .
Therefore , we employed the stochastic diffusion model ( Ratcliff , 1978 ) to decompose switch costs into specific cognitive components .
Using this model in the task-switching paradigm , recent studies have reported that differences in the non-decision time parameter ( t0 ) between switch trials and non-switch trials are related to the early phase of a task switch , which involves task-reconfiguration processes , whereas differences in drift rate ( v ) between switch trials and non-switch trials are associated with the later stage of task switching , which entails proactive interfer- ence ( Mansfield , Karayanidis , Jamadar , Heathcote , & Forstmann , 2011 ; Schmitz & Voss , 2012 , 2014 ) .
This model , therefore , allows us to examine whether the locus of bilingual advantages in switch costs is pertinent to either task-set reconfiguration or proactive interference ( see Fig .

Participants One hundred and thirty-three bilinguals ( female = 89 ) from a university in Singapore participated for extra course credit or S $ 13.2 In addition to English , bilingual participants spoke a variety of languages , which includes Chinese ( n = 110 ) , Malay ( n = 8 ) , Indonesian ( n = 1 ) , Hindi ( n = 3 ) , Tamil ( n = 3 ) , Malayalam ( n = 1 ) , Vietnamese ( n = 5 ) , Korean ( n = 2 ) .
Using a 5-point Likert scale ( 1 = never , 5 = always ) , participants reported on two items regarding the extent to which they used two languages within the same con- text ( DLC bilingualism ) and in different contexts ( SLC bilingualism ; 0 Table 1 Characteristics of dual-language context ( DLC ) and single-language context ( SLC ) bilinguals .

Scores on these two items were summed to produce the composite score for DLC bilin- gualism ( M = 5.80 ; SD = 1.69 ) , which takes SLC bilingualism into con- sideration .
Using the mean split of this , participants were divided into groups of DLC ( n = 75 ; MP 6 ) and SLC bilinguals ( n = 58 ; M < 6 ) .
Participants ’ demographic and language characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .
2.2 .
Color–shape switching task Similar to the typical color–shape switching task used in previ- ous studies ( e.g. , Paap & Greenberg , 2013 ) , participants were instructed to respond to either the color ( red or green ) or shape ( circle or triangle ) of a target , with respect to the given cue ( the color gradient or a row of small black shapes ) .
For the diffusion- model analysis , we made two modifications .
First , we employed overlapping response mapping , which required participants topress the left key for both ‘ ‘ green ” and ‘ ‘ triangle ” and the right key for both ‘ ‘ red ” and ‘ ‘ circle ” ( counterbalanced across partici- pants ) .
Second , we employed 100 % stimulus–response incompati- ble trials for two bivalent target stimuli ( green circle and red triangle ) ; i.e. , no stimulus matched a response on both color and shape .
Participants began with one practice block ( 30 trials ) , followed by two pure blocks ( color and shape , counterbalanced across par- ticipants ) , and then four mixed blocks that included an equal num- ber of task-switch and task-repeat trials .
Each main block consisted of 50 randomized trials with a maximum of four consecutive trials of the same task .
For each trial , a fixation cross appeared for 350 ms , followed by a blank screen ( 150 ms ) .
The cue then appeared 2.8 above the fixation cross ( 250 ms ) , followed by the target .
Both the cue and the target remained on the screen until the participant responded , which was followed by an inter-trial interval ( 850 ms ) .
Participants received feedback ( a beep ) for incorrect responses .

Background measures A subtest of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test ( KBIT-2 ; Kaufman & Kaufman , 2004 ) was used to measure nonverbal intel- ligence .
General verbal ability was assessed by the Shipley Vocab- ulary Test ( Shipley , 1986 ) , and language background by a questionnaire adapted from the Language Experience and Profi- ciency Questionnaire ( Marian , Blumenfeld , & Kaushanskaya , 2007 ) and the Language History Questionnaire ( Li , Zhang , Tsai , & Puls , 2014 ) .3 .
Results 3.1 .
Background measures DLC and SLC bilinguals did not differ in nonverbal intelligence , general vocabulary , demographic profiles , or various language- background variables ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
The two groups differed sig- nificantly , however , in variables related to DLC and SLC bilingual- ism , intrasentential and intersentential code-switching , all ps < .01 ( Table 3 ) .
3.2 .
Task-switching costs Overall accuracy rates were high for both pure and mixed blocks and did not differentiate DLC and SLC bilinguals , all ts < 1 ( Table 4 ) .
Preliminary analyses of accuracy showed that bilinguals ’ interactional contexts ( DLC , SLC ) moderated neither switch costs nor mixing costs , Fs < 1 .
Therefore , no other analyses were per- formed for accuracy .
Response time ( RT ) that were either below 200 ms or above 5000 ms or 2.5 SD above or below each partici- pant ’ s mean were excluded separately for pure blocks and mixed-task blocks .
Separate analyses were performed for switch costs and mixing costs .
Regarding switch costs , a repeated-measures mixed-factor ANOVA was performed with Interactional Context ( DLC vs. SLC ) as a between-participant factor and Switching ( switch vs. repeat ) as a within-participant factor .
We found significant main effects of Interactional Context , F ( 1,131 ) = 4.63 , p = .033 , gp2 = .034 , and Switching , F ( 1,131 ) = 506.94 , p < .001 , gp2 = .795 .
The interaction between Interactional Context and Switching was also significant , F ( 1,131 ) = 8.94 , p = .003 , gp2 = .064 , suggesting that bilinguals ’ interactional contexts modulate switch costs .
Follow-up analyses showed that DLC bilinguals were significantly faster than SLC bilin- guals in switch trials , F ( 1,131 ) = 6.55 , p = .012 , gp2 = .048 , but not in repeat trials , p = .155 .

A. Hartanto , H. Yang / Cognition 150 ( 2016 ) 10–19 13Regarding mixing costs , a similar repeated-measures mixed fac- tor ANOVA was performed with Interactional Context and Mixing ( pure vs. repeat ) .
We found a significant main effect of Mixing , F ( 1,131 ) = 660.36 , p < .001 , gp2 = .834 , but neither the main effect of Interactional Context ( p = .151 ) nor its interaction with Mixing ( p = .269 ) was significant .
Together , our results demonstrate that DLC bilingualism confers benefits on switch costs , but not on mix- ing costs .
3.3 .
Diffusion-model analysis of switch costs We performed diffusion-model analysis by focusing on switch and repeat trials in the mixed blocks .
In our analysis , only drift rate ( v ) and non-decision time ( t0 ) were allowed to vary freely over task-switch and task-repeat trials .
Boundary separation ( a ) and starting point ( zr ) were held constant across trials to increase the model ’ s parsimony and fit ( Voss , Nagler , & Lerche , 2013 ) .
Similarly , variability parameters and response-execution differences ( d ) werefixed to zero , except for the inter-trial variability of non-decision components ( st0 ) , which were held constant across trials ( Voss et al. , 2013 ) .
Parameters were estimated using Fast-dm for each participant , with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov ( KS ) statistic for opti- mization of parameters ( Voss & Voss , 2007 , 2008 ) .
Overall , the KS statistic did not reveal any suspicious fit ( ps > .20 ) , and parameter estimates of the diffusion model fit the empirical RT distributions closely ( Appendix C ) .
Drift rate and non-decision time were submitted to repeated- measures mixed-factor ANOVAs with Interactional Context and Switching ( switch vs. repeat ) .
For non-decision time , we found a significant main effect of Switching , F ( 1,131 ) = 373.62 , p < .001 , gp2 = .74 , and an interaction effect between Interactional Context and Switching , F ( 1,131 ) = 4.61 , p = .034 , gp2 = .034 .
How- ever , for drift rate , we found only a significant main effect of Switching , F ( 1,131 ) = 159.50 , p < .001 , gp2 = .427 .
Neither the effect of Interactional Context nor its interaction with Switching was significant , Fs < 1 .
These results did not change when we excluded either 23 bilinguals who speak English and a lan- guage ( s ) other than Chinese or 5 participants whose IQ scores were missing ; in either case , interactional context significantly modulated switch costs in RT and non-decision time , ps < .05 .
Together , these results suggest that the source of DLC bilinguals ’ advantages in switch costs are likely driven by their better abil- ity to deal with task-set reconfiguration rather than proactive interference ( Table 5 ) .
For boundary separation , we found signif- icant group differences t ( 131 ) = 2.06 , p = .041 , suggesting SLC bilinguals ’ conservative ( slower ) responses than DLC bilinguals .
However , given that zero-order correlations of boundary separa- tion with the composite score of DLC ( r = .132 , p = .129 ) and the index of SLC bilingualism ( r = .07 , p = .455 ) were not signifi- cant , this suggests that group differences in boundary separation could be a statistical artifact of the median-split procedure ( MacCallum , Zhang , Preacher , & Rucker , 2002 ) .
Lastly , for starting point , the groups did not differ , t ( 131 ) = 1.29 , p = .199 , suggesting that the groups were similar in terms of a priori decision bias.3.4 .
Regression analyses on switch costs Four hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to assess the importance of various predictors of switch costs ( in both RT and non-decision time ) .
In all models , paternal education , verbal ability , and nonverbal intelligence were controlled in Step 1 ( see Table 6 ) .
In Step 2 , the index of intrasentential code-switching— i.e. , the proxy measure of a dense code-switching context—was added simultaneously with an additional predictor for each regres- sion model : the composite score of DLC bilingualism ( Model 1 ) , the index of SLC bilingualism ( Model 2 ) , the index of intersentential code-switching ( Model 3 ) , and the frequency of intersentential code-switching ( Model 4 ) .
Two primary results were noteworthy .
First , we found that the composite score of DLC bilingualism and the index of SLC bilingual- ism—variables that represent the continuum of single- and dual-language contexts—emerged as significant predictors of switch costs , while the index and frequency of intersentential code-switching were only moderately significant .
Second , unlike intersentential code-switching and DLC bilingualism , which negatively predicted switch costs , intrasentential code-switching positively predicted ( i.e. , exacerbated ) switch costs.4 .
Discussion Our study demonstrates that bilinguals ’ DLC facilitates switch costs but not mixing costs .
Furthermore , our diffusion-model anal- Table 5 Diffusion model parameter estimates .

14 A. Hartanto , H. Yang / Cognition 150 ( 2016 ) 10–19ysis demonstrates that DLC bilinguals ’ advantages in switch costs are primarily driven by group differences in non-decision time— which is related to task-set reconfiguration—rather than drift rate , which is related to proactive interference .
Our findings highlight the importance of bilinguals ’ interactional contexts in examining bilingual advantages in task switching .
Our results elucidate potential causes of previous studies ’ inconsistencies in three respects .
First , although the frequency- related values of intersentential code-switching reflect important aspects of the DLC context , they may be less reliable predictors of switch costs than the composite score of DLC bilingualism and index of SLC bilingualism .
This is because the mere frequency of intersentential code-switching may not sufficiently capture the complex nature of the control processes involved in language switching .
For example , the cognitive demand for intersentential code-switching can be moderated by who initiates the discourse .
In general , self-initiated intersentential code-switching seems less taxing than other-initiated intersentential code-switching , because the former permits sufficient preparation time to reconfigure language sets , while the latter is triggered unexpectedly and occurs rapidly , and therefore imposes greater demands on language-set reconfiguration and proactive inhibition .
Accordingly , the mere frequency of language switching may not be an adequate proxy measure of bilinguals ’ interactional context.Table 6 Multiple regression analyses on switch costs with interactional contexts as predictors .

** p < .01.Second , our finding that intrasentential and intersentential code-switching predict switch costs in the opposite direction underscores the importance of the typology of code-switching .
Intrasentential code-switching is voluntary and implicates oppor- tunistic planning—i.e. , using whatever comes most readily to hand ( e.g. , Gollan & Ferreira , 2009 ; Green & Abutalebi , 2013 ) .
Therefore , intrasentential code-switching facilitates language production by lightening the cognitive load of language-set reconfiguration ( Gollan , Kleinman , & Wierenga , 2014 ) .
This contrasts with inter- sentential code-switching , which requires more taxing language control that leads , in turn , to adaptive cognitive control .
Hence , a greater reliance on intrasentential code-switching likely mitigates one ’ s ability to exercise task-set reconfiguration and eventually impairs switch costs .
Our finding corroborates previous studies ( e.g. , Festman , Rodriguez-Fornells , & Münte , 2010 ; Rodriguez- Fornells , Krämer , Lorenzo-Seva , Festman , & Münte , 2012 ) , in that not only unconscious but also conscious self-directed code- switching is associated with reduced executive functioning .
Fur- ther investigation is warranted to examine different types of code-switching ( Green & Wei , 2014 ) , which appears to demand a different extent of control processing .
Together , our findings high- lights potential factors that can account for the mixed findings pre- viously reported .
Lastly , previous studies ’ inconsistent results can be attributed in part to methodological differences .
Given that our color–shape switching task included two modifications—i.e. , overlapping response mapping and 100 % stimulus–response incompatibility— it is noteworthy that these modifications may have enhanced the task ’ s sensitivity to group differences in task-set reconfiguration .
Previous studies have suggested that overlapping response map- ping places greater demand on task-set reconfiguration than non-overlapping response mapping ( Meiran , 2000 , 2008 ) , because switch trials in overlapping response mapping require participants to recode the response key to match different aspects of the stimulus ( for a review , see Kiesel et al. , 2010 ) .
Moreover , unlike previous studies that employed 50 % incompatible trials ( e.g. , Gold et al. , 2013 ) , using 100 % incompatible trials requires response recoding on all switch trials , which may further impose greater demand on task-set reconfiguration .

a Overlapping response mapping occurs when each response key is assigned to two responses ( e.g. , both ‘ ‘ green ” and ‘ ‘ triangle ” ) from the color vs. shape tasks , while non-overlapping response mapping occurs when each response key is assigned to only one response ( e.g. , green ) .
b RC ( response compatibility ) indicates the proportion of trials where the stimulus and response are compatible in the color–shape switching task .
For instance , on compatible trials , the bivalent stimulus ( e.g. , ‘ ‘ green triangle ” ) correctly matches the response associated with ‘ ‘ green ” and ‘ ‘ triangle. ” A .H artanto , H .Yang /Cognition 150 ( 2016 ) 10– 19 15 16 A. Hartanto , H. Yang / Cognition 150 ( 2016 ) 10–19Although we found that DLC and SLC bilinguals do not differ in mixing costs , one might argue that DLC bilinguals should have greater advantages in mixing costs because they experi- ence greater demands on goal maintenance and conflict moni- toring .
We argue , however , that given the high prevalence of bilingualism in Singapore ( Dixon , 2005 ) , our SLC bilinguals may still—although to a relatively lesser degree—engage moni- toring of their language environment , and therefore both SLC and DLC bilinguals can have comparable mixing costs .
For instance , SLC bilinguals who speak only Chinese at home must still monitor sudden conversational intrusions from a new interlocutor—e.g. , conversing by phone in the caller ’ s language .
Furthermore , given mixing costs ’ greater malleability and sensi- tivity to training effects than switch costs ( e.g. , Prior & Gollan , 2013 ; Strobach , Liepelt , Schubert , & Kiesel , 2011 ) , it is likely that bilingualism readily confers benefits on mixing costs to a relatively comparable degree for both DLC and SLC bilinguals .
On procedural grounds , the absence of group differences in mixing costs is less likely to be attributed to our administration of pure blocks prior to mixed blocks .
We did not find any systematic practice effects between the first two pure blocks .
Although only the first mixed block showed relatively faster RTs than other mixed blocks , RTs were quickly stabilized across subsequent mixed blocks .
Additionally , when we recalculated mixing costs by using only the second pure block as the baseline to account for any potential practice effect , we still obtained the same results .
In conclusion , using a theoretical framework , our study closes a gap in the literature regarding the critical importance of including bilinguals ’ interactional contexts and different types of language switching when studying bilingual advantages in task switching .

Appendix A A.1 .
Index of intersentential code-switching Intersentential code-switching is the language switching that occurs between sentences .
The index of intersentential code- switching yields an overall estimate of bilinguals ’ intersentential code-switching , aggregated across four different situations ( home , school , work , and others ) .
Participants reported the percentage of time they spent at home , school , work , and in other situations as well as the frequency of intersentential code-switching ( 1 = never , 5 = always ) in each situation .
The following formula was used to derive the index for intersentential code-switching : X4 i¼1 pi si 100 where pi is the amount of time bilinguals spent across four different situations , and si is the value of intersentential code-switching within each situation.A.2 .
Index of intrasentential code-switching Intrasentential code-switching is the language switching that occurs within a sentence .
The index of intrasentential code- switching yields an overall estimate of bilinguals ’ intrasentential code-switching , aggregated across four different situations ( home , school , work , and others ) .
Participants reported the per- centage of time they spent at home , school , work , and in other situations as well as the frequency of intrasentential code- switching ( 1 = never , 5 = always ) in each situation .
The following formula was used to derive the index for intrasentential code- switching : X4 i¼1 pi mi 100 where pi is the amount of time spent in each context , and mi is the frequency of intrasentential code-switching within a particular situation .
Appendix B B.1 .
Composite score of dual-language context bilingualism Composite score of dual-language context ( DLC ) bilingual- ism reflects the extent to which two languages are used within the same situation in general .
The value is computed by summing participants ’ responses on two items regarding DLC bilingualism and single-language context bilingualism , which is reverse coded .
Scores range from 2 to 10 , with a higher score indicating a greater degree of DLC bilingualism .
B.2 .
Index of single-language context bilingualism The index of single-language context ( SLC ) bilingualism esti- mates the extent to which one language ( e.g. , L1 ) is used in one sit- uation , as opposed to the usage of another language ( e.g. , L2 ) in a separate situation .
Participants reported the percentage of time they spent at home , school , work , and in other situations as well as the percentage of time they used L1 and L2 ( and , potentially , L3 and L4 ) in each situation .
Total percentage of all languages should be 100 % .
The following formula was used to derive the index for SLC bilingualism : X4 i¼1 pi ci 100 ci ¼ jðjðjðPercentage of L1 Percentage of L2Þj Percentage of L3Þj Percentage of L4Þj where pi is the amount of time spent in each context , and ci is the absolute discrepancy between the percentage of time L1 was used and the total percentage of time other languages were used .

Graphical display of model fit The graph displays overlaid predicted ( parameter-based ) and empirical cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) for both switch and repeat trials .
Following the suggestion of Schmitz and Voss ( 2012 ) , predicted and empirical cdfs were first computed for each participant and then averaged across participants .
Correct and A. Hartanto , H. Yang / Cognition 150 ( 2016 ) 10–19 17incorrect cdfs are combined , with latencies of correct responses plotted on the right side ( with positive values ) and latencies of incorrect responses plotted on the left side ( with negative values ) .
The intercept of the cdf reflects the percentage of inaccurate responses .
