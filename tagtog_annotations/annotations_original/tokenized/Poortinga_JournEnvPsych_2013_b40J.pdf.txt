Introduction 1.1 .
Background Wales is the first country in the United Kingdom to have introduced a charge for single-use carrier bags .
From the 1st of October 2011 onwards , shoppers inWales have to pay a compulsory five pence for each single-use carrier bag at point of sale.1 The charge was introduced to prevent littering and to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill ( Welsh Assembly Government , 2010 ) .
A quasi-experimental field study was set up to evaluate the effectiveness of the charge to reduce carrier bag use amongst the general public , and to explore further attitudinal and behav- ioural responses to the charge .
More specifically , the introduction of the carrier bag charge inWales was used as a natural experiment to examine whether environmental policies may become more pop- ular after their introduction and lead to behaviour spillover , i.e. , ture , Cardiff University , Bute 10 3NB , UK .

The effectiveness of policies to reduce single-use carrier bag use Over the past decade a remarkable shift in the international norms associated with disposable carrier bags has taken place .
Single-use carrier bags e plastic ones in particular e are increas- ingly seen as an environmental hazard threatening human and animal welfare , rather than as a benign modern convenience .
Many national and local governments have therefore either banned or put restrictions on the sale or use of disposable plastic bags ( Clapp & Swanston , 2009 ) .
The success of these countries to reduce plastic bag use among the general public has led to other countries , states and local communities following suit with comparable measures ( e.g. , Convery , McDonnell , & Ferreira , 2007 ) .
While there have been many initiatives to reduce single-use carrier bags , very few of them have been evaluated .
The available evidence suggests that a tax or a charge on disposable carrier bags can be highly effective.2 Research by Convery et al .
( 2007 ) shows that plastic bag tax introduced in the Republic of Ireland in 20022 The difference between a tax and a charge is that the revenues of a tax go to the government while the revenues of a charge go to the retailer .
In Wales , retailers are suggested to donate the proceeds to a charity of choice .
W. Poortinga et al .
/ Journal of Environmental Psychology 36 ( 2013 ) 240e247 241 ( the ‘ plastax ’ ) reduced plastic bag use by more than 90 % and raised revenues in the order of V12e14 million for the Environment Fund .
However , this conclusion was based on evidence from multiple sources , not on a systematic evaluation of the policy .
A national plastic bag charge introduced in China in 2008 led to a 49 % reduction in the use of new plastic bags ( He , 2010 ) .
In this study , independent samples of shoppers were interviewed before and after the implementation of the policy .
However , without a com- parable control or comparator group , the research was not able to separate the effects of the policy from more general trends in plastic bag use .
There are different ways in which the effectiveness of a tax or a charge on carrier bags can be understood .
Economists see a carrier bag tax or charge as a typical market-based instrument that in- ternalises the costs of environmental pollution .
The effectiveness is therefore based on the pricing of the external costs of pollution that were not previously part of the consumers ’ decision to use disposable carrier bags .
The functioning of market-based in- struments is well supported by economic theory ( Tietenberg , Button , & Nijkamp , 1999 ) .
According to economic theory , ‘ emis- sions ’ ( i.e .
number of bags used ) will be reduced to the point where the marginal benefits of internalisation equal the marginal costs of abatement ( Convery et al. , 2007 ) .
However , while the pricing certainly forms part of the explanation , a singular economic focus may ignore important psychological processes that could contribute to the success of a tax or charge to change behaviour .
The functioning of the carrier bag charge can also be understood from a ‘ habit discontinuity ’ perspective ( Verplanken , Walker , Davis , & Jurasek , 2008 ) .
The use of carrier bags may e like many other waste-related behaviours e be strongly habitual ( i.e .
automatic , frequent and ‘ cued ’ by stable contexts ; Verplanken , Aarts , van Knippenberg , & Moonen , 1998 ) .
The introduction of the charge can be seen as a ‘ context change ’ after which bag use needs to be renegotiated .
While previously consumers may have ‘ uncon- sciously ’ grabbed a single-use carrier bag at the cashier till , a carrier bag charge or tax forces them to make a conscious decision as to whether they want to use one or not .
People are then prompted to adapt their behaviour to either avoid the charge , as argued by economic theory , or to bring behaviour in line with their values , as posited by the self-activation hypothesis ( Verplanken et al. , 2008 ) .
The old wasteful habit then may ( or may not ) be replaced by the new behaviour of bringing a re-usable bag to the shops , which in the longer term may become a habit in its own.1.3 .
Attitudinal responses to environmental policies In addition to the intended changes in the targeted behaviours , environmental policies appear to elicit a number of other less well understood attitudinal and behavioural responses .
Despite Irish consumers being somewhat resistant to the plastic bag charge prior to its introduction ( Drury Research , 2000 ) , Convery et al .
( 2007 ) reported that they became more positive about the policy after its implementation .
Convery et al .
( 2007 ) even label the policy as “ the most popular tax in Europe ” .
Similar positive attitudinal changes were observed for other environmental and behavioural change policies .
Smokers as well as non-smokers have been found to be more supportive of a smoking ban after the benefits became apparent ( Borland , Owen , Hill , & Chapman , 1990 ; Owen , Borland , & Hill , 1991 ; Seo , Macy , Torabi , & Middlestadt , 2011 ) ; and a number of congestion charges have becomemore popular after they came into3 Congestion pricing or congestion charges are a system charging motorised vehicles for entering a particular zone in periods of high demand to reduce traffic congestion.force ( Schuitema , Steg , & Forward , 2010 ; Transport for London , 2004 ) .3 Attitude change brought about by behaviour change policies can be explained by well-established social psychological consistency theories , such as cognitive dissonance ( Festinger , 1957 ) and self- perception theory ( Bem , 1967 ) .
Cognitive dissonance theory posits that people have a motivational drive to reduce discrepancies be- tween attitudes and behaviour , as such discrepancies produce feelings of discomfort .
This can be done by either changing atti- tudes or behaviours .
According to self-perception theory , people infer their own attitudes from observing their own behaviour .
Attitude change may therefore occur if policies are successful in changing behaviour .
An alternative explanation for the positive attitudinal changes is that parts of the public have unrealistic expectations regarding the consequences of the proposed policies .
These views may then be adjusted after people have experienced the benefits of a policy and/ or have been able to adapt to the policy without much difficulty ( Ölander & Thøgersen , 1995 ) .
1.4 .
Behavioural responses to environmental policies : spillover effects A possible side effect of cognitive dissonance and self- perception processes is that the policies and their accompanying attitude and behaviour changes may lead to further behavioural responses .
The spread of effects from a targeted behaviour to other associated behaviours is known as behavioural spillover ( Thøgersen , 2004 ; Thøgersen & Crompton , 2009 ) or response generalisation ( Ludwig , 2002 ; Ludwig & Geller , 1997 ) .
According to Bem ’ s self- perception theory ( 1967 ) people do not only infer their attitudes from their behaviours ; they also use their behaviours as ‘ cues to their internal dispositions ’ .
This means that engagement in pro- environmental behaviour may encourage changes in people ’ s values and identity , which then may lead to further behavioural changes in line with the revised identity ( Whitmarsh & O ’ Neill , 2010 ) .
If people stop using single-use carrier bags and start bringing their own reusable bag to the shops , they may see themselves as being morewaste conscious and thus are more likely to make other waste-conscious decisions .
Response generalisation theory argues that reinforcement ef- fects may spread to other functionally similar behaviours ( Ludwig , 2002 ) .
The use of behavioural spillover processes to promote environmentally sustainable lifestyles change has gained some traction in policy circles .
It is hoped that certain ‘ catalytic ’ or ‘ wedge ’ behaviours may serve as entry points in helping people to make additional changes ( Defra , 2008 ) .
However , while behav- ioural spillover or response generalisation has been observed for safety behaviours ( Ludwig & Geller , 1997 ) , there is little empirical evidence of spillover effects in the environmental domain .
Most of the evidence in the environmental domain is still predominantly correlational ( Barr , Gilg , & Ford , 2005 ; Poortinga , Spence , Demski , & Pidgeon , 2012 ; Thøgersen & Noblet , 2012 ; Whitmarsh & O ’ Neill , 2010 ) .
While response generalisation may have contributed to the covariance between the different ( types of ) environmental behav- iour , a causal relationship can only be established via ( field ) experimental research .
It also has to be considered that changes in a target behaviour might not necessarily lead to additional attitude and other behav- ioural change .
People need to change their behaviour voluntarily and for the ‘ right ’ reasons .
If behaviour change is ( perceived to be ) imposed or associated with external contingencies , the behaviour could become extrinsically rather than intrinsically motivated ( Deci & Ryan , 1985 ) .
This is then unlikely to produce changes in identity and other associated behaviours .
Also , evidence is emerging that Table 1 Characteristics of the weighted before and after samples in Wales and England ( % ) .

/ Journal of Environmental Psychology 36 ( 2013 ) 240e247242spillover effects can only be expected if policies appeal to envi- ronmental rather than self-interested reasons for behavioural change ( Evans et al. , 2013 ) .
There are further risks associated with relying too much on behavioural spillover processes to establish further changes in lifestyle .
Adopting particular pro-environmental behaviours may establish ‘ moral credentials ’ ( Thøgersen & Crompton , 2009 ) which may lead to negative spillover through a ‘ licensing effect ’ ( Mazar & Zhong , 2010 ) .
By engaging people in one salient environmentally significant act ( e.g. , recycling ) , they may feel they earned the right to engage in other more wasteful behaviours ( e.g. , a flight to an exotic destination ) .
1.5 .
Aim of the research The overall aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness and further attitudinal and behavioural impacts of the single-use carrier bag charge in Wales .
The focus of the research was four- fold .
First , the study examined the effectiveness of the charge to reduce its target behaviour of single-use carrier bag use .
It was hypothesised that people in Wales are more likely to bring their own reusable shopping bag/s to supermarkets and other shops after the introduction of the carrier bag charge ( Hypothesis 1 ) .
Second , the study examined attitudinal changes brought about by the charge .
It was expected that due to self-perception and cognitive dissonance processes , people in Wales would become more positive about the carrier bag charge after its introduction .
The specific hypotheses being tested were : people in Wales will become more supportive of the charge after its introduction ( Hy- pothesis 2a ) and will develop more positive attitudes towards the charge after its introduction ( Hypothesis 2b ) .
The third aim of the paper was to explore potential changes in identity as a result of the carrier bag charge .
It was hypothesised that , as a result of self-perception and cognitive dissonance pro- cesses , a waste-conscious/environmental identity will become more prevalent in Wales after the introduction of the carrier bag charge ( Hypothesis 3 ) .
Fourth , the study explored possible spillover to other waste and non-waste related environmental behaviours .
It was hypothesised ( Hypothesis 4 ) that the carrier bag charge will produce changes in other waste-related behaviours ( e.g .
recycling ) but not in non- waste related environmental behaviours ( e.g .
energy use ) .

Method 2.1 .
The study A quasi-experimental field study consisting of independent samples was set up to evaluate the introduction of the single-use carrier bag charge in Wales .
Telephone surveys were conducted in Wales before ( n ¼ 500 ) and after ( n ¼ 500 ) the introduction of the charge .
Similar telephone surveys were conducted in England at the same times ( n¼ 500 in both the before and after sample ) .
The interviews conducted in England , where no carrier bag charge was introduced , served as the comparator for the study .
The ‘ before ’ telephone interviews were conducted from 19 to 30 September 2011 in Wales ( two weeks prior to the introduction of the charge ) and from 19 September to 8 October 2011 in England .
The ‘ after ’ telephone interviews were conducted from 8 April to 1 May 2012 ( approximately six months after the introduction of the charge ) .
A quota sampling strategy was used to obtain nationally representative samples .
Broad quotas were set for gender , age and urbanerural location .
The independent samples were then weighted to the known socio-demographic profile of theWelsh and English populations as recorded in the 2001 Census .
The ‘ before ’ and ‘ after ’ Welsh and English samples were therefore comparable in terms of socio-demographic composition .
There were only small differences between the Welsh and English samples .
Income levels were somewhat lower in Wales than in England , and the Welsh samples were more rural than the English ones ( see Table 1 ) .
These differences reflect differences in the makeup of the respective populations.2.2 .
Measures The questionnaire contained 32 questions on the topics of own bag use ; support for and attitudes towards the carrier bag charge ; waste-related and non-waste related environmental behaviours ; self-reported environmental identity and concern ; waste knowl- edge ; and socio-demographic background information .
Current levels of own bag use were assessed by asking ( 1 ) ‘ At your last visit to the supermarket , did you bring your own bag ? ’ ; ( 2 ) ‘ How often do you take your own bag/s to the supermarket ? ’ ; and ( 3 ) ‘ How often do you take your own bag/s to other shops ? ’ .
Re- spondents could answer the first question with ‘ yes ’ , ‘ no ’ , or ‘ don ’ t know ’ .
The latter two questions could be responded to by answering ‘ always ’ , ‘ often ’ , ‘ occasionally ’ , or ‘ never ’ .
The scale was dichotomised , contrasting ‘ always ’ to all other responses .
The acceptability of the single-use carrier bag charge was assessed by asking respondents ‘ How strongly do you support or oppose a five pence charge on single-use carrier bags ? ’ .
The five- point response scale ranged from ‘ strongly support ’ to ‘ strongly oppose ’ .
The scale was dichotomised , contrasting support ( ‘ strongly support ’ and ‘ tend to support ’ ) to all other responses .
Attitudes towards the charge were indicated by responses to the following three statements : ‘ Charging five pence for each single- use carrier bag is a good way of reducing waste ’ ; ‘ Charging five pence for each single-use carrier bags helps to reduce litter ’ ; and ‘ I Fig .

The five-point response scale had the following scale points : ‘ strongly agree ’ , ‘ tend to agree ’ , ‘ neither agree nor disagree ’ , tend to disagree ’ and ‘ strongly disagree ’ .
The three items could be combined into an internally consistent scale ( Cronbach ’ s a ¼ 0.77 ) .
The questionnaire included four agreeedisagree statements designed to assess respondents ’ waste and environmental identity ( e.g .
‘ I think of myself as a waste conscious person ’ and ‘ I think of myself as someone who is very concerned about environmental issues ’ , respectively ) .
The four statements formed a reliable self- reported environmental identity scale ( Cronbach ’ s a ¼ 0.87 ) .
The following waste-related and non-waste related environ- mental behaviours were included in the survey : buying products with less packaging ; recycling household waste ; repairing or maintaining an item to avoid buying something new ; walking or cycling short distances ( i.e .
trips of less than 3 miles ) ; turning off the tap while brushing your teeth ; buying energy-saving light bulbs ; and washing clothes at 30 or less .
Respondents indicated if they ‘ always ’ ‘ often ’ , ‘ occasionally ’ , or ‘ never ’ took these actions .
No reliable scales could be constructed from these behaviours .
Po- tential spillover effects were tested for each of the seven waste- related and non-waste related environmental behaviours .
2.3 .
Statistical analysis The data were analysed using two-way Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) .
The 2 2 factorial design included ‘ stage ’ ( before versus after the introduction of the carrier bag charge ) and ‘ country ’ ( Wales versus England ) as the fixed factors .
Full-factorial analyses were conducted with own bag use , support for the carrier bag charge , attitudes to the carrier bag charge , self-reported environ- mental identity , and waste-related and non-waste-related behav- iours as the respective dependent variables .
The full-factorial analyses estimated simultaneously the main effects of two fixed factors and the interaction between them .
Both the main effects and the interaction effects of the full-factorial analyses are pre- sented .
Interaction effects show non-additive effects of the two fixed factors that can be attributed to the carrier bag charge .
Simple effects analysis was used to explore the nature of the found in- teractions .
The effect sizes are presented in Cohen ’ s d. 3 .

It also shows that people in Wales were generally more supportive of a charge than people in England , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 33.82 , p < 0.001 .
The Stage Country interaction was statistically signif- icant , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 4.00 , p < 0.05 .

A simple effects analysis confirmed that attitudes to the carrier bag charge improved in Wales ( d ¼ 0.16 , p < 0.01 ) as well as England ( d ¼ 0.12 , p < 0.05 ) .
These results are not in line with Hypothesis 2b.3.4 .
Self-reported environmental identity Fig .
5 shows that , overall , there was no significant difference in self-reported environmental identity before and after the intro- duction of the carrier bag charge , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 0.26 , p ¼ 0.61 , and that self-reported environmental identity was slightly higher in the Welsh samples than in the English samples , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 5.23 , p < 0.05 .
The analysis revealed a significant Stage Country interaction effect , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 8.13 , p < 0.01 .
While self-reported environmental identity increased in Wales ( d ¼ 0.14 , p < 0.05 ) , no significant changewas observed in England ( d¼0.10 , p¼ 0.11 ) .
These results confirm Hypothesis 3 that a waste-conscious/ environmental identity would become more prevalent in Wales after the carrier bag charge was introduced.Fig .

Waste-related and non-waste related behaviours No evidence for behavioural spillover was found in this study .
There was an increase in recycling household waste , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 10.09 , p < 0.001 .
However , the Stage Country interaction was not significant , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 0.01 , p ¼ 0.91 .
A simple effects analysis confirmed that recycling increased in bothWales ( d¼ 0.13 , p < 0.05 ) and England ( d ¼ 0.14 , p < 0.05 ) .
Somewhat surprisingly , the frequency of people buying energy-saving light bulbs dropped between the before and after samples , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 4.44 , p < 0.05 .
Again , the Stage Country interaction was not significant , F ( 1 , 2199 ) ¼ 1.85 , p ¼ 0.17 , although a simple effects analysis suggests that the drop was somewhat bigger in England ( d ¼ 0.15 , p < 0.05 ) than in Wales ( d ¼ 0.03 , p ¼ 0.62 ) .
The study could not confirm Hypothesis 4.4 .

Key objectives of the study were to examine the effectiveness of the charge to reduce the use of single-use carrier bags ( as indicated by own bag use ) ; changes in support for and attitudes towards the charge ; potential changes in identity as a result of the carrier bag charge ; and potential behav- ioural spillover effects brought about by the charge .
The charge appeared highly effective in changing its target behaviour of carrier bag use .
Own bag use in Wales increased from 62 % before to 82 % after the introduction of the carrier bag charge .
While own bag use also increased in England , the increase was much smaller than inWales .
The carrier bag charge appears to have established a change of habits in Wales .
Many people in Wales now ‘ always ’ bring their own bag to the supermarket ( an increase from 42 % to 64 % ) and to other shops ( an increase from 27 % to 43 % ) .
The increase in ‘ always ’ bringing a reusable bag to the supermarket was much smaller in England .
England even saw a decrease in shoppers ‘ always ’ bringing a reusable bag to other shops .
Although it can not be assumed that all frequent behaviour is habitual ( habits are also defined by their automaticity and being cued by a stable context ; Verplanken et al. , 2008 ) , it would be likely that people who ‘ always ’ bring a reusable bag to the shops have developed some habitual routine of bringing a bag in the six months after the introduction of the charge .
Indeed , research on habit development indicates that new behaviour becomes habitual on average 66 days after initiation ( Lally , van Jaarsveld , Potts , & Wardle , 2010 ) .
Initially , the charge will have made the decision to bring a reusable bag deliberate .
Then at some stage bringing a reusable bag will become the new habit by building it into the routine of going to the shops ( cf .
Verplanken & Wood , 2006 ) .
More qualitative and experimental research is needed to show how such habit discontinuity effects unfold .
It will be particularly useful to explore according to which principles waste-related habits are broken and re-created .
The study identified a number of attitudinal responses to the charge that may be informative for environmental policy-makers .
While support for the single-use carrier bag charge was already high before its introduction , the Welsh population became even more supportive of the charge after ( from 59 % before to 70 % after ) .
In England , support for a five pence charge remained stable over the same period .
These results are in line with the predictions and consistent with cognitive dissonance and self-perception processes.The observed changes in self-reported environmental identity reflect the patterns of behaviour change in England and Wales and are also consistent with the increased support for the carrier bag charge in Wales .
While self-reported environmental identity increased in Wales , it did not significantly change in England .
However , not all attitudinal changes were as expected .
Even if at- titudes to the single-use carrier bag charge becamemore positive in the wake of its introduction in Wales , a similar improvement was found in England .
It is therefore likely that these results reflect a wider change in norms relating to disposable carrier bags in the UK , rather than being attributed to the policy itself or associated cognitive dissonance/self-perception processes .
It is possible that attitudes in England have been contaminated through the intro- duction of long-life bags in supermarkets or through reports in the media ( see e.g .
BBC , 2012 ) .
The study found no support for behavioural spillover .
Very few real changes in waste-related and non-related behaviours were observed after the charge was introduced in Wales .
The absence of such effects may have important policy implications as it questions the viability of behavioural spillover as a strategy to promote more substantial lifestyle changes .
However , there could be a number of alternativemethodological and theoretical explanations for the absence of behavioural spill- over effects .
Due to space restrictions it was only possible to include a small number of waste-related and non-waste related environ- mental behaviours in the survey .
It is therefore possible that the effects may have spilled over to behaviours that were not included in this study .
It would be worthwhile to conduct a behavioural mapping exercise to identify the most likely candidates for behavioural spillover in advance .
An alternative explanation is that bringing your own bag is not an appropriate ‘ catalytic ’ or ‘ wedge ’ behaviour to bring about further behavioural changes .
Cognitive dissonance will only emerge and thus lead to other changes if the changed behaviour is diagnostic of an internal disposition ( namely , environmental values or identity ) .
The change in self-reported environmental identity would argue against this explanation .
A related explanation as to why spillover may not have happened is that the behaviour change may have been motivated by cost avoidance rather than by environmental values .
Engagement in the more pro-environmental behaviour is then externally rather than internally attributed ( Deci & Ryan , 1985 ) .
As observed in both the response generalisation and spillover literatures , this would mili- tate against change in non-targeted behaviours .
The study has a number of methodological weaknesses that need to be addressed in future research .
Most notably , the study used independent samples to evaluate the effectiveness and further attitudinal and behavioural impacts of the carrier bag charge in Wales .
It was therefore not possible to conduct detailed individual- level analyses .
Longitudinal research is needed to show which in- dividuals are the most likely to change their attitudes and behav- iour and under which conditions these changes may come about ( cf. , Evans et al. , 2013 ; Ludwig & Geller , 1997 ) .
This could show whether environmentally concerned individuals are more likely to change their behaviour in accordance with their values , as can be expected from a self-activation perspective ( Verplanken et al. , 2008 ) ; how ( differential ) experiences of the benefits and draw- backs of the new situation can bring about attitude change ( cf. , Schuitema et al. , 2010 ) ; and whether individuals who change their behaviour for ‘ intrinsic ’ environmental reasons are more likely to engage in further behaviour change than those who change their behaviour for ‘ extrinsic ’ financial reasons ( cf. , Deci & Ryan , 1985 ; Evans et al. , 2013 ) .
The current study primarily focused on environmental identity as a mechanism for change .
However , there is a wider variety of mechanisms at play that could contribute to attitude and W. Poortinga et al .

By engaging in a pro-environmental behaviour , individuals may acquire knowledge or learn skills that make other pro-environmental behaviours easier to conduct ( Thøgersen & Crompton , 2009 ) .
The response generalisation literature pro- vides an alternative perspective on how the reinforcement of a single behaviour may spread to other functionally similar be- haviours ( Ludwig , 2002 ) .
According to Stokes and Baer ( 1977 ) response generalisation to functionally similar behaviours is part of a wider reinforcement effect that take place acrossDependent variable Values Scale Wales England Before ( n ¼ 500 ) After ( n ¼ 500 ) Before ( n ¼ 500 ) After ( n ¼ 500 ) At your last visit to the supermarket , did you bring your own bag ?

This opens up interesting new avenues for behavioural spillover research in the environmental domain .
Spillover effects may also occur to other persons , settings , time , and as a response to resembling policies .
For pragmatic reasons , our research relied on self-reports rather than on objective measures of behaviour .
While self-reported measures may reflect inflated estimates of actual behaviour , this would likely have been consistent across both the intervention and comparator groups .
Other research on the Welsh carrier bag charge that used more ‘ objective ’ behavioural measures reported consistent effects as a result of the introduction of the charge ( WRAP , 2012 ) .
Despite these limitations , the study has made a contribution to understanding the attitudinal and behavioural implications of environmental policy .
The evidence regarding behavioural spillover has so far been predominantly associational , while evidence regarding attitude and behaviour change tends not to include a comparator group .
This study constitutes the first quasi- experimental evidence of the effectiveness of a carrier bag charge as well as for an environmental policy becomingmore popular after its implementation .
The attitudinal responses to the carrier bag charge observed in this study suggest that environmental policy-makersmay be bolder in implementing policies that have a certain level of support and are easily adapted to .
While the study did not find any support for spillover effects to other environmental behaviours , it also did not find evidence for negative spillover or ‘ licensing ’ .
Furthermore , the observed changes in self-reported environmental identity could suggest that the carrier bag charge may bring about behavioural spillover in the longer term .
There is now a need for further research to study the long- term effects of behaviour change policies as well as in-depth field-experimental research to examine the processes and spe- cific conditions under which attitude change and spillover effects may or may not occur .
Such research will be vital for policy- makers in other countries currently considering introducing carrier bag charges , and those who are considering using behavioural spillover as a strategy to bring about further lifestyle changes.Acknowledgements The research was made possible by financial support from the Welsh Government.Appendix A .
