In three experiments , we explored the impact of waste disposal signage design on disposal behavior .
Specifically , we were interested in two primary questions in signage design : 1 ) what type of waste disposal information should be presented ; and 2 ) how the information should be presented .
We found that signs containing either icons or pictures of permitted items improved sorting performance compared to signs containing only words of the items ; consistent positioning of the signs improved sorting performance compared to random positions for both pictures and icons ; and presenting both permitted and prohibited items can interfere with performance when the signs are icons .
The current study provides experi- mental evidence to demonstrate that the design of waste disposal signage can impact waste sorting performance in meaningful ways and highlights the need for graphical signage and bin standardization .

Introduction Waste disposal receptacles and bins are ubiquitous in the urban environment .
They are commonly placed in people 's homes , offices , and on the streets .
The popularity of recycling programs in recent years has led to an increase in waste disposal bin categories ( e.g. , paper , bottles , compost ) .
This development inevitably requires people to learn to sort their waste in the respective bins , which necessitates new designs of waste disposal signage to help guide users to correctly sort their waste .
Unlike other types of public signs ( e.g. , traffic signs ) , there is little standardization among waste disposal signage .
Waste disposal signage , the physical appearance of the bins , and the positioning of the bins , differ substantially between neighbouring jurisdictions .
Even within the same jurisdiction or institution , there are often diverse signage and bins used in different buildings ( Andrews , Gregoire , Rasmussen , & Witowich , 2013 ) .
This is problematic given that standardization is an important ergonomic principle known to increase user comprehension and compliance ( Ben-Bassat & Shinar , 2006 ; Shinar , Dewar , Summala , & Zakowska , 2003 ) .
The lack of standardization can be confusing and frustrating for users , which leads to improper sorting .
Improperly sorted waste increases the costs of recycling programs by increasing the time and labour required to properly re-sort items at a centralized sorting facility or at the pick-up truck ( Bohm , Folz , Kinnaman , & Podolsky , 2010 ) .
The research literature suggests that other ergonomic principles should be considered in addition to signage standardization ( for ex- ample , constructing and placing signs so that they are conceptually and spatially compatible with the message they represent ( Shinar et al. , 2003 ) ) .
While there is a wealth of research addressing the components of effective signage in areas like traffic ( e.g. , Ben-Bassat & Shinar , 2006 ) , industrial safety ( e.g .
Collins , 1983 ) , consumer safety ( e.g .
Laughery , 2006 ) , pharmaceuticals ( e.g .
Chan & Chan , 2013 ) , and even libraries ( e.g .
Polger & Stempler , 2014 ) , research on waste disposal signs has been limited .
Specifically , since an initial study by Austin , Hatfield , Grindle and Bailey ( 1993 ) found that the presence of basic signs placed above waste disposal bins can itself increase recycling , the literature has focused largely on persuasive messaging , e.g .
“ do you leave your litter lying around ? ” , and other design features that might motivate recycling behavior ( Bateson , Callow , Holmes , Roche , & Nettle , 2013 ; Werner , Rhodes , & Partain , 1998 ; Werner , Stoll , Birch , & White , 2002 ; Werner , White , Byerly , & Stoll , 2009 ; de Kort , McCalley , & Midden , 2008 ) .
Critically , these studies neither evaluate the design factors of the signs themselves , nor do they investigate how signs might capture attention or communicate the information differently .

T The signage literature has adopted a four stage information-pro- cessing framework for how signs and labels can produce specific be- havioral change : 1 ) engage attention ; 2 ) facilitate comprehension ; 3 ) modify beliefs and attitudes ; 4 ) enhance motivation ( Wogalter & Laughery , 1996 ) .
The literature around waste disposal signage has fo- cused on the role of the later stages of this information-processing framework : beliefs and attitudes , and motivation .
The first two stages ( attention and comprehension ) depend on basic design features of the signage that can impact early stages of cognitive processes in a waste disposal context , and they remain unexplored .
The present study takes an initial step towards understanding how signs can optimally display information so that users can most efficiently and effectively perceive and comprehend the information presented .
As the motivation behind this study was to assist jurisdictions and institutions wishing to implement evidence-based standardization of waste disposal signage , we were primarily interested in resolving sev- eral debates that we found were common across local institutions im- plementing waste disposal signage .
Common concerns included whe- ther words or images were better in conveying the category of waste , whether consistent positioning of the signs was important , and whether signs should display prohibited items ( Andrews et al. , 2013 ; Ben-Bassat & Shinar , 2006 ; Bohm et al. , 2010 ; Schultz , Oskamp , & Mainieri , 1995 ) .
From these practical design questions we derived two broad directions that could be explored scientifically : 1 ) what type of waste disposal information should be presented ; and 2 ) how the information should be presented .
Underlying these themes was the larger question of whether basic design features can influence waste disposal behavior at all .
These questions intersect with the established literature on in- formation provision from icons .
It has long been noted that icons can communicate large amounts of information efficiently , and are not limited by language barriers ( Isherwood , McDougall , & Curry , 2007 ) .
In altering attention and comprehension aspects of the information-pro- cessing framework , researchers look to manipulate three characteristics of the visual stimuli : complexity , concreteness , and familiarity ( McDougall , Reppa , Kulik , & Taylor , 2016 ) .
Generally , images that are simpler result in quicker performance , with more complex images re- sulting in slower response times .
There is also a correlation between complexity and familiarity ( Forsythe , Mulhern , & Sawey , 2008 ) , though both factors also independently predict performance ( with familiarity generally being the most important ) .
Concreteness refers to how pic- torial an image is , or how closely it connects or represents the real- world object it is depicting .
There remains some debate in the literature about the importance of concreteness in impacting user performance ( McDougall et al. , 2016 ) .
Recent theory has suggested that easing the information processing of icons ( i.e .
having simple , concrete , and familiar icons ) can not only improve performance ( e.g .
accuracy and response times ) but can also impact subjective evaluations and preferences ( McDougall et al. , 2016 ) .
That is , not only can changing the basic characteristics of visual stimuli make performance easier , but it can also make participants like it more .
The practical questions that motivated our study dovetail with the theoretical questions about the characteristics of visual stimuli , and whether characteristics like complexity and concreteness can impact performance in a novel context – waste disposal – yet to be explored in the icon literature .
To address these practical and theoretical questions , we created an experimental paradigm utilizing motion tracking technology and a large tabletop touchscreen where participants would be shown an item to dispose ( e.g .
an apple core ) and they would then have to throw the item out by touching the proper waste category ( compost , paper , recycling , or garbage ) .
Waste categories were represented on the ta- bletop touchscreen by clear visual signs .
We compared the impact of the following factors on sorting behavior : the use of pictures , icons , and texts as signage ( Experiment 1 ) , the consistency of bin positions and the presence of permitted and prohibited items ( Experiments 2 & 3 ) .
We should note that although the relative benefit of icons vs. pictures ( vs. words ) on human sorting behavior may seem intuitive , the empirical evidence is far from clear-cut .
Designing effective visual signage in many ways is about striking the proper balance between presenting too little and too much information to guide the sorting behavior ( e.g. , Cole , Hammond , & McCool , 1997 ; Hollnagel , 2009 ) .
The pictures and icons used in our experiments were developed with the diverse images commonly found throughout the local munici- palities ' waste disposal signage .
We used the same four waste streams that were ubiquitous on the campus of University of British Columbia and in the local communities .
The sorting rules in the experiments followed the sorting guidelines in the City of Vancouver .
As the par- ticipants would have to reach out to the sign to dispose an item , the task approximates the reaching gestures commonly used when throwing out a waste item in the real world .
We reasoned that natural responses such as these might generalize more readily to actual sorting behavior outside the laboratory , yet the tabletop set-up allowed us to easily manipulate the design of the signs while controlling for all other external factors .
2 .
Experiment 1 We began by exploring whether different types of image renderings ( pictures , icons , words ) would be more effective at inducing proper waste disposal behavior .
The literature suggests that signage informa- tion conveyed by images generally produce better outcomes than those by words only , which has led some regulators to replace word-only warning signs with images ( Argo & Main , 2004 ; Forsythe , Sheehy , & Sawey , 2003 ) .
We predicted , therefore , that images should produce faster and more accurate responses compared to words .
2.1 .
Methods 2.1.1 .
Participants Psychometric visual cognition studies that emphasize speed and accuracy routinely sample 15–30 participants in order to obtain a re- liable measure of central tendency ( Baddeley , 2003 ; Grill-Spector & Kanwisher , 2005 ; Wolfe , 1998 ) .
The present series of experiments were grounded on this foundation .
Furthermore , a power analysis was con- ducted using G*Power ( Faul , Erdfelder , Lang , & Buchner , 2007 ) .
Given a partial eta squared of 0.41 ( Luo , Zelenika , & Zhao , under review ; Zhao , Al-Aidroos , & Turk-Browne , 2013 ) derived from our previous work using a similar interface and experimental design with four within-subjects conditions , a minimum of 20 participants was required to have 90 % power ( alpha= 0.05 ) to reveal an effect .
Thus , we re- cruited at least 20 participants in each experiment .
Variation in the number of participants beyond this threshold is inevitable based on how the University of British Columbia subject pool operates , where studies are open for a set period of time , and students are free to sign-up for course credit or financial remuneration both for the purpose of contributing to new data acquisition and in order to gain personal in- sights into how research investigations operate .
Thus , if the number of volunteers exceeds our pre-set target , we allow them to participate and , of course , include their data in our analyses .
In our first experiment forty-three university students ( mean age= 23.42 years , sd= 4.94 , range=18–42 ; 13 male ; 40 right handed ) participated in a 30-min session for course credit or $ 5 CAD .
We excluded one subject because of an equipment failure that occurred during testing .
2.1.2 .
Stimuli Four waste categories were used : garbage , recycling , paper , and compost .
Each waste category was represented by a sign .
Signs were D.W.-L. Wu et al .
Journal of Environmental Psychology 58 ( 2018 ) 77–85 78 depicted using four different image renderings ( standard pictures , black and white pictures , icons , or words ) .
These image renderings allowed us to manipulate the level of complexity and concreteness of each sign .
Standard pictures were the most complex and most concrete ( most accurately portrayed real-world items ) .
Black and white pictures were less complex though still displayed the same level of concreteness as standard colour pictures .
Icons meanwhile were less complex and concrete than the pictures ( see Fig .
1 ) .
These signs displayed items that were representative of the category and also found commonly in waste disposal signs in the local area .
As such , only a few items to be disposed of matched the items displayed on the signs .
Not all items displayed on signs were items participants were tasked to dispose of .
Participants were tasked to dispose of a total of 96 items during testing , with 24 items drawn from each of the four categories : compost , garbage , paper , and recycling categories .
The items to be disposed of were presented as word labels to limit ambiguity of what the items were .
See Appendix 1 for a list of the items that were to be disposed of and the items that were displayed on the signs .
2.1.3 .
Apparatus A motion tracking setup was used for this experiment , which con- sisted of 6 motion tracking cameras ( NaturalPoint Optitrack , VR100 : R2 ) , each with a 100 Hz sampling rate and 640×480 pixels spatial resolution .
These cameras emitted infrared signals to detect a small marker ball that was attached to a participants ' index finger with an adjustable strap .
The stimuli were projected onto a tabletop from a ceiling-mounted projector ( Dell M410HD ) with display settings of 1024×768 pixels and 60 Hz refresh rate .
The physical size of this projected area on the table was 92 cm×69.25 cm .
See Fig .
2 for how the signs were displayed and the dimensions of the projected area .
Motion tracking data , including reaction times and reach times , were collected and the experiment was controlled using MATLAB .
See Fig .
3 for a depiction of the Optitrack setup .
2.1.4 .
Procedure Participants1 were seated at the touch table , and were fitted with an adjustable marker on the index finger of their dominant hand .
On each trial , a home box appeared first .
Participants held their index finger down within the home box for 1 s , after which an item to be disposed of would be randomly selected and appear 6.6 cm above the home box .
Participants were given ample time ( 3–4 s ) to decide what waste cate- gory the item belonged to , before the different waste bins appeared in any one of four possible locations .
In this way any variation between bin selection ( e.g. , words vs. images ) could be attributed to differences in processing the bin .
Participants then indicated which Waste Category the item should be deposited in by reaching out and touching down on the sign , roughly simulating a natural “ throwing away ” gesture .
To emphasize that we wanted participants to behave naturally , we asked participants to “ imagine themselves placing various waste items in the right disposal bin ” by reaching towards and touching down on the correct sign .
We emphasized that both the speed and accuracy of their reaches were important .
Note that if participants lifted their finger outside the home box before the bins appeared , the trial ended pre- maturely and the participant received a “ too early ” message ; that item 's Fig .

1 Half of the participants in the study underwent a cognitive load manip- ulation , whereby on each trial they were asked to hold in working memory a various set of different colors .
However , this load manipulation had no impact on sorting performance in this experiment and the conditions were collapsed for all subsequent analyses .
D.W.-L. Wu et al .
Journal of Environmental Psychology 58 ( 2018 ) 77–85 79 position in the sequence would then be re-randomized along with the remaining items to be disposed of .
There was a 2.5 s interval between trials .
2.1.5 .
Data handling “ Efficiency score ” was our main dependent variable ( Townsend & Ashby , 1983 ) .
This measure was computed by dividing the total reac- tion time ( the time it took from when a participant lifted his or her finger from the home box to when a sign was touched ) by accuracy ( the proportion of accurate responses ) .
It is well established that response accuracy is often sacrificed in the name of response speed , known as the speed-accuracy trade off ( Bogacz , Wagenmakers , Forstmann , & Nieuwenhuis , 2010 ; Wickelgren , 1977 ) .
Efficiency scores seek to nor- malize this trade off by taking into account both reaction time and accuracy , allowing us to normalize different speed-accuracy response strategies ( e.g. , maximizing speed at the cost of response accuracy versus sacrificing speed in order to respond accurately ) .
Thus , for ex- ample , if a person took 1 s ( 1000ms ) to respond but only got half of the responses right , their efficiency score would be 2000 ( 1000ms/ 0.5=2000 ) ; whereas if another person took 1 s to respond but got all the responses correct , their score would be 1000 ( 1000ms/1=1000 ) .
Thus , better performance is reflected in a more efficient ( smaller ) ef- ficiency score .
Response times were trimmed according to a hybrid recursive trimming method in order to remove outliers including trials with extremely short or long response times ( Van Selst & Joliceour , 1994 ) .
This procedure removed on average 3.60 % of trials .
2.2 .
Results Efficiency scores were calculated for each participant ( ms/accu- racy ) , and then entered into a within-subjects ANOVA across the four levels of Image Rendering .
There was a main effect of Image Rendering ( F ( 3 , 123 ) = 6.9 , p < .001 , ƞp2=0.14 ) .
Paired t-tests on all pairs of means with bonferroni adjusted p-values for multiple comparisons re- vealed that word renderings produced significantly worse total effi- ciency scores than standard picture renderings ( mean differ- ence=1098.5 , std .
error=371.4 , p= .031 , d=0.46 , 0.95CI= [ 68.7 , 2128.2 ] ) , and worse than black and white renderings ( mean differ- ence=948.7 , std .
error=334.9 , p= .043 , d=0.44 , 0.95CI= [ 20.1 , 1877.2 ] ) .
All other pairs of image renderings were not significantly different ( p values > .06 ) , though it is noteworthy that words were also almost significantly worse than icons ( mean difference=893.2 , std .
error=332.4 , p= .062 , d=0.41 , 0.95CI= [ −28.2 , 1814.6 ] ) .
The underlying reaction time and accuracy scores are reported in Table 1 .
Table 2 reports the descriptive statistics based on item category.2 2.3 .
Discussion In Experiment 1 , we examined what type of waste disposal in- formation should be presented in the signage of each waste category , in order to maximize people 's sorting performance .
Specifically , we ex- amined whether waste disposal signs were more effective when they consisted of images or words .
Based on previous literature , we pre- dicted that images would fare better than word-only signs as , for ex- ample , traffic signs with symbols are not only learned more quickly , but also produce more accurate recall compared to word traffic signs ( Walker , Nicolay , & Stearns , 1965 ) .
Similarly , in categorization tasks , images tend to show a general behavioral benefit over words ( Snodgrass & Vanderwart , 1980 ) .
Consistent with these data the results from Experiment 1 reveal that picture and icon signs yield more effi- cient performance than word-only signs ( though only marginally in the case of icons ) .
The differences in image and icon signs appeared not to matter .
Looking at the descriptive statistics , standard picture images had the fastest reaction times despite being the most complex sign .
This might suggest that there is some advantage of concreteness in situations where the task and the signs are unfamiliar ( McDougall et al. , 2016 ) .
How- ever , given that the accuracy was similar across all three categories , the results of Experiment 1 suggest that any differences between the three categories may not have any substantial practical implication .
In summary our data suggest that sign designers for waste disposal should opt for images over words .
However , it is important that de- signers keep in mind that the superiority of images over words may not apply to all situations .
In some cases , when the words are highly fa- miliar ( as in 'Push ' and 'Pull ' ) , or the images themselves are novel or unfamiliar , words may be preferable to images .
Of course , images also carry other advantages , such as being able to circumvent language barriers ( Walker et al. , 1965 ) .
3 .
Experiment 2 In Experiment 2 , we move onto the second question : how should the information be displayed ?
As previously mentioned , standardization ( i.e. , consistency in design features across repeated uses ) is an im- portant ergonomic principle known to increase user comprehension ( Ben-Bassat & Shinar , 2006 ; Shinar et al. , 2003 ) .
In the visual search context , researchers have long known that knowledge of different at- tributes of the target can guide search behavior in a “ top down ” manner and decrease search times ( Wolfe , 2007 ) .
For example , consistent spa- tial arrangements have been shown to aid visual search in experimental situations ( Chun & Jiang , 1999 ; Conci , Sun , & Müller , 2011 ) .
As spatial positioning of waste disposal items is something that could be stan- dardized but tends to vary across situations , we reasoned that this de- sign feature is worthy of investigation .
Experiment 2 also begins to explore whether designs showing pro- hibited items , as well as permitted items , improves performance .

We report the descriptive statistics for interest only , as we believe it would be fruitful for subsequent studies to explore which item categories are most problematic to dispose of .
D.W.-L. Wu et al .
Journal of Environmental Psychology 58 ( 2018 ) 77–85 80 signs that display prohibited items provide more information ( e.g .
Arphorn , Augsornpeug , Srisorrachtr & Pruktharathikul , 2003 ; Kline & Beitel , 1994 ) they also risk increasing selection difficulty ( i.e. , ne- cessitating that the user correctly discriminate between permitted versus prohibited items ) , and may lead to confusion , errors , and/or slower decisions ( Forsythe et al. , 2003 ; Kline & Beitel , 1994 ) .
To our knowledge , despite the popularity of such signs , the benefits of in- cluding prohibited items on waste disposal signs have yet to be iden- tified ( see Fig .
4 for real-world examples of signs showing permitted and prohibited items ) .
In Experiment 2 , we tested the efficacy of such signs by having them depict permitted items only ( “ yes ” signs ) or both permitted and pro- hibited items ( “ yes/no ” signs ) .
To maintain a consistent trial and ana- lysis structure with Experiment 1 , we included only two Image Renderings ( pictures and icons ) with our two Sign Styles ( yes signs and yes/no signs ) , for a total of four sets of signs .
We also had a consistent condition where the position of the waste categories stayed the same , and a random condition where the position of the categories was ran- domized in each trial .
Category condition was manipulated between- subjects , and sign style was manipulated within-subjects .
3.1 .
Methods Except where noted , the methods used were the same as in Experiment 1 .
3.1.1 .
Participants Twenty university students ( mean age=20.9 , sd= 3.3 , range= 17–30 ; 15 female ; 18 right handed ) participated in a 30-min session for course credit or $ 5 CAD .
The participants were randomly assigned to two different consistency conditions : half were in a Consistent Condition where the locations of the Waste Category were the same for every trial , while the other half were put in a Random Condition where the locations of the waste category were randomized on every trial .
3.1.2 .
Stimuli Signs were designed for us by Metro Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada in a 2 ( Sign Style : yes vs. yes/no ) x 2 ( Image Rendering : picture vs. icon representations ) .
The signs were developed to be as ecologically valid as possible ( i.e. , they were designed to look like signs that users may actually see in real life ) while still meeting our experimental needs ( see Fig .
1b for signs , and Fig .
5 for dimensions ) .
3.1.3 .
Trial structure Trials were randomized such that there were 24 trials for each of the 4 sign conditions ( 2 Sign Styles x 2 Image Renderings ) .
In the Random condition each possible spatial positioning of compost , garbage , paper , and recycling categories were shown in the 24 trials .
In contrast , the Consistent Condition always displayed the waste categories in the fol- lowing order , from left to right : garbage , paper , recycling , compost .
For both groups the actual order of the items to be disposed was rando- mized .
Participants were given 1.8s to select a sign before the trial would end and be reshuffled together with the remaining trials.3 Testing occurred in two blocks of 48 trials , separated by an untimed rest break .
3.1.4 .
Data handling As with Experiment 1 , efficiency scores were calculated for each participant ( ms/accuracy ) .
The hybrid recursive trimming procedure removed on average 3.10 % of trials .
3.2 .
Results A 2×2 × 2 ANOVA was conducted with Sign Style ( yes , yes/no ) and Image Rendering ( picture , icon ) as within-subjects factors , and Consistency Condition ( consistent , random ) as a between-subjects factor .
The results are presented in Table 3 .
It is clear from the table of means that consistent sign positions produce better efficiency scores than random sign positions ( mean difference=730.4 , F ( 1 , 18 ) =14.8 , p < .01 , ηp2=0.45 , d=0.98 ) .
All other main effects , and interactions were not significant ( p 's > .14 ) , with image rendering , as in Experi- ment 1 , falling short of significance ( F < 1 ) .
Note , however , an inter- esting spike in response inefficiency for the random positioning of an iconic yes/no sign ( mean efficiency=1969 ) , though the 3-way inter- action fell far short of significance ( F ( 1 , 18 ) =0.3 , p= .60 , ηp2=0.02 ) .

Discussion In Experiment 2 , we investigated how consistent spatial positioning of signs , and how depicting both permitted and prohibited items could impact waste disposal behavior .
As predicted by the literature , we found that consistent positioning of the signs led to better sorting per- formance than random positioning of the signs .
This suggests that standardization of bin position should be prioritized for jurisdictions and institutions seeking to reduce contamination in waste disposal bins .
It also highlights the difference between situations where there are built-in waste receptacles ( e.g .
in some food courts ; Wu , DiGiacomo , & Kingstone , 2013 ) that maintain the relative location of the waste bins versus situations where waste disposal receptacles are individual bins that may have their relative positions changed ( e.g. , in many office buildings ; Duffy & Verges , 2009 ) .
Our results indicate that the former is preferable to the latter .
As in Experiment 1 , we found no difference in sorting performance between image renderings ( picture/icons ) ; and we also found no effect of sign style ( yes vs. yes/no ) .
However , there was an intriguing ( though statistically irrelevant ) suggestion that sign style itself might interact with image rendering if the arrangement of the bins is not consistent , with sorting efficiency declining for the yes/no iconic signs .
In considering the potential import of this issue , we noted that the ordering of the yes/no sign information was always consistent in Experiment 2 , with 'yes ' consistently appearing on the left and 'no ' on the right .
Given that bin consistency enhances sorting efficiency and mitigates any sign style× rendering interaction , we thought it im- portant to investigate if yes/no sign consistency also modulates per- formance , and if it does , will it interact with sign rendering as hinted at in Experiment 2 .
We pursued this final issue in Experiment 3 .
4 .
Experiment 3 While Experiment 2 focused on the spatial positioning of the global arrangement of waste categories , the current experiment focused on the spatial positioning of the items within the signs themselves for each bin .
Thus , waste bin categories were randomized , and the spatial positions of the yes items and no items were counterbalanced and Sign Style ( yes vs. “ yes/no ” for one group , yes vs. “ no/yes ” for the other group ) .
In light of our observation that response efficiency may be compromised for yes/no icon signs we expected that randomization on yes/no con- sistency may be most evident for the iconic images .

Methods Except where noted , the methods used were the same as in Experiment 2 .
4.1.1 .
Participants Twenty-six university students ( mean age=20.0 years , sd= 2.7 , range=18–29 ; 22 female ; 24 right handed ) participated in a 30-min session for course credit or $ 5 CAD .
4.1.2 .
Stimuli Half of the yes/no signs in this experiment had yes items on the left and no items on the right , and the other half had the reverse , with waste category randomized across trials and yes/no order counterbalanced across participants .
Otherwise , the stimuli were the same as in Experiment 2 .

Results A 2-way within-subjects ANOVA was conducted on efficiency scores , with Sign Style ( yes vs yes/no ) and Image Rendering ( picture vs icon ) as within-subjects factors.4 The results are presented in Table 4 .
There was a significant interaction of Sign Style x Image Rendering ( F ( 1,25 ) =7.7 , p < .05 , ηp2=0.24 ) .
However , the main effects of Sign Style and Image Rendering factors were not significant ( F 's < 1 ) .
To investigate the source of the interaction , we conducted two paired t- tests with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons .
The difference between yes and yes/no styles for the icon rendering was significant ( mean difference=175.3 , std.error=68.1 , p < .05 , d=0.50 , 0.95CI= [ 12.9 , 337.7 ] ) .
However , there was no statistically significant difference between yes and yes/no styles for the picture Rendering ( mean difference=−95.0 , std.error=87.1 , p= .57 , d=0.21 , 0.95CI= [ −302.7 , 112.7 ] ) .

Discussion This experiment revealed that iconic yes/no signs results in less efficient response decisions than iconic yes signs .
In contrast , response efficiency for pictures was the same for yes/no and yes signs .

Journal of Environmental Psychology 58 ( 2018 ) 77–85 82 pattern of results confirms the observation hinted at in Experiment 2 .
Why should yes/no iconic signs interfere with response efficiency ?
We suggest that it is because the colour used to convey yes/no response information is especially salient for iconic signs , as they are otherwise colourless , drawing attention to colour and away from the waste cate- gory form information .
In short , the conspicuity of the colour in- formation in the iconic renderings can distract attention away from the form information that is necessary to first make the correct waste ca- tegory selection .
There is a wealth of controlled studies demonstrating precisely this result ( see Theeuwes , 2004 ; Theeuwes & Godijn , 2001 ; Theeuwes , Kramer , & Kingstone , A. , 2004 ; Yantis , 1996 ) .

General discussion Motivated by questions commonly encountered in jurisdictions and institutions seeking to reduce waste , this study sought to examine how signage might affect waste disposal behavior in two ways : 1 ) what type of information is conveyed ; and 2 ) how the information is conveyed .
In Experiment 1 , we found that signs conveying information with images or icons are better than signs conveying information with only words .
In Experiments 2 we found that displaying prohibited items along with permitted items did not yield a net benefit relative to signs that only contained permitted items , although consistent positioning of the four waste categories enhances sorting performance .
Experiment 3 picked up on the possibility that when bins are randomized , yes/no signs may actual interfere with response efficiency for iconic signs .
This possibility was tested , and confirmed , in Experiment 3 .
Collectively our experiments show that some basic design features of signs can have an impact on sorting performance , specifically , whether the signs use words or images and whether the signs are consistently positioned .
The increased sorting efficiency ( improved accuracy and reduced response time ) suggests a potential lower eco- logical footprint because higher sorting accuracy means reduced contamination in the waste streams , particularly in the compost , re- cycling , and garbage streams .
Less contamination in the compost , recycling , and garbage streams means that there is more waste di- verted from landfill and more materials to be re-used ( Hoornweg , Bhada-tata , & Kennedy , 2013 ; Zelenika , Moreau , & Zhao , 2018 ) .
However , not all changes have a profound impact .
We found that adding prohibited items to the signs did not improve a signs ' ability to influence response decisions , and can , in the case of icon signs , in- terfere with response behavior .
On this latter point we think it prudent to emphasize that there may also be a point at which yes/no signs for pictures also compromise decision making .
Yes/no signs convey more information than yes signs alone , and too much information can result in less attention being devoted to any one item , and with this the ability to comprehend and retain information declines – i.e. , “ in- formation overload ” ( Cole et al. , 1997 ; Rosenholtz , Li , & Nakano , 2007 ) .
It seems inevitable that displaying too much information on a waste disposal sign ( e.g. , displaying a large number of permitted and prohibited items ) will , at a certain point , lead to information overload and impair performance .
To the extent that yes/no signs double the amount of information on yes signs , the former risk impairing sorting performance more than the latter.5 In our view , waste disposal signage should be simple and comply with ergonomic principles like being brighter , having less clutter , and having larger font ( Argo & Main , 2004 ; Ben-Bassat & Shinar , 2006 ; Campbell , Cowley , Mayhorn , & Wogalter , 2007 ; Wogalter , Conzola , & Smith-Jackson , 2002 ) .
Un- fortunately , many of these yes/no signs encountered in the real world are extremely cluttered with far more information being displayed than those in the present study ( see Fig .
4 above ) .
Furthermore , we think that it is appropriate to ask if , and to what extent , our findings will replicate across different demographics and cultures , as well as sorting behaviours in the real-world context .
There is no question that exploring the boundary conditions of lab- based investigations drawn from a particular population sample is of importance ( Anderson , Lindsay , & Bushman , 1999 ; Falk & Heckman , 2009 ; Mitchell , 2012 ) , but we have good reasons to expect our pre- sent findings to apply to a broad and diverse range of individuals and real-world settings .
First , our study , while controlled , struck an im- portant balance between control and real-world relevance , by using sorting signage drawn from the local community and sorting guide- lines from the City of Vancouver , which itself is extraordinarily di- verse .
Second , our paradigms used motion tracking technology which required participants to pick up the item and place it into one of the bins .
This paradigm was designed to mimic real-world sorting beha- vior .
Finally , the effects observed in our study reflect differences be- tween conditions within the same participants ( i.e. , within-subject effects ) , which means that our findings are less susceptible to in- dividual or cultural differences .
Even when comparisons were be- tween-subjects , participants were randomly assigned to each condi- tion , which means that any variation between individuals should be equal in each condition .
While the information provision literature on the effectiveness of icons and images has long known that basic changes in the character- istics of visual stimuli can affect information processing and therefore user performance , our study applies this theory into a novel context – waste disposal – where we find an avenue to make what at times can be a difficult and confusing task ( sorting waste ) unconsciously easier by altering the characteristics of signs .
5.1 .
Conclusion and future directions Our experiments reveal that basic design features of waste signage can influence the efficiency of sorting behavior .
We began answering questions found commonly across institutions seeking to standardize waste signage in order to facilitate sorting behavior .
Despite our ex- periments being only exploratory in nature , they help inform institu- tions in their decisions regarding the creation of effective waste disposal signage .
This series of experiments represents an initial and exploratory step towards creating standardized waste disposal signage .
Many questions remain unanswered .
For example , there appear to be cultural differ- ences in the comprehension of traffic signs ( Shinar et al. , 2003 ) .
Do such differences also exist in waste disposal signage ?
This is an im- portant question for highly multicultural jurisdictions such as New York and Chicago in the USA , and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada .
Sub- sequent studies could also look at whether increasing the ease of in- formation processing of waste disposal signs can also influence the subjective appeal of the signs and the task , as has been recently de- monstrated in other contexts ( McDougall et al. , 2016 ) .
Making both the task of disposing waste easier and more attractive can have profound practical implications .
Another useful next step will be to test how waste signage influences behavior in uncontrolled real-world settings , as opposed to the present controlled environment ( see e.g .
Kline & Beitel , 1994 ) , since waste disposal behavior in the real world can differ drastically from experimental settings ( Wu , DiGiacomo , Lenkic , Wong , & Kingstone , 2016 ) .
Critically , the present study provides an empirical framework within which findings in the natural world can be con- textualized .
The impact of “ familiarity ” of signs has yet to be explored in the waste disposal context .
Given literature suggesting that familiarity is perhaps the most important characteristic of icons in impacting user performance , the study and creation of standardized waste disposal signs are , in our view , critically important .
5 Indeed , in an early pilot experiment ( N=25 ) with cluttered signs dis- playing much more information than in the experiments in this study , we dis- covered that performance with yes/no signs led to significantly worse sorting efficiency than yes signs .
