The present research introduces a novel predictor of environmentally friendly behavior : atti- tudes toward the prototypical environmentalist , or the favorability of a mental image someone has of the typical , representative environmentalist .
Based on previous findings linking prototype attitudes to behavior , we expected positive attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes to predict greater envi- ronmentally friendly behavior .
In addition , the current studies used not just explicit , direct self-reports of attitudes , but also indirect measures of implicit attitudes , which are less intentional , less controllable , and less deliberate .
As expected , Studies 1 and 2 showed that positive implicit and explicit attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist predict self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors .
In Study 2 , positive implicit and explicit prototype attitudes also predicted greater likelihood of donating to an environmental charity .
These findings provide the first demonstration of the utility of prototype models in environmentalism .

Introduction Environmentally friendly human behavior is critical for the health of the planet ( Dietz , Gardner , Gilligan , Stern , & Vandenbergh , 2009 ; Vlek & Steg , 2007 ) .
Most people accept this view and report high levels of concern about environmental issues ( Yeager , Larson , Krosnick , & Tompson , 2011 ; Pew Research , 2011 ) .
But these pro-environment attitudes do not necessarily translate to actual behavior ( Knussen & Yule , 2008 ; Rabinovich , Morton , & Postmes , 2010 ) .
Worldwide , less than 25 % of recyclable waste is recycled ( Worldwatch Institute , 2004 ) , few people use energy efficient lightbulbs ( IEA , 2008 ) , household energy consumption continues to climb ( IEA , 2008 ) , and only 1e2 % of food product sales qualify as sustainable ( Radman , 2005 ) .
In the United States , 76 % of employed adults drive to work alone rather than carpooling or taking public transit , bottled water consumption is rising steadily ( Rodwan , 2012 ) , recycling rates have flattened or slightly declined ( EPA , 2013 ) , and , despite meat consumption 's potential to harm the environment ( Marlow et al. , 2009 ) , only about 3 % of people follow a vegetarian diet ( Vegetarian Times , 2008 ) .Behavioral scientists have identified a wide variety of psycho- social factors that predict environmentally friendly behavior ( see Steg & Vlek , 2009 ; for a review ) including values and moral con- cerns ( Bolderdijk , Gorsira , Keizer , & Steg , 2013 ; de Groot & Steg , 2007 ; Dunlap , Van Liere , Mertig , & Jones , 2000 ; Perlaviciute & Steg , 2015 ) , social norms ( Bator , Tabanico , Walton , & Schultz , 2014 ; Cialdini , Reno , & Kallgren , 1990 ) , affect ( Steg , 2005 ) , envi- ronmental knowledge ( Cheng & Wu , 2015 ) , habit development ( Aarts & Dijksterhuis , 2000 ) , and temporal focus ( Baldwin & Lammers , 2017 ) .
The present research examines an additional fac- tor that might influence people 's environmentally friendly behavior : how one feels about environmentalists .
More specifically , we hypothesize that people will engage in environmentally friendly behavior to the extent that they have positive attitudes toward the most central , representative e i.e. , prototypical e environmentalist .
To support this hypothesis , we turn to the growing literature on prototypes and prototype-behavior relations.1.1 .
Prototypes and behavior A prototype is an exemplar of a category that comes most easily to mind ( Rosch , 1973 ) .
For example , when one thinks of the cate- gory “ pets ” it is likely that a dog or a cat comes to mind , rather than K.A .
Ratliff et al .
/ Journal of Environmental Psychology 51 ( 2017 ) 132e140 133an orangutan or a flying squirrel , even though the latter two could fit into the category .
Consistently , when asked “ do you like pets ? ” a person 's response is likely to be the same as if they were asked “ do you like cats and dogs ? ” because cats and dogs represent proto- typical members of the category ( Rosch , 1973 ) .
People also have prototypes of social categories ( e.g. , professors , bank tellers , smokers ) .
This is a mental image of the representative person whom they think of when think of the category .
Social prototypes can differ widely ; one person 's prototypical smokermay be fun and cool , and another person 's may be boring and uncool ( Gerrard , Gibbons , Stock , Lune , & Cleveland , 2005 ) .
The Prototype- Willingness Model of behavior ( PWM ; Gerrard , Gibbons , Houlihan , Stock , & Pomery , 2008 ) suggests that differences in evaluations of these prototypes predict differences in willingness and likelihood of engaging in relevant behaviors .
For example , in one study of teenagers , positive prototypes of smokers ( e.g. , as cool , fun ) pre- dicted teens ' willingness to smoke cigarettes and , subsequently , their actual smoking behavior ( Gerrard et al. , 2005 ) .
Researchers have observed a similar influence of prototypes on behaviors ranging from alcohol use ( Spijkerman , Larsen , Gibbons , & Engels , 2010 ) to exercise ( Ouellette , Hessling , Gibbons , Reis-Bergen , & Gerrard , 2005 ) .
The present studies use the Prototype-Willingness Model ( PWM ) to understand how attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist relate to environmental behavior .
We expect that positive attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist will be associated with greater self-reported engagement in environmen- tally friendly behaviors ( Studies 1 and 2 ) and greater likelihood of donating money to an environmental charity ( compared to other charities ; Study 2 ) .
The PWM has largely been used to measure health behaviors .
Thus , one important contribution of the present work is to extend its applicability to environmental behavior .
There is a small , but important , distinction between stereotypes , which are beliefs about the nature of all members of a group ( Hamilton , Dugan , & Trolier , 1985 ; Hilton & von Hippel , 1996 ; Stangor & Schaller , 1996 ; van Knippenberg & Dijksterhuis , 2000 ) and prototypes , which are beliefs about the typical member who represents a group ( Gerrard et al. , 2005 ; Rosch,1973 ) .
Nevertheless , the stereotyping literature supports the general idea that attitudes toward , and beliefs about , the prototypical environmentalist will influence behavior .
Most related to the present work , Bashir , Lockwood , Chasteen , Nadolny , and Noyes ( 2013 ) found that nega- tive stereotypes of environmental activists lead people to avoid affiliating with them .
Subsequently , these participants were also less motivated to adopt pro-environmental behaviors when such behaviors were advocated by “ a typical environmentalist ” .
The present work builds on this initial finding in two important ways .
First , we measure participants ’ actual behavior rather than inten- ded or hypothetical behavior .
Second , we include implicit measures of attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes , a point we turn to next .
1.2 .
Implicit and explicit measures of prototypes The current research investigates the predictive power of both implicit and explicit measures of attitudes toward prototypes .
We define explicit measures of attitudes as those where participants ' responses are largely intentional , controllable , and subject to deliberate introspection .
Implicit measures of attitudes , on the other hand , are those where participants ’ responses are largely unintentional , uncontrollable , or outside of conscious awareness ( De Houwer & Moors , 2012 ; Gawronski & De Houwer , 2013 ) .
Because implicit measures of attitudes typically do not alert the respondent to what is being measured , or do not allow the respondent time to control their automatic response , they are idealfor detecting attitudes that people are otherwise unwilling or un- able to report ( Greenwald & Banaji , 1995 ) .
For simplicity , in this manuscript we will refer to the outcomes of explicit measures as “ explicit attitudes ” and the outcomes of implicit measures as “ im- plicit attitudes ” ( see De Houwer , 2006 , for further discussion of this distinction ) .
It is important to note that both implicit and explicit attitudes often inform behavior ( see below ) , and neither is a defi- nite reflection of a “ truer ” or “ real ” attitude .
Researchers rarely use implicit measures when assessing pro- totypes or environmental attitudes , and have never measured im- plicit attitudes of environmentalist prototypes .
Measuring attitudes toward implicit prototypes should expand explanatory power beyond more traditional explicit measures .
Evidence suggests that implicit and explicit attitudes have distinct predictive validity ( see Greenwald , Poehlman , Uhlmann , & Banaji , 2009 ; for a meta- analysis ) .
Implicit attitudes predict a wide-variety of important , real-world behaviors including White Americans ’ behavior in interracial interactions ( Dovidio , Kawakami , & Gaertner , 2002 ) , race-based disparities in physicians treatment of patients ( Green et al. , 2007 ) , the longevity of romantic relationships ( LeBel & Campbell , 2009 ) , suicidal behavior ( Nock et al. , 2010 ) , voting behavior ( Galdi , Arcuri , & Gawronski , 2008 ) , consumer decision making ( Maison , Greenwald , & Bruin , 2004 ) , and eating behavior ( Friese , Hofmann , & Wanke , 2010 ) .
Only a handful of papers that we know of have used implicit attitudes toward prototypes to predict behavior , but both provide strong evidence that it is useful to do so .
First , Ratliff and Howell ( 2015 ) demonstrated that implicit attitudes toward the prototypi- cal woman with tan skin predicted more variance in women 's re- ported sun behavior , planned sun behavior , willingness to engage and risky sun behavior , and tanning frequency than did explicit attitudes toward prototypes ( see also Howell & Ratliff , 2016 ) .
Then , Redford , Howell , Meijs , and Ratliff ( 2016 ) found that implicit atti- tudes toward the prototypical feminist explained variance in feminist behavior ( public identification , donating to a feminist or- ganization ) above and beyond explicit attitudes alone ( see also Weis , Zucker , Redford , & Ratliff , 2017 ) .
Both of these findings sug- gest that measuring implicit prototype-attitudes can maximize prediction of real-world behavior .
While there has been relatively little study of the role of im- plicit attitudes in environmental behavior , and none specifically regarding implicit prototypes , the work that does exist suggests the utility of implicit attitude measures in predicting environ- mentally friendly behavior .
For example , Panzone , Hilston , Sale , and Cohen ( 2016 ) found that explicit attitudes ( a measure of environmental concern ) predicted overall sustainable food shop- ping behavior , but decisions in single categories ( e.g. , bottled water ) were better predicted by more specific implicit attitudes .
More generally , the research suggests that implicit attitude measures are particularly useful in situations where self- presentation concerns might contribute to self-report ( Nosek , 2005 ) .
Consistently , there is evidence that individuals often inflate explicit pro-environment attitudes relative to their implicit attitudes ( Schlegelmilch , Bohlen , & Diamantopouls , 1996 ) .
For example , Siegrist , Keller , and Cousin ( 2006 ) showed that while people did not self-report negative attitudes towards nuclear en- ergy , measures of implicit attitudes suggested that they were opposed to nuclear energy .
Similarly , Beattie and Sale ( 2009 ) found that most participants ’ self-reported attitudes toward low carbon-footprint products were more favorable than their implicit attitudes .
Similarly , we suspect that people might be unwilling to report or unable to access unfavorable attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist .
As such , implicit measures should prove partic- ularly useful in this context .

The present research Based on previous work showing that implicit prototype- favorability is associated with relevant behavior ( Ratliff & Howell , 2015 ; Redford et al. , 2016 ) , we hypothesized that positive implicit attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist will be associ- ated with greater self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors ( Studies 1 and 2 ) and greater likelihood of donating to an environmental charity ( Study 2 ) .
Although we expect positive explicit attitudes to be related to environmental behavior in isolation , we do not know whether they will add explanatory power in the context of implicit attitudes .
Indeed , Ratliff and Howell ( 2015 ) found that only implicit attitudes toward prototypes were related to behavioral intention , while Redford et al .
( 2016 ) demonstrated the importance of both implicit and explicit attitudes toward prototypes .

Study 1 method Study 1 was designed as an initial test of the hypothesis that implicit prototypes would predict environmental behavior .
2.1 .
Study 1 participants Participants were 1346 volunteers at the Project Implicit research website ( https : //implicit.harvard.edu ; Mage ¼ 32.2 years , SD ¼ 13.3 , 65.8 % women , 71.1 % U.S. citizens , 81.0 % White ) who completed all study materials .
Project Implicit is a website re- searchers designed to conduct research and to promote education in the social and behavioral sciences .
Participants typically find the site through suggestion of friends , school or work assignment , or through links in news sources .
Participants complete demographic information upon registration , and are then randomly assigned to a study from a pool of studies .
Once they were assigned to this study , participants were again randomly assigned to respond to one of five prototype conditions , which we treat separately for data analysis .
In other words , each participant completedmeasures of only one potential characteristic of the prototypical environmentalist : attractiveness ( final N¼ 243 ) , coolness ( final N ¼ 260 ) , fun ( final N ¼ 243 ) , intelligence ( final N¼ 228 ) , or judgmentalness ( final N¼ 216 ) .
We chose the first four traits based on previous work utilizing the Prototype Willingness Model ( PWM ; e.g. , Ratliff & Howell , 2015 ; Redford et al. , 2016 ) and the latter , judgmental , because it is a common stereotype of envi- ronmentalists ( Bashir et al. , 2013 ) .
We chose a sample size of at least 200 participants per prototype condition a priori and ended data collection as soon as possible after reaching this target number ( because studies at Project Implicit are not removed from the website immediately upon request , the total sample size is a bit larger ) .
Our sample size allowed us to detect a small-to-medium effect size of rpartial ¼ 0.20 at 0.80 power in each prototype condi- tion ( sample size needed 189 ; Faul , Erdfelder , Lang , & Buchner , 2007 ) , and a small meta-analytic effect size at 0.80 power across conditions ( sample size needed 1221 , Faul et al. , 2007 ) .
This research was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board .

Study 1 materials and measures Implicit Measure of Environmentalist Prototype ( Speeded Self- report ; Ranganath , Smith , & Nosek , 2008 ) .
Prior to each trial , a brief orienting stimulus ( a series of X 's : ‘ XXXXX ’ ) appeared for 500 ms. Then , as a stimulus item appeared on the screen .
Participants responded to this stimulus using a 4-point scale corresponding to the 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 keys on the computer keyboard .
If participantsfailed to respond to the stimulus within a 1000 ms response deadline , a red X appeared and the next trial began automatically .
Prior research has fruitfully employed speeded self-report tasks as measures of implicit attitudes using similar response windows ( Bar-Anan & Nosek , 2014 ; Ho , Sidanius , Levin , & Banaji , 2011 ; Howell , Ratliff , & Shepperd , 2016 ; Nosek , Bar-Anan , Sriram , Axt , & Greenwald , 2014 ) .
Although people are aware of their responses on speeded self-reports , they also appear to be unable to control their responses .
Indeed , speeded self-reports are distinct from more controlled measures ( e.g. , the same reports without time pressure ) and consistently relate to other measures of implicit at- titudes ( e.g. , the Implicit Association Test ; Ranganath et al. , 2008 ) .
Participants were assigned to rate environmentalist stimuli on one of five response scales corresponding to the five prototypes : Attractive ( 1 ¼ Very unattractive , 2 ¼ Unattractive , 3 ¼ Attractive , 4 ¼ Very attractive ; Cool ( 1 ¼ Very uncool , 2 ¼ Uncool , 3 ¼ Cool , 4 ¼ Very cool ) ; Fun ( 1 ¼ Very boring , 2 ¼ Boring , 3 ¼ Fun , 4 ¼ Very fun ) , Intelligent ( 1 ¼ Very unintelligent , 2 ¼ Unintelligent , 3¼ Intelligent , 4¼ Very intelligent ) , Judgmental ( 1¼ Very tolerant , 2 ¼ Tolerant , 3 ¼ Judgmental , 4 ¼ Very judgmental ) .
Participants responded to the target word ( “ Environmentalists ” ) in 8e10 trials out of 60 total trials .
They also responded to eight distractor stimuli : bicyclists , politicians , Republicans , Democrats , vegetarians , lobby- ists , feminists , and professors .
See Appendix A for screen shot of the measure .
The instructions given to participants prior to the task were as follows : In this next part of the study you will judge words or pictures very quickly .
First , you will see “ XXXXXXXX ” in the middle of the screen .
Then there will be picture or word .
You will indicate how you feel about the picture or word using the 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 keys on your keyboard , as shown .
You simply press the key that corre- sponds to how you feel about that item .
As soon as you respond to one item , the next will appear .
You will have one ONE SECOND to respond to each item , so just go with your gut reaction and do n't be worried if you hit the wrong key from time to time .
If it takes you longer than one second to respond , a prompt will indicate that you need to go faster and then the next itemwill appear .
Remember this task goes very fast so stay alert .
We recommend that you use your left-hand fingers to press the “ 1 ” and “ 2 ” keys and your right hand fingers for the “ 3 ” and “ 4 ” keys ( take a second to try it now ) .
Please press the button below to begin .
We did not analyze data from participants who pressed the same number for every trial ( N ¼ 124 ) .
It was considered an error if participants did not respond to the stimulus item within the response window .
Of the remaining 1222 participants , the overall error rate was 21.1 % ( SD ¼ 16.7 ) , and the error rate on the target trials was 17.3 % ( SD ¼ 24.0 ) .
We then discarded data from 32 par- ticipants whose error rates were more than two standard de- viations from themean error rate on target trials , resulting in a total of 1190 participants .
Self-Reported Environmentalist Prototype .
The self-report mea- sure of prototypes was identical to the speeded report task except that : ( a ) therewas no time pressure , and ( b ) participants responded to each stimulus only once .
Self-Reported Environmentally Friendly Behavior .
Participants re- ported the frequency with which they engage in sixteen different environmentally friendly behaviors ( e.g. , I put my food scraps in a compost bin ; I use recycled printer paper ; see Appendix B for full scale .
Participants responded to each item on a 6-point scale with the following response choices : 1¼ Never , 2¼ Rarely ( about 25 % of the time ) , 3 ¼ Sometimes ( about 50 % of the time ) , 4 ¼ Usually ( about 75 % of the time ) , 5 ¼ Always , 6 ¼ Not applicable .
We com- bined participants responses to the items into a single numerical index ( coding 6 ¼ Not Applicable as missing ) of environmentally friendly behavior ( a ¼ 0.84 ; M ¼ 3.16 , SD ¼ 0.84 ) .

Study 1 procedure Participants were randomly assigned to this study from a pool of studies at the Project Implicit research site .
Participants read a consent form on screen that assured them of the anonymity of their data and that they could leave the study at any time by closing their internet browser .
Then , participants generated a mental image of a single person representing the prototypical environmentalist .
Par- ticipants then completed the explicit measure of environmentalist- prototypes , followed by the implicit measure of environmentalist- prototypes .
This order was fixed because we reasoned that seeing how the task was set up would reduce error on the speeded version .
Finally , participants completed the measure of their self- reported environmentally friendly behavior.1 Once a participant initiated the study session , they were no longer eligible to be assigned to this study again on subsequent visits to the website .

The results of this meta-analytic procedure suggested that there was an overall significant main-effect of both implicit , rpartial ¼ 0.18 [ 0.12 , 0.24 ] , and explicit , rpartial ¼ 0.11 [ 0.05 , 0.17 ] , prototypes , suggesting that more positive attitudes toward the prototypical environmen- talist were associated with greater environmentally friendly behavior .
These main effects were not qualified by an interaction rpartial ¼ 0.01 [ -0.05 , 0.07 ] .

Study 1 discussion Study 1 showed that people with more positive implicit atti- tudes toward environmentalist prototypes e on four of five traits ewere more likely to engage in environmentally friendly behavior .
Nevertheless , Study 1 was limited in two important ways .
First , the study examined prototypes between subjects .
Prototype studies often use measures of multiple prototypes to examine the extent to the positivity of participants ’ average prototype .
Second , the study examined self-reported behavior .
It is possible that participants with positive implicit prototypes of environmentalists are simply more likely to report that they engage in environmental behavior .
Study 2 was designed both to circumvent these limitations as well as to replicate the findings from Study 1 .

Study 2 method 4.1 .
Study 2 participants A small portion of participants ( 15 % ) participated in the lab and received credit toward a research requirement .
Early on , we recognized that wewould not be able to collect enough data during the course of the semester so we recruited an additional adults in public spaces on the university campus .
These participants received $ 1 payment for their participation .
No study variable differed significantly between paid and non-paid participants .
We collected data from as many participants as we could before the end of the semester .
This provided enough power to detect a small-to- medium effect size of rpartial ¼ 0.25 at 0.80 power ( sample size needed 129 ; Faul et al. , 2007 ) .
Researchers recorded donation behavior for 156 participants ; however , some cases were not link- able with other measures because participants did not enter a participant number .
Implicit prototypes were linkable via partici- pant number for 140 of those participants .
Of those 140 , 135 completed all self-report measures and are included in the analyses that include all three measures .
This research was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board .
4.2 .
Study 2 materials and measures Implicit Measure of Environmentalist Prototype ( Speeded Self- report ) .
The measure of implicit attitudes was identical to Study 1 with two exceptions .
First , all participants completed four proto- type measures ( cool , fun , intelligent , attractive ) .
We dropped judgemental from the method because it failed to predict Second , there were 20 total trials for each prototype ( 80 trials total ) , and participants responded to the target word ( “ Environmentalists ” ) between 4 and 12 times ( 1e3 times for each prototype ) .
Thirty-four participants made more than one error or entered the same response to every trial or on one of the prototypes .
Thus , we coded their data for that prototype as missing .
However , none of the participants made errors or entered the same response for every trial on all prototypes , so we retained and analyzed all participants data.2 We aggregated participant responses to the cool , fun , attractive , and intelligent prototypes into a single measure of pos- itive prototypes ( a ¼ 0.80 ) .
Self-Reported Environmentally Friendly Behavior .
Participants self-reported the frequency of their environmentally friendly behavior using the scale described in Study 1 .
We combined the items into a single numerical index of environmentally friendly behavior ( a¼ 0.74 ) .
Themean score on the self-reported behavioral measure was M ¼ 3.06 ( SD ¼ 0.55 ) .
Environmental Donation Behavior .
Participants completed a donation task designed to measure spontaneous environmental behavior .
After completing the computerized portion of the task , K.A .
Ratliff et al .
/ Journal of Environmental Psychology 51 ( 2017 ) 132e140 137participants received their $ 1 payment along with $ 1.25 to donate to charity .
All payments were made in quarters .
They donated the money to one of four charities : one supporting cancer research ( M ¼ 1.72 quarters , SD ¼ 1.78 ) , one supporting children and childhood education ( M¼ 1.70 quarters , SD¼ 1.42 ) , one supporting homeless animals and animal rights ( M ¼ 1.25 quarters , SD ¼ 1.41 ) , and one supporting environmental research and preservation ( M ¼ 0.68 quarters , SD ¼ 0.92 ) .3 Donation to the environmental charity was the primary outcome of interest.4.3 .
Study 2 procedure Researchers approached participants in public places and asked them to participate in a psychology study in exchange for $ 1 .
Re- searchers then escorted willing participants to a bank of laptop computers to complete the study.4 Participants read a consent form on screen that assured them of the confidentiality ( for lab partici- pants ) or anonymity ( for public participants ) of their data , and that they could leave the study at any timewithout penalty .
Participants were then asked to generate a mental image of a single person representing the prototypical environmentalist .
Participants completed the implicit prototype measures and the measure of their self-reported behavior in a counterbalanced order .
To disguise the true nature of the study , participants also completed a variety of items about topics like feminism , philanthropy , and volunteering ( related to the filler items in the speeded report task ) .
After par- ticipants completed the study , the researcher escorted them to a table with four jars on it , each labeled for a charity and full of $ 20 in quarters ( about ¼ of the jar ) .
In front of the jars were one-page print-outs about each of the charities and their goals .
The researcher told participants that an anonymous donor was going to donate money to each of the charities at the end of the study , and that participants got to decide where the money would go .
The researcher also indicated that all charities received highly positive reviews on http : //www.charitynavigator.org .
Next , the researcher gave participants five quarters and instructed that they could donate them in any way they desired .
The researcher then stepped away and unobtrusively observed and recorded howmany quarters participants donated in each jar .
Between participants , researchers took out donated quarters to equalize the number of quarters were in each jar and randomly shuffled the jars so that they did not have the same left-to-right configuration.5 .
Study 2 results Self-Reported Environmentally Friendly Behavior .
As in Study 1 , participants with more positive implicit prototypes of environ- mentalists were also more likely to report engaging in environ- mentally friendly behavior , r ( 144 ) ¼ 0.31 , p < 0.001 .
Environmental Donation Behavior .
Like most count-type behavior , quarter donation was both positively skewed , skewness ¼ 3.54 , SE ¼ 0.19 , and leptokurtic , kurtosis ¼ 20.32 , SE ¼ 0.39 .
As such , we used the non-parametric Spearman 's rho to assess correlation between prototype-favorability and donation behavior .
As expected , participants with more positive implicit prototypes of environmentalists were also more likely to donate quarters to the environmental charity , r ( 140 ) ¼ 0.29 , p < 0.001 .
Self-3 Some participants chose also to donate the dollar they received in payment to charity .
Analyzing the data with and without this extra donation produces the same pattern of results , so we have retained this additional donation behavior here .
4 Participants receiving participation credit for a research requirement scheduled an appointment to come to a room in a campus building and completed the study on a bank of desktop computers.reported environmental behavior was also positively related to participants ' donation behavior , r ( 140 ) ¼ 0.23 , p ¼ 0.009 , and im- plicit prototypes continued to predict donation behavior even when controlling for self-reported behavior r ( 132 ) ¼ 0.24 , p ¼ 0.005 .
Establishing discriminant validity , positive implicit envi- ronmentalist prototypes did not significantly predict donation be- haviors to the animal- , r ( 140 ) ¼ 0.14 , p ¼ 0.11 , children- , r ( 140 ) ¼ - 0.15 , p ¼ 0.07 , or cancer-related charities , r ( 140 ) ¼ -0.08 , p ¼ 0.37 , suggesting that implicit prototypes specifically predicted environment-related behavior .
6 .
General discussion In two studies , implicit and explicit attitudes toward environ- mentalist prototypes predicted two types of relevant outcomes : ( 1 ) self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors ( Studies 1 and 2 ) , ( 2 ) the amount participants donated to an envi- ronmental charity ( Study 2 ) .
These findings provide the first demonstration of the utility of prototype models in understanding environmental behavior .
They also advance an emerging literature on how attitudes toward implicit prototypes predict behavior ( e.g. , Ratliff & Howell , 2015 ; Redford et al. , 2016 ) .
Thus far , implicit prototypes have been shown to predict only UV behavior ( e.g. , tanning ; Ratliff & Howell , 2015 ) and feminist identification ( Redford et al. , 2016 ) .
As the first to link implicit prototypes to environmental behavior , the present work suggests the generality of implicit prototypes in predicting behavior and offers further evidence for the utility of measuring implicit prototypes .
The present work also suggests several possible future lines of inquiry .
First , future research should investigate whether attitudes toward prototypes moderate typical predictors of environmental behavior .
Prototypes may increase or decrease the effects of more structural or contextual predictors of environmental behavior .
For instance , research suggests that people are more likely to engage in environmentally friendly behaviors to the extent that they feel the behaviors are easy to implement ( e.g Fujii , 2006 ) .
If attitudes to- ward environmentalist prototypes are negative , even those who report that they want to engage in environmentally friendly be- haviors ( e.g. , recycling ) may acquiesce to difficult circumstances .
By contrast , if attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes are very positive , a person may recycle even if it is difficult , shielding them from the negative effects of difficulty .
Future research should also determine the conditions under which implicit and explicit attitudes each predict environmentally friendly behavior .
For example , implicit attitudes generally outperform explicit attitudes in predicting socially sensitive be- haviors ( Greenwald et al. , 2009 ) .
So , to the extent that people are motivated to report favorable attitudes toward environmentalists , implicit measures should predict behavior more strongly than explicit attitudes .
Implicit and explicit attitudes may also predict different aspects of behavior .
Implicit attitudes tend to be better predictors of nonverbal , spontaneous behavior ( e.g. , friendliness ; Dovidio et al. , 2002 ) than explicit attitudes , which perform better at predicting controllable behaviors ( e.g. , brand-related choices and voting , Brunel , Collins , Tietje , & Greenwald , 1999 ; for a meta- analysis , see Greenwald et al. , 2009 ) .
Thus , it might be that im- plicit and explicit a toward prototypes have different effects on environmentally friendly behaviors that differ in automaticity or controllability .
6.1 .
Research limitations Although the present study suggests unique predictive power of implicit prototypes in behavior , it remains to be seen whether the present effects would generalize in the context of other predictors .
K.A .
Ratliff et al .
/ Journal of Environmental Psychology 51 ( 2017 ) 132e140138In addition to prototypes and behaviors , the full Prototype- Willingness Model ( PWM ) includes attitudes and subjective norms as predictors of intentions , willingness , and behaviors .
Given that our focus here was on the contribution of prototypes to envi- ronmental behavior , with a specific focus on including implicit and explicit prototypes , we did not examine the full PWM .
Moreover , evidence consistently suggests that prototypes predict in addition to , and often more than , attitudes and subjective norms ( Gerrard et al. , 2008 ) .
Nevertheless , future studies should examine whether prototypes ( both implicit and explicit ) continue to predict behavior in the context of other measures ( e.g. , attitudes , subjective norms ) .
Anotherlimitation of the present work is that it was primarily correlational in nature .
Despite the clear relationship between environmentalist prototypes and behavior , it is impossible to infer that prototypes cause behavior .
Indeed , positive prototypes of en- vironmentalists might cause people to engage in more environ- mentally friendly behaviors .
This pattern is supported best by other work on the PWM , which implicates prototypes as causing behavior .
Nevertheless , in the present study we can not rule out the possibility that engaging in environmentally friendly behavior promotes pro-environmentalist attitudes .
Our second study offers at least some temporal precedent of measured environmentalist prototype attitudes in predicting a novel environmentally friendly behavior , consistent with the PWM .
Nevertheless , because we can not conclude causality , future studies should directly test the causal influence of prototype attitudes on environmentally friendly behavior .
Such causal evidence could come from studies using prototype- based interventions to increase environmentally friendly behavior .
The relationship between positive prototype attitudes and positive behaviors suggests that interventionists wishing to increase envi- ronmentally friendly behavior should consider how to promote positive implicit attitudes toward environmentalists .
Changing implicit attitudes often requires different means than changing explicit attitudes ( c.f .
Smith , De Houwer , & Nosek , 2013 ) .
For example , implicit attitudes change particularly well in response to associative retraining ( e.g. , Baccus , Baldwin , & Packer , 2004 ; Dijksterhuis , 2004 ) .
In the context of environmental behavior , associative retraining might consist of repeatedly pairing pictures of environmentalists with positive stimuli .
Doing so should lead to more positive implicit attitudes toward environmentalist pro- totypes and , subsequently , more environmentally friendly behavior .
One final limitation of the present results was that the order of presentation of implicit and explicit attitudes was fixed .
We chose to present explicit attitudes first followed by implicit attitudes so that participants could understand the task at hand prior to having to speed it .
Moreover , fixing the task order reduces error variance and makes it easier to find true relationships between variables .
Nevertheless , future studies should examine whether the order of presentation of implicit and explicit attitudes influences the extent to which they relate to environmental behavior .
7 .
Conclusion At the outset of this inquiry , we noted that despite the fact that most people are concerned about environmental issues ( Yeager et al. , 2011 ) , many do not engage in environmentally friendly behavior ( Knussen & Yule , 2008 ; Rabinovich et al. , 2010 ) .
The present work offers a novel way of understanding environmentally unfriendly behavior .
Specifically , it suggests that positive attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist relate positively to environmentally friendly behaviors .
Importantly , it implicates both implicit and explicit processes in predicting this behavior , suggesting that environmentally friendly behavior may derive both from controlled , thoughtful processes , but also from automatic , affective reactions to the types of people who actively engage in environmentally friendly behavior .
The present studies represent the first attempt to unite inquires about environmentalism with knowledge about prototypes and prototype models and implicit social cognition .
In so doing , it plants the seed for several potential future studies and offers potential targets for future interventions to predict and promote behavior that is crucial to the health of the planet .
