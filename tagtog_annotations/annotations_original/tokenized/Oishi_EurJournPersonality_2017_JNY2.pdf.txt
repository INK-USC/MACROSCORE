The present studies examined whether the experience of a natural disaster experience shifts people ’ s values and job preferences toward pro- social directions .
In Study 1 ( cross-temporal analysis ) , we analysed job application data in nine cities in Japan over 12 years and found that the popularity of pro-social occupations ( e.g .
firefighter ) increased after the Great Hanshin– Awaji Earthquake in 1995 , in particular the area hit hardest by the quake .
In Study 2 ( a large national survey ) , we found that Japanese respondents who had experienced a major earthquake are more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who never experienced a major earthquake .
Together , the current findings suggest that the experience of a major natural disaster shifts human values from the egocentric to the allocentric direction , which in turn could result in a social structure that values pro-social occupations .

Fujimoto became misty-eyed as he talked about the people who helped him recover after the storm .
“ It changed my perspective for life ” ’ ( Takashi Fujimoto , a survivor of Hurricane Sandy , December 1 , 2013 , New York Times ) .
Natural disasters such as earthquakes , hurricanes , tornadoes , floods , and volcanic eruptions are part of human life and history .
Humans have had to deal with them ever since their earliest times on Earth .
While modern technologies with advance warning systems and disaster preparation have reduced the number of victims dramatically , many people living in a modern society today are still faced with major natural disasters .
What kinds of effects does the experience of a major natural disaster have on humans ?
Does it have any effect on human values ?
From a socioecological perspective ( Gelfand et al. , 2011 ; Jokela , Rentfrow , Bleidorn , Lamb , & Gosling , 2015 ; Oishi & Graham , 2010 ; Rozin , 2003 ) , we examined these questions using cross-temporal analyses of job application data ( Study 1 ) and a national survey ( Study 2 ) .
It is true that much of the change in the labour market and occupational structure is typically determined by economic factors ( e.g .
a gradual shift from agricultural to manufacturing to service/technology industry in the United States from late 1800s to today ) .
However , our paper suggests that a natural disaster could shift people ’ s values ( or ‘ desirable transsituational goals , varying in importance , that serve as guiding principles in the life of a person ’ Schwartz , 1994 , p. 21 ) and occupational preferences , which in turn could result in a change in the occupational structure and social structure at large .
ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS AND HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY Recent studies have shown that ecological conditions appear to affect human psychology ( see Murray , 2014 ; Oishi , 2014 ; Oishi & Graham , 2010 ; Van de Vliert , 2013 for reviews ) .
For instance , nations historically high in pathogens such as India and Ethiopia are shown to be more collectivistic ( Fincher , Thornhill , Murray , & Schaller , 2008 ) , more conformative ( Murray & Schaller , 2011 ) , more religious ( Fincher & Thornhill , 2012 ) , and less extraverted/reward seeking ( Schaller & Murray , 2008 ) than those low in pathogens ( even controlling for GDP per capita ) .
The main idea is that environmental threats evoke adaptive psychological defense ; in threatening environments , there is a larger benefit to be collectivistic , conformist , religious , and less sociable than in non-threatening environments ( Murray , 2014 ) .
Like pathogens , a harsh climate poses environmental challenges .
Van de Vliert ( 2013 ) found that nations with a harsh climate and low economic resources tend to show less freedom , oppression of press ( media ) , and greater levels of ingroup favoritism and outgroup hate .
Gelfand and colleagues ( 2011 ) also found that natural disaster vulnerability was associated with tighter cultural syndromes ( i.e .
strong norms and severe punishment of deviant behaviours ) .

However , there are a plethora of experimental studies that manipulated perceived threat on similar outcome measures such as dogmatism ( e.g .
Vail , Arndt , Motyl , & Pyszczynski , 2012 ) .
It is also interesting to note that terrorist attacks such as 9–11 indeed induced a similar value change among Americans ( e.g .
outgroup hate ) and moralization in general ( Janoff-Bulman & Sheikh , 2006 ) .
Given that natural disasters are a type of threat and that threat is associated with value changes , they are likely to affect human values as well .
Because a natural disaster happens randomly , it is difficult for victims to understand why it happened ( see Neria , Galea , & Norris , 2009 ; Norris et al. , 2002 for reviews ) .
Many victims of Hurricane Katrina turned to God to explain their experiences ( Stephens , Fryberg , Markus , & Hamedani , 2012 ) .
Some victims of Hurricane Katrina also spontaneously mentioned caring for others , connection to others , community , and family ( Stephens , Hamedani , Markus , Bergsieker , & Eloul , 2009 ) .
An analysis of 1084 US bloggers before and after the September 11 attacks revealed that the bloggers used more socially oriented words such as friend , talk , and share after the 9–11 attacks ( Cohn , Mehl , & Pennebaker , 2004 ) .
These changes suggest that the 9–11 attacks made these bloggers more communal .
Interestingly , however , these changes lasted only roughly 2 weeks .
Most relevant to the current research , Uchida , Takahashi , and Kawahara ( 2014 ) conducted a large internet survey among Japanese young adults a few weeks after the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011 , when a Magnitude 9 earthquake hit the Tohoku area of Japan , followed by the massive tsunami , killing over 15 000 residents altogether .
They found that the majority of participants reported that their attitude toward life changed a lot ( 13 % ) or somewhat ( 45 % ) .
The majority of these participants ( 61.7 % ) also reported having already donated or considering donating for the 3–11 earthquake and tsunami .
Similarly , Tiefenbach and Kohlbacher ( 2015 ) found that respondents participating in disaster relief-related volunteering increased from 1 to 4 % and those making disaster relief-related donations increased from 6 to 32 % after the 3–11 earthquake .
These changes could be due in part to the increased demand for volunteer activities and donations .
However , these findings could also mean that the experience of a major natural disaster redirects human values away from self-indulgence toward pro-social values , at least for the short run .
Li , Li , Decety , and Lee ( 2013 ) conducted the first behavioural study to directly test whether the experience of a great natural disaster would change altruism among the victims of the great Sichuan earthquake ( 8.0 magnitude ) of May 2008 .
They found that the experience of the great earthquake did not have any effect on 6-year-old children ’ s altruistic behaviours .
However , the experience of the great earthquake significantly increased 9-year-old children ’ s altruistic behaviour ( i.e .
how many stickers children donated for another classmate ) assessed around 1 month after the earthquake .
In the second study , the pictures of the great earthquake made 9-year-olds more altruistic , whereas they did not make 6-year-olds more altruistic .
Thus , the experience of a great earthquake appears to increase altruism , at least among 9 years old .
Although natural disasters pose existential threats , it is important to distinguish between natural disasters and other types of existential threats .
One major difference is that people experience a natural disaster with many others , whereas mortality threat ( at least the way it is manipulated in the lab ) is often concerned with one ’ s own , as opposed to another ’ s , death ( e.g .
Jonas , Sullivan , & Greenberg , 2013 ) .
Similarly , a lot of post-traumatic growth research is concerned with victims of rape , child abuse , or other tragedies , which are often specific to the victims ; that is , the victims did not experience the same traumatic event with others together ( Janoff-Bulman , 1992 ) .
By nature , the experience of a natural disaster tends to be a collective , shared tragedy , whereas other types of threats ( rape , child abuse ) tend to be personal experiences .
Many victims of crime might become cynical about human nature and less trusting of others ( Janoff-Bulman , 1992 ) , whereas the victims of a natural disaster ( unless they became victims of violence aftermath of a natural disaster ) are less likely to become cynical about humanity .
It is noteworthy , however , that some victims of traumatic personal events find new meaning in life ( Janoff-Bulman , 1992 ; Linley & Joseph , 2011 ; Park & George , 2013 ) and engage in more pro-social behaviours than those who did not have traumatic personal events ( Frazier et al. , 2013 ) .
Similarly , older people who were reminded of their own mortality showed greater concern for future generations ( Maxfield et al. , 2014 ) .
Likewise , although mortality salience sometimes makes people more materialistic , it made people less materialistic when the fairness was primed ( Jonas et al. , 2013 ) .
Considering that victims of a natural disaster are in a threatening situation with others together , like people in the mortality salient and the fairness condition , victims of a natural disaster are likely to become more pro-social ( that is concerned about the well- being of others ) .
In sum , natural disasters are likely to present an existential threat to the victims .
Like other threats , natural disasters might make people more defensive , conservative , and collectivistic ( e.g .
ingroup favoritism , prosociality toward ingroup members ) .
However , considering the collective nature of the threat , we hypothesized that natural disasters would make people realize the importance of others , the significance of order and conformity , and more likely to pursue pro-social occupations ( that we define as the job whose primary goal is to benefit others ) .
THE PRESENT RESEARCH The present research investigated whether experiencing a major natural disaster changed people ’ s occupational choices .
Study 1 is a cross-temporal analysis of job application data in nine cities in Japan from 1989 to 2000 .
We tested whether the popularity of pro-social jobs increased after the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake in January 1995 , especially in the Kansai area devastated by the 1995 Earthquake and human values 259 Copyright © 2017 European Association of Personality Psychology Eur .

West et al .
called this design ‘ one of the strongest alternatives to the randomized experiment ’ ( p. 58 ) , as it can test whether the popularity of pro-social jobs increased suddenly using this model .
In Study 2 , using a large national survey , we examined whether people who had experienced any major earthquake ( the earthquake officially designated by Japanese government as a disaster of extreme severity ) were more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who never experienced any major earthquake .
In Study 2 , we also assessed participants ’ value-orientations .
Study 1 : Occupational popularity over time First , it is important to recognize that some natural disasters examined in the past such as the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011involved not only great natural disaster but also human-made disaster ( e.g .
the Fukushima nuclear meltdown , Federal Emergency Management Agency ’ s mishandling of the Hurricane Katrina ) .
In Study 1 , we examined the natural disaster with the minimum level of human disaster involved , namely , the 1995 Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake .
Second , previous research on natural disaster was limited to self-reports .
Most data were collected immediately after the great earthquake and tsunami .
Thus , it is unclear how long the change observed by previous researchers would last ( Burger & Palmer , 1992 ) .
If the experience of a great natural disaster indeed changes one ’ s values so profoundly , then it should result in some concrete behaviours .
One such behaviour might be an occupational choice .
An occupational choice is one of the most important decisions in one ’ s life that could represent one ’ s core values ( Rokeach , 1979 ; Sagiv , 2002 ) .
Extending the previous research that focused on the immediate change in attitude or behaviour following a natural disaster ( Li et al. , 2013 ; Tiefenbach & Kohlbacher , 2015 ; Uchida et al. , 2014 ) , we examined whether a major natural disaster had a lasting effect .
Specifically , we tested whether pro-social occupations ( e.g .
firefighter , kindergarten teacher ) have become more popular since the Hanshin Awaji Great Earthquake that took place on 17 January 1995 ( Magnitude 7.3 ) , which devastated Kobe , Nishinomiya , Akashi , and other surrounding areas in Kansai region of Japan ( over 6000 residents were killed ; over 43 000 residents were injured ) .
Because the demand for certain pro-social jobs ( e.g .
firefighters ) was likely to have increased after the earthquake , we analysed the acceptance rate ( i.e .
# of job offers/ # of applicants ) as the main dependent variable .
That is , we examined whether it has become more difficult to get a pro-social job after the earthquake .
To make the test stricter , we compared the popularity of pro-social occupations in the Kansai area of Japan with the popularity of pro-social occupation in the Kanto area from 1989 to 2000 , roughly 5 years before and after the 1995 earthquake .
In the Kansai area of Japan ( e.g .
Kobe , Osaka , Kyoto ) , many residents received direct damages , whereas in the Kanto area of Japan ( e.g .
Tokyo , Chiba , Kanagawa ) , residents did not receive any direct damages from the 1995 earthquake .
These are two major metropolitan areas in Japan , separated by roughly 300 miles .
We chose 10 cities , five from each region : Kobe , Nishinomiya , Akashi , Takatsuki , and Kyoto from the Kansai region , and Machida , Chiba , Kawasaki , Fujisawa , and Kamakura from the Kanto region .
These cities are matched roughly in terms of the population size and the median income .
We were unable to obtain the data from Kamakura .
Thus , the final data came from nine cities , five from the Kansai area ( Kobe , Nishinomiya , Akashi , Takatsuki , Kyoto ) , and four from the Kanto area ( Machida , Chiba , Kawasaki , and Fujisawa ) .
We looked at all the job application data in these nine cities and identified kindergarten teachers , social workers , fire Figure 1 .

Although there are many other pro-social jobs , other pro-social jobs are handled at the level of prefecture ( e.g .
elementary school teachers ) , or in private sectors ( e.g .
nurses ) where job data are not publicly available .
There were 72 data points for the pro-social jobs in the Kansai area , whereas there were 113 data points for the pro-social jobs in the Kanto area .
If the effect size f2 is .11 , the Kansai data have the statistical power of .80 ( two-tailed , alpha = .05 ) using the G*Power 3.192 ( multiple regression , fixed model with two predictors ) .
For the same effect size , the Kanto data have the statistical power of .94 .
When interpreting the results reported below , it is important to note that the fiscal year in Japan starts on April 1 , Year X and ends on March 31 , Year X + 1 .
For example , Fiscal Year 1994 starts on 1 April 1994 and ends on 31 March 1995 .
That is , the Great Hanshin–Awaji Earthquake took place in Fiscal Year 1994 .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figures 1 and 2 depict the number of applicants and acceptance rate for the pro-social jobs ( i.e .
firefighter , kindergarten teacher , social worker ) in the Kansai area and the Kanto area , separately , across the 10-year period .
First , we tested whether the acceptance rate for the pro-social jobs in Kansai area increased after the earthquake ( Fiscal Year 1994 ) using the regression discontinuity model analysis ( Bernal , Cummins , & Gasparrini , 2016 ; West et al. , 2000 ) .
Because the data were nested within each city , we used a multilevel random coefficient model using HLM 7.04 .
Specifically , our model was as follows : Level 1 ( within-city ) # of applicants = b00 + b10*year + b20*dis- continuity + e Level 2 ( between-city ) B00 ¼ γ00 þ e B10 ¼ γ10 B20 ¼ γ20 ; where year was centred around Fiscal Year 1994 ( i.e .
1992 = 2 , 1993 = 1 , 1994 = 0 , 1995 = 1 , 1996 = 2 etc . ) .
This variable captures a linear trend ( whether the acceptance rate decreased during this period linearly ) .
The discontinuity variable was a dummy code which had a value of 1 for Fiscal Year 1994 and afterward , and 0 until Fiscal Year 1993. γ 20 for Level 2 indicates the average discontinuity effect ( whether the acceptance rate suddenly decreased after Fiscal Year 1994 ) across the cities in the Kansai area .
First , the mean intercept , γ10 , was 14.646 ( SE = 2.160 ) , t ( 3 ) = 6.782 , p < .001 .
This means that in Fiscal Year 1994 , the acceptance rate for prosocial jobs was on average 14.646 % .
This analysis further revealed that there was a marginally linear decrease in the acceptance rate for the pro-social jobs in the Kansai area , γ10 = .643 ( SE = .385 ) , t ( 69 ) = 1.671 , p = .099 .
This means that the acceptance rate went down on average by .643 % per year between 1989 and 2000 .
Most importantly , there was a significant discontinuity effect , or a sudden decrease in the acceptance rate after the earthquake in the Kansai area above and beyond the general trend toward lower acceptance rate , γ20 = 5.342 ( SE = 2.476 ) , t ( 69 ) = 2.158 , p = .034 .
The discontinuity effect was quite substantial ; in Fiscal Year 1994 , the acceptance rate dropped by 5.342 % .
That means , although the pro-social jobs became more and more popular and competitive over time , this trend accelerated after Fiscal Year 1994 , or around the Great Hanshin–Awaji Earthquake .
We repeated the above HLM analysis , this time in the Kanto area of Japan , where there was no direct effect of the Great Hanshin–Awaji Earthquake .
We ran this analysis to test whether the growing popularity of pro-social jobs was specific to the area most affected by the earthquake .
Because of the magnitude of the earthquake , there was extended media coverage of the earthquake throughout Japan .
Thus , it is reasonable to assume that this was a Figure 2 .
X-axis is fiscal year .
Y-axis is the acceptance rate in % ( % of applicants offered the position ) .

However , it is still reasonable to assume that the effect was most robust in the Kansai area .
The intercept , γ10 , was 19.841 ( SE = 2.269 ) , t ( 3 ) = 8.744 , p < 001 .
That is , the average acceptance rate for the pro-social jobs in the Kanto area was 19.841 % .
The results further showed a marginal linear trend such that pro-social jobs became more popular and competitive over time in the Kanto area as well , γ10 = 1.099 ( SE = .596 ) , t ( 110 ) = 1.844 , p = .067 .
That is , every year , the acceptance rate dropped by 1.099 % .
Unlike the Kansai area , the acceptance rate for the pro-social jobs did not drop significantly after the earthquake in the Kanto area , γ20 = 5.576 ( SE = 3.913 ) , t ( 110 ) = 1.425 , p = .157 .
In sum , pro-social jobs tended to become more popular and competitive between 1989 and 2000 in both the Kanto and the Kansai metropolitan areas .
However , the regression discontinuity design model analyses showed that the popularity and competitiveness of the pro-social jobs had a sudden surge after the Hanshin–Awaji Great Earthquake in the Kansai area but not in the Kanto area .
Study 2 : Occupational choice of major earthquake victims Another way to test our main idea is to test whether people who experienced a major earthquake ( living in the city/town where a major earthquake hit ) are more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who have never experienced a major earthquake .
To this end , we conducted a nationally representative survey in Japan .
Because Study 1 did not assess human values directly , we also included Schwartz ’ s ( 1994 ) 10 universal values .
METHOD Participants were 1500 Japanese ( 750 men , 750 women ) who lived in three areas : Tohoku ( Iwate , Miyagi , and Fukushima prefectures ) , Kanto ( Tokyo , Chiba , and Kanagawa prefectures ) , and Kansai ( Kyoto , Osaka , and Hyogo prefectures ) area .
They were selected from members of a research panel of an online research company .
We sampled Tohoku , Kansai , and Kanto areas because most residents in these areas , especially Tohoku and Kansai , have first-hand experience with a major earthquake .
The mean age was 44.44 ( SD = 13.63 , Range = 20 to 69 ) .
We expected that the effect size would be quite small ( e.g .
d = .20 ) .
Assuming the true effect size of d = .20 , our sample had the statistical power of .97 .
In December 2012 , the participants completed an online survey mainly on political attitudes and voting .
We assessed respondents ’ values by asking them to rank-order Schwartz ’ s ( 1994 ) 10 universal values ( power , achievement , hedonism , stimulation , self-direction , universalism , benevolence , conformity , tradition , and security ) from 1 = most important to 10 = least important ( for the data analyses below , we reversed the ranks , so that the larger number indicates more importance , as in Oishi et al. , 2007 ) .
After answering all the political attitudes , voting , and value questions , participants read the list of a major earthquake to which the Severe Disasters Act was applied ( i.e .
Sanriku–Haruka–Oki , Hanshin–Awaji , Niigata Prefecture–Chuetsu , Noto–Hanto , Nigataken–Chuetsu–Oki , Iwate–Miyagi–Nairiku , and Higashi–Nihon ) , and indicated whether they lived in the area hit by each earthquake at the time of the earthquake ( yes/no ) .
Among our participants , 903 participants ( 60.2 % ) experienced at least one major earthquake , whereas 597 ( 39.8 % ) did not experience any major earthquake .
At the end of the survey , participants indicated their occupation , followed by 10 questions about their job on a 7-point scale ( 1 = not at all true ; 7 = very true ) : ( i ) it requires higher education ; ( ii ) it requires skills ; ( iii ) it has large responsibilities ; ( iv ) it is a well-paid job ; ( v ) it is a job well-respected by people ; ( vi ) it makes a large contribution to society ; ( vii ) it is a job that has a large impact on society ; ( viii ) it uses a great deal of creativity ; ( ix ) it has a great deal of autonomy and ( x ) it has lots of power .
These items were taken from the 11-item job characteristics scale used by the 1995 social class and social mobility survey in Japan ( see http : //www.sal.tohoku.ac.jp/~tsigeto/ssm/reports.html # 5 for the original survey ) .
One item ‘ It is cool ’ was not included in this survey because it was deemed irrelevant .
Items 5 , 6 , and 7 capture pro-sociality ( α = .85 ) , whereas the rest are concerned with power and status ( α = .82 ) .
Two coders ( the second author and an undergraduate RA ) independently classified each participant ’ s occupation into two categories : pro-social ( 1 ) or other ( 0 ) .
The data file that these two coders received for coding did not include any other information besides participants ’ ID and occupation .
Thus , although the second author was aware of the hypothesis , her coding was in no way affected by her knowledge of the hypothesis .
The undergraduate RA was not aware of the hypothesis .
The pro-social occupations were social welfare ( e.g .
social worker ) , health care ( e.g .
doctor , nurse ) , education ( e.g .
teacher , instructor , coach ) , and public welfare ( e.g .
police officer ) .
Two coders were able to code reliably , κ = .935 , p < .001 .
There were 15 cases of disagreement out of 1500 cases .
These disagreements were subsequently resolved by a discussion between the two coders .
We used the consensus coding below ( see the Supporting Information for the full coding ) .
The results are virtually identical to either coder ’ s original coding .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION According to the consensus classification , there were 129 respondents with a pro-social job out of 1500 participants ( 8.6 % ) .
When we looked at the individuals who have never experienced any major earthquake , 39 out of 597 ( or 6.5 % ) had a pro-social job , whereas 90 of the 903 participants who experienced a major earthquake ( or 10 % ) had a pro- social job , χ2 ( 1 , 1500 ) = 5.39 , p = .020 .
Because there might be gender , age , and marital status differences in the propensity to have a pro-social job , we next conducted a binary logistic regression , regressing the pro- 262 S. Oishi et al .

31 : 258–265 ( 2017 ) DOI : 10.1002/per social job ( yes/no ) on participants ’ age , gender , marital status ( married = 1 ; others = 0 ) , as well as the major earthquake experience .
The result was virtually identical , as the experience of a major earthquake was the only significant predictor , b = .230 ( SE = .100 ) , Wald = 5.30 , p = .021 , Odds Ratio = 1.26 ( 95 % C.I = 1.04 ; 1.53 ) .
Thus , replicating and extending Study 1 , we found that individuals who have experienced a major earthquake are more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who have not experienced it .
Next , we analysed whether participants who experienced a major earthquake reported that their jobs are more pro- social than those who have not experienced .
As expected , participants who experienced a major earthquake reported that their jobs were more pro-social ( M = 3.73 , SD = 1.35 ) than those who did not ( M = 3.55 , SD = 1.43 ) , t ( 998 ) = 1.98 , p = .048 , d = .13 .
In contrast , the experiencers ( M = 4.02 , SD = 1.13 ) did not differ from non-experiencers ( M = 4.07 , SD = 1.13 ) in terms of the power dimension of their jobs , t ( 998 ) = .72 , p = .469 , d = .05 .
Because the power dimension and pro-sociality were positively correlated , r ( 998 ) = .69 , p < .001 , next we conducted a multiple regression analysis , predicting pro-sociality from power , as well as the experience of a major earthquake , gender , age , and marital status .
This analysis showed that the effect of the experience of a major earthquake remained significant , b = .108 , 95 % C.I = .045 ; .172 ( SE = .03 ) , β = .077 , t ( 994 ) = 3.35 , p = .001 .
Finally , we examined whether value orientation is different between those who experienced a major earthquake and those who did not .
First , a series of t-tests showed that participants who had experienced a major earthquake valued self-direction ( M = 6.37 , SD = 2.57 vs. M = 6.65 , SD = 2.50 ) and achievement ( M = 5.42 , SD = 2.38 vs. M = 5.68 , SD = 2.55 ) less than those who had not experienced any major earthquake , tself-direction ( 1498 ) = 2.11 , p = .035 , d = .11 , tachievement ( 1498 ) = 1.96 , p = .051 , d = .10 .
The experiencers valued conformity marginally more than non- experiencers , t ( 1498 ) = 1.67 , p = .095 , d = .09 .
The results were essentially the same when we statistically controlled for age , gender , and marital status in multiple regression analyses , tself-direction ( 1495 ) = 2.18 , p = .030 , d = .11 , tachievement ( 1495 ) = 1.95 , p = .052 , d = .10 , tconformity ( 1495 ) = 1.55 , p = .121 , d = .08 .
Overall , the Japanese who experienced a major earthquake were less individualistic and more collectivistic than those who did not .
Therefore , these results conceptually replicated Study 1 findings .
GENERAL DISCUSSION From a socioecological perspective ( Gelfand et al. , 2011 ; Jokela et al. , 2015 ; Oishi , 2014 ; Rozin , 2003 ) , the present research explored the relation between the experience of a natural disasters and life perspectives using multiple methods .
Previous research has provided suggestive evidence that the experience of a major natural disaster changes human values .
For instance , the experience of a major earthquake appears to increase altruism among 9 years old children ( Li et al. , 2013 ) .
Japanese have donated money and engaged in volunteer work more after the Great East Japan Earthquake ( Tiefenbach & Kohlbacher , 2015 ; Uchida et al. , 2014 ) .
However , it is not yet known whether the change in human values seen in the previous research is a short-term or a lasting change .
Furthermore , it is unclear whether it translates into an important life outcome such as occupational choice .
Finally , the increase in donation and volunteerism observed in the previous research could be due in large part to the increased demand for such activities .
Building on recent research on natural disasters ( Neria et al. , 2009 ; Stephens et al. , 2012 ) , the current research has examined a simple yet important question : can the experience of a major natural disaster change human values , including one ’ s occupational choice ?
In order to explore whether the experience of a major natural disaster could change human values in the long run , we examined occupational preferences in Study 1 .
Specifically , we tested whether occupational popularity has changed before and after the 1995 Hanshin–Awaji Earthquake , using the job application data collected from nine cities from 1989 to 2000 in Japan .
We found that pro- social occupations have become more popular after 1995 , and this was particularly true in the Kansai area hit heavily by the 1995 earthquake .
Because the job market is sensitive to various other factors , most notably the economic prospects and job demands in a particular year , the fluctuation in job application data could be influenced by idiosyncratic factors , the factors specific to a particular year or region .
Thus , it was desirable to corroborate the job application data with people who experienced different natural disasters in different years .
In Study 2 , we conducted a large national survey and examined whether individuals who experienced a major earthquake ( out of several major earthquakes that took place in different years ) were more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who never experienced a major earthquake .
Study 2 replicated and extended Study 1 by showing that ( i ) Japanese respondents who had experienced a major earthquake were indeed more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who have never experienced a major earthquake ; ( ii ) described their jobs to be more pro-social and ( iii ) endorsed individualistic values such as self-direction and achievement less and collectivistic values such as conformity ( marginally ) more strongly than the non-experiencers .
In sum , our studies show that the experience of a major earthquake appears to have changed people ’ s job preferences toward the pro-social direction .
We demonstrated this by using diverse methods , including actual job application data ( Study 1 ) , and a large national survey ( Study 2 ) .
The effect sizes were small for value orientations ( Study 2 ) .
In contrast , the effect sizes for Study 1 were substantial , as the number of applicants tripled before and after the earthquake ( roughly 100 applicants in 1990 , 1991 , 1992 ; well over 300 applicants in 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 ) , and the acceptance rate of the pro- social occupations went down significantly ( from over 20 % to less than 10 % ) .
The current findings have several important implications for research on social ecology and human values .
First , the previous research appears to show that one-dimensional self-selected events such as educational and occupational Earthquake and human values 263 Copyright © 2017 European Association of Personality Psychology Eur .
J. Pers .
31 : 258–265 ( 2017 ) DOI : 10.1002/per transitions did not change value orientations , whereas multi- dimensional self-selection events such as migration did ( Bardi , Buchanan , Goodwin , Clabu , & Robinson , 2014 ) .
Natural disasters are not self-chosen events .
They are different from self-chosen life events in several important ways .
First , in the case of self-chosen events such as education and occupational transitions , individuals have concrete expectations and envision the new life in advance .
That is , people imagine what it would be like to be in a university , for instance , and have very specific assumptions about what they would be doing , what would be expected of them , and so forth .
In contrast , natural disasters often happen unexpectedly .
Even though Japanese are familiar with earthquakes and in a vague sense expect them to occur once in a while , people do not live their lives anticipating an earthquake every day .
Research on hedonic adaptation shows that expectation and explanation play a key part .
That is , people adapt to an event when they can explain away why that event happened ( Wilson & Gilbert , 2008 ) .
Unexpectedness along with the difficulty of explaining why a natural disaster happened might have contributed to the potency of such events to affect human values .
Second , just as a migration to a new country affects many aspects of one ’ s life ( Bardi et al. , 2014 ) , a major earthquake affects one ’ s entire life , ranging from job , to family , to community .
The many aspects of life that a major natural disaster affects might be a reason why it changes human values .
It is also important to explore in the future the effect of self-selected and non-self-selected events on value and personality changes , and clarify the factors that contribute to changes in human values and personality .
The present findings in the context of the existing findings ( e.g .
Bardi et al. , 2014 ) , then , suggest that unexpectedness , multi-dimensionality of an event , and non- self-selection might be key .
Third , it is well recognized that occupational choices reflect one ’ s value orientations ( Rokeach , 1973 ; Sagiv , 2002 ) .
However , so far research has not examined the possibility that the experience of a major natural disaster changes one ’ s occupational preferences .
Our studies showed that the experience of a major earthquake shifted the population ’ s occupational preferences toward pro-social occupation .
These findings are consistent with the earlier findings that victims of Hurricane Katrina spontaneously mention community ( Stephens et al. , 2009 ) and that bloggers used socially oriented words such as ‘ friends ’ and ‘ share ’ after the 9–11 attacks ( Cohn et al. , 2004 ) .
As occupation is one of the most important life outcomes ( Roberts , Kuncel , Shiner , Caspi , & Goldberg , 2007 ) , it is beneficial to use occupational choice as an indicator of human value orientations in the future .
Finally , it is important to note that a small shift in the popularity of pro-social occupations could have a large societal consequence .
As pro-social occupations become more popular , it is likely that the prestige of such occupations will go up also .
As the prestige and popularity grow , more schools are likely to offer training programs for such occupations ( e.g .
social workers , teachers ) .
In the long run , this could affect occupational and social structure at large .
Based on Park and Peterson ’ s ( 2010 ) work on head ( e.g .
love of learning , creativity , curiosity ) vs. heart ( e.g .
love , forgiveness , fairness ) cities and Jokela and others ’ work on selective migration ( Jokela , 2009 ; Jokela , Elovainio , Kivimäki , & Keltikangas-Järvinen , 2008 ; Motyl , Iyer , Oishi , Trawalter , & Nosek , 2014 ) , it is easy to imagine that disaster-ridden cities might become more of the ‘ heart ’ cities and attract ‘ heart ’ persons over time .
This in turn could make disaster-ridden cities have quite different vibes than disaster- free cities ( cf .
Oishi , 2015 ) .
In the future , it is important to explore how value changes at the level of the individual will result in changes in social structure in the long run .
Before concluding , it is important to recognize limitations of the current research and future directions .
First , the present research does not reveal the exact mechanism through which the experience of a major earthquake translates into a change in job preferences .
Was it the experience of needing someone ’ s help that enhanced a pro-social value , which led the victims to pursue a pro-social occupation ?
Was it the heroism of firefighters , doctors , and nurses that changed their course ?
Second , Study 2 was a cross-sectional study .
Thus , any unmeasured third variables could explain our findings .
For instance , it is possible that structural changes caused by the earthquake ( e.g .
residential relocation to another region , different rates of job vacancies , disruption in education ) could have caused the differential popularity of prosocial occupations between earthquake experiencers and non-experiencers .
It is ideal to follow victims of a major earthquake over time to see if their values and occupational preferences change over time .
Finally , it is important to explore other major life experiences that might transform job preferences in a similar way ( e.g .
terrorist attack , Bonanno , Galea , Buchiarelli , & Vlahov , 2006 ) .
Natural disasters such as earthquake and hurricane are a part of human life .
If the goal of personality psychology is to understand individual differences in human mind , feelings , and behaviours , then it is critical to investigate psychological changes and individual differences associated with the experience of a major natural disaster .
