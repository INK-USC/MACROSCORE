Decay or resilience ?
The long-Term social consequences of conflict-related sexual Violence in sierra leone By carlo Koos* IntroductIon HisTory has been witness to plenty of civil wars in which large-scale rape of civilians by soldiers , rebels , and militias occurred either as part of a strategy for opportunistic reasons or because rape became an established practice.1 yet little is known about the social consequences of wartime sexual violence.2 This article examines the long-term consequences of widespread conflict-related sexual violence ( crsv ) in sierra leone .
Does crsv destroy the social fabric of commu- nities as is often claimed , or are victims , families , and communities able to overcome such traumatic events and demonstrate resilience ?
What do crsv victims and their families do to remain part of their commu- nities ?
These questions are significant , particularly in postconflict so- cieties where the state is often absent and people must rely on and cooperate with each other .
The feminist literature provides the most established and developed ideas on these questions and suggests that crsv , most often rape by armed groups , is associated with stigma and results in social exclusion.3 This notion is the dominant view of feminist scholarship and within the development community , and in this article i refer to it as the de- cay mechanism .

Using data on 5,475 Sierra Leonean households , the author finds that exposure to CRSV increases prosocial behavior—cooperation , helping , and altruism—which supports the resilience hypothesis .
The results are robust to an instrumental variable estimation .
The ramifications of this finding go beyond the case of Sierra Leone and generate a more general question : What makes communities resilient to shocks and trauma ?
ABSTRACT This article examines the long-term impact of conflict-related sexual violence ( CRSV ) on prosocial behavior in Sierra Leone .
Two theoretical arguments are developed and tested .
The first draws on the feminist literature and suggests the presence of a decay mechanism : victims and their families are stigmatized by their community and excluded from social networks .
The second integrates new insights from social psychology , psychological trauma research , and anthropology , and argues for a resilience mechanism .
It argues that CRSV-affected households have a strong incentive to remain part of their community and will invest more effort and resources into the community to avert social exclusion than socIal consequences of sexual vIolence 195 4 cohen and Hoover Green 2012 ; Hoover Green 2012 .

First , the empirical evidence for this mechanism is based solely on small convenience samples and therefore potentially suffers from selection bias and a lack of representativeness.4 second , the the- oretical mechanism that sees exposure to crsv result in stigma and ex- clusion relies on two key implicit assumptions .
For one , it assumes that victims and their families do not make increased efforts to avoid social exclusion stemming from stigma .
For the other , it assumes communi- ties rigidly shun and exclude anyone associated with crsv , as if crsv suddenly becomes the sole feature of a victim and his or her family , re- placing all previous identities and relationships .
But whether these two assumptions hold is far from certain .
This article addresses both of these problems .
First , i develop a the- oretical argument that builds on the decay mechanism .
i suggest taking into account the adaptive capabilities of individuals , families , and com- munities when dealing with shocks or trauma such as crsv.5 i do not deny that stigmatization occurs , but i argue that a sense of belonging and being part of a community is such a fundamental human need that crsv victims and their families engage in high levels of prosocial behav- ior—investing time and resources into community affairs—to avert the negative effects of stigma and thus avoid social exclusion.6 Further , i ar- gue that communities generally are not as heartless and value-rigid as the decay mechanism suggests simply because most communities have reconciliation mechanisms in place that help to address and resolve the disruption of values caused by crsv.7 i refer to this argument as the re- silience mechanism .
second , i aim to overcome the methodological constraints of pre- vious studies .
empirically , the analysis focuses on sierra leone , which is well-suited to studying the consequences of crsv .
During the civil war ( 1999–2002 ) , rape by armed groups , particularly the revolutionary United Front ( ruf ) , was rampant and affected all parts of the country and all levels of society .
i use representative household-level data from the 2011 sierra leone integrated Household survey ( slIhs ) to test both the decay and the resilience arguments.8 The analysis shows that households whose members were raped during the war engage more in prosocial behavior .
They are more likely to be members of commu- ht tp s : // do i.o rg /1 0 .

in addition , the analysis shows that crsv-affected households are as likely as unaffected households to receive the community ’ s help in times of need , which speaks against the idea of social exclusion .
These effects of crsv are in- dependent of other forms of violence , including killings , mutilation , and displacement , and are robust to an instrumental variable estima- tion , which uses the exogenous distance to mining areas as an instru- ment for crsv exposure perpetrated by the ruf .
Ultimately , i find unbiased evidence for the resilience argument .
To illuminate the underlying mechanisms , i provide qualitative accounts that community acceptance of crsv survivors and their families in si- erra leone has been facilitated through immense peacebuilding efforts , women ’ s rights campaigns , and in particular , local-level reconciliation and cleansing rituals .
in terms of policy relevance , the article provides new insights into communities ’ adaptive capabilities when dealing with traumatic events like widespread crsv and adds to the growing dis- course on resilience by providing evidence that individuals , households , and communities in postconflict settings are able to absorb certain shocks and distress .
Using these local abilities will benefit the efficacy of humanitarian and development programs tremendously .
concepts , MechanIsMs , and hypotheses How does crsv affect victims ’ and their families ’ behavior and accep- tance in their community ?
Before turning to the proposed mechanisms , i define the two key concepts used in this article : prosocial behavior and crsv .
prosocIal BehavIor : defInItIons and Its usefulness In postconflIct socIetIes The notions of prosocial behavior , altruism , and cooperative norms have recently received much attention in social psychology9 and in empiri- cal peace and conflict research , particularly in microlevel studies on the consequences of violence.10 Broadly speaking , people , households , or groups act prosocially when their actions benefit other people .
essen- tially , prosocial behavior is the underlying individual element of widely used terms such as social cohesion , social fabric , and social capital.11 it ht tp s : // do i.o rg /1 0 .

Prosocial behavior comes in various forms , including providing assist- ance to people in need , sharing information and working with others , volunteering time and resources to nonprofit organizations , cooperat- ing to achieve shared goals , and donating to social causes .
at their core , prosocial acts are interactions between at least two people that involve a benefactor and a beneficiary .
From a measurement point of view , proso- cial behavior can be observed at the individual level .
common catego- ries of prosocial behavior include cooperation , helping , and altruism.12 Cooperation is understood as people participating in interdepen- dent relationships ( for example , an association or committee ) and co- ordinating their actions to achieve a shared goal that produces mutual benefits.13 For instance , in the context of a village , cooperation could manifest in the form of local farmers ’ associations aiming to share ma- chinery or labor , or health and education committees aiming to launch awareness campaigns .
Helping refers to a broader range of actions that includes favors and gifts for friends or acquaintances , and also to emer- gency help in dangerous situations .
Altruism is closely related to help- ing , but assumes that the helper does not expect any external reward for providing assistance .
it is conceived of as an act that is driven by the de- sire to serve others , whereas helping assumes reciprocity.14 an example of helping would be a financial contribution to a neighbor whose house was destroyed , to a young couple who married or had a child , or to fu- neral expenses .
in essence , the helper would expect a similar favor from the beneficiary if the situation were reversed .
altruism is best illustrated by donations from a helper with no presumption of reciprocity on the part of the ( perhaps anonymous ) beneficiary .
although there are myriad causes of prosocial behavior , dozens of re- cent empirical studies show that the experience of nonsexual violence in wars contributes to positive changes in cooperation and community participation.15 Because this article examines the social consequences of crsv , these findings are of particular relevance .
Possible explanations for the positive effects of violence on prosocial attitudes and behavior range from economic payoffs to shifts in norms toward one ’ s in-group , as well as to general changes in social preferences and psychology.16 12 schroeder and Graziano 2015a .

as such , social en- gagement is highly relevant in postconflict societies where the state is often not capable of providing public goods and services .
in such sit- uations , cohesive communities with high levels of prosocial behavior are better able to leverage resources to achieve common goals .
several studies show that higher levels of social cohesion are associated with in- creased economic development.17 conflIct-related sexual vIolence conceptualizing crsv is rather straightforward in a technical sense , but highly complex and contested in terms of its meanings and symbolic manifestations .
leading scholars largely agree on practical definitions of crsv .
i follow elisabeth Wood,18 who defines conflict-related sex- ual violence as “ sexual violence by armed organizations during armed conflict. ” armed organizations include state forces ( military , police , government-sponsored militias ) as well as nonstate actors ( rebels and militias ) .
sexual violence refers to “ [ r ] ape , sexual slavery , enforced pros- titution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization , or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity. ” 19 Dara cohen suggests differen- tiating between several aspects of crsv , for example , whether the sexual violence occurred in public or private , whether there was a single per- petrator or there were multiple ones , and whether an object was used to mutilate the victims.20 These variations have implications for the vic- tims , their families , the community , and the perpetrators themselves .
The question this article seeks to answer is whether crsv affects prosocial behavior , and if so , how ?
What theories , mechanisms , and empirical results does the existing literature offer on this particular re- lationship , and on the broader social consequences of crsv ?
the decay MechanIsM The contemporary mainstream discourse on the consequences of crsv holds that “ in many conflicts , women ’ s bodies become battlegrounds , with rape used as a weapon of war to humiliate , dominate , or disrupt social ties. ” 21 although there is a continuum of sexual and gender- 17 Woolcock and narayan 2000 ; aldrich 2012 ; van rijn , Bulte , and adekunle 2012 .

in this sense crsv ex- ploits emotionally charged values about sexuality , virtue , shame , and honor .
crsv thereby stigmatizes victims , their families , and even com- munities , and leaves a lasting reminder of humiliation and defeat.23 These negative sentiments are further fueled by physical consequences , such as the risk of hIv/aIds and pregnancies .
The following statement by a man whose wife was raped by an armed group in the Democratic republic of the congo partially expresses this : .
.
.
i am as traumatized as my wife .
Why ?
Because i saw my wife being raped and i was powerless despite the fact that i am her husband .
How they can play with the body of my wife and i was there powerless and i could not defend my wife .

.24 Jonathan Gottschall and inger skjelsbaek argue that the cultural val- ues and taboos related to sexuality and the view of the female body as a symbol of a group ’ s culture give patriarchal communities little room to integrate victims and their families.25 Kristin Hagen and sophie yohani add that societies end up in a collective state of shock not only because they have witnessed acts of crsv and death , but also because of the fa- milial and communal rejection of their loved ones.26 This idea is echoed by Jill Trenholm and colleagues : This residual “ damage ” to the fabric of society consists of the disintegration of communities and families , ostracism with subsequent homelessness , damaged re- productive abilities , unwanted children and its sequelae , all while living in a per- sistent state of fear.27 The empirical evidence for these arguments has largely been lim- ited to survivors ’ narratives from various conflict zones .
although the evidence is not suited to generalizations , two important overall obser- vations can be made .

Victims and their families do indeed anticipate stigma and are ashamed of what happened to them despite the fact that it was not their fault .
They are well aware , acknowledge , and expect that being identified as a rape victim damages one ’ s social reputation .
Tina sideris quotes a woman who expresses that fear : i am worried that people will speak and point at me and say , “ that woman has been raped. ” i am afraid that people might shout at me , talk bad about me , send me away.28 Dozens of accounts such as this one that express fear of shunning and rejection can be found in the literature .
in addition , many narra- tives show that stigmatization and gossip are not solely an illusion of the victim , but in fact are practiced in the community .
They often man- ifest in the mocking of the victim or the family 29 and eventually re- sult in rejection.30 in addition , there is increasing awareness that men as well as women are victims of crsv .
although women are the main victims of such violence , recent research shows that crsv against men is more common than previously assumed.31 subjecting men to rape , forced sterilization , genital mutilation , and other acts can be under- stood as another extreme form of emasculation driven by the perpe- trators ’ motivation to demonstrate power and dominance over victims and communities.32 although this line of research is still in its infancy , the stigmatization of male crsv victims and their families is likely to be similar to or even more severe than that of female crsv victims .
overall , the notion that crsv damages community cohesion through stigma is convincing , but the existing empirical analyses suffer from methodological shortcomings that limit their potential to draw general conclusions .
First , the empirical material relies exclusively on conve- nience samples , often with fewer than twenty respondents.33 relat- edly , researchers often depend on local psychosocial support facilities to recruit interviewees , and thereby incorporate selection bias toward victims seeking help and a systematic exclusion of those who , for what- ever reasons , were not.34 This critique does not suggest that the data 28 sideris 2003 , 721 .

sexual violence in war terrorizes victims , families , and their com- munities .
crsv damages sensitive norms of sexuality , honor , and virtue , and gives traditional communities little opportunity to integrate victims and their families without altering critical cultural values .
Victims and their families are stigmatized and face rejection .
consequently , they are not part of community life and do not participate in social events that bind members together .
This results in low levels of prosocial behavior by crsv victims and their families .
The observable implications of this mechanism can be formulated in the following hypothesis : —H1 ( Decay ) .
The exposure to crsv inflicts stigma and shame on crsv victims and their families and therefore decreases their level of prosocial behavior .
the resIlIence MechanIsM another body of research examines the consequences of nonsexual vio- lence in armed conflicts and looks at social outcomes such as social co- hesion , trust , altruism , cooperative behavior , and political participation .
in contrast to the decay literature , this work is empirical and quantita- tive .
Dozens of studies find that different types of exposure to violence have either no effect or a positive effect on social outcomes .
although this strand of research has neglected sexual violence as a distinct type of violence , it is informative regarding how individuals and groups deal with exposure to mass violence and distress in civil wars .
Many of these studies use household survey data .
For sierra le- one , John Bellows and edward Miguel show that displacement and the death of family members increased political participation after the war.36 similarly , christopher Blattman finds that abducted child sol- diers in northern Uganda were more likely to vote and become commu- nity leaders after returning to their communities.37 Giacomo De luca 35 see , e.g. , Human security report Project 2012. empirical research can be highly beneficial for such research gaps .
The growing empirical scholarship on the causes of sexual violence in war has overturned long-held assertions .
several scholars have shown that there is much variance in the preva- lence of crsv across countries , and even within conflicts and armed groups ( cohen 2013a ; leiby 2009 ; Wood 2009 ) .
This has challenged the idea that sexual violence is an inevitable by-product of war as Brownmiller 1975 and others assert .

To summarize , there is growing evidence that exposure to violence in civil wars increases prosocial attitudes and behavior toward the in- group , but not always toward the out-group.44 The causal mechanisms behind this relationship are less clear but potentially rely on a combi- nation of economic payoffs , psychological processes , collective coping , community empathy , and survivors ’ willingness to remain socially in- cluded.45 This ability to absorb and withstand such shocks is often re- ferred to as resilience .
The existing empirical studies have neglected crsv as a distinct type of violence .
as discussed above , crsv is special , and therefore requires an empirical distinction from other forms of violence such as homicide , mutilation , and displacement.46 crsv , and rape in particular , leaves a lasting imprint on the victim , their family , and their community for nu- merous reasons .
crsv can result in pregnancy and children born from war rape , infection with sexually transmitted diseases such as hIv/aIds , and physical injuries .
importantly , crsv victims and their families are 38 De luca and Verpoorten 2015 .

i propose to build on the decay mechanism ( H1 ) .
although the de- cay argument is convincing in suggesting that exposed individuals and households are stigmatized , there are strong reasons to believe that so- cial exclusion is not the most common result .
i posit that in postcon- flict contexts , crsv victims and their families have strong incentives to remain part of their community , since doing so entails significant ad- vantages , such as better information , collective burden sharing and , not least , a sense of belonging.47 We can further expect that victims and exposed households know the social norms and are aware of the potential stigma and the linger- ing threat of social exclusion .
Thus , we should expect crsv victims and their families to take countermeasures to reduce stigma and avert ex- clusion .
These efforts can include an increased investment of time and resources into communal affairs , financial contributions , obeying tradi- tional reconciliation mechanisms , and reintegration and cleansing rit- uals .
Margaret shih emphasizes that stigmatized people often develop the ability to ward off the negative consequences of stigma through compensation strategies.48 For instance , they act more persistently and assertively to achieve what nonstigmatized people may obtain with less effort .
Furthermore , they often advance their social skills to adjust for potential stigma and to be more socially likable .
several experimental studies find support for these assertions.49 as a premise for these countermeasures , crsv survivors and their families assume that their increased efforts to reconnect with their com- munity will result in reduced stigma and social acceptance .
an experi- mental study supports the idea that stigmatized people only engage in prosocial behavior when these efforts are likely to result in acceptance.50 Psychological studies suggest that both those individually affected and their social environment respond to trauma , for example , natu- ral disasters , fatal illness , war , and peacetime rape , with adaptive re- sponses , such as post-traumatic growth or resilience , more often than previously assumed .
Post-traumatic growth describes a process through which people who have experienced traumatic events undergo reflec- 47 Bowlby 1969 .

2007. another possible way to avoid stigma is for the household to eject or kill the victim .
This will keep the household free of any communal rejection based on crsv-related stigma .
However , according to qualitative studies in sierra leone , familial rejection of crsv victims was rare ( Human rights Watch 2003 ; Utas 2009 ; stark 2006 ) .

Jeannie annan and colleagues find that abducted and potentially raped women in northern Uganda reintegrated well into their home commu- nities.52 They note that “ [ s ] upport from families , not rejection , is the norm. ” More generally , this suggests that these adaptive responses de- pend on a combination of compensation efforts on the part of victims and their families and on empathy from the community.53 The observ- able implications of this resilience mechanism can be formulated in the following hypothesis : —H2 ( resilience ) .
The exposure to crsv potentially inflicts stigma and shame on crsv victims and their families .
To reduce stigma and avert so- cial exclusion , they will use countermeasures that manifest in higher lev- els of prosocial behavior .
Before turning to the empirical analysis , i briefly discuss the civil war in sierra leone to shed additional light on the context of this analysis .
in particular , i outline how and why the ruf , the main perpetrator of crsv , turned against civilians and used sexual violence to demonstrate its domination , and the consequences of this choice .
the cIvIl war In sIerra leone , the ruf , and sexual vIolence agaInst cIvIlIans Between 1991 and 2002 sierra leone experienced a major civil war in which more than 50,000 people were killed54 and approximately 1.5 million were displaced.55 in 1991 the ruf , the main rebel movement , entered sierra leone with support from liberian special forces allied with charles Taylor ; its aim was to overthrow the government of Presi- dent Joseph Momoh .
The ruf ’ s goal of changing the political and social system enjoyed considerable popular support at the start , but its efforts quickly deteriorated into a campaign of violence , the main victims of which were the civilian population.56 51 calhoun and Tedeschi 2014 ; Bonanno , Westphal , and Mancini 2011 .

it transcended ethnic categories and was instead a product of the politically and ec- onomically marginalized sierra leonean youth .
Paul richards argues that the ruf and the war were consequences of the dissolving sierra leonean state , whose resources for patrimonialism were drying up un- der IMf- and World Bank-imposed structural adjustment programs.57 These programs contributed to the country ’ s political and economic collapse , and the ruf ’ s membership and support base especially com- prised those who were excluded from the patronage networks that en- sured access to government resources and jobs.58 although the ruf fought against the government , gaining control of the diamond production areas and diamond revenues was integral to the group ’ s strategy .
For this reason , several scholars and commen- tators deny that the ruf had any political agenda , ascribing its prime raison d ’ être to the looting of diamond resources .
David Keen empha- sizes that the ruf did not necessarily aim to win the war or to control diamond production , but rather to demonstrate power and domina- tion by the powerless , the marginalized , and the excluded .
The ruling elite ’ s ignorance of the younger generation ’ s problems , social margin- alization , and lack of prospects was the main driver causing people to support the ruf.59 The question remains as to why the ruf exerted so much brutality and violence against the rural civilian peasantry whose agent it claimed to be .
Keen argues that the ruf ’ s struggle targeted not only the govern- ment , but also the overall deficiency of the social order in sierra le- one.60 The traditional chief structures have long been enmeshed in the practices of the shadow state.61 From a practical perspective , Keen ar- gues , villagers were the easiest target .
The ruf ’ s use of child soldiers and drugs contributed to the brutal- ity .
Kieran Mitton adds that the level of violence against civilians was more modest at the start of the war , but as the conflict progressed , it in- creased massively because the combatants themselves became increas- ingly traumatized and brutalized.62 Krijn Peters emphasizes that in the beginning the ruf adhered to its own codes of conduct , particularly to- 57 richards 1996 .

at the same time , a combination of ideological decline and a drift toward more brutal and less educated leadership led to extreme outbursts of violence against civilians.66 according to the Truth and reconciliation commis- sion ( trc ) records , the ruf and associated rebels were responsible for approximately 75 percent of the reported human rights violations , in- cluding killings , property destruction , and displacement.67 During the course of the conflict , women and girls of all ethnic groups and social classes were victims of sexual violence , and the ruf was the main perpetrator.68 an analysis of trc data estimates that be- tween 23,000 and 56,000 conflict-related instances of sexual violence occurred during the war,69 while a population-based survey in three displacement camps conducted by Physicians for Human rights es- timates that 50,000 to 65,000 displaced women suffered war-related rape.70 The latter report estimates the total number of instances of sex- ual violence during the war at 215,000 to 257,000 .
The ruf ’ s prac- tices in terms of sexual violence have been documented by a number of scholars who have addressed not only the suffering of women and girls , but also their active participation as fighters and their role in perpe- trating sexual violence.71 as Human rights Watch notes , the function of rape was to demonstrate power and domination over communities : The rebels sought to dominate women and their communities by deliberately undermining cultural values and community relationships , destroying the ties that hold society together .
child combatants raped women who were old enough to be their grandmothers , rebels raped pregnant and breastfeeding mothers , and fathers were forced to watch their daughters being raped.72 63 For instance , rape was sanctioned with death , according to one ruf combatant .

The government , the in- ternational community , and civil-society actors placed significant em- phasis on peacebuilding and reconciliation .
alongside the two main institutions for addressing war crimes , the trc and the special court for sierra leone , local organizations funded by international donors sprang up in communities and campaigned for women ’ s and human rights and for reconciliation .
Together with these newly established or- ganizations , existing conflict-resolution mechanisms contributed to a generally supportive climate of peacebuilding.75 sierra leone ’ s postconflict path of reconciliation provided fruitful conditions for communities to rebuild their social networks .
But the ac- counts referenced here reflect only the grand narratives .
To understand what happens on the ground in the aftermath of such conflicts , i turn to the empirical analysis .
data and varIaBles To examine the hypothesized relationship between crsv and proso- cial behavior in sierra leone , i use data from the slIhs , which was col- lected by the statistics office of sierra leone in cooperation with the World Bank.76 The slIhs is nationally representative , with a sample size of 6,767 households.77 The survey is unique in that it provides a module on war experiences that includes questions on crsv , killings , mutilation , and displacement , as well as on different measures of social cohesion .

in the second stage , 684 of 9,671 so-called enumeration areas ( eas , created for the 2004 census ) were selected as the primary sampling unit .

The variable association is a binary variable and measures whether someone from the household is a member of a community-based association , such as a school or a health or development committee .
Helping relates to the notion that people provide assistance to one another in situations of need and social obligation .
i use the dummy variable contributions to measure whether families contribute financially to social events like funerals , weddings , and Osusu.79 These contributions are usually nonanonymous and there- fore involve an element of reciprocity .
altruism is often described as selflessness and is generally viewed as a virtue .
To proxy the notion of altruism , i use the dummy variable donations , which measures whether a household donates to various social or religious causes .
Donations are commonly anonymous , and the recipient may be unknown to the contributor .
Undoubtedly , helping and altruism are closely related , and they are in essence beneficial to communities .
These two measures are likely confounded by social and economic factors , such as household size and poverty , which need to be accounted for in the analysis .
Table 1 provides the summary statistics .
explanatory varIaBle : exposure to crsv The primary explanatory variable , CRSV in HH , is a binary measure indicating whether at least one member of a household experienced conflict-related sexual violence during the sierra leone civil war ( crsv- affected household versus unaffected household ) .
The slIhs includes a battery of questions on war-related experiences , for example , whether household members were killed or mutilated or whether the household was displaced ; one question asks whether “ household member ( s ) [ were ] molested or raped. ” 80 admittedly , this household dummy variable is a crude indicator because it captures the bundle of crsv-related expe- riences rather than the circumstances of crsv ( once or repeated , pri- vate or public , the affiliation of the perpetrator ) , but it is a first cut with 78 schroeder and Graziano 2015a .
79 osusu is a microsavings scheme in sierra leone and elsewhere in africa .
The idea is that a con- tributor must believe that the others in the osusu group , usually around ten people , will play accord- ing to the rules and keep paying their contributions .
80 note that the question wording used both “ molestated ” and “ raped. ” although term rape is quite clear , molestation could theoretically also be understood as nonsexual molestation .
if exposed family members do not live in the households anymore for whatever reason ( e.g. , ejection , migration , death ) , the household is assumed not to report that a member was raped and is thus considered an unaffected household .

Furthermore , since details remain undisclosed , the measure is less susceptible to retraumatization and so- cial desirability bias .
Most important , this information is rare and has not been available in previous surveys on postwar outcomes.81 The summary statistics in Table 1 show that overall , 39 percent of households were affected by crsv .
note that this 39 percent relates to the household .
The structure of the data does not allow for the calcula- tion of the prevalence rate for individuals .
But for illustrative purposes , considering the mean household size of 5.6 ( see the variable household size in Table 1 ) and further assuming that only one member per crsv- affected household experienced crsv , we can infer a national prevalence of 7 percent at the individual level .
This is lower than lynn amowitz and colleagues ’ survey in three displacement camps in sierra leone , which reports a prevalence rate of 9 percent.82 alternatively , drawing on the trc data , Tamy Guberek and associates report 65,000 incidents of crsv , which , assuming sierra leone ’ s population of 4 million in 2001,83 translates into a prevalence rate of 1.6 percent.84 since the trc data are 81 Bellows and Miguel 2009 ; Blattman 2009 ; Voors et al .

The overall measure of the slIhs therefore seems reasonable .
it is lower than the level reported in displacement camps , but higher than the level estimated through the public statements given to the trc .
Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of violence ; graph ( a ) indicates the particularly high prevalence of crsv in the north and south of sierra leone.85 one important methodological concern is that crsv may be highly correlated with other types of human rights abuses , such as homicide , mutilation , and displacement .
Graphs ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) show the spatial distribution of killings , mutilation , and displacement , respectively .
at least visually , the geographical distribution patterns dif- fer substantively between the different types of violence .
The statistical analysis includes measures for killings , mutilation , and displacement .
The variance inflation factors are very modest at approximately 1.1 .
Multicollinearity between different types of violence therefore does not affect the estimation .
This corresponds to Wood and cohen , who ar- gue that wartime sexual violence follows different patterns than homi- cide and forced displacement.86 The concentration of crsv in the north , as shown in panel ( a ) , res- onates with Guberek and colleagues ’ analysis of testimonials from the trc .
They show that the level of human rights abuses peaked in the last years of the war , and that the north was hit hardest in this period.87 To further illustrate , i use the sierra leone local location event Dataset ( sll-led ) to plot the number of violent events per chiefdom over three distinct phases of the war.88 The three panels in Figure 2 show that vio- lence against civilians started in the southeast then spread to large parts of the territory before becoming concentrated in the northern half of the country toward the end of the war .
The sll-led data do not pro- vide information on the distinct form of violence against civilians , but they complement the slIhs data in the sense that they show temporal and geographic variation and indicate that the north was most affected toward the end of the war .
85 The percentage levels in the legend relate to the household , meaning , for instance , that in some chiefdoms 81 to 100 percent of households include a household member who has experienced crsv .
assuming a 5.6-person household , this would result in a prevalence rate between 14.5 and 17.9 per- cent among individuals in such high-prevalence chiefdoms .
These values should not be interpreted as a reliable measure , but merely as a general trend of magnitude , because the slIhs was representative only at the national level and not at the chiefdom level .

Humanitarian assist- ance is provided in places hit by violence and could therefore operate parallel to the resilience mechanism .
access to medical , psychological , social , and financial assistance can alter the capacity and motivation to act prosocially .
For instance , those households with access to psychoso- cial support groups may develop more agency and score higher for pro- social indicators .
it is important to control for humanitarian support to avoid overestimating the effect of the social resilience mechanism .
To capture humanitarian support , i construct a variable that measures self- reported reception of humanitarian aid from humanitarian agencies ( for example , ngos , UniceF , and the World Health organization ) and faith-based institutions .
such support has been reported to influence community integration for victims of war in general and for crsv sur- vivors in particular.89 To separate the impact of other types of violence , i include a num- ber of violence controls that measure whether someone in the house- hold has been killed ( homicide in HH ) or mutilated ( mutilation in HH ) , or whether the household has ever been displaced ( HH ever displaced ) .90 The number of RUF camps that were present in the chiefdom may fur- ther affect prosocial behavior , since the ruf ’ s raids were likely to affect community life.91 Furthermore , i use several household controls that have been imple- mented in related studies on nonsexual violence.92 The size of a house- hold ( household size ) is likely to have an effect on the outcome .
larger households are more likely to be better connected to the communities they live in and may therefore have a higher likelihood of scoring on prosocial behavior measures .
Poverty ( poverty index ) is associated with lower social status , which may result in decreased levels of social inclu- sion , spending on social events , and donations .
last , a dummy for urban households is included , since one would expect community cohesion to be lower in urban areas .
in addition , i include four standard individual controls for respon- 89 Winter et al .

analysIs and results Before analyzing the data , i employ coarsened exact matching ( ceM ) to create more balanced data between crsv-affected ( crsv = 1 ) and unaf- fected ( crsv = 0 ) households .
ceM drops those observations for which there is no common empirical support .
Through this procedure the distribution of the covariates in both crsv-affected and unaffected households is more alike , and thus minimizes model dependence and statistical bias.93 Table 2 presents the main findings .
in all four logistic regression models the main outcome variable association , which measures whether a household member is a member of a community-based association , is regressed on the explanatory variable CRSV in HH and the other covariates .
all four models include household controls and individual controls ( as described above ) , as well as district-level fixed effects , to ac- count for unobserved location factors.94 Because it is not possible to cal- culate standard statistics of model fit ( for example , Bayesian and akaike information criterion , Pseudo r2 ) when using stata ’ s survey module and nonlinear models , i rely on an f-adjusted mean residual goodness- of-fit test .
The insignificant p-values across all four models indicate that the model fits the data .
Turning to the results , model 1 shows that expo- sure to conflict-related sexual violence ( CRSV in HH ) has a positive and statistically significant effect ( 1 percent ) on the likelihood that house- holds are members of community-based associations .
Model 2 adds the other violence-related variables .
They show di- verse effects .
The killing of household members ( homicide in HH ) , dis- placement ( HH ever displaced ) , and the number of RUF camps have no significant effect on ( association ) membership .
Mutilation in HH has a positive effect on association .
importantly , even with the inclusion of the 93 iacus , King , and Porro 2012. i use the ceM package for stata ( Blackwell et al .
2009 ) .
applying ceM reduces the total observations from 6,727 to 5,475 .
This reduction of the sample sizes improves the l1 statistic as an overall measure of balance from .68 to .57 .
The estimation results with unmatched data are available in tables a4 and a5 in the supplementary material ; Koos 2018b .
The results are ro- bust to the matched data .
in addition , since the data were collected through a two-stage sampling pro- cess , i use stata ’ s survey module to account for the first stage ( district level ) and the second stage , i.e. , the primary sampling unit ( psu ) , meaning that all models use standard errors clustered at the psu .
The probability weights are calculated by multiplying the household-level survey weights by the weight computed through the ceM procedure .
94 The expanded models are available in tables a1 and a2 in the supplementary material ; Koos 2018b .

This result supports the idea that crsv is independent of other types of violence .
in addition , low variance infla- tion factors at 1.1 speak against multicollinearity .
in model 3 of Table 2 , the variable humanitarian aid is added and is indeed strongly linked with a higher likelihood of membership in associations .
This finding lends evidence to the fact that humanitar- ian actors ’ engagement contributes to the integration of crsv-affected households .
again , the variable CRSV in HH remains largely robust .

Because both variables are dummies , i again use logistic regression models .
Model 1 equals model 4 from Table 2 , and is included to pro- vide a better comparison .
Model 2 shows the effect of CRSV in HH on social contributions .
The effect is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level even when other violence-related variables are ac- counted for .
The humanitarian aid variable has a negative effect .
Model 3 shows a positive effect of CRSV in HH on donations as a proxy indica- tor for altruism , but it is only significant at the 10 percent level .
To interpret the substantive effects of the explanatory variable CRSV in HH , Figure 3 shows the average predicted probabilities with a 90 per- cent confidence interval .
When a household has been exposed to CRSV in HH , such exposure results in a 5 percent greater chance of it being a member of a community association ( left plot ) , an 8 percent greater chance of it paying social contributions ( center plot ) , and also increases the odds that it will donate by 5 percent ( right plot ) .
When households receive humanitarian aid from ngos or religious institutions , it increases the odds of them being members of an association by 20 percent .
But humanitarian aid has a negative effect on contributions and no effect on donations .
although these effect sizes should not be taken literally , they indicate that the effect of crsv is not only statistically significant , but also substantively meaningful .
The analyses above show that crsv-affected households engage in more prosocial activities , arguably to avert or reduce stigmatization and to increase their acceptance within their communities .
But this result reflects only the behavior of a household and not whether a household is accepted by other households in the community .
The socio-psycho- logical literature suggests that stigmatized people engage in prosocial behavior only when they anticipate subsequent social acceptance.96 Unfortunately , the slIhs does not include specific questions on the acceptance of crsv victims , but there is a question that asks respondents whether their household can rely on the community to provide assist- ance during difficult periods , for example , when there is a shortage of money or food .
although this question does not measure whether other 95 a graph of the interaction effects is available in Figure a1 in the supplementary material ; Koos 2018b .
overall , the effect of humanitarian aid is not conditional on exposure to crsv .

This indi- cation is in principle at least as important as acceptance by other com- munity members , because crsv-affected households are—as i show in the qualitative section below—very sensitive about how other commu- nity members treat and talk to them .
Therefore , if crsv-affected house- holds perceive themselves to be as likely to receive assistance from the community as unaffected households , that is , if the CRSV in HH vari- able is insignificant , we can interpret this result as an absence of explicit social exclusion of crsv-affected households .

Figure 4 shows the result of using the variable com- munity reliance as the outcome.97 The plot shows the predicted proba- bilities for reliance on the community .
Unaffected households ( left side ) report a probability of 46 percent of relying on the community during difficult times ; crsv-affected households report 47 percent .
The dif- ference is marginal and not significant ( the confidence intervals over- lap ) .
This result indicates that crsv-affected households are as likely as unaffected households to receive community support , which speaks against social exclusion and ultimately lends further credit to the resil- ience hypothesis .
in sum , the results of the empirical analysis provide no support for the decay mechanism ( H1 ) .
Quite to the contrary , there is substantial support for the resilience mechanism ( H2 ) .

These over- all findings are striking and support the idea that crsv-affected house- holds employ prosocial behavior as a means to remain part of their community .
The results regarding community reliance also suggest that there is no perceived exclusion among crsv-affected households .
causal IdentIfIcatIon as with most observational data , endogeneity remains a concern .
We can not rule out the possibility that certain prewar characteristics influ- enced the joint probability of being exposed to crsv , prosocial behav- ior , and social inclusion .
not accounting for such characteristics would result in biased estimates .
The most obvious concern is reverse causal- ity , which would be the case if prosocial households in particular were more likely to experience crsv or other forms of violence .
since there are no baseline data that reflect prosocial behavior before the war , i ap- ply four strategies to examine the possibility of reverse causality : ( 1 ) qualitative evidence of targeting practices by the ruf , ( 2 ) an analysis of crsV in HH=0 crsV in HH=1 Pr ( r el ia nc e on c om m un it y ) .52 .5 .48 .46 .44 .42 fIgure 4 effect of crsv on coMMunIty relIance a a To what degree do people believe they can rely on their community during difficult times ?

none of these strategies rules out problems of endogeneity completely .
But overall , they increase our confidence that the results are not driven by omitted variable bias or reverse causality.98 First , a key question is whether the ruf and associated rebels targeted villages , households , and individual household members selectively or indiscriminately .
at the chiefdom level , the geographical and tempo- ral distribution of violence as shown in figures 1 and 2 does not support the idea that the spread of violence followed a random pattern , but in- stead supports that there were both spatial and temporal concentrations of violence .
The statistical analysis accounts for this with district fixed effects and clustered standard errors .
at the household level , however , previous representative and qualitative studies have not found any evi- dence of selective targeting in sierra leone according to major catego- ries like social class , ethnic identity , or religion.99 The trc ’ s report on women also emphasizes this notion of random sexual violence toward civilians in several paragraphs.100 in addition , massive substance abuse among ruf fighters , particularly before they raided villages , contributed to a quasi-random pattern of victimization of villagers .
ruf combatants explained that civilians appeared “ like in- sects , ” indicating a distorted perception and raising doubts about their ability to selectively target those civilians who might not have been sup- portive of the ruf or particularly active in community affairs.101 over- all , the qualitative evidence suggests that selection into conflict-related sexual violence was not caused by any particular factors ( apart from age ) at the household or individual level .
We can thus conceptualize the exposure to crsv as a type of near-random treatment .
assuming a quasi-random pattern of crsv is a critical assumption and one that has received extensive support in the previous literature on sierra leone and similar contexts.102 second , Table 4 provides further evidence that exposure to crsv was 98 notably , a certain degree of selection bias in the form of attrition is inevitable in postwar survey research , for various reasons .
an unknown number of women ( and families ) died or emigrated dur- ing or after the war or stayed with their “ rebel husbands ” even after the war ended .
especially since the slIhs was conducted in 2011 , almost ten years after the war ended , this analysis can only consider long-term survivors of the war .

larger households ( household size ) should generally have a higher risk of rape .
The same holds for households with more girls ( girls ratio in HH ) .
in households with at least two children , the mean girls ratio in HH amounts to 47 percent .
Because the ruf was revolt- ing against the established order , community leaders , chiefs , and people with authority were reportedly specifically targeted.104 since there are no questions on leadership positions in the data , i use the father ’ s educa- tion as a proxy .
Poverty might have decreased people ’ s ability to preemp- tively send their children to a safe haven ( for example , the nearest town , the capital Freetown , or even abroad ) .
Households in remote areas and villages were less prepared for raids than larger towns and the variable urban captures this possibility .
also , religion may have played a role in targeting .
some accounts argue that women ’ s status in the southern 103 see also cohen 2016. since these household characteristics ( apart from RUF camps ) were col- lected in 2011 , they only imperfectly approximate pre-crsv characteristics , but assuming a certain de- gree of continuity of household features , they provide a reasonable approximation .

This could be captured by the binary variable Muslim .
last , the number of times the ruf established headquarters ( RUF camps ) within an area may have influenced the risk of rape since encounters with ruf combatants were more likely .
as Table 4 shows , none of these factors are statistically significant predictors of the explanatory variable CRSV in HH .
These results further indicate that crsv-affected and unaffected households did not differ systematically before being exposed or not ex- posed to crsv .
Third , as described above , to further increase my ability to make a causal statement , i have matched the data using the ceM algorithm.105 although matching does not solve problems of omitted variable bias , it balances the data and thereby reduces model dependence and mis- specification bias .
Fourth and finally , i employ an instrumental variable ( Iv ) approach whereby i exploit the exogenous distance of a chiefdom from the next diamond or gold mine .
The idea behind this Iv is that the ruf , as the main perpetrator of sexual violence during the war , sought to control these mining areas .
These areas therefore attracted what Jeremy Wein- stein refers to as opportunistic joiners , that is , combatants who were drawn to the ruf not because of its initial ideological mission to trans- form the marauding political and social system,106 but rather for private and materialistic benefits.107 relating to this key aspect , cohen argues that opportunistic groups—abductees and “ greedy ” joiners—suffer from lower levels of group cohesion than groups consisting of ideo- logically motivated joiners.108 among such low-cohesion , opportunity- driven groups , sexual violence , and particularly gang rape , commonly has been used to increase bonding among combatants and thereby in- crease unit strength.109 Households in chiefdoms closer to mines should therefore have had a higher risk of experiencing crsv .
The distance from mines should therefore negatively affect the risk of conflict- related sexual violence ( CRSV in HH ) .

The effect of CRSV in HH on membership in as- sociations remains highly significant ( below 0.1 percent ) and the effect on donations gains more significance ( below 0.1 percent ) .
But the effect on contributions disappears .
These slightly deviant results may come from the fact that the Iv approach only estimates the local average treatment effect ( late ) , that is , those households that comply with the assump- tion that proximity to mines increases the risk of crsv .
The late can- not be estimated for so-called defiers , never-takers , and always-takers ( more details on the assumptions can be found in section 3.1 of the supplementary material ) .112 The f-statistic of 40 suggests that the in- strument is sufficiently correlated with the explanatory variable CRSV in HH .
Furthermore , the significant p-value of the underidentification test allows rejecting the null hypothesis that the instruments are irrel- evant .
in total , the Iv results further support the resilience argument ( H2 ) and show no evidence of social decay ( H1 ) .
qualItatIve evIdence on MechanIsMs although the statistical analysis provides robust evidence for the resil- ience hypothesis that crsv-affected households engage in more proso- cial behavior , it does not tell us much about the underlying mechanisms of this relationship.113 in this section , i present qualitative evidence on how and why crsv survivors and their families have engaged in proso- cial behavior and what prosocial behavior can mean in the context of a sierra leonean village .
Prosocial behavior , as i will show , is strongly embedded in traditional rituals and is a precondition for reconciliation , reintegration , and social acceptance .
i also point out some general , na- tional-level conditions that further contribute to a climate of forgive- ness , integration , and peacebuilding in postwar sierra leone .
a few anthropological studies examine the process of how crsv vic- tims are received , treated , and integrated by their families and commu- nities.114 Broadly speaking , one can distinguish between crsv victims , for example , those raped on one occasion , such as a village raid , and bush wives , those abducted and abused by the ruf , often for years .

Villagers often feared bush wives for their aggressive conduct.115 Upon return to their villages , most bush wives faced initial rejection by either the family or the community .
often , due to fear of stigma be- ing inflicted on the family , there were differing views within families on how to deal with returning wives , daughters , and sisters .
The following account exemplifies this : When i came back from the bush , my parents hugged me , but other people weren ’ t happy .
They mocked my parents and me.116 another crsv survivor shared a similar experience : My bad luck affected my family because i slept in the same bed as my mother .
Her business was also not going well and she was stigmatized for sharing a bed with a rebel.117 These accounts provide partial evidence for the decay mechanism ( H1 ) .
But as theorized in the resilience hypothesis ( H2 ) , there are ways to overcome this stigma , as i show below .
stigma and rejection were less pronounced if crsv victims had been raped during village raids by combatants because these victims were not viewed as ruf members .
yet to get rid of the stigma , crsv survivors and bush wives alike had to go through cleansing rituals that are widely practiced in sierra leone .
These rituals were performed by local heal- ers ( herbalists , Mori-man , and Karamoko ) and the women ’ s secret so- ciety ( Bundu ) , and took place outside the community .
They involved physical cleansing , prayers , and donations .
Upon returning to the com- munity , the cleansed crsv victim was reintroduced as a member of the community and food was shared—an act that is an important symbol of acceptance and integration in sierra leone.118 lindsay stark notes that in approximately two-thirds of the cases the family decided that the girl should be cleansed , and in one-third the girl herself made the decision and was supported by her family.119 stark further notes that the 115 coulter 2009 .

These accounts show that victims and families—anticipating social norms and sanctions—successfully used countermeasures in the form of prosocial behavior to avert exclusion .
This provides direct evidence of the resilience mechanism ( H2 ) .
in his study , Mats Utas notes that 83 percent of his interviewees who had been raped were treated by traditional healers and accepted by their home communities.120 stark finds that ritual cleansing led to a positive self-perception among crsv victims and contributed to community ac- ceptance .
For instance , one of her respondents said , “ i see my family now .
after the cleansing , they welcomed me .
My family is more inter- ested in me .
i feel happy because we are one with the rest of the com- munity. ” 121 importantly , these cleansing rituals were a collective effort involv- ing the crsv victim , the family , and the community .
stark notes that in some instances the community financed and organized the rituals as a sign of caring .
Families themselves also contributed their share , not least by agreeing to have their family members cleansed.122 all these accounts show that the extended family of the victim plays a key role as the initial group for the victim to go to , and from then on as supporters of the cleansing process .
if the family rejects a victim , ac- cess to cleansing and subsequent reintegration is much harder .
indeed , rejection sometimes drove bush wives back to their former ruf hus- bands.123 according to these studies , the family is understood as the victim ’ s agent within the community .
The family establishes contacts with elders and healers , helps prepare the ceremony , and donates money when necessary .
although there are no representative data on the existence of cleans- ing rituals across sierra leone , the anthropological studies cited de- scribe it as a rather common custom , and one that enjoys widespread respect and popularity among villagers as an alternative to Western ap- proaches to justice.124 apart from the social institutions of reconciliation at the village level , chris coulter and Utas argue that the sheer magnitude of crsv ( 39 per- cent , see Table 1 ) made it easier for survivors and families to share their ordeals and talk openly about it , and thereby reduce severe stigma and 120 Utas 2009 , 29 .

a report by Human rights Watch notes , Given that rape has been committed on such a systematic and widespread scale and was witnessed by many people , it seems that rape survivors , particularly in urban centers , are generally not stigmatized by society .
survivors interviewed have expressed fear of rejection by their families and communities , but in practice it seems that their fears are unfounded .
Most survivors are accepted back into their communities , with their families simply overjoyed to find that they are still alive.126 evidently , crsv-affected families ’ engagement in cleansing rituals and the high prevalence of crsv reduced sustained stigmatization and fostered social acceptance .
This qualitative evidence not only supports the findings of the statistical analysis , but also enriches these findings by adding a contextualized understanding of what the concept of pro- social behavior entails on the ground .
The fact that crsv-affected fam- ilies obey the traditional norms of reintegration can be understood as a contribution to communal peace and harmony .
although the partici- pation in cleansing ceremonies promises social reintegration for victims and families , it also incurs costs as they must pay for healers and mate- rials , and donate or pay for food shared with the community .
For rural households these costs can be significant .
nevertheless , withstanding the public attention the ceremonies focus on them takes courage and commitment on the part of the victims and their families .
The fact that stigmatization occurs and is reportedly a reason to en- gage in these reconciliatory practices also supports the notion that the resilience mechanism functions as a means to overcome stigmatization and exclusion following crsv , which is an important aspect of the pro- posed theory .
Moving from the analytical microlevel to the national level , it is worth noting that the general scope conditions and the role of author- ities in sierra leone were favorable for peacebuilding and reconcilia- tion relative to many other african postconflict contexts .
authorities including President ahmad Kabbah , the inter-religious council of sierra leone , and the council of churches , continuously called for forgiveness as a precondition for peace in sierra leone .

as such , churches played a key role in healing and social inclusion among and between communities.128 This idea of forgiveness was echoed by the population , which reconciled with for- mer rebels despite the atrocities they had committed.129 in addition , the silence about rape was broken because of the heavy presence of international ngos and because many women demanded peace and participated in postconflict recovery.130 The trc was initiated to create a forum where experiences of war could be shared.131 similarly , international organizations funded human rights campaigns across the country and thereby supported women ’ s causes and gender equality .
over time , these efforts contributed to a change in the public discourse on gender relations and sexual and gender-based violence , and created supportive conditions for the acceptance of crsv victims and their fam- ilies.132 The supportive role of churches and ngos is reflected in the hu- manitarian aid variable in the statistical analysis .
apart from international support , there are enlightening examples of grassroots movements for gender equality among refugees them- selves .
elizabeth Mills and colleagues report that the constant threat of violence—in particular against women—in Guinean refugee camps was a key motive for the creation and expansion of the Men ’ s associa- tion for Gender equality ( Mage ) .
according to Mills ’ research , sierra leonean rebels infiltrated refugee camps in Guinea and were respon- sible for rising levels of sexual violence .
among female refugees , this contributed to a growing perception that all men were perpetrators .
Mage started organizing small meetings among fellow refugees to al- low them to share their frustration over the ubiquity of violence in the camps and the worsening gender relations among refugees .
structural violence against women had been entrenched in sierra leone , and the extreme brutality that many witnessed or experienced during the war contributed to critical reflections among men on gender relations.133 What makes Mage such an illuminating example is that it emerged or- ganically from within a group of vulnerable refugees without external 127 richards 1996 .

partIcularItIes , lIMItatIons , and addItIonal tests although the statistical and the qualitative analyses support the resil- ience hypothesis , some particularities and limitations must be noted .
First , time matters .
There is likely to be a difference between the short- term and long-term social consequences of crsv .
The immediate shock for individuals and families may cause more distress than what remains of those feelings ten years after the end of the war ( when the slIhs was conducted ) following immense reconciliation efforts and peace- building.134 Hence , the analysis is limited to the long-term effects of crsv .
second , although the slIhs is representative of the sierra leonean population in 2011 , some people and households were systematically excluded because they had been killed , died , or remained outside of si- erra leone.135 in addition , one could argue that crsv-affected families returning from exile or displacement camps may not have gone back to their home communities , but moved to a new location in sierra leone to avoid stigmatization and to have better chances of being socially in- cluded .
But the slIhs data speak against that notion .
on average , 49 percent of displaced households were affected by crsv , as compared to only 27 percent of nondisplaced households .
The crsv prevalence rate among displaced households returning to their home communities was 49 percent , and among those households moving to places other than their home communities it was 42 percent , and hence substantially lower .
according to the data , it appears that crsv exposure is not corre- lated with a preference not to return to one ’ s home community .
Third , when it comes to social inclusion , inclusion among crsv vic- tims themselves and inclusion between victims and other members of the community should be distinguished .
one could argue that survi- vors of crsv ( and also amputees ) are perhaps more likely to participate in ngo-supported activities and organizations , such as women ’ s rights organizations ( or soccer leagues for amputees ) .
This notion refers to in- clusion among victims , but it may not necessarily mean that survivors of crsv ( or amputees ) are included in broader community-based associa- 134 see , e.g. , Millar 2012 .
135 But the number of refugees in neighboring countries was likely to be low in 2011. although at the height of the civil war approximately 500,000 sierra leoneans had fled abroad , in 2008 only 43,000 were still living in exile .
large-scale Un-supported repatriation of sierra leonean refugees ended in 2004 ( UnHcr 2008 ) .

Un- fortunately , the data do not provide more detailed information on the kind of community organizations respondents are members of .
But the slIhs includes a question on whether respondents are members of a professional association ( for example , a local farmers ’ or fishermen ’ s as- sociation ) , which is less likely to be initiated by an ngo , and reflects the notion of inclusion between crsv-affected and unaffected households .
Table a6 in the supplementary material shows the results of a regres- sion model that uses the binary variable professional association as an al- ternative outcome.136 interestingly , crsv-affected households are still more likely to be members of professional organizations , while house- holds with amputees ( mutilation in HH ) are not .
This result supports the idea that elevated prosocial behavior on the part of crsv-affected households is independent of potential ngo-supported activities and associations .
Ultimately , this finding strengthens the notion of resil- ience and inclusion between crsv-affected households and the rest of the community .
Fourth , although quantitative data are immensely valuable for this type of analysis , they fall short in providing in-depth knowledge about the particular circumstances of crsv .
additionally , the data do not allow us to distinguish between the actions taken by the family and the crsv victim .
Future data collection efforts should pay attention to the types of crsv , the nature of the event , and the type of exposure ( personal vic- timization or witness ) to account for effect heterogeneity .
conclusIon The purpose of this article was to examine the social consequences of wartime sexual violence , and in particular whether crsv victims and their families are stigmatized and socially excluded ( decay mechanisms ) or whether they engage in compensatory prosocial behavior to ensure social inclusion ( resilience mechanism ) .
Using representative house- hold-level data from sierra leone , i demonstrate that crsv-affected households are more likely to be members of local associations , more likely to allocate money to communal events , and more likely to do- nate than unaffected households .
several robustness checks , including an instrumental variable approach , validate the results .
The qualitative evidence further supports the findings and sheds some light on the un- 136 Koos 2018b .

This study ’ s contribution to the literature on sexual violence in armed conflicts is twofold .
First , it is—to the best of my knowledge—the first systematic comparative analysis of the social consequences of wartime sexual violence.137 it thus complements the qualitative literature on crsv by addressing the nagging issues of selection bias and the lack of representativeness .
second , by drawing on recent findings from social psychology , it provides a new , extended theoretical argument on how crsv victims and their families use countermeasures to remain members of their community .
in that sense , it challenges the dominant notion in the feminist literature and the development community that crsv de- stroys the social fabric of communities.138 crsv victims , their families , and the communities they live in , it appears , are far more resilient than previously assumed .
additionally , the article enriches the literature on the sociopolitical legacy of violence by being the first to consider sexual violence as a dis- tinct form of violence.139 information on crsv exposure at the house- hold level is typically not available , which makes the present article particularly valuable .
The analysis shows that crsv and the mechanisms that follow exposure to it have far more significant social outcomes than homicide or displacement , at least in the context of sierra leone .
although the results are representative of sierra leone , the question remains as to what degree the resilience mechanism is generalizable to other contexts where crsv has been widespread—for instance , to post- conflict zones such as the eastern congo , Darfur , south sudan , nepal , and colombia .
several conditions have been raised throughout the ar- ticle , and these appear to be critical in enabling the operation of the re- silience mechanism .
Here i summarize these conditions to allow an evaluation of the extent to which other contexts share them .
First , the magnitude and frequency with which crsv was perpe- trated in sierra leone was a defining feature of the war and of the ruf ’ s practices in particular .
crsv was so widespread that most people knew someone among their family or friends who had been raped .
Therefore , everyone had to deal with crsv in some sense , and people talked openly about it .
Furthermore , gang rape and public rape were frequent .
These forms of crsv may create collective experiences of suffering and there- fore reduce victim-blaming and stigmatization .
These conditions ulti- 137 Koos 2017 .

Third , as the qualitative section shows exhaustively , the cultural re- sources available to crsv victims and their families to redress stigma by adhering to local forms of reconciliation and cleansing played a major role inside communities .
We find similar traditions of reconciliatory practices throughout africa and elsewhere .
in Peru , for instance , Kim- berley Theidon documents how deeply divided communities used such ceremonies to transform and integrate former wrongdoers back into the community.143 Fourth and last , as both the statistical and qualitative sections show , humanitarian assistance matters not only to crsv victims , but also to all respondents .
apart from providing medical , psychological , and so- cial assistance , advocacy campaigns and women ’ s rights associations en- abled women to become involved in the peace process and thereby shed light on the gendered consequences of war .
These four conditions make intuitive sense as facilitating factors , but to what degree they are nec- essary or sufficient for the resilience mechanism to operate needs to be tested in a comparative cross-country framework .
To conclude , these findings raise new and more general questions about how individuals , families , and communities develop and exercise the resilience to withstand shocks and traumatic events .
Policymakers and practitioners in the humanitarian and development communities can use these results to recalibrate their working relationships with local communities .
The example of the Men ’ s association for Gender equal- ity presented in the qualitative section illustrates how resilience develops under harsh conditions and distress .
Granting the people who should benefit from humanitarian responses more decision-making power in the design of gender-related programs would harness resilience capacities 140 coulter 2009 ; Utas 2009 ; Human rights Watch 2003 .
