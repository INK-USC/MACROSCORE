This paper investigates how two psycholog- ical antecedents , ( 1 ) need for uniqueness and ( 2 ) status aspiration , can influence consumers ' attitude with regard to forming procedures toward e-customized products and how perceived risk , another psychological factor , on purchasing e-customized products plays a role of moderating factor .
A self-administered online survey of 321 Japanese consumers is conducted to examine a proposed conceptual model with Structural Equation Modeling ( SEM ) .
The analysis using results indicates that the need for uniqueness directly impacts on attitude toward e-customized products while it mediates the effect of status aspiration .
A multi-group analysis to test a moderating effect of the perceived risk on purchasing e-customized products highlights the significant effects of psychological factors .
The result also provides potential guidelines to e-tailors on possibility of segmenting markets as well as promoting their customized products using these psychological criteria of their target consumers .

Introduction Despite the fact that consumers feel more comfortable when shopping for standardized products than for customized products ( Kımıloğlu , 2004 ) , customized products are an increasingly common consumer choice and e-customized products have become more pop- ular providing auxiliary benefits to customers in an online shopping environment with advanced internet technologies and configuration tools .
While traditional customization has been an important part of consumer and retailing research for decades , there seems to be no clear conceptual boundaries with online customization for products ( i.e. , e-customization ) ( Duray , Ward , Milligan , & Berry , 2000 ) al- though empirical studies have dealt with issues of concerns of online customization to manufacturers and retailers such as customization levels , systems , enabling technologies , and process methodologies ( Silveira , Borenstein , & Fogliatto , 2001 ) , and online customization for web contents ( Guo & Salvendy , 2009 ) .
Despite the fact that e- customization processes during online purchasing may require that they be educated about related skills for instance use of the Internet as well as have relevant knowledge about the product , still a growing number of customers seek for e-customized products .
For example , ity , Department of Information ) .
sevier Inc.when trying to purchase an e-customized laptop computer on Dell.com , customers should not only be accustomed to using the In- ternet , but also need to obtain knowledge to choose relevant features based on basic computer knowledge such as its operating system , hard drives , types of chips and main board , and so forth .
Given that much research has concentrated on suppliers ' perspectives on tech- nology , there is a scarcity of research that deals with consumers ' internal psychological properties that shape attitudes toward pur- chasing of e-customized products .
The researchers for this study sense that factors fabricated due to the different medium , the Internet vs. in person , between traditional customization product order process and e-customized order product process must be one of the critical variables that would impact on attitude toward e-customized products and purchasing intention of e-customized products .
For online e-customized product shopping , consumers more likely seek for personalized search products than experience products ( Moon , Chadee , & Tikoo , 2008 ) and sense higher benefits on purchas- ing customized products than standardized products when they have better perception and understanding into their own preferences ( Franke , Keinz , & Steger , 2009 ) , and they are able to express their preferences with higher product involvement .
Regardless of the complicated process and more expensive price , nonetheless , there is significant demand for customized products due to the unique characteristics of the products such as uniqueness ( Chan , Berger , & Van Boven , 2012 ; Kastanakis & Balabanis , 2012 ; Zhan 2553J .
Park et al .
/ Journal of Business Research 66 ( 2013 ) 2552–2559 & He , 2012 ) or reflecting image/status ( Kastanakis & Balabanis , 2012 ; Moon et al. , 2008 ; Wiedmann , Hennigs , Varelmann , & Reeh , 2010 ) .
Cutting edge online technologies are able to aid retailers to sup- port personalized e-customized products ' sales and provide these products to their customers better than ever with configuration tools for both mass and pure customization .
Online retailers can max- imize usage of business intelligent technologies with data mining in retaining existing customers and acquiring new customers .
These technologies help them to improve services and enhance customer satisfaction ( Rust & Espinoza , 2006 ) with aiding functions such as personalized search and recommendations based on their navigating , searching , purchasing , and transaction history ( Ansari , Essegaier , & Kohli , 2000 ; Baglioni , Ferrara , & Romei , 2003 ; Schafer , Konstan , & Riedl , 2001 ) generating additional revenue .
In online environments , consumers have to take risks by revealing their personal information to customized product or service pro- viders ' website and whether they ordered the products or services they intended to order because of the complexity of the online e-customized product or service process .
Assuming that taking a risk is one of the Internet 's natural characteristics , it is also important to consider the effect of perceived risk on how consumers form their attitude toward e-customized products .
With the feasible competitive advantage of e-customization , it is important to investigate which factors lead consumers to shop for e-customized even though cus- tomers are likely to confront some barriers such as a higher price , complicated processes , or uncertainty of receiving the right products and risk of online shopping itself .

Theoretical development and hypotheses 2.1 .
Consumer innovation adoption model Gatignon and Robertson expand Rogers ' view of diffusion theory and propose a conceptual model explaining diffusion of innovation , for which adoption processes may be influenced by personal influ- ences , such as innovativeness and opinion leadership mediated by perceived uncertainty ( Gatignon & Robertson , 1985 ; Robertson & Gatignon , 1986 ) .
This model has been a core concept to many con- sumer behavior studies ( Crespo & Bosque , 2008a , 2008b ; Crespo & Bosque , 2010 ; Schramm , Trainor , Shanker , & Hu , 2010 ) and has been applied to organization 's adoption of new technology consider- ing consumer 's heterogeneity reflecting different characteristics , preferences , and needs ( e.g. , Adner & Levinthal , 2001 ) .
With regard to adoption at the individual consumer level , opinion leadership and market mavenship ( Ruvio & Shoham , 2007 ) , preference fit achieved and design effort ( Franke , Schreier , & Kaiser , 2010 ) , and generalPersonal Characteristics Personal Innovation Characteristics Personal Influence A P C Pr U Pr A Pa Social System ( M • • • Fig .

Summary of consumer innovation adoptiondemographics ( Faiers & Neame , 2006 ) have been identified .
In addi- tion , this model proposing to explain e-commerce technologies ' ( i.e. , e-customization ) adoption by consumers includes the simulta- neous influence of attitudes , perceived risk , or innovativeness .
In this study , the authors adapted theGatignon and Robertson 's con- ceptual model ( see Fig .
1 ) as a main conceptual framework because of the same reason that Crespo and Bosque ( 2008a , b ) adopted this model , due to its overall nature and agreement with the main theories used to explain e-commerce adoptionwith its technology specifically in customer research domain .
The study expects to fill the research gap by suggesting two unique types of Japanese consumer characteristics , needs for uniqueness and status aspiration , explaining innovation adoption based on the diffusion of innovationmodel ( Fig .
1 ) toward an online framework of customiza- tion .
In addition , given the context of e-commerce , the authors further examined how perceived risk ( which is uncertainty in Fig .
1 ) of online shopping moderates the hypothesized relations .
Japanese consumers were chosen for thismodel testing , as Japanwas the number one region for many decades known for their excellent craftsmanship supporting their manufacturing field , Japanese value craftsmanship highly in their purchasing decision , and the country is the second country followed by USA in terms of online sales ( emarketer , 2012 ) ; it is necessary to have a sample that more commonly use e-customized products .
This research focus is not a comparison between two different cul- tures , rather to test a theory driven model .
Therefore using a group of Japanese as a homogenous sample must be adequate for this study ( Huang , Schrank , & Dubinsky , 2004 ; Mullen , 1995 ) .
2.2 .
Need of uniqueness and e-customized products Need for uniqueness is known as to what degree people put a value on scarcity , which varies from person to person ( Kehret-Ward & Yalch , 1984 ) .
Internally , people tend to be satisfied when they find themselves to be unique and separable from others and external- ly , through posing independence , people can be evaluated positively since independence is considered a quality of strong character as well as autonomy .
This perception of uniqueness from others is re- ferred to as the “ need for uniqueness ” ( Snyder & Fromkin , 1977 , 1980 ) which is defined as a social desire of people who want to differ- entiate themselves by acquiring and possessing unique consumer products ( Lynn and Harris , 1997 ; Snyder , 1992 ; Snyder & Fromkin , 1977 , 1980 ) .
Lynn and Harris ( 1997 ) explain acquisitive and possessive mea- surement by examining three antecedents , ( 1 ) need for uniqueness , ( 2 ) status aspiration and ( 3 ) materialism and reveal that all three antecedents are significantly related to desire to purchase uniquedoption rocess ognitive ocessing ncertainty iority cquisition tterns Diffusion Process arket Segment ) model ( from Gatignon and Robertson , 1985 ) .

In the present day , people defining themselves in relation to others tend to identify themselves by what they consume ( Douglas , 1997 ) and ones seeking for more choices likely prefer to choose cus- tomized products over standardized products in order to identify and differentiate themselves from others ( Moynagh & Worsley , 2001 ) .
The compelling reasons why people desire uniqueness and indepen- dence to differentiate themselves from others can be described with two pressures ; enhancing internal and external images ( Ruvio , Shoham , & Brenčič , 2008 ; Snyder , 1992 ) .
In this study , based on diffusion innovative theory and existing lit- erature reviews , the authors attempt to test whether need of unique- ness and self-aspiration which are positively related to desire to purchase unique consumer products in Lynn and Harris ' study also have an effect in the same way in the e-commerce environment with e-customized products .
Owning scarce products differentiates a consumer fromotherswhile preventing others from imitating them easily ; ones with a high need for uniqueness aremore likely to adopt newproducts than individualswith a low need for uniqueness ( Lynn , 1991 ) .
With this perspective , the in- herent scarcity of e-customized products seems to be more attractive to consumers who have a higher need for uniqueness .

Consumers ' need for uniqueness positively influences attitude toward e-customized products .
2.3 .
Status aspiration Another consumer characteristic that fabricates consumer desire for customized products is status aspiration which is defined as an in- dividual characteristic reflecting the desire for dominance and leader- ship in social hierarchies by normally possessing and obtaining particular products to convey social status ( Dawson & Cavell , 1987 ) .
Blumberg ( 1974 ) insisted that one 's obtaining a scarce or unique product must be a more effective status symbol than possessing a standardized product .
Some consumers like to be recognized distinct- ly from the majority in order to receive differentiated recognition ( Scitovsky , 1992 ) and tend to consume products that could convey their status ( O'Cass & Frost , 2002 ) .
Chaudhuri and Majumdar ( 2006 ) reinterpreted conspicuous or status pursuing consumption behavior along the lines of shifting social structures from pre-capitalist to post-modern .
In this post modernism era , the middle class try to ex- press their status by consuming unique products or experience par- taking in pursuit of self-expression and self-image ( Firat , Dholakia , & Venkatesh , 1995 ) .
People having higher status aspirations are more likely to pursue differentiation , e-customized products more than e-standard products from those who do not pursue to identify themselves by consuming unique products .
Need for uniqueness and status aspiration have consistently showed stronger relationships with desire for possession of scarce products or customized products with high coefficients in previous studies ( Cassidy & Lynn , 1989 ; Lynn & Harris , 1997 ) .
As e-customized products having more alternatives and selections for high status aspiration customers to have a sense of distinctiveness , the relationship between consumers with high status aspiration and their attitude toward e-customized products will be positive .

Attitude and purchase intention of e-customized products Consumers ' intention to purchase products seems to be one of the necessary variables that reflects consumers ' actual purchasing behavior.To explain purchase intention of e-customized products , the authors use the attitude–behavior theory which claims a positive relationship be- tween attitude and behavior ( Ajzen , 1985 , 1991 ; Ajzen & Fishbein , 1980 ) , and add attitudes toward e-customized products as a mediating variable between consumer psychological characteristics and purchase intention .
Attitude–behavior theory has been widely used and is highly recommended to explain the consumer decision-making process , espe- cially in technology adoption behavior ( Yoh , Damhorst , Sapp , & Laczniak , 2003 ) .
Consumer purchase intention of e-customized prod- ucts is preceded by the consumer attitudes toward the idea of proposing e-products , thus consumers ' attitudes toward the object should be a main influence factor on intention to purchase .

2.5 .
Perceived risk in online shopping Perceived risk has been studied to explain why consumers are re- luctant to use the Internet for purchasing tasks ( Pires , Stanton , & Eckford , 2004 ) .
In the diffusion innovative theory model , Gatignon and Robertson ( 1985 ) placed perceived uncertainty as the link between personal influences and the adoption process ( Fig .
1 ) .
Distinguishing online retailers from traditional offline ones , Brynjolfsson and Smith ( 2000 ) , in their work suggested that consumers are likely to feel uncertainty and unpredictability when purchasing from e-tailors .
Many researchers have examined different causes of uncertainty in online settings ; Pavlou ( 2003 ) explained that behavioral and envi- ronmental uncertainties result from fear of economic risk of mone- tary loss ( Lee , 1998 ) , and other researchers perceived consumers uncertainty coming from seller performance risk , and privacy risk of revealing private information ( Bhatnagar & Ghose , 2004 ) and person- al risk of receiving incorrect products or services ( Bhatnagar & Ghose , 2004 ; Laroche , Nepomuceno , & Richard , 2010 ) .
Heijden , Verhagen , and Creemers ( 2001 ) indicated that perceived risk stemming from trust has an indirect effect on shopping intention through attitudes and Im , Kim , and Han ( 2008 ) found that perceived risk is a significant moderating variable in technology adoption .
This perceived risk can be considered to be collaborativewith uncer- tainty around innovative technology offerings like e-customization under the assumption that the risk stems from insufficient and unreliable information about that innovation .
Especially with regard to innovative technologies such as the e-customization process , per- ceived risk has influence on consumers ' decision making processes such as shaping attitudes toward adopting technologies or purchasing behavior ( Im et al. , 2008 ) .
The authors feel that summarizing these risks involved in online shopping nature and additionally using new technologies , the personal risk of receiving incorrect products or ser- vices ( Bhatnagar & Ghose , 2004 ; Laroche et al. , 2010 ) should be higher with purchasing e-customization products than purchasing standard- ized products online .
Given the previous research about the Internet shopping environ- ment and new technology acceptance , this research expected that perceived risk was likely to have significant influence on the attitude formation process toward e-customized products .
When there is high level of perceived risk , described by fear , skepticism , cynicism , wariness and watchfulness , and vigilance ( McKnight , Kacmar , & Choudhury , 2004 ) , even though consumers may have positive atti- tudes toward e-customized products , they are unlikely to maintain the purchase intention long enough to purchase the products .
While customers are looking for customized products to satisfy their needs for uniqueness and social image , they still may feel a high level of risk concerning online transactions and receiving correct products and services that they ordered .

Park et al .
/ Journal of Business Research 66 ( 2013 ) 2552–2559The roles of psychological antecedents to explain the attitude to- ward e-customized products are introduced to understand why con- sumers generate positive attitudes even though they may go through complex and risky procedures .
Given the individual consumer 's needs for uniqueness and for establishing their status , when perceiving the Internet as a relatively risky shopping medium and e-customization process as a risky process , the attitude toward e-customized products is likely to be determined by consumer psychological needs and characteristics .
According to planned behavior theory ( Ajzen , 1991 ) , perceived behavioral control , how much control an individual perceives to have over the success of engaging behavior , is one of the main charac- teristics determining attitude and directly influencing intention for the behavior .
This theoretical background shows that consumers are likely to buy when perceiving a low level of risk ( Featherman , Miyazaki , & Sprott , 2010 ; McKnight et al. , 2004 ) , regardless of how their attitudes toward the purchase are established and the influences of customer traits showing needs for customized products on the at- titude seem to increase when the Internet user 's distrust of e-commerce comes into play ( McKnight et al. , 2004 ) .
This corollary indicates that consumers with favorable attitude toward the purchase are unlikely to have good intention to purchase if there is a high level of perceived risk .
In summary , the paper hypothesizes that perceived risk of Internet shopping moderates the anticipated positive relation- ship between attitude and intention of purchasing e-customized products .

With higher perceived risk in online transactions , effects of need for uniqueness on attitudes for e-customized products are strengthened .

With higher perceived risk in online transactions , effects of status aspiration on attitudes for e-customized products are strengthened .

Method 3.1 .
Sample characteristics A self-administered online survey was conducted in two metro- politan universities in Japan with e-mail invitations .
With regard to the accuracy of the questionnaire , the authors developed an English-language questionnaire that was first translated into Japanese and cross checked by two bilingual translators before distributing the survey .
The completed questionnaires in Japanese were returned and then translated back into English by the same bilingual translators .
The questionnaires and results in English and Japanese are cross-validated by two invited researchers who are experts in con- sumer research ( Fig .

Conceptual model of psychological antecedents of conThe questionnaires were distributed with opening scenarios of e-customized products purchasing with examples of two products : online customized clothes and shoes .
A total of 321 useful question- naires from students , staff , and faculty members were collected , reaching a 35.60 percentage response rate .
Overall , demographics of the sample presented that 65.30 % of the subjects are female , 300 re- spondents comprising 93 % of the group are under 24 years old .
The sample is relatively young and well educated ; most had some college or university experience .
This attribute is consistent with the nature of recent online shoppers ' demographics ( Palumbo & Herbig , 1998 ; Peng , Wang , & Cai , 2008 ; Williamson , 2006 ) .
3.2 .
Measurement Eight itemsmeasuring need for uniqueness are adopted from Lynn and Harris ( 1997 ) with its reliability being above 0.78 and eleven items measuring status aspiration come from Cassidy and Lynn 's ( 1989 ) study .
Ring and Van de Ven ( 1994 ) suggest that these facets of risk around online transactions can be combined with various con- sumers ' intentions while maintaining generalizability .
With this agreement , this research includes a uni-dimensional perspective on perceived risk adapted from Jarvenpaa , Tractinsky , and Vitale 's ( 2000 ) work which measures four incorporated items .
The measures for attitude and purchasing intention toward e-customized products are modified from Jarvenpaa et al .
( 2000 ) .
An exploratory factor analysis was performed to test factorial structures of antecedents .
Each of the six items for each construct showed factor loadings greater than 0.50 .
The results of correlation analysis after refining of the factor analysis result , the means , stan- dard deviation , and the result of correlation analysis are presented in Table 1 .
In order to assess reliability , Cronbach 's alpha was calculat- ed and all alpha values greater than 0.70 were shown which is good for basic research ( Nunnally , 1978 ) .

Results 4.1 .
Structural equations analysis Prior to the structural equation analysis , the basic descriptive anal- ysis revealed that the sample confirmed the assumptions of normali- ty , collinearity , and outliers ' presence .
In addition to the descriptive analysis , an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the indicators are loaded strongly on the designated constructs .
Most of the constructs had factor loading greater than 0.70 and there was no indication of cross loading factors .
As there was no sin- gle recommended measure of fit for SEM , a variety of model fit mea- sures were applied to determine the model 's appropriateness .
Provided in Table 2 , the χ2/df value for this model was 2.432 , which is below the generally desired cut-off value of 3.0 .
Additionally , in terms of Goodness of Fit Index ( GFI ) and Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index ( AGFI ) , the values in this model indicated 0.932 and 0.900Purchasing Intention of E-customized Products ( PIeCP ) Risk ping ward ized ts ) sumers ' purchasing intention of e-customized products .

However , with regard to Root Mean Square Error of Approximation ( RMSEA ) the fit index was 0.067 , which is below the recommended cut-off level of 0.08 .
Still with these multiple fit indices indicating a reasonable fit for this model , the results of the structural model analysis can be considered to show a good fit of the proposed model to the data .
In terms of the basic model , the relationship between need for uniqueness ( NU ) and attitude toward e-customized products ( AeCP ) is statistically significant ( β = 0.706 ; t-value = 8.715 ) , as hypothe- sized .
With regard to the relations connected to status aspiration ( SA ) , the relationship with NU is significant ( β = 0.025 ; t-value = 7.362 ) ; however , its influence on attitudes toward e-customized products is not significant ( β = 0.025 ) , with a 0.05 significance level and a rela- tively low t-value of 0.411 .
Lastly , AeCP had a strong and significant impact ( β = 1.592 ; t-value = 13.558 ) on purchasing intention on e-customized products ( PIeCP ) .
In conclusion , hypotheses 1 , 3 , and 4 are supported and hypothesis 2 is not supported.4.2 .
Moderating effects of perceived risk In order to examine the hypothesized moderating effects of per- ceived risk , the whole sample is divided into two groups , high and low , using a median split method for a multi-group analysis .
As recommended in Jöreskog and Sörbom 's ( 1993 ) procedures , tests are conducted with four models ( i.e .
A , B , C , and D ) to investigate if coefficients of the proposed paths are significantly different across two groups ( see Table 2 ) .
Respectively , model A let all factor loadings as well as all paths ' coefficients to be constrained as the same across two groups , model B had only factor loadings constrained , model C let both factor loadings and coefficients are free and the last model D has only coefficients constrained ( Dabholkar & Bagozzi , 2002 ) .
The results of model comparison analysis indicate that there is a sig- nificant difference between model A and model D , showing relatively similar fit indices .
Additionally , the significant difference betweenTable 2 Structural equation results for moderating effect models .

Regarding Table 3 , among all proposed relations in the basic model , the effect of perceived risk strengthened the relationships be- tween two constructs , NU and AeCP and also SA and AeCP , except for the relationship between AeCP and PIeCP , which drastically decrease supporting hypothesized moderating effects of perceived risk .
Hy- potheses with perceived risk as a moderating effect are all supported.5 .
Conclusions and implications With the dramatic diffusion of the Internet , consumers can purchase e-customized products within a reasonable time frame at a relatively reasonable price .
At the same time , suppliers can provide e-customized products with relatively low costs while satisfying con- sumers ' needs and be able to keep track on existing customers ' trends and needs through online tools which also helps choose future markets .
Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2006 ) defined e-customization as a strategy that creates value through interactions between suppliers and consumers and companies provide customized products to dif- ferentiate their products and services and to gain customer loyalty while generating sales lead ( Hogue , 2012 ) .
Under the development of e-customization , much research has been done on building efficient e-customization processes for sup- pliers .
Since there is scarcity of e-customization research exploring cognitive approaches to consumers ' e-customized product consump- tion , this research attempted to investigate meaningful psychological constructs ( i.e .
needs for uniqueness and status aspiration ) , whichwere anticipated to play a role in consumers ' purchase of e-customized prod- ucts .
Ultimately , scarcity and uniqueness have been necessary reflecting conspicuous and status or prestige seeking consumption .
The products that consumers utilize to distinguish themselves may be scarce and unique enough to be distinguishable from other standardized mass products .

According to the results presented in the previous section , it appears that the need for uniqueness has a significant influence on customers ' attitudes toward e-customized products , while status aspiration has a limited influence on customers ' attitudes toward e-customized prod- ucts , and its effect is mediated by the need for uniqueness .
When it comes to the moderating effect of perceived risk , con- sumers perceiving a higher level of risk for purchasing products on the Internet are more likely depending on psychological needs when forming attitudes toward e-customized products than con- sumers with a lower level of perceived risk .
On the other hand , peo- ple who perceive a lower level of risk for online purchases tend to engage in a strong relationship between attitudes and purchase in- tention toward e-customized products .
This indicates that people who perceive a high risk are not likely to purchase e-customized prod- ucts evenwhen they have positive attitudes toward e-customized prod- ucts .
In contrast , for people with a low purchase risk to purchase e-customized products on the Internet , their positive attitudes toward e-customized products may directly associate with purchase behavior of e-customized products .
This research showed that the need for uniqueness and the status aspiration have a significant impact on forming favorable attitudes toward e-customized products .
By enlightening the psychological antecedents of adoption of e-customization products , this study fills up the deficiency of the psychological approaches related to e-customization .
This psychological approach is crucial to help mar- keters construct marketing strategies including segmentation defin- ing their target consumers .
More recently , marketers have put more importance on psychological segmentation criteria such as motiva- tion , attitudes , perceptions , and personality rather than on demo- graphic characteristics .
Thus , the authors urge the researchers to consider the influences of psychological factors on e-customized products or services which need to be investigated from consumers ' perspectives .
Besides consumers ' perception toward online shop- ping becoming a significant psychological factor , the moderating role of perceived risk on shopping on the Internet suggests that re- searchers and practitioners need to learn to decrease consumers ' perceived risk by presenting the evidences of strong security con- trols of their websites and designing user-friendly websites which should be emphasized especially dealing with e-customized prod- ucts as it adds one more risk issue , receiving incorrect products .
Online marketers need to enhance ease of ordering and build trust- worthy relationships with consumers by adopting effective privacy and security policies on the way of earning their royalty .
Given the amount of explanatory power in predicting purchasing intention of e-customized products with two psychological antecedents , the util- ity of the model seems promising as the model evolves and further develops.6 .
Limitations and future research To our knowledge , this paper is the first to examine consumers ' psychological antecedents for purchasing e-customized products on the Internet at the same time proposing a model testing the psycho- logical antecedents .
First , this study proposes the model tested using a Japanese sam- ple group which considered a less individualistic but a collectivism country ( Abe , Bagozzi , & Sadarangani , 1996 ; Moon et al. , 2008 ) ; how- ever , the model needs to be reassessed using additional samples to generalize the findings on more individualistic countries such as USA .
It is also possible that this sample coming from Japan could have limited the ability to detect some findings although there is evidence that individual difference , rather than cultural difference determines the extent ( e.g. , Suh , Diener , Oishi , & Triandis , 1998 ) .
The second limitation of this study is the scenario using only shoes and clothing , considered relatively low cost and tangible products .
Whether the products are customized or standardized , the price difference could be minimal and receiving incorrect products would not be a big problem to many people .
Studies testing this model using different products in different price ranges and for different companies ( with high royalty vs. low royalty ) need to be done .
Another limitation of this study was the data collection method which can be subject to errors ; it was collected through self- administered questionnaires measuring customers ' perception and intention as oppose to collection of their actual purchasing behavior .
As an effort to minimize large errors of survey method nature , the re- searchers presented scenarios for participants to imitate a real life purchasing behavior .
The fourth limitation is using a relatively homogenous sample .
The researchers attempted to target a wide range of age groups , but most of the participants were young university students than other associates of the universities .
However , the purpose of this study was accomplished because to test a theory driven model , the best sample is a homogenous sample ( Huang et al. , 2004 ; Mullen , 1995 ) .
The objective of this study was not to test Japanese consumers ' e-customization product consumption , but testing the proposed model , using a sample that , on a regular basis , purchases customized products online .
Future studies need to be done testing this proposed model using different types of products , and applying this study broadly , cross- cultural effects on e-customized products need to be examined with different samples from different regions and cultures as well as for dif- ferent occupations and income levels .
Specifically , moderating effects of perceived risk on e-shopping in a relationship with those two psy- chological factors need more research as consumers in individualism countries are predicted to purchase more e-customized products and willing to pay more than consumers in collectivistic countries ( Moon et al. , 2008 ) .
