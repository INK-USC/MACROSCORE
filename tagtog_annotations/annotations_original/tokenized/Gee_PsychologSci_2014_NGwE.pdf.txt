At the neural-systems level , emotion regulation is supported by mature amyg- dala-prefrontal circuitry in healthy adults ( Banks , Eddy , Angstadt , Nathan , & Phan , 2007 ; Hariri , Mattay , Tessitore , Fera , & Weinberger , 2003 ; Kim , Somerville , Johnstone , Alexander , & Whalen , 2003 ) .
However , children have yet to develop these internal mechanisms of regulation , as amygdala-prefrontal circuitry undergoes protracted development through adolescence ( Gee , Humphreys , et al. , 2013 ; Guyer et al. , 2008 ; Hare et al. , 2008 ; Monk et al. , 2003 ) .
Because of this relative immaturity , external sources of regulation ( primarily caregivers ) play a critical role in children ’ s emotion regulation ( Hofer , 1994 ; McCoy & Masters , 1985 ) .
Early in life , the caregiver , often the mother , is one of the most potent stimuli for altricial and semialtricial spe- cies and plays an essential role in typical behavioral and neural development ( Tottenham , 2012 ) .

Fareri , Christina Caldera , and Nim Tottenham University of California , Los Angeles Abstract Mature amygdala-prefrontal circuitry regulates affect in adulthood but shows protracted development .
In altricial and semialtricial species , caregivers provide potent affect regulation when mature neurocircuitry is absent .
The present investigation examined a potential mechanism through which caregivers provide regulatory influences in childhood .
Children , but not adolescents , showed evidence of maternal buffering , such that maternal stimuli suppressed amygdala reactivity .
In the absence of maternal stimuli , children exhibited immature amygdala-prefrontal connectivity .
However , in the presence of maternal stimuli , children ’ s connectivity was more mature , resembling adolescents ’ connectivity .
Children showed improved affect-related regulation in the presence of their mothers .
Individual differences emerged , with greater maternal influence on amygdala-prefrontal circuitry associated with stronger mother-child relationships and maternal modulation of behavioral regulation .
These findings suggest a neural mechanism through which caregivers modulate children ’ s regulatory behavior by inducing more mature connectivity and buffering against heightened reactivity .
Maternal buffering in childhood , but not adolescence , suggests that childhood may be a sensitive period for amygdala-prefrontal development .

( Hofer , 1994 ) .
The affective mother-child bond is intense and learned , resulting in preference for the mother and wariness of strangers in infants , and greater approach- related behavior ( Zarbatany & Lamb , 1985 ) , greater exploration ( Ainsworth & Bell , 1970 ) , and less fear ( Campos , Emde , Gaensbauer , & Henderson , 1975 ) in children when the mother is present than when the mother is absent .
These studies suggest that the mother is uniquely relevant as an external source of regulation when the child approaches and engages with the environment .
In nonhuman animals and humans , the maternal stim- ulus is distinguished from nonmaternal stimuli at the neural level as well ( Caldji et al. , 1998 ; Hostinar , Sullivan , & Gunnar , 2014 ; Moriceau & Sullivan , 2006 ; Plotsky et al. , 2005 ; Todd , Evans , Morris , Lewis , & Taylor , 2011 ; Tottenham , Shapiro , Telzer , & Humphreys , 2012 ) .
In rodents , maternal presence reduces amygdala activity in the pup , thus promoting attachment behaviors and reduc- ing fear ( Moriceau & Sullivan , 2006 ) .
Given the functional homologies between rats and humans early in life , it is possible that the mother exerts a similar influence on amygdala circuitry in humans , although the latter remain dependent on maternal care for a much longer period than do the former .
Thus , the present study focused on neural mechanisms underlying the mother ’ s external reg- ulation of emotion in human development .
Recently , we characterized developmental changes in the amygdala-prefrontal circuit that supports emotion regulation in adulthood , with evidence suggesting a shift from an immature to a mature phenotype of amygdala- prefrontal circuitry around the transition between child- hood and adolescence .
Specifically , children exhibit positive connectivity between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) and higher amygdala reactivity , whereas adolescents and adults exhibit negative amygdala-mPFC connectivity and lower amygdala reac- tivity ( Gee , Humphreys , et al. , 2013 ) .
For children , the normative state is having access to their caregiver , who can provide external regulation of developmentally nor- mative heightened amygdala reactivity .
We hypothesized that maternal stimuli might induce phasic modulation of amygdala-mPFC circuitry to promote emotion regulation in childhood by modulating amygdala-mPFC connectiv- ity ( instantiating connectivity akin to that in mature indi- viduals ) and reducing amygdala and affective reactivity .
We anticipated that this effect would be absent in adoles- cence , a time of increasing independence from the mother .
In order to examine the potential mechanism through which the mother provides affect regulation , the present study used a functional MRI ( fMRI ) task involving maternal and nonmaternal stimuli .
In addition , an affect-related regulation task was used to examine whether the presence of the mother effectively modulates amygdala-prefrontal connectivity and associ- ated regulatory behavior .
Method Participants Participants in the fMRI session ( N = 53 ) were 23 children ( ages 4–10 years old , mean age = 7.34 , SD = 2.14 ; 14 females , 9 males ) and 30 adolescents ( ages 11–17 years old , mean age = 14.21 , SD = 1.87 ; 18 females , 12 males ) .
A maximum sample size of 60 participants was deter- mined a priori to account for expected data loss due to excessive motion during fMRI scanning .
We aimed to obtain at least 50 participants with usable scanning data to ensure sufficient sampling across the age range of 4 to 17 years .
Data collection was stopped following comple- tion of the targeted enrollment .
Seven participants were excluded because of excessive motion in their fMRI data .
All participants were physically and psychiatrically healthy ( no medical or psychiatric disorders ) , as con- firmed by a telephone screening prior to participation .
The Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ; Achenbach , 1991 ) was used to assess clinical symptoms , and all participants fell within the normal range on the CBCL Total Problems , Internalizing Problems , and Externalizing Problems subscales .
Of the original 53 participants , 47 also completed a go/no-go task , which measured regulatory behavior in an affective context .
These 47 participants had a mean age of 11.44 years ( SD = 3.86 , range = 4–17 ) .
Of the 6 participants who did not complete the behavioral ses- sion , 3 were children and 3 were adolescents .
Participants were from European American ( 37.7 % ; 34.8 % of children , 40 % of adolescents ) , African American ( 32.1 % ; 26.1 % of children , 36.7 % of adolescents ) , Asian American ( 15.1 % ; 26.1 % of children , 6.7 % of adolescents ) , American Indian ( 5.7 % ; 4.3 % of children , 6.7 % of adoles- cents ) , and other ( 9.4 % ; 8.7 % of children , 10 % of adoles- cents ) backgrounds .
Among participants , 22.6 % identified as Latino ( 21.7 % of children , 23.3 % of adolescents ) .
Cognitive ability was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence ( Wechsler , 1999 ) for participants between the ages of 6 to 17 years ( assess- ments were conducted with 48 participants ) .
The average full-scale IQ of the sample was 110 ( SD = 16 ) .
Data on household income were obtained for the families of 49 participants ; modal income was between $ 55,001 and $ 70,000 , and there was no difference between the child and adolescent groups .
Data on primary caregiver ’ s edu- cation was obtained for families of 52 participants : There was a modal education level of a 4-year college degree for both the child and adolescent groups .
All participants were right-handed .
The protocol was approved by the Maternal Buffering of Amygdala-Prefrontal Circuitry 2069 University of California , Los Angeles Institutional Review Board .
Participants provided informed consent or assent ( parental informed consent for minors ) .
Self- and parent-report measures Anxiety was measured using the parent report form of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale ( Chorpita , Moffitt , & Gray , 2005 ) .
The current study was primarily interested in the subscale for separation anxiety .
Attachment-related behaviors were measured using the Security Scale ( Kerns , Klepac , & Cole , 1996 ) .
Attachment security is difficult to measure after infancy ( during which , measurement relies on the Ainsworth Strange Situation task ) ; however , the Security Scale assesses chil- dren ’ s perceptions of security in parent-child relation- ships in middle childhood and early adolescence .
The instrument provides scores for three subscales : ( a ) chil- dren ’ s belief that their attachment figure is responsive and available , ( b ) children ’ s reliance on the attachment figure in times of stress , and ( c ) children ’ s ease and inter- est in communicating with the attachment figure .
Procedure Participants came to the laboratory for two sessions .
In the first session , behavioral measures were collected and children performed an affect-related regulation task in the presence of their mother and separately in the pres- ence of a stranger ( an experimenter ) .
Children were also acclimated to the scanner environment with an MRI rep- lica .
During the second visit , which occurred on a sepa- rate day , the mother/stranger task was administered in the MRI scanner .
Participants completed the fMRI session an average of 3.81 months ( SD = 4.34 , range = 0–20 ) fol- lowing the behavioral session .
Mother/stranger fMRI task .
Participants completed a block-design mother/stranger task while in the MRI scan- ner .
Based on rodent studies that present olfactory cues associated with the mother to the developing rodent ( reviewed in Moriceau , Roth , & Sullivan , 2010 ) , the pres- ent task used visual cues ( the mother ’ s face ) representa- tive of the mother .
Participants viewed pictures of their mother and an ethnicity-matched unfamiliar individual , who was the mother of another child ( a stranger ) , in alternating blocks of 28 s each .
Both mothers and strang- ers posed with happy and neutral expressions , and all models wore white material around their necks ; thus , for each participant , there were two mother stimuli and two stranger stimuli .
These images were obtained in the labo- ratory and standardized for size and luminance .
The face images were in full color with a vertical visual angle of approximately 15° .
Participants were instructed to respond quickly to the happy facial expression ( regard- less of model ) , which was presented 50 % of the time in the same random order to all participants .
There were four blocks of mother stimuli ( M ) , four blocks of stranger stimuli ( S ) , and three blocks of fixation ( + ) , which were presented with mother and stranger blocks alternating ( +MSMS+SMSM+ ) .
The starting block ( mother or stranger ) was counterbalanced across sub- jects .
Each block contained 18 images of either the par- ticipant ’ s mother ( happy and neutral expressions ) or a stranger ( happy and neutral expressions ) , which yielded a total of 144 stimulus presentations—72 mother trials and 72 stranger trials .
Each face stimulus was presented for 500 ms followed by 1,000 ms of fixation .
Thus , partici- pants were allowed approximately 1,500 ms to respond , which they did by pressing a button with their index finger .
Participants viewed images through VisuaStim Digital video goggles ( Version 8 ; Resonance Technology ) .
A 932 fORP response box ( Current Designs , Philadelphia , PA ) was used for recording behavioral responses .
The entire task lasted 4:54 min .
Prior to scanning , participants were given the opportunity to practice to ensure that they understood and could perform the task .
Scanning parameters .
Participants were scanned with a Siemens Trio 3-T fMRI scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) .
A whole-brain , high resolution , T1-weighted anatomical scan ( magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisi- tion gradient echo ; 192 × 192 in-plane resolution , 250- mm field of view ; 176 mm × 1 mm sagittal slices ) was acquired for each subject for transformation and localiza- tion of functional data into Talairach space ( Talairach & Tournoux , 1988 ) .
For the functional run of the mother/ stranger task , we collected 143 T2*-weighted echo-planar images—34 slices , slice thickness = 4 mm ( skip 0 ) , repeti- tion time = 2,000 ms , echo time = 30 ms , flip angle = 90° , matrix size = 64 × 64—at an oblique angle of approxi- mately 30° .
fMRI preprocessing .
Functional imaging data were pre- processed and analyzed with the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages ( AFNI ) software package ( Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI ) .
All included data were free of movement greater than 2.5 mm in any direction .
After slice-time correction , images were registered to the first image volume after the high-resolution anatomical data set with rigid body transformations and smoothed with an anisotropic 6-mm Gaussian kernel .
Time series were normalized to percentage signal change to allow comparisons across runs and individuals by dividing sig- nal intensity at each time point by the mean intensity for that voxel and multiplying the result by 100 .
The model included regressors for each of the two stimulus types ( mother and stranger ) by convolving the stimulus-timing 2070 Gee et al .
files using a canonical hemodynamic response function .
Six motion parameters were included as separate regres- sors , for a total of eight regressors .
General linear mod- eling ( GLM ; random effects ) was performed to fit the percentage signal change time courses to each regressor .
Linear and quadratic trends were modeled in each voxel time course to control for correlated drift .
Group-level analyses were conducted on the regression coefficients from the individual analysis after transformation into the standard coordinate space of Talairach and Tournoux ( 1988 ) with parameters obtained from the transformation of each subject ’ s high-resolution anatomical scan .
Talai- rach-transformed images had a resampled resolution of 3 mm3 .
Task-dependent functional connectivity .
A whole- brain psychophysiological-interaction ( PPI ) analysis was conducted to examine whether the mother-versus- stranger context modulated functional connectivity with the amygdala .
The PPI analysis tested the extent to which the amygdala covaried with other brain regions more during the viewing of mother faces than during the view- ing of stranger faces .
A GLM analysis was performed in AFNI for each participant , with regressors for task , seed- region time series , interaction of task and time series , accuracy , and the six motion regressors .
Two psycho- logical ( task ) regressors modeled whether a given trial consisted of viewing the mother ’ s face or the stranger ’ s face .
The physiological ( seed-region time series ) regres- sor comprised the time series for the right anatomically defined amygdala .
Two interaction regressors modeled the interaction of the psychological regressors and the physiological regressor , such that each interaction regres- sor identified regions whose time series correlated in a task-dependent manner with the amygdala time series .
The GLM analyses fit the percentage-signal-change time series to each regressor , and linear and quadratic trends were modeled for each voxel ’ s time series to control for correlated drift .
The individual-level regression coef- ficients were then submitted to random-effects , group- level analyses .
Statistical and behavioral data analysis .
Participants were grouped by age ( 4–10 years vs. 11–17 years ) on the basis of prior studies demonstrating a valence switch in amygdala-mPFC coupling around age 10 ( Gabard- Durnam et al. , 2014 ; Gee , Gabard-Durnam , et al. , 2013 ) .
We performed a 2 × 2 repeated measures analysis of vari- ance ( ANOVA ) to test for effects of age group ( children vs. adolescents ) and condition ( mother vs. stranger ) on beta weights for amygdala reactivity and functional con- nectivity .
Individual differences in anxiety and attachment were examined using univariate ANOVAs with factors for age group and valence of amygdala-mPFC connectivity ( positive or negative to the mother , relative to implicit baseline ) .
The right anatomical amygdala , as defined by the Talairach & Tournoux Atlas in AFNI , was selected as a region of interest ( ROI ) .
We were particularly interested in the right amygdala because literature on hemispheric asymmetry suggests that the left hemisphere is more involved in positive emotion , whereas the right hemi- sphere is more threat sensitive and involved in negative emotion ( Canli , Desmond , Zhao , Glover , & Gabrieli , 1998 ; Compton , Heller , Banich , Palmieri , & Miller , 2000 ) , even in infants ( Davidson & Fox , 1982 ) .
Thus , we hypoth- esized that maternal buffering would occur via the right amygdala , which would normally mediate the monitoring of threat presence or absence .
In addition , we have previ- ously shown that the presence of the mother potentiates activation in the left amygdala ( Tottenham et al. , 2012 ) .
Results for the left amygdala ( also defined anatomically using the Talairach & Tournoux Atlas in AFNI ) are pre- sented in the Supplemental Material available online .
The mPFC ROI consisted of z = 10–20 of the anatomically defined anterior cingulate cortex in the Talairach & Tournoux Atlas in AFNI .
This particular region was selected based on prior work demonstrating its role in affective tasks ( Bush , Luu , & Posner , 2000 ) , as well as changes in its connectivity with the amygdala across typi- cal development ( Gabard-Durnam et al. , 2014 ; Gee , Humphreys , et al. , 2013 ) ; beta weights were extracted from the PPI analysis for this ROI .
For each participant , we calculated accuracy and mean reaction time ( RT ) for each condition ( mother , stranger ) .
We calculated accuracy as the difference between the total number of trials ( 72 ) and total errors .
Total errors equaled the sum of false alarms to neutral faces ( errors of commission ; i.e. , responding to a neutral face ) and misses to happy faces ( errors of omission ; i.e. , not responding to a happy face ) .
We calculated the mean RT for correct responses ( hits ) to happy faces and for false alarms to neutral faces .
Motion correction .
Systematic procedures were imple- mented to reduce motion , particularly in younger par- ticipants , and to ensure that children remained still throughout the duration of the task .
Before the scanning session , children participated in a mock scanning session to help them acclimate to the scanning environment and feel comfortable with the scanning procedures .
In addi- tion , this step provided an opportunity for children to practice and receive feedback on lying still in order to optimize children ’ s ability to remain still during actual data collection .
During data collection , an air-vacuum pillow ( Siemens Comfort Pack ) was used to pad and secure the child ’ s head in a comfortable , steady position .
Additional padding was placed around the child ’ s head .
In addition , Maternal Buffering of Amygdala-Prefrontal Circuitry 2071 all participants were provided with feedback and remind- ers regarding motion throughout the scanning session .
Volumes with motion greater than 2.5 mm in any direction were excluded ( via censoring ) , and all par- ticipants had fewer than 27 % of total volumes cen- sored ( mean censored volumes = 1.4 % ; mode = 0 % ) .
Preprocessing included standard spatial realignment to correct for motion .
Motion regressors were included in our imaging analyses ( at the subject level , motion in all six directions at the trial-by-trial level ) .
In addi- tion , multiple analyses were conducted to rule out potential effects of motion .
Average motion ( across all six directions ) did not correlate with age , amygdala reactivity , or amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity and did not differ between the two age groups ( all ps > .05 ) .
Given recent advances in methods for controlling for motion , we also conducted a secondary analysis in which we reanalyzed our functional-connectivity data control- ling for different motion levels across participants ( Van Dijk , Sabuncu , & Buckner , 2012 ) .
The mean absolute- displacement value was calculated for each participant and was entered as a covariate into the repeated mea- sures ANOVA examining functional connectivity in response to mothers versus functional connectivity in response to strangers as a function of age group .
Results of this secondary analysis replicated our original finding of the Condition × Age Group interaction , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 3.98 , p = .052 .
Moreover , mean displacement value was not associated with age , amygdala reactivity , or amygdala- mPFC functional connectivity and did not differ between the two age groups ( ps > .05 ) .
Affect-related regulation task .
At least 1 day prior to completing the mother/stranger task , 47 participants com- pleted an affect-related regulation task ( Hare et al. , 2008 ; Tottenham , Hare , & Casey , 2011 ) outside of the scanner .
In this go/no-go task , participants viewed facial expres- sions of emotion , pressing a button when a target facial expression ( go ) appeared and inhibiting this behavioral response when a distractor facial expression ( no-go ) appeared .
Stimuli consisted of color images of four female faces from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces data- base , each of which was shown with happy , sad , and neutral expressions ( Lundqvist , Flykt , & Öhman , 1998 ) .
The face images were in full color with a vertical visual angle of approximately 12° .
The three task blocks con- sisted of the following : happy face as the go expression and sad face as the no-go expression , happy face as the go expression and neutral face as the no-go expression , and neutral face as the go expression and happy face as the no-go expression .
Participants were instructed to press a response button quickly for the go face and were not told which expression would be the no-go stimulus .
Blocks were counterbalanced across participants .
The go facial expression was presented 66.6 % of the time to cre- ate a prepotent tendency for responding .
Stimuli were presented in the same random order to all participants .
Each face stimulus was presented for 500 ms followed by 1,000 ms of fixation to ensure enough time for responding .
The task was administered twice , once in the presence of the participant ’ s mother and once in the presence of a stranger ( a research assistant ) .
During each administra- tion , the mother or stranger sat next to the participant while he or she completed the task .
Participants were instructed to focus on the task in both conditions , and mothers were instructed not to speak with the participant during the task but instead to occupy themselves with paperwork .
The order of administration ( mother or stranger first ) was counterbalanced .
For each participant , we calculated accuracy as the dif- ference between the number of hits in response to go faces and the number of false alarms ( i.e. , responding to a no-go face ) .
We calculated the mean RT for hits in response to neutral faces in the context of happy and sad no-go faces .
Repeated measures ANOVAs assessed differences in behavioral performance when participants were in the presence of the mother versus the stranger .
A repeated measures ANOVA tested the effects of amygdala-mPFC connectivity valence ( between-subjects factor ) and mother or stranger presence ( within-subjects factor ) on behavior .
To assess whether amygdala reactivity related to how chil- dren performed in the presence of their mother or a stranger , we tested whether children with greater suppres- sion of the amygdala in response to mothers than to strangers differed from children with less amygdala sup- pression to mothers on false alarm rate when in the pres- ence of their mother or a stranger .

Effect of the mother on amygdala reactivity .
Beta weights corresponding to blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) signals were extracted from the right amygdala .
A Condition × Age Group interaction demonstrated that differential activation to mother versus stranger stimuli depended on age , F ( 1 , 53 ) = 4.065 , p = .049 , η2 = .071 ( medium effect size ; Cohen , 1988 ) .
Specifically , right amygdala reactivity in children , which is typically high ( Gee , Humphreys , et al. , 2013 ) , was suppressed when participants viewed their mother , relative to when they viewed a stranger ( Fig .

By contrast , adolescents did not show differential amygdala reactivity to mothers 2072 Gee et al .

Figure S1 in the Supplemental Material shows amygdala reactivity to mothers and strangers ver- sus the implicit baseline for children and adolescents .
Effect of the mother on functional connectivity .
A voxel-wise PPI analysis , with the seed region of the right anatomically defined amygdala , was conducted to examine how the mother and stranger tasks modulated functional connectivity between the amygdala and the mPFC .
Results demonstrated a Condition × Age Group interaction for amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity , F ( 1 , 51 ) = 4.737 , p = .034 , η2 = .085 ( medium effect size ) .
Whereas adolescents showed negative amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity ( relative to baseline ) that did not differ between the mother and stranger conditions , t ( 28 ) = 0.139 , p = .89 , children showed differential con- nectivity to the mother and stranger conditions , t ( 23 ) = 2.496 , p = .02 , η2 = .213 ( large effect size ; Fig .
2 ) .
Amyg- dala-mPFC functional connectivity in children was nega- tive relative to implicit baseline ( inversely correlated ) only for mothers , t ( 23 ) = 2.52 , p = .019 , d = 0.51 ( medium effect size ) , but was not significantly different from zero for strangers relative to implicit baseline , t ( 23 ) = 0.70 , p = .494 .
Connectivity for mothers did not differ between children and adolescents , t ( 51 ) = 0.48 , p = .634 .
For more information about connectivity valence and amygdala reactivity , see the Supplemental Material .
Amygdala-mPFC connectivity and individual dif- ferences .
In order to understand the relationship between the maternally induced neural phenotype and individual differences , we grouped participants into those showing positive amygdala-mPFC connectivity relative to implicit baseline ( n = 17 ; indicative of childlike neural response ) and those showing negative connectivity rela- tive to implicit baseline ( n = 32 ; indicative of adultlike neural response ) .
Participants who demonstrated nega- tive amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity in response to mothers ( vs. implicit baseline ) had lower separation anxiety than those who exhibited positive connectivity in response to mothers , F ( 1 , 48 ) = 6.12 , p = .021 , η2 = .21 ( large effect size ; Fig .
3a ) .
As anticipated , adolescents had lower separation anxiety than children , F ( 14 , 48 ) = 3.11 , p = .008 , η2 = .65 ( large effect size ) .
There was no interac- tion between age group and connectivity valence on separation anxiety , F ( 1 , 48 ) = 1.11 , p = .394 .
Participants with negative amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity in response to mothers ( vs. implicit baseline ) also had higher attachment security , as measured by the Security Scale ’ s subscale for youth ’ s reliance on their attachment figure in times of stress , F ( 1 , 41 ) = 4.20 , p = .047 , η2 = .11 ( medium-large effect size ; Fig .
3b ) .
There was no main effect of age group , F ( 1 , 41 ) = 0.15 , p = .70 , and no inter- action effect between age group and connectivity valence on reported attachment , F ( 1 , 41 ) = 2.17 , p = .149 .

Maternal Buffering of Amygdala-Prefrontal Circuitry 2073 for tests of false alarm rate , miss rate , and reaction time .
There was a Condition ( mother vs. stranger ) × Age Group interaction , F ( 1 , 46 ) = 6.35 , p = .015 , η2 = .12 ( medium- large effect size ) for false alarm rate , such that children ( but not adolescents ) exhibited fewer false alarms in the presence of mothers compared with strangers , t ( 21 ) = 2.24 , p = .037 , d = 0.35 ( small effect size ; Fig .

There were no main effects of or interactions with condition on false alarm rate or RT .
This laboratory-based regulatory behavior was associated with maternal buffering of the amygdala during childhood ( see the Supplemental Material ) .

Discussion The present study examined the effects of mothers ( via both presentation of their image and their physical pres- ence ) on amygdala-prefrontal circuitry and regulatory behavior in children and adolescents .
The maternal stim- ulus induced a mature pattern of negative amygdala-pre- frontal coupling and suppressed amygdala reactivity in children , whereas adolescents showed the expected pat- tern of mature connectivity to both the maternal and stranger conditions and did not show reduced amygdala reactivity to their mother .
Moreover , children , but not adolescents , performed with better regulatory behavior in the presence of their mother than in the presence of a stranger , whereas adolescents ’ performance was unaf- fected by maternal presence .
These findings demonstrate that the maternal stimulus can modulate amygdala-mPFC circuitry and affect behavior , which supports the hypoth- esis that mothers serve as an external source of regula- tion through buffering effects on amygdala-prefrontal circuitry in childhood .
The finding that maternal stimuli buffer amygdala reactivity among children provides a neurobiological basis for the regulatory effects of caregiver presence early in life .
Suppressed amygdala reactivity to the mother in this study parallels prior findings of maternal suppression of amygdala reactivity in rodents ( Moriceau & Sullivan , 2006 ) .
Evidence shows that maternal presence also reduces corticosterone in rodents ( Levine , 2001 ) and cor- tisol in nonhuman primates ( Bayart , Hayashi , Faull , Barchas , & Levine , 1990 ) and humans ( Gunnar & Donzella , 2002 ) .
Thus , the mother may buffer against stress through direct effects on the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , which acts on the develop- ing amygdala .
This potential mechanism has been explored in early childhood , and evidence suggests that social regulation through maternal buffering serves a reg- ulatory function in humans ( Gunnar & Donzella , 2002 ) .
In the present study , the regulatory effects of mothers on children were different from those on adolescents : The latter did not exhibit maternal neural modulation , which possibly reflects decreased behavioral relevance of –30 –25 –20 –15 –10 –5 0 5 Children Adolescents Am yg da la -m PF C Fu nc tio na l C on ne ct iv ity Stranger Stimulus Mother Stimulus * x = –4 Fig .

caregivers as independence increases .
Adults do not show differential amygdala activation to the face of their mother compared with the face of a stranger ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ) , which suggests that childhood is a unique time during which the mother can modulate neurocir- cuitry .
A similar period in rats has been identified as a “ conditional sensitive period ” for the amygdala ( Moriceau & Sullivan , 2006 , p. 655 ) .
Though understanding the function of maternal amygdala suppression requires fur- ther investigation in humans , participants with reduced amygdala reactivity to their mother made fewer false alarms in the presence of their mother , compared with participants without maternal amygdala suppression .
Thus , maternal presence may act on amygdala circuitry to enhance regulatory behavior .
Adolescents exhibited negative amygdala-mPFC con- nectivity ( vs. baseline ) regardless of condition , a finding consistent with evidence for a switch from positive to negative amygdala-mPFC connectivity around the transi- tion to adolescence ( Gee , Gabard-Durnam , et al. , 2013 ; Gee , Humphreys , et al. , 2013 ) .
In children , connectivity to their mother was negative relative to baseline , but con- nectivity did not differ from baseline in response to a stranger ’ s face .
Thus , children ’ s connectivity resembled the pattern of connectivity in adolescents only for the maternal condition .
Given the known regulatory role of the mPFC in adults ( Hariri et al. , 2003 ; Kim et al. , 2003 ) , the observation in children of negative amygdala-mPFC connectivity with reduced amygdala reactivity to mothers suggests that the presence of the mother might buffer against amygdala reactivity through modulation of mPFC coupling with the amygdala .
Though PPI analyses can compare how two tasks modulate functional connectiv- ity , it is important to understand how each task modu- lates connectivity relative to implicit baseline .
For adolescents , the mother and stranger conditions modu- lated amygdala-mPFC connectivity in similar ways ; by contrast , children showed modulation by the mother ( more negative than baseline ) but not by strangers .
Thus , the modulation of amygdala-mPFC functional connectiv- ity by a maternal or stranger context changed with age .
It is important to note the phasic nature of maternal neural modulation in the present study , compared with prior evidence suggesting that prolonged maternal separation accelerates amygdala-prefrontal development ( Callaghan & Richardson , 2011 ; Gee , Gabard-Durnam , et al. , 2013 ) .

Maternal Buffering of Amygdala-Prefrontal Circuitry 2075 Thus , while extended maternal deprivation may induce early development of mature connections with deleteri- ous consequences , strong parent-child attachment may promote regulation through phasic amygdala-prefrontal modulation in the mother ’ s presence .
The finding that maternal buffering was present in children but absent in adolescents suggests that child- hood may be a sensitive period for amygdala-prefrontal development .
Identifying sensitive periods , during which the environment has particularly strong influences on neurodevelopment and thus lasting effects on behavior , is critical to understanding the developmental timing of neuroplasticity and how adult phenotypes are con- structed .
Sensitive periods have been shown in animal models of affective neurodevelopment ( Callaghan & Richardson , 2011 ; Moriceau & Sullivan , 2006 ; Yang , Lin , & Hensch , 2012 ) but have been elusive in humans .
The present study provides initial evidence for a sensitive period in human amygdala-mPFC development , during which the mother can modulate the system .
Physical maternal presence also affected performance on the affect-related regulation task , which has been used previously to measure behavioral regulation in an emotional context ( Hare et al. , 2008 ) .
Specifically , chil- dren made fewer false alarms in their mother ’ s presence than in a stranger ’ s presence , which may mean that the mother enables better behavioral regulation .
Notably , children ’ s false alarm rate , which indexes a failure to reg- ulate a response to an emotional stimulus , but not their miss rate , was modulated by maternal presence .
These findings suggest that maternal presence does not improve general performance but specifically enhances affect- related behavioral regulation .
Consistent with the increased behavioral relevance of the mother in child- hood and our finding that access to maternal stimuli affected amygdala-prefrontal circuitry in children but not in adolescents , these results showed that only children performed differently in the maternal context .
Within children , individual differences in maternal amygdala-prefrontal modulation related to behavior .
Those children who benefited from maternal buffering against amygdala reactivity were able to better regulate their affect-related regulatory behavior than children whose amygdala reactivity was not reduced in the pres- ence of their mothers .
Moreover , the adolescent-like neu- ral phenotype elicited by maternal stimuli may reflect positive aspects of the parent-child relationship .
Specifically , children who displayed negative connectiv- ity to their mother ( relative to implicit baseline ) reported lower separation anxiety and more secure attachment than children who displayed positive connectivity to their mother .
It may be that the nature of a secure attachment relationship results in the mother ’ s ability to regulate amygdala-prefrontal circuitry in children .
Though the fMRI task lacked an explicit demand for emotion regulation , it provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that the mother buffers against amyg- dala reactivity in childhood .
Prior work suggests norma- tively heightened amygdala reactivity in childhood ( Decety , Michalska , & Kinzler , 2012 ; Gee , Humphreys , et al. , 2013 ; Swartz , Carrasco , Wiggins , Thomason , & Monk , 2014 ; Vink , Derks , Hoogendam , Hillegers , & Kahn , 2014 ) .
In novel situations ( e.g. , an fMRI scanner ) , young children can typically access their caregiver , who would buffer against developmentally normative high amygdala reactivity .
Employing threat-related stimuli or acute stressors will be important to further test maternal buffer- ing .
Though mother/stranger physical presence was manipulated in the behavioral task , visual images were manipulated in the fMRI task .
It may be that the mother ’ s physical presence would produce even stronger neural effects of maternal buffering .
A limitation of our fMRI task is the lack of stimuli normed by independent raters for valence , arousal , or perceived age .
Moreover , because we purposefully compared amygdala reactivity to mothers versus strangers , we can not rule out the possible influ- ence of facial familiarity .
This possibility seems less likely , .00 .05 .10 .15 .20 .25 .30 .35 .40 .45 Children Adolescents Fa ls e Al ar m R at e Age Group Mother Present Stranger Present * * Fig .

however , because the effect was absent in adolescents ( who should have even greater familiarity than children with their mothers ) .
Future research would benefit from the inclusion of a familiar nonmaternal control condition .
Finally , because there was a wide age range in the pres- ent study , future studies that focus on a group of simi- larly-aged participants in different stages of puberty ( e.g. , Forbes , Phillips , Silk , Ryan , & Dahl , 2011 ) would help to disentangle influences of age and puberty .
( See the Supplemental Material for information about gender and pubertal status in the present study . )
Caregivers are one of the most salient stimuli early in life and provide many types of regulation for developing youth , including emotion regulation .
Our findings provide a neuromechanistic framework for how caregivers regu- late children ’ s emotional reactivity .
Specifically , maternal presence appears to buffer against amygdala reactivity and induce phasic modulation of amygdala-mPFC con- nectivity , reflecting positive attachment and reduced anxi- ety .
Moreover , for children who experience neural regulatory effects of their mother , maternal presence enables enhanced regulatory behavior .
Thus , caregivers may serve an external regulatory function while circuitry supporting emotion regulation develops in childhood .
With age , this maternal effect may become internalized , which allows for independent regulation via mature neu- ral systems .
The present findings provide evidence for how emotion regulation is supported in humans prior to mature central-nervous-system development .
