ORIGINAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH Institutions and opportunism in buyer–supplier exchanges : the moderated mediating effects of contractual and relational governance Shibin Sheng1 & Kevin Zheng Zhou2 & Julie Juan Li3 & Zhaoyang Guo4 Received : 2 April 2017 /Accepted : 10 April 2018 /Published online : 4 May 2018 # Academy of Marketing Science 2018 Abstract Themarketing channel literature has paid limited attention to institutional environments that constrain buyer–supplier exchanges , though such institutions are fundamental determinants of transaction costs , and thus of the occurrence of opportunism in the buyer–supplier dyads .
Drawing on transaction cost economics and institutional theory , this study uncovers the critical influence of formal and informal institutions ( i.e. , legal effectiveness and networking expenditure ) on the use of governance in deterring opportunism , as well as the moderating role of government support on the efficacy of governance mechanism .
The findings from a buyer–supplier dyadic survey and 2 secondary datasets reveal that legal effectiveness mitigates opportunism through increased use of both contractual and relational governance ; in contrast , networking expenditure reduces opportunism through relational governance , yet increases opportunism via lowering contractual governance .
In addition , contractual governance is more efficient in constraining opportunism when government support is high , whereas relational governance deters opportunism more when government support is low .
These findings offer important implications for academic research and managerial practice .

China With the globalization of business activities , marketing scholars have long called for more attention to the role of macro-level institutions in the globalmarketplace ( Carson et al .
1999 ; Grewal and Dharwadkar 2002 ) .
Carson et al .
( 1999 ) propose a theoret- ical framework to articulate the impact of institutions on gover- nance arrangements for marketing value systems , and Grewal and Dharwadkar ( 2002 ) offer a political economy paradigm to tackle firms ’ interactions with regulatory and normative institu- tions .
Taking institutions into consideration is especially critical for studies in emerging markets , where underdeveloped institu- tional frameworks and rapid institutional changes generate se- vere challenges for business operations ( Handley and Angst 2015 ; Sheng et al .
2011 ; Sheth 2011 ) .
Specifically , the underde- veloped and unstable institutional environments in emerging markets make marketing channels more vulnerable to opportun- ism due to the high cost of detecting and punishing opportunistic behaviors ( Hoskisson et al .
2000 ; Zhou et al .
2017 ) .
Because institutional environments determine a firm ’ s strategic choices and costs in coordinating economics exchanges ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ; North 2005 ; Zhou et al .
2017 ) , it is critical to account for institutional environments when contemplating how to curtail opportunism in buyer–supplier relationships .

2018 ; Sheng et al .
2011 ; Yang et al .
2012 ) , few studies have examined their impact on oppor- tunism ( Wang et al .
2016b ) .
Building on transaction cost eco- nomics ( TCE ) , marketing scholars have extensively investigat- ed how firms choose alternative governance mechanisms to mitigate opportunism ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ; Rindfleisch and Heide 1997 ) .
However , because interfirm exchanges are embedded in a broad institutional environment , and institutions define transaction rules and determine transaction costs ( Carson et al .
1999 ; North 1990 ) , the choice of governance mechanisms is a function of external institutional environments ( Grewal and Dharwadkar 2002 ) .
Underdeveloped , however , is how alterna- tive governance mechanisms mediate the impact of institutions on opportunism in buyer–supplier relationships .
Moreover , the efficacy of alternative governance mecha- nisms is conditional on exchange and environment factors ( Poppo et al .
2016 ; Raassens et al .
2012 ) .
The transaction costs associated with governance mechanisms reflect institu- tional impacts , especially in emerging markets where market- supporting institutions are underdeveloped ( Handley and Angst 2015 ; Sheth 2011 ; Wang et al .
2016b ) .
As buyer–sup- plier relationships are embedded in the macro institutional context , organizational behaviors and actions must be deemed proper according to the socially constructed system of norms , values , and beliefs ( Suchman 1995 ) .
Thus , the efficacy of governance mechanisms is bounded by surrounding institu- tional environments .
However , prior studies have primarily focused on the contingent role of environmental uncertainty ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ) , with limited attention given to how institutional forces moderate the effects of governance mechanisms on opportunism ( Wang et al .
2016b ) .
To address these research gaps , we build on TCE and insti- tutional theory , such that we model the mediating role of gover- nance in bridging the link between institutions and opportunism in buyer–supplier exchanges as well as the moderating effect of government support on the relationship between governance and opportunism ( Fig .
1 ) .
We explicate formal and informal institu- tional forces , manifested as legal effectiveness and networking expenditure , respectively .
We consider both contractual and re- lational governance mechanisms ( Brown et al .
2000 ; Cao and Lumineau 2015 ; Poppo and Zenger 2002 ) , and their interactions with government support .
Thus we can assess how institutional factors influence opportunism through alternative governance mechanisms andmoderate their impacts on partner opportunism .
The empirical results from a primary dyadic survey and 2 sec- ondary datasets provide strong support for our predictions .
With these insights , this study makes several important contributions to the buyer–supplier management literature .
First , by uncovering the mediating roles of contractual and relational governance through which institutions influence op- portunism , we bridge the missing link between the macro- level institutional environment and micro-level buyer–suppli- er relationship outcome .
Second , our findings reveal that legal effectiveness and networking expenditure influence opportun- ism through different mediating fashions .
Third , we demon- strate that the efficacy of buyer–supplier relationship gover- nance is contingent on government support , which enriches our understanding of the proper alignment between gover- nance and institutional environments .
Overall , our study com- plements prior TCE-based marketing channel studies with an institutional view , demonstrating the salient role of institutions in buyer–supplier exchanges .
Conceptual development TCE view of interfirm governance and opportunism Opportunism refers to Bself-interest seeking with guile , ^ as manifested in behaviors such as cheating , shirking , and agree- ment breaching ( Williamson 1985 , p. 47 ) .
According to TCE , opportunistic behaviors are induced by exchange hazards , such as transaction-specific assets ( TSAs , assets invested par- ticularly for a relationship ) and performance ambiguity ( Poppo and Zenger 2002 ; Rokkan et al .
2003 ) .
Contractual and relational governance are two primary mechanisms to safeguard exchanges and curtail potential opportunism in the transactional–relational continuum of exchange governance ( Heide and John 1992 ; Johnson and Sohi 2016 ; Poppo and Zenger 2002 ; Rindfleisch and Heide 1997 ; Williamson 1996 ) .
These two types of governance coexist and coordinate inter- firm exchanges and deter opportunism via different mecha- nisms ( see Cao and Lumineau 2015 for a review ) .
Contractual governance refers to the explicit use of formal written contracts to coordinate interfirm cooperation ( Jap and Anderson 2003 ; Lusch and Brown 1996 ; Poppo and Zenger 2002 ) .

( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 1015 with contingencies , they reduce ambiguity in interpreting in- formation and safeguard TSAs in interfirm exchanges ( Reuer and Ariño 2007 ; Rindfleisch and Heide 1997 ) .
Relational governance refers to the use of shared social norms to guide acceptable or desirable behaviors between exchange partners ( Brown et al .
2000 ; Heide 1994 ; Rokkan et al .
2003 ; Zhou and Xu 2012 ) .
Among various social norms , flexibility , informa- tion sharing , and solidarity are most critical ones in buyer– supplier relationships ( e.g.Heide and John 1992 ; Jap and Ganesan 2000 ; Lusch and Brown 1996 ) .
Following these studies , we operationalize relational governance as a second- order construct consisting of norms of flexibility , information sharing , and solidarity .
Institutional view of buyer–supplier exchanges Institutional theory stems from two distinct roots : economics and sociology .
Institutional economics defines institutions as Bhumanly devised constraints that structure human interaction^ and emphasizes their roles in shaping corporate strategic choices and performance ( North 1990 , p. 3 ; North 2005 ) .
The new institutionalism movement from sociology instead defines institutions as Bregulative , normative , and cognitive structures and activities that provide stability and meaning to social behavior^ ( Scott 1995 , p. 33 ) , such that it highlights how orga- nizations should conform to institutional pressures ( DiMaggio and Powell 1983 ) .
Scholars in turn have developed an institu- tional view derived from both roots , because the two ap- proaches are largely complementary ( Peng et al .
2008 ) .
Institutions can be formal ( e.g. , laws and regulations ) or infor- mal ( e.g. , cultures and values ) ( North 1990 ) .
Enforced through official , coercive means such as courts and legal regulations , formal institutions exert regulatory pressures on organizations , and noncompliance leads to legal sanctions and penalties ( Peng 2003 ) .
Informal institutions are enforced through private , network-based means , which create normative and cognitive pressures for firms to engage in socially acceptable or desirable practices .
Normative pressures shape firm behaviors through social beliefs that define what organizations should or should not do , and cognitive pressures reflect how individual man- agers ’ internalized beliefs affect firm actions ( Scott 2008 ) .
Noncompliance with the institutional pressures causes external constituents to question or defy the firms ’ social validity ( Grewal and Dharwadkar 2002 ; Scott 2008 ) .
Recent studies have explored the impact of institutional environments on buyer–supplier relationship management ( see Table 1 for a review ) .
These studies mainly focus on how institutions affect buyer–supplier relationship outcomes , including information sharing and trust development ( Cai et al .
2010 ) , contract ineffectiveness ( Shou et al .
2016 ) , role hazards ( Dong et al .
2016 ) , request of quotation ( Lanzolla and Frankort 2016 ) , channel performance ( Yang et al .
2012 ) , and the manufacturer ’ s dependence on foreign distributors ( Zhang et al .
2003 ) .
Another set of studies explore the contingent effects of institutional factors .
For instance , Bai et al .
( 2016 ) find that legal enforceability and unilateral government support moderate the effect of contract on conflict .
Sheng et al .
( 2011 ) show that the effect of business ties on firm performance is a function of enforcement inefficiency and government support .
Wang et al .
( 2016a ) examine how gov- ernment intervention and guanxi importance moderate the ef- fect of mutual learning on product co-development between the buyer and supplier .
However , despite that institutions largely determine the cost of detecting and punishing opportunism ( North 2005 ) , few studies have investigated their impact on opportunism , never to mention the underlying mechanisms through which institutional forces may attenuate or increase opportunism .
In addition , the proper alignment between governance mecha- nisms and the institutional environments is an important factor in restraining opportunism .
Yet prior studies have paid scant attention to the contingent effect of government role on the efficacy of governance mechanisms .
These research gaps war- rant a simultaneous examination of the mediating role of gov- ernance and their interplay with institutions in constraining opportunism in buyer–supplier dyads .
Subnational institutional variations in emerging markets In emerging markets , an underdeveloped legal system and a pervasive reliance on social networks represent the most salient formal and informal institutional factors respectively ( Hoskisson et al .
2000 ; Peng 2003 ) .
In many emerging coun- tries , even if legal codes and court systems seem well defined , their implementation and enforcement remain problematic ( Acquaah 2007 ; Hoskisson et al .
2000 ) .
Although the de jure judiciaries are usually universally- and well-defined at the na- tional level , the de facto judiciaries are often subordinated to political power ( Carson et al .
1999 ) .
In China for example , despite continuous legal reforms over the past several decades , legal enforceability continues to be a major business hurdle due to intensive government interventions ( Zhou and Poppo 2010 ) .
In Africa , legal institutions are widely undermined by poor enforcement capacity ( Acquaah 2007 ) .
Therefore , we focus on legal effectiveness , or the extent to which the regulatory and court systems can enforce laws and protect a firm or an individual ’ s property and interests ( Zhou and Poppo 2010 ) .
Moreover , companies in Brazil , China , India , and Russia have long traditions of using network-based , informal institu- tions to conduct business ( Hoskisson et al .
2000 ; Li et al .
2008 ; Peng 2003 ) .
These social networks shape dyadic inter- firm relationships , because the Bindividual relationships are embedded in a context of other relationships that could have governance implications^ ( Heide 1994 , p. 81 ) .

( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 1017 networks improve firm performance ( Gu et al .
2008 ) .
In China , economic exchanges tend to be built on networks ( i.e. , guanxi ) that rely on special favors and obligations in business relationships ( Greif and Tabellini 2010 ) .
Therefore , we consider networking expenditure , the resources a firm uses to build its social networks ; the higher the expenditure , the more important networking is in the society ( Hutchings and Murray 2003 ; Lin et al .
2016 ) .
Unlike governments in developed countries that regulate economic activities mostly through established and transpar- ent legislations , governments in emerging economies such as China often directly intervene into business operations and influence firm decisions by allocating scarce resources and guiding industrial development ( Cai et al .
2010 ) .
Local gov- ernments in China can provide direct support such as valuable information and financial resources to individual firms , as well as indirect support such as implementing policies or pro- grams that are beneficial to individual firms ( Li and Atuahene- Gima 2001 ; Pistor et al .
2000 ) .
Accordingly , we consider gov- ernment support , defined as the extent to which governments provide regulatory resources and help to individual firms ( Cai et al .
2010 ; Li and Atuahene-Gima 2001 ) .
Emerging markets also possess noticeable subnational in- stitutional variations , due to uneven economic development and different cultural traditions across regions ( Chan et al .
2010 ; Chang and Wu 2014 ; Jia 2014 ) .
For example , the 33 provinces in China ( similar to the states in the U.S. ) differ widely in their economic development levels , with the highest GDP per capita of more than US $ 17,000 in Tianjin and Beijing and the lowest of less than US $ 4,800 in Yunnan and Gansu in 2016 .
With such variations , although China has strived to establish an effective legal system nationwide , legal enforcement varies widely across regions ( Chan et al .
2010 ; Zhou and Poppo 2010 ) .1 Such legal variation is evident even in Italy , a developed country , where the legislative institutions demonstrates large heterogeneity across its 20 regions ( Lanzolla and Frankort 2016 ) .
Informal institutions , including culture and social values , also vary greatly across provinces due to historical traditions and uneven development ( Meyer and Nguyen 2005 ) .
In China , the role of informal institutions in business operations , such as managerial networks , is historically and culturally divergent across different regions ( Li et al .
2008 ) .
Uneven regional economic development also prompts regional difference in social values , including networking expenditure ( Tung et al .
2008 ) .
Compared with the coastal regions of China , which have enjoyed a much faster growth rate , western inland provinces tend to host business operations that are em- bedded in social relationships ( Jia 2014 ) .
Government support also exhibit significant heterogeneity in China .
During China ’ s economic reform , the Chinese cen- tral government has shifted a large portion of its power to local governments , which can develop specific policies to cater lo- cal business environments or regional development priorities ( Cai et al .
2010 ) .
Accordingly , local governments may provide different levels of support to firms , such as state-owned enter- prises ( Zhou et al .
2017 ) or firms with political connections ( Gu et al .
2008 ) .
Hypotheses Mediating role of governance mechanisms Prior studies have extensively examined the role of contractu- al and relational governance in deterring partner opportunism ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ; Rokkan et al .
2003 ; Wuyts and Geyskens 2005 ) .
By explicating the responsibilities of each party , performance outcomes to be delivered , and processes for resolving contingent issues , contractual governance pro- vides clear guidelines for the transaction parties to follow , so it should narrow the potential for opportunistic behaviors ( Wuyts and Geyskens 2005 ) .
Moreover , the procedures and performance standards specified in the contract provide the basis for courts to clarify responsibility , should breaches oc- cur , which reduces the costs of contract enforcement ( Klein 1996 ) .
Penalties for noncompliance and compensation for the aggrieved party , as specified in the contract , also provide means for the aggrieved party to protect its interests from being opportunistically appropriated ( Poppo and Zenger 2002 ) .
Thus , contracts mitigate interfirm opportunism .
By nurturing shared values and congruent goals , relational governancemotivates exchange parties to cooperate and value mutual interests , which reduces incentives to behave opportu- nistically ( Rokkan et al .
2003 ; Wuyts and Geyskens 2005 ) .
Also , relational governance promotes expectations of continu- ity , which create a future time horizon for exchange relation- ships ( Carson et al .
2006 ) .
Accordingly , the potential loss of future business outweighs the current gain from opportunistic conduct ( Poppo et al .
2008 ) .
In addition , relational governance encourages information sharing and cultivates trust between the channel members , which reduces tendencies to exercise opportunistic behaviors ( Morgan and Hunt 1994 ) .
Given the abundant literature on the roles of contractual and relational governance in reducing opportunism , we treat such roles as the foundation of the mediating effects .
Our logic is that as institutions determine the transaction costs and 1 The World Bank ’ s Doing Business Survey ( 2008 ) investigates the effective- ness of legal enforcement in the capital cities of 26 provinces and 4 centrally administered municipalities in China .
The average number of procedural steps required to investigate a commercial dispute is the same ( 31 steps ) for all 30 cities , because these steps follow a national , standardized , written code .
However , the efficiency of the courts varies significantly across cities : The average number of days to solve a commercial dispute ranges from 112 ( Nanjing ) to 540 days ( Changchun ) , with a mean of 319.07 and a standard deviation of 89.33 .
Average court and attorney fees , expressed as a percentage of the claim value , swing from 9.00 % ( Shanghai ) to 41.80 % ( Hefei ) , with a mean of 21.78 % and a standard deviation of 9.04 % .

We predict that legal effectiveness will increase the use of contractual governance .
The power of the legal system ema- nates from its capability to make the threat of sanctions or rewards credible ( Greif 2005 ) .
Because an effective legal sys- tem strengthens the predictability of the law and enforcement of contracts ( Zhou and Poppo 2010 ) , firms have higher confidence that the provisions specified in the contracts will be enforced .
In return , firms are more likely to enlarge the scope , explicitness , and completeness of their contracts to coordinate economic transactions ( Carson et al .
1999 ; Peng 2003 ) .
Also , an effective legal system reduces the costs of litigation and contractual en- forcement ( Greif 2005 ) , so firms can protect their interests and obtain credible compensation , should litigations occur .
As a result , exchange parties have more incentives to stipulate re- wards or compensations in details .
In addition , because an ef- fective legal system coercively delineates what each party can or can not do , and noncompliance leads to legal sanctions ( Scott 2008 ) , exchange partners are motivated to specify the respon- sibilities and obligations of each party in the contract .
Extant literature offers conflicting views regarding the rela- tionship between legal effectiveness and relational governance .
Some researchers predict that an efficient legal system decreases the relative enforcement costs of contractual versus relational governance , yet relational governance is more costly and slower to develop and maintain ; thus , legal effectiveness should de- crease the use of relational governance ( Greif 2005 ; Peng 2003 ) .
In contrast , other researchers emphasize the enduring na- ture of informal governance mechanisms despite the institutional transition , perhaps because Bthe movement from personal to im- personal exchange … requires fundamental rethinking at odds with our genetic heritage^ ( North 2005 : 84 ) .
In reality , relational governance is common in the U.S. , despite its strong litigation tradition ( Poppo and Zenger 2002 ; Uzzi 1997 ) ; the use of rela- tional governance is also extensive in Japan , although an effec- tive legal system has been established over time ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ; Ginsburg and Hoetker 2006 ) .
We agree that the substitutive view may be too simplistic , as economic activities are deeply embedded in institutional settings ( Carson et al .
1999 ) .
As an effective legal system ensures the transaction order and pre-specified obligations , it increases predictability in behavior and thus serves as an in- stitutional foundation to develop relational governance be- tween the transaction parties ( Poppo and Zenger 2002 ) .
Consistent with this logic , Zhang et al .
( 2003 ) reveal that the perceived hostility of legal and institutional environment in foreign markets increases manufacturer ’ s dependence on for- eign distributors , which in turn reduces the flexibility norms .
Lanzolla and Frankort ( 2016 ) find that a better institutional quality increases the likelihood of partner contact and information sharing , as the quality of institutional environ- ment conveys credible information on economic agents ’ be- haviors .
Greif and Tabellini ( 2010 ) report that Asian business- men perceive Westerners as more trustworthy due to the ad- vanced legal system in the Western countries , which helps build solidarity norms .
Johnson et al .
( 2002 ) show that the effectiveness of legal system has a significant , positive effect on relational norms ( i.e. , trust and information sharing ) be- tween exchange parties in a study of Vietnamese firms .
Zhou et al .
( 2014 ) document the persistent role of business ties in Chinese societies during the institutional development .
Because relational governance consists of norms of flexibility , information sharing , and solidarity , we predict that legal effec- tiveness likely supports the use of relational governance .
Taken together , given the positive effect of legal effective- ness on contractual and relational governance , and the latter ’ s role in constraining opportunism , we hypothesize that : H1a : Legal effectiveness mitigates opportunism through in- creased use of contractual governance .
H1b : Legal effectiveness mitigates opportunism through in- creased use of relational governance .
Next , we expect networking expenditure to inhibit the use of contractual governance .
According to the institutional view , or- ganizations must devise strategic choices , including relationship governance mechanisms , to conform to the normative and cog- nitive pressures of informal institutions , such as social and cul- tural values ( DiMaggio and Powell 1983 ) .
Compliance with cul- tural values allows firms to obtain positive social evaluations and establish social status ( Oliver 1991 ) .
When networking is impor- tant , cultural values place great normative pressure on economic agents to use social connections to coordinate business relation- ships ( Xin and Pearce 1996 ) .
Accordingly , firms must comply with these values to obtain social legitimacy ( Oliver 1991 ) .
However , if partners rely heavily on explicit contracts , such reli- ance goes against the prevalent cultural values and is perceived as a signal of distrust ( Jap and Ganesan 2000 ) .
Because escalated distrust deviates from the values of network-based institutions , exchange partners will have less incentive to use detailed and explicit contracts when networking expenditure is high .
In contrast , networking expenditure fosters relational gov- ernance through both normative and cognitive pressures .
A network-based society emphasizes social relations , moral ob- ligations , and reputational incentives ( Greif and Tabellini 2010 ) .
These values define what practices are socially accept- able or desirable ( Scott 1995 ) .
Relational norms of flexibility , information sharing , and solidarity get enforced through on- going cooperative interactions and reputational threats ( Plambeck and Taylor 2006 ) , which are highly consistent with the normative values of a network-based society .
Because the values of cooperation and collectivization are widely diffused among economic agents ( Oliver 1991 ) , channel managers J. of the Acad .

Sci .
( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 1019 comply with this cognitive pressure by internalizing beliefs and assumptions within channel dyads to guide everyday operations and routines ( Scott 1995 ) .
Managers thus may develop stronger relational norms , which are congruent with the network values .
Overall , because networking expenditure is negatively associ- ated with contractual governance but positively associated with relational governance , we hypothesize that : H2a : Networking expenditure increases opportunism through reduced use of contractual governance .
H2b : Networking expenditure mitigates opportunism through increased use of relational governance .
Moderating role of government support By providing regulatory information , scarce resources , and preferential programs , government support plays a critical role in shaping the efficacy of firm strategies ( Li and Atuahene- Gima 2001 ; Sheng et al .
2011 ) .
We suggest that government support may enhance the role of contractual governance in mitigating opportunism .
First , government support can facili- tate contractual enforcement .
Given the overall underdevel- oped institutional frameworks in emerging economies , con- tractual enforcement in general is problematic and subject to the interpretation and intervention of local government offi- cials ( Luo 2007 ) .
Accordingly , local government officials play a significant role in facilitating the litigation process as well as speeding up the execution of judicial ruling .
For instance , according to the statistics from the World Bank ’ s Doing Business Survey ( 2008 ) , nearly half of the civil cases with effective rulings in China had not been executed by the year end .
Government officials can use their political power to execute the ruling in a timely manner .
As a result , opportunis- tic contract breach or violation can be deterred if firms can obtain strong support from local governments .
Second , government support can help firms fulfill their contractual obligations.When firms can not deliver the outputs as prescribed in the contracts due to uncontrollable factors , opportunistic shirking or evasion of obligations arises ( Wathne and Heide 2000 ) .
If firms can obtain resource or policy support from the government , they can deal with the uncontrollable factors so as to fulfill its contractual obligations and avoid potential opportunistic behaviors .
As a result , con- tractual governance is more effective when government sup- port is strong .
The case of Fosunny ( Fu Chang ) Electronic Technology Co. in China illustrates the important role that governments play to help firms fulfill their contractual obliga- tions .
With more than 100 upstream suppliers , Fosunny is a Shenzhen-based electronics manufacturer that provides smartphone components and accessories for telecoms giants , including Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation .
In 2014 , Fosunny experienced its hardest time and filed a bankruptcy and reorganization case .
The local governments in Shenzhen provided intensive support to Fosunny in the reorganization process by providing unemployment benefits to its employees , coordinating creditors and suppliers , and bringing in new strategic investors , and etc .
These efforts helped Fosunny to avoid potential breach or violation of its contracts with upstream suppliers ( China Daily 2015 ; Wall Street Journal 2015 ) .
Overall , we predict : H3 : The negative relationship between contractual gover- nance and opportunism is stronger when government support is high than when it is low .
In contrast , relational governance may be less effective in constraining opportunism when government support is high .
Relational governance coordinates exchanges through infor- mation and resource sharing , which nurtures mutual benefits and suppresses opportunism ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ; Rindfleisch and Heide 1997 ) .
However , when firms have strong government support , they can obtain critical informa- tion and scarce resources from the governments ( Li and Atuahene-Gima 2001 ; Pistor et al .
2000 ; Sheng et al .
2011 ) .
As Zhou et al .
( 2017 ) reveal , state-owned enterprises in China have the privilege of securing low-cost loans from the big-four banks , which are directly controlled by the government .
In such case , relational governance becomes less effective in suppressing opportunism because government support re- duces firms ’ dependence on partners for resources .
The role of relational governance in constraining op- portunism also relies on social reputation ( Sheng et al .
2011 ) .
Opportunistic behaviors are perceived by the mem- bers of the business society as a noncompliance or viola- tion of relational norms ( Zhou and Xu 2012 ) .
The loss of a trustworthy reputation due to opportunistic behaviors can lead to ostracism or exclusion from business loops , which helps curb opportunistic intentions ( Gu et al .
2008 ; Milgrom and North 1990 ) .
Meanwhile , given the strong power of governments in emerging markets ( Sheng et al .
2011 ) , government support reflects the backup and favor from the administrative agencies , which helps build and signal a firm ’ s social legitimacy ( Li and Atuahene-Gima 2001 ) .
Such legitimacy implies that the firm ’ s activities and behaviors are consistent with government expecta- tions and standards ( Zimmerman and Zeitz 2002 ) .
As so- cial legitimacy enables a firm to earn acceptance and sup- port from stakeholders in the business network ( Suchman 1995 ) , the opportunism-constraining role of relational governance declines for firms with strong government support .
H4 : The negative relationship between relational governance and opportunism is weaker when government support is high than when it is low .

( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 Method Sample and data collection procedures To test the hypotheses , we examined buyer–supplier exchanges of manufacturing firms in China by combining a primary dy- adic survey and 2 secondary datasets .
In China , institutional development varies significantly across different provinces , so a province is a meaningful level to measure the legal effective- ness and networking expenditure ( e.g. , Chan et al .
2010 ; Chang and Wu 2014 ; Jia 2014 ) .
We assessed province-level legal effectiveness with an archival dataset provided by the National Economic Research Institute ( NERI ) in China .
We measured province-level networking expenditure with data from the World Bank BInvestment Climate Survey.^ We conducted a primary survey of buyer–supplier dyads to measure a firm ’ s perception of government support and other exchange-level variables .
The survey was conducted 2 year after the secondary data collection ( i.e. , information about legal effectiveness and networking expenditure ) , which helped establish causal links between the institutional environments and the governance mechanisms .
We combined the 3 datasets by attributing the scores of legal effectiveness and networking expenditure to the individual firms based on their home provinces .
For the primary survey , we used a directory provided by the China Statistics Bureau to draw a random sample of 1,200 manufacturing firms that operated within the four-digit Chinese Industrial Classification codes 1311–4290 .
These firms spanned diverse industries ( e.g. , chemicals , computer equipment , electronics , mechanics , materials , plastics , appar- el , furniture , food ) and regions , such that they offer significant variation in their institutional environments .
The survey instrument was developed in English , translated into Chinese by independent translators , and then translated back into English to ensure conceptual equivalence ( Hoskisson et al .
2000 ) .
To ensure the content and face validity of the measures , we conducted 10 in-depth interviews with senior purchasing managers , who affirmed their relevance and completeness .
On the basis of their responses , we also revised a few questionnaire items .
We then conducted a pilot study with 20 purchasing professionals and 20 supplier managers , who answered all the items and provided further feedback about the design and wording of the questionnaire .
We finalized the questionnaire according to the results of this pilot study .
We collaborated with a national marketing research compa- ny and trained interviewers to administer the survey on-site .
On-site surveys are critical for obtaining reliable , valid data in emerging markets , because interviewers can reach the right respondents and explain the survey questions if necessary ( Hoskisson et al .
2000 ; Li et al .
2008 ) .
In each firm , a senior purchasing manager served as the key informant ; our inter- views revealed that they were the most knowledgeable about their firms ’ relationships with suppliers .
Managers were first contacted by telephone to solicit their cooperation .
To motivate participation , the interviewers informed them of the academic nature of the study and the confidentiality of their responses and offered an incentive , in the form of a summary report .
In total , 583 purchasing managers agreed to participate , 463 of whom were successfully surveyed on-site .
Informants selected one of their firms ’ major suppliers and answered the survey questions with regard to their exchanges with that supplier .
After the survey , we asked the managers to provide contact information for their counterparts in the supplier companies .
Next , we contacted the supplier managers to solicit their cooperation .
At this stage , we used multiple methods ( i.e. , on- site visits , mail , and fax ) to collect the data .
After excluding firms with extensive missing values , we successfully obtained 420 valid responses from suppliers .
Our final sample thus consists of 420 matched buyer–supplier dyads , representing an effective response rate of 35 % .
The sample firms were located in 18 provinces or province-level municipal cities ; 71.7 % buyers and suppliers were located in the same province or province-level municipal cities , and 28.3 % dyads were comprised of buyers and suppliers from different locations .
Since we used the buyer ’ s opportunism as the dependent var- iable , we used the buyer province ’ s institutional environments in the analyses when the buyer and the supplier were not located in the same province .
After this fieldwork , one of the authors randomly contacted 45 respondents to confirm that the interviews had been con- ducted properly ; we found no problems in the data collection procedure .
A comparison of the responding and non- responding firms from the sampling frame indicated no sig- nificant differences in terms of key firm characteristics ( t = 0.21 , p = 0.83 for number of employees ; t = 0.52 , p = 0.61 for total assets ) , so non-response bias was not a major concern .
Measures To avoid common method bias , we separated the information sources of independent and dependent variables .
In particular , the information of province-level institutional variables ( legal effectiveness and networking expenditure ) was obtained from the secondary data ; the information of government support and interfirm governance mechanisms ( i.e. , contractual and relational governance ) was collected from buyer managers ; the information of opportunism and control variables was from supplier managers .
In the survey , the perceptual mea- sures of latent constructs used 7-point Likert scales .
Opportunism To avoid potential response bias associated with self-reported opportunism , we asked the supplier to rate the buyer ’ s opportunism .
These items , adapted fromRokkan et al .
( 2003 ) , assessed the extent to which the buyer firms engaged in opportunistic behaviors such as lying , violating contracts , J. of the Acad .

Wemeasured contractual governancewith items adapted from Lusch and Brown ( 1996 ) .
These items assessed the degree to which the channel members relied on written contracts ( cf .
shared understanding ) to specify roles , responsibilities , task performance , or appropriate responses to unplanned events , as well as to resolve disagreement .
We operationalized relational governance as a second-order factor of 3 relational norms : flexibility , information sharing , and solidarity ( Heide and John 1992 ; Jap and Ganesan 2000 ; Lusch and Brown 1996 ; Zhang et al .
2003 ) .
We adapted the measure of government support from Li and Atuahene-Gima ( 2001 ) .
The scale contains four items that reflect the local governments ’ effort and activities to support individual firms ’ operations in various perspectives , including supportive projects , policies , information , and resources .
The measure of legal effectiveness is from the NERI index that indicates each province ’ s level of economic , financial , political , and legal development , which has been widely used in economics , finance , and strategy research ( e.g. , Chang and Wu 2014 ; Jia 2014 ) .
The index contains five sub-indices : ( 1 ) the relation between government and the market , ( 2 ) the de- velopment of the non-state economy , ( 3 ) the development of the product market , ( 4 ) the development of the factor market , and ( 5 ) the development of the legal environment and market intermediaries .
We used the fifth sub-index to measure legal effectiveness .
It contains four indicators : ( 1 ) development of market and legal intermediaries , such as lawyer and accoun- tant services , ( 2 ) legal protection of corporate property and interests , ( 3 ) legal protection of intellectual property , and ( 4 ) legal protection of consumer interests and rights .
The level of legal effectiveness exhibits significant variation across differ- ent provinces , ranging from 3.20 ( Shaanxi province ) to 13.87 ( Shanghai ) , with an average of 11.88 .
We obtained the measure of networking expenditure from the World Bank BInvestment Climate Survey.^ In China , firms de- vote substantial resources to business entertainment , such as kar- aoke , performances , travel , and banquets , to build managerial networks ( Sheng et al .
2011 ; Xin and Pearce 1996 ) ; networking expenditure reflects the importance and value of social networks ( Lin et al .
2016 ; Hutchings and Murray 2003 ) .
The World Bank Survey collected information of annual corporate expenses on business entertaining .
We used the annual entertaining expenses as a percentage of firm revenue to measure networking expendi- ture .
Similarly , Lin et al .
( 2016 ) use this ratio to measure firms ’ investment on network connections , which reflects the impor- tance and value of network in business operations in China .
The World Bank Survey sampled 12,400 firms in China .
To assess networking expenditure at the provincial level , we used the average score across all individual sample firms in each province , with the assumption that firms in a specific province share similar cultural values ( Klein and Kozlowski 2000 ) .
Following Klein and Kozlowski ( 2000 ) , we examined within-unit agreement and between-unit differences when ag- gregating firm-level data to the provincial level .
We generated the intraclass correlation coefficients ICC ( 1 ) .
The ICC ( 1 ) is greater than 0 , and the group effect ( i.e. , F-value in the anal- ysis of variance [ ANOVA ] , with province as the independent variable and the ratio as the dependent variable ) is significant ( p < .001 ) , indicating within-unit convergence .
Using the Spearman-Brown formula , we derived an ICC ( 2 ) value of 0.85 , well above the 0.70 cutoff ( Klein and Kozlowski 2000 ) .
These results justify the data aggregation .
The level of networking expenditure ( the annual entertaining expenses as a percentage of firm revenue ) varies substantially , with the lowest level of 0.27 ( Guangdong province ) and the highest level of 0.77 ( Hunan province ) .
The average level is 0.42 .
Control variables We controlled for four sources of heteroge- neity .
First , we controlled for exchange attributes , including TSAs and performance ambiguity .
We adapted the TSAs mea- sure from Cannon and Perreault Jr. ( 1999 ) and Jap and Ganesan ( 2000 ) and the scale of the buyer ’ s performance am- biguity from Heide ( 2003 ) ( see the Appendix ) .
Second , we considered focal firm characteristics , including firm size and foreign ownership .
We used the logarithm of the number of employees as an indicator of firm size .
Firm own- ership was a dummy variable , with international joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned firms coded foreign ( 1 ) and others coded domestic ( 0 ) .
Third , we noted the dyadic exchange characteristics , includ- ing order frequency , exchange duration , and transaction size .
For order frequency , we determined how often the buyer placed or- ders on an eight-point scale ( 1 = Bonce a day , ^ 8 = Bonce a year^ ) .
Exchange duration indicated the number of years the buyer and supplier had been doing business together .
Tomeasure transaction size , we used the natural logarithm of yearly sales ( in tens of thousands of RMB ) between the supplier and the buyer .
In addition , we accounted for the impacts of industry .
We controlled for the effects of the firm ’ s industry with 3 dummy variables : electronics , mechanics , and chemicals .
The remaining industries represented the baseline group .
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations among all the variables .
Construct validity We assessed the reliability and validity of latent constructs with confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) .
First , we ran a CFA model of the 3 first-order factors of relational governance ( i.e. , flexibility , information sharing , and solidarity ) ( see Appendix , Panel A ) .
Then we ran an overall CFA model that includes all latent constructs , in which relational governance was treated as a second-order factor with 3 summated indicators of the first-order factors ( see Appendix , Panel B ) .
For Models A and B , the comparative fit index [ CFI ] is 0.96 and 0.94 ; the root mean square error of approximation 1022 J. of the Acad .

( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 1023 [ RMSEA ] is 0.08 and 0.08 ; the standardized root mean square residual [ SRMR ] is 0.04 and 0.08 .
Following Hu and Bentler ’ s ( 1999 ) two-index approach , we used RMSEA and SRMR to evaluate the measurement model fit .
The SRMR value ( 0.04 and 0.08 ) is better than the cutoff value ( 0.09 ) whereas RMSEA ( 0.08 ) is slightly higher than the cutoff value ( 0.06 ) suggested by Hu and Bentler ( 1999 ) .
Overall , the mea- surement models fit the data adequately .
As the Appendix shows , the composite reliability of each latent construct exceeded the 0.70 threshold ( Bagozzi and Yi 1988 ) ; the average variance extracted ( AVE ) values all exceeded the 0.50 cutoff value ( Fornell and Larcker 1981 ) .
We compared the AVE of each construct with the square of the construct ’ s correlations with other factors to assess dis- criminant validity .
All the AVEs were greater than the corre- lation squares , providing further support of discriminant va- lidity ( Fornell and Larcker 1981 ) .
Overall , the measures pos- sessed adequate reliability and validity .
Analyses and results Following previous studies ( Palmatier et al .
2007 ) , we tested our model by using structural equation modeling ( SEM ) with maximum likelihood estimation for 3 reasons .
First , contrac- tual governance and relational governance can coexist in a buyer–suppler relationship ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ) ; the correlation between the two types of governance can be accounted for in an SEM model by simultaneously analyzing all variables in the model instead of separately .
Second , SEM uses latent variables to account for measurement errors , in- stead of aggregating measurement errors in a residual error term .
Third , SEM is particularly effective in testing mediating models ( Hu and Bentler 1999 ; Palmatier et al .
2007 ) .
In the SEM model , we estimated the path links among the constructs according to the conceptual framework in Fig .
1 .
Legal effectiveness and networking expenditure were the exog- enous constructs , with contractual governance and relational governance as the intermediate constructs , and opportunism as the outcome variable .
The 10 control variables were included and linked to opportunism .
Each construct with multiple measure- ment items was represented as a latent construct .
Relational gov- ernance was configured as a second-order factor with 3 first-or- der reflective constructs ( i.e. , flexibility , information sharing , and solidarity ) .
As shown in Table 3 , the fit indexes of the mediating effect model indicated an adequate fit ( χ2 ( 534 ) = 1512.81 , p < 0.001 ; RMSEA = 0.07 ; SRMR = 0.07 ; CFI = 0.90 ) .
Mediating effects of governance We compared two models to test the mediating effects ( see Table 3 ) .
First , we estimated a direct effect model that excluded the mediating variables ( contractual and relational governance ) .
The model shows direct negative effects of contractual gover- nance ( β = -0.08 , p < 0.10 ) and relational governance ( β = -0.19 , p < 0.01 ) on opportunism .
Second , we included contractual and relational governance into the mediating effect model .
As shown in Table 3 , the effect of networking expenditure on opportunism remains significant ( β = -0.18 , p < 0.01 ) and that of legal effec- tiveness becomes non-significant ( β = -0.02 , n.s . ) .
Legal effec- tiveness positively relates to both contractual governance ( β = 0.24 , p < 0.01 ) and relational governance ( β = 0.14 , p < 0.01 ) .
Networking expenditure negatively relates to contractual gover- nance ( β = -0.12 , p < 0.05 ) but positively relate to relational governance ( β = 0.13 , p < 0.05 ) .
Furthermore , both contractual governance ( β= -0.14 , p < 0.01 ) and relational governance ( β= - 0.27 , p < 0.01 ) negatively relate to opportunism .
Overall , the results in Table 3 support the mediating roles of contractual and relational governance underlying effects of institutional environments on opportunism , with the effect of legal effectiveness being fully mediated and the effect of networking expenditure being partially mediated .
Following Zhao et al .
( 2010 ) and Preacher and Hayes ( 2008 ) , we used the bootstrapping test results to assess the significance of the indirect effects of institutional environments on opportunism .
The 95 % bias-corrected confidence interval for the indirect ef- fect of legal effectiveness on opportunism is [ -0.13 , -0.03 ] .
Because this interval is below 0 , the indirect effect of legal effectiveness on opportunism differs significantly from 0 at the 5 % significance level .
In contrast , the 95 % bias-corrected confidence interval for the indirect effect of networking expen- diture on opportunism is [ -0.07 , 0.03 ] .
Since the 0 point falls within the confidence interval , the indirect effect of networking expenditure is not significantly different from 0 at the 5 % sig- nificance level ( Zhao et al .
2010 ) .
However , this does not mean that there is nomediating effect from networking expenditure to opportunism through governance mechanisms , because oppo- site mediating effects may exist , resulting in a non-significant indirect effect ( Zhao et al .
2010 ) .
In order to test H1a-b and H2a-b , we need to isolate the indirect effects of institutional factors on opportunism through specific mediators , i.e. , contractual governance and relational governance , respectively , and run the corresponding Sobel z- test ( Zhao et al .
2010 ) .
As shown in Table 4 , all the four isolated mediating effects are significant and consistent with our predictions .
The indirect effect of legal effectiveness on opportunism through contractual governance ( β = -0.02 , p < 0.05 ) and relational governance ( β = -0.02 , p < 0.05 ) are significant and pointing in the same direction , leading to the significant indirect effect of legal effectiveness on opportun- ism in the bootstrapping test .
However , the mediating mecha- nism underlying the effect of networking expenditure demon- strates a more complex fashion .
The indirect effect of networking expenditure on opportunism through contract governance is pos- itive and marginally significant ( β = 0.26 , p < 0.10 ) , while that through relational governance is negative ( β= -0.52 , p < 0.05 ) .

Overall , H1a-b and H2a-b are all supported .
Moderating effects of government support Following Palmatier et al. ’ s ( 2007 ) approach , we used multi- group structural analyses to test the moderating effects of gov- ernment support on the relationships between governance and opportunism .
First , we used median-split to divide the whole sample into two groups at the median level of government support .
Observations with a value of government support smaller than the median ( 4.50 ) is grouped into the Blow^ group ( N =194 ) ; and those with a value of government support larger than the median is grouped into the Bhigh^ group ( N = 209 ) .
Then , we tested the moderating hypotheses using a series of nested models .
For each moderating hypothesis , we compared the constrained model in which the path coefficient correspond- ing to the relationship of concern ( i.e .
the hypothesized moder- ated path ) is constrained to remain equal across the two groups versus an unconstrained model in which the path is estimated freely for each group .
A significantly lower χ2 value for the unconstrained model indicates a significant moderating effect .
In line with H3 , the results in Table 5 show that contractual governance plays a stronger role in constraining opportunism when government support is high ( β = -0.31 , p < 0.01 ) than when it is low ( β = 0.01 , n.s . ) .
The chi-square difference test also suggests a significant moderating effect ( Δλ2 ( 1 ) = 10.17 , p < 0.01 ) .
Consistent with the prediction of H4 , the results in Table 5 show that relational governance is less effective in mitigating opportunism when government support is high ( β = 0.11 , n.s . )
than when it is low ( β = -0.23 , p < 0.01 ; Δλ2 ( 1 ) = 4.19 , p < 0.05 ) .
These results provide support to H3 and H4 .
Discussion Echoing the call for more research into the role of institutions in marketing decisions ( Cao et al .
2018 ; Sheng et al .
2011 ; Sheth 2011 ; Yang et al .
2012 ) , especially in marketing channel management ( Carson et al .
1999 ; Grewal and Dharwadkar 2002 ; McFarland et al .
2008 ) , we aim to understand how institutional environments influence opportunism in buyer– supplier relationships .
Our study tackles this question from an institutional view by uncovering the mediating effect of contractual and relational governance on the relationship be- tween institutions and opportunism , as well as the moderating role of government support on the efficacy of interfirm gov- ernance .
The empirical findings of this study have important implications for both marketing theory and practice .
Theoretical contributions First , the extant governance literature , mostly rooted in TCE , has focused primarily on the task environment and economic deter- minants of transaction costs ( Grewal and Dharwadkar 2002 ) .
However , institutions are primary macro-level determinants of the size and structure of transaction costs at the micro-level ( North 1990 ; Williamson 1996 ) , and they exert significant influ- ence on strategic decisions , including interfirm governance choices , and the performance outcome of these decisions ( Cao et al .
2018 ; Carson et al .
1999 ; Yang et al .
2012 ) .
This study extends the TCE-based marketing channel literature by explicitly considering the role of institutions .
Because formal and informal institutional forces have distinct enforcement mechanisms ( North 2005 ) , they demonstrate differential effects on buyer–supplier op- portunism .
This institutional view of buyer–supplier relationship enriches the extant TCE-based marketing channel literature and demonstrates the importance of integrating macro-level institu- tional forces with micro-level governance mechanisms of eco- nomic exchanges ( McFarland et al .
2008 ; Williamson 1996 ) .
Second , our study reveals the underling mediating mecha- nisms through which institutions impact buyer–supplier rela- tionships , echoing a long-standing call by Grewal and Dharwadkar ( 2002 ) .
Some recent studies have started to ex- amine the effect of institutions on buyer–supplier relationship performance , including trust development ( Cai et al .
2010 ) , role hazards ( Dong et al .
2016 ) , and likelihood of transactions ( Lanzolla and Frankort 2016 ) .
However , we know little about the underlying mechanisms through which institutions atten- uate or nurture opportunism .
Our findings indicate that the effect of legal effectiveness on opportunism is fully mediated Table 5 Standardized path estimates of the moderating effects Government support Paths β of low group β of high group Δλ2 Contractual governance → Opportunism 0.01 ( 0.05 ) -0.31** ( 0.12 ) 10.17** Relational governance → Opportunism -0.23** ( 0.08 ) 0.11 ( 0.20 ) 4.19* * p < .05 .

( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 by contractual and relational governance , which suggests that an effective legal system increases the use of both contractual and relational governance , which in turn mitigates partner opportunism .
The finding of the enduring role of relational governance is in contrast with the conventional institutional view that governance mechanisms will shift from network- based to market-based as the formal institutions improve in emerging economies ( Peng 2003 ) .
However , this finding is in line with recent evidence that an effective legal system builds up the foundation that supports the functioning of relational governance ( Lanzolla and Frankort 2016 ; Zhou et al .
2014 ) .
These findings suggest that the establishment of effective legal system in emerging markets does not preclude the use of infor- mal governance ; rather , the pluralistic use of both formal and informal governance is more realistic .
Interestingly , whereas networking expenditure decreases opportunism via relational governance , it also increases opportunism by reducing the use of contracts .
Such findings show the complicated influence of institutional factors on interfirm strategies and bridge the miss- ing link between institutional factors and relationship outcomes ( c.f .
Lanzolla and Frankort 2016 ; Shou et al .
2016 ) .
Third , the extant marketing literature recognizes how alterna- tive governance mechanisms curtail potential opportunism ( e.g. , Heide et al .
2007 ; Rokkan et al .
2003 ) and how their efficacy depends on the nature of exchange hazards ( Hoetker and Mellewigt 2009 ; Poppo et al .
2016 ; Raassens et al .
2012 ) .
However , despite the long-standing call of Grewal and Dharwadkar ( 2002 ) , few studies account for the interplay be- tween governance mechanisms and institutional environments ( Bai et al .
2016 ; Wang et al .
2016b ) .
We extend this research stream by examining how government support differentially moderates the effects of contractual and relational governance on opportunism .
Our findings reveal that contractual governance is more effective in constraining opportunism when government support is high , whereas relational governance is more effective when government support is low .
These findings provide fresh insights into how to match the proper governance mechanisms with the institutional environment ( Yang et al .
2012 ) and high- light the importance of considering the role of government in interfirm exchange studies ( Bai et al .
2016 ; Sheng et al .
2011 ) .
Managerial implications This study also offers important managerial implications .
Whereas emerging markets such as China offer great growth opportunities , their fast-changing social , political , and economic institutions also make opportunistic behaviors pervasive ( Sheth 2011 ) .
Hence , managers must consider institutional environments when employing appropriate governance mechanisms to con- strain opportunism .
First , managers should understand that con- tractual and relational governance fully mediate the effect of legal effectiveness on opportunism .
Thus , in regions with well- developed legal systems , managers should both design specific contractual clauses and develop relational norms to constrain op- portunism , rather than reduce the use of relational governance .
Second , managers should understand the complicated role of social networks in deterring opportunism .
Whereas managers tend to use less contractual governance in a network-based busi- ness environment , such a practice is not optimal because it leads to increased opportunism .
For instance , the northeast region of China is characterized by heavy reliance on network connections in business operations .
Transaction parties often downplay legal contracts to manage their relationships .
This deters the develop- ment of a heathy business environment , and opportunism in business relationships is pervasive , which is considered to be an important factor leading to slow economic growth in this region in recent years .
Thus , managers should realize that even if social networks are pervasive , it is not a wise choice to lessen contractual governance when opportunism is a concern .
Third , our findings indicate that the effect of governance mechanism is contingent on government support .
If managers can gain strong support from the government , then they can use contractual control to suppress transaction partners ’ op- portunistic behaviors .
Conversely , if managers attempt to use contractual control , they should try to get support from the government to back it up .
In contrast , when government sup- port is unlikely , then managers should employ relational gov- ernance to constrain partner opportunism .
Limitations and further research This study is subject to several limitations .
First , our sample is limited to firms in China .
Emerging markets vary in their eco- nomic development and institutional transitions , so we recom- mend caution before generalizing our findings .
Additional re- search could test our framework in other emerging markets .
Also , cultural differences may interfere with governance choices in the buyer–supplier dyads .
Collective cultures motivate eco- nomic agents to reduce conflict and pursue common interests , whereas individualist cultures may encourage self-interest seek- ing ( Handley andAngst 2015 ) .
Future researchmay explore how cultural differences influence the effects of the governance on opportunism in buyer–supplier relationships .
Second , we measure legal effectiveness and networking ex- penditure at the province level .
Whereas the cross-province vari- ations in China are shown in prior studies ( e.g. , Chang and Wu 2014 ; Jia 2014 ) , the conceptual model can be tested more effec- tively with a cross-country dataset , which can directly measure institutional environments at the national level ( Yang et al .
2012 ) .
Also , there may be many other confounding variables like urban- ization and westernization due to uneven regional development in China , future research should take a longitudinal panel dataset to examine their impacts .
Third , this study investigates a limited set of institutions , in the form of legal frameworks , informal networks , and gov- ernment support .

( 2018 ) 46:1014–1031 1027 examine whether other facets of institutional frameworks , such as political instability and government corruption , af- fect buyer–supplier relationship management ( Cao and Lumineau 2015 ) .
Fourth , managers have multiple goals when managing buyer–supplier relationships , such as suppressing oppor- tunism , minimizing risk , bolstering cooperation , and max- imizing profitability ( Poppo et al .
2016 ) .
With our sole fo- cus on opportunism , this study suggests the need for further research that explores the confluence of governance mech- anisms and institutions in shaping other relationship out- comes .
Also , dyadic variables , including order frequency , exchange duration , transaction size , and relative power , al- so interact with institutions to determine exchange out- comes .
Additional research is encouraged to explore the dynamic interplay among institutions , exchange features , and relationship outcomes .
