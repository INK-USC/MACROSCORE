We propose that others ' facial behavior provides a frequently-encountered source of feedback to which self-esteem should respond .
We expected repeated exposure to angry faces to reduce perceivers ' self-esteem but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze ( “ looked at ” perceivers ) .
Two studies supported this hypothesis .
In Study 1 , participants viewed a series of faces under the guise of amemory paradigm .
Self-esteemwas reduced amongpar- ticipants who viewed angry faces compared to participants who viewed neutral or happy faces .
Crucially , this pattern only occurred in response to faces exhibiting direct-gaze .
In Study 2 , participants completed a word- identification task in which attention to faces was task-irrelevant .
The results of this study replicated Study 1 but only to the extent faces captured participants ' attention during the priming task .

All rights reserved.It hurts to get rejected for a date or told of one 's undesirable traits but fortunately for humans ' self-esteem , most people do not receive this sort of overt feedback more than a few times daily ( Blumberg , 1972 ; Felson , 1980 ; Leary , Cottrell , & Phillips , 2001 ; Waung & Highhouse , 1997 ; Zadro , Williams , & Richardson , 2004 ) .
Subtler feedback , such as feedback generated by facial expressions and other nonverbal cues , may occur with greater frequency ( cf .
Ambady & Weisbuch , 2010 ) and thus exert a persistent influence on self-esteem .
Yet despite research demonstrat- ing the influence of others ' nonverbal behavior on perceivers ' attention , emotion , and attitudes ( e.g. , Dimberg , Thunberg , & Elmehed , 2000 ; Phelps , Ling , & Carrasco , 2006 ; Weisbuch & Ambady , 2009 ) , there is little evidence regarding how the self-concept is shaped by nonverbal cues .
Drawing from theories that suggest the self-concept is built via social- feedback ( Cooley , 1902 ; Leary , 1999 ; Mead , 1934 ) , we here examine how self-esteem is shaped by others ' nonverbal behavior.Self-esteem and social value Classic theories across the social sciences suggest that the self- concept is shaped by others ' opinions .
In describing the looking-glass self , Cooley ( 1902 ) posited that beliefs about others ' evaluations of one- self ( “ reflected appraisals ” ) are the foundation of the self-concept .
Mead ( 1934 ) built on this idea to emphasize the accumulation of reflected appraisals into a relatively stable generalized other .
Consistent with the views of Cooley and Mead , self-esteem has recently been described as a gauge of one 's perceived social valuewherein state self-esteem fluctu- ates in response to moment-to-moment social feedback ( e.g. , Leary , 1999 ; Leary & Baumeister , 2000 ; Leary et al. , 2001 ; Leary & Downs , 1995 ; Leary , Haupt , Strausser , & Chokel , 1998 ) .
Such fluctuations can also be described as oscillation around each individual 's attractor ( or resting ) state of self-esteem ( Vallacher Nowak , Froehlich , & Rockloff , 2002 ) with the key point here that self-esteem fluctuations reflect perceived social value .
Many studies have supported this sociometer model of self-esteem ( Leary , 2012 ) .
For example , verbal feedback and ostracism both exert 131S.A .
Lamer et al .
/ Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 56 ( 2015 ) 130–138powerful influences on state self-esteem ( Kamal , Blais , McCarrey , Laramee , & Ekstrand , 1992 ; Leary , Tambor , Terdal , & Downs , 1995 ; Leary et al. , 2001 ; Zadro et al. , 2004 ) .
Yet much of this evidence regards forms of feedback that occur relatively infrequently .
Even themost talk- ative people speak only so-often ( Ambady & Weisbuch , 2010 ) and when they do speak , are often hesitant to give negative or even positive feedback ( Blumberg , 1972 ; Felson , 1980 ; Waung & Highhouse , 1997 ) .
Thus , while verbal feedback and ostracism can account for changes to self-esteem over longer time periods , they probably do not occur frequently enough to account for moment-to-moment fluctuations in self-esteem .
These fluctuationsmay be explained , however , by feedback accruing via nonverbal behavior .
Nonverbal behavior and self-esteem Whenever one person sees another , she or he typically sees body- posture , eye-gaze , facial-expressions ( neutral or emotional ) , and other nonverbal cues .
The high frequency of nonverbal behavior is conse- quential in that perceivers ' emotions , attitudes , and behavior effortless- ly respond to others ' nonverbal cues ( e.g. , Dimberg et al. , 2000 ; Murphy & Zajonc , 1993 ; Tiedens & Fragale , 2003 ; Weisbuch & Ambady , 2009 ) .
Yet little research has examined how the self-concept responds to others ' nonverbal behavior .
In the one set of studieswe located , participants watched a dynamic , 2-min video of a person exhibitingmostly-direct ormostly-averted gaze and visualized interactingwith that person ( Wirth , Sacco , Hugenberg , & Williams , 2010 ) .
Across three studies , participants in the mostly- averted gaze conditions exhibited an array of self-evaluative responses including reduced self-esteem , suggesting that self-esteemcan be sensi- tive to a single nonverbal cue ( eye-gaze ) .
Importantly , this study established that self-esteem is sensitive to dynamic patterns of eye- gaze exhibited by a single individual .
Thus , when participants envisaged interactingwith a personwho exhibited a particular dynamic pattern of eye-gaze , their self-esteem adjusted to whether that eye-gaze pattern was consistentwith inclusion ( mostly direct-gaze ) or exclusion ( mostly averted-gaze ) .
These findings made an important contribution to scien- tific understanding of self-esteem but also opened up important new questions which we address herein .
Although people often interact with single individuals , those single individuals display multiple nonverbal cues at any one moment ( not just eye-gaze ) .
Moreover , the social environment includes many individuals some ofwhomare only encountered briefly.We thus sought to examine the extent towhich self-esteem tracksmeaningful combina- tions of nonverbal cues and whether it can track such combinations across multiple target persons .
Even if eye-gaze and other nonverbal cues can evokemeaningful responses when isolated , these cues typical- ly do not exist in isolation .
For example , eye-gaze and facial expression can be artificially isolated with photo-editing software , but such isolation is atypical in everyday experience .
Facial expressions ( includ- ing neutrality ) and eye-gaze regularly occur together in space .
The comingling of these cues is not lost on perceivers , who interpret eye- gaze with respect to facial-expression and vice-versa ( Adams & Kleck , 2003 , 2005 ; Lobmaier , Tiddeman , & Perrett , 2008 ; Slepian , Weisbuch , Adams , & Ambady , 2011 ) .
Similarly , a photograph or video can isolate the face of a single individual but over time , most people encounter many faces and each of these faces contain nonverbal cues ( e.g. , eye- contact ) .
Consistent with this “ nonverbal environment , ” perceivers update their attitudes and appetites to reflect the temporally- distributed pattern of nonverbal cues they encounter ( Weisbuch & Ambady , 2009 ; Weisbuch , Pauker , & Ambady , 2009 ; Winkielman , Berridge , & Wilbarger , 2005 ) .
A sociometer sensitive to complex nonverbal patterns in the envi- ronment could find state self-esteem readings in any face-to-face inter- action , would be sensitive to evaluations that people are unwilling or unable to communicate overtly , and would be sensitive to the accrual of such tacit evidence .
In short , people can process spatially- andtemporally-distributed patterns of nonverbal cues and we expect self- esteem to be sensitive to those patterns .
The current research We examined whether self-esteem was reliably influenced by mul- tiple nonverbal cues encountered across different faces over time .
We focused here on the well-studied combination of eye-gaze and facial- emotion ( cf .
Adams , Franklin , Nelson , & Stevenson , 2010 ) .
In each of two studies , participants completed self-esteemmeasures after viewing a series of faces that varied—on a between-subjects basis—with respect to emotion expression and eye gaze .
We expected exposure to negative ( versus positive ) facial emotion to reduce perceivers ' self-esteem but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze ( i.e. , were “ looking at ” perceivers ) .
In other words , self- esteem should only be influenced by facial emotions directed at the self .
Just as hearing negative statements directed at oneself may reduce one 's self-esteem ( Kamal et al. , 1992 ; Kernis & Johnson , 1990 ) , seeing negative facial expressions directed at oneself might reduce one 's self- esteem .
Negative facial expressions directed away from oneself are not self-oriented and thus might not reduce self-esteem .
Our hypothe- seswere strongest for negative facial expressions .
Positive facial expres- sions directed at oneself may increase self-esteem but this hypothesis was a bitmore exploratory in that positive facial expressions are norma- tive ( Cole , 1986 ; Hayes & Metts , 2008 ; Matsumoto , 1993 ) somay not be received as signals about the self .
Consequently , we expected self- esteem to be lower after exposure to a temporally-distributed pattern of facial anger versus facial joy or facial neutrality , but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze .
We have argued that self-esteem is most likely to respond to com- plex patterns of nonverbal cues .
Yet it is also possible that exposure to negative facial expressions decreases perceivers ' self-esteem , regardless of eye-gaze cues .
This patternmight be observed for several reasons .
For example , compared to eye-gaze direction , facial expressions may be more salient , may be interpreted as more reliable indices of others ' re- sponses to oneself , or may generate subjective emotion in perceivers ( via emotion contagion ; e.g. , Dimberg et al. , 2000 ; Neumann & Strack , 2000 ; Wild , Erb , & Bartels , 2001 ) that bleeds over into self-esteem .
We examined this alternative hypothesis but based on evidence reviewed in preceding sections , we expected the influence of facial expressions to be moderated by eye-gaze .
Study 1 Participants saw 24 faces in an ostensible face-memory study .
There were three facial emotion conditions ( neutral , angry , happy ) such that all faces within a given between-subject condition exhibited the same emotion .
Thus , each participant viewed 24 different faces that exhibited the same emotion ( e.g. , anger ) .
Orthogonal to this independent variable , there were three eye-gaze conditions corresponding to the ratio of di- rect to averted-gaze faces ( mostly-direct , equal , or mostly-averted ) .
Each participant was thus randomly assigned to view a series of faces within a 3 ( facial emotion ) × 3 ( eye-gaze ) independent-groups design .
We predicted that that exposure to facial anger ( vs. joy or neutrality ) would reduce participants ' self-esteem but only when faces displayed direct-gaze .
Method Participants and setting Participants were recruited and paid viaMechanical Turk ( for guide- lines , see Buhrmester , Kwang , & Gosling , 2011 ) and the experimentwas conducted online .
The samplewas limited to people living in the United States under age 41 ( to parallel facial ages presented in this study ) .
Participants were excluded if they completed the experiment twice ( n = 9 ) , failed to finish ( n = 6 ) , or used the answer-choice “ 1 ” to Table 1 Study 1 : Exclusions by condition .

The distribution of exclusions by condition is listed in Table 1 .
The final sample included 241 participants ( 145women ) , including 172White non-Hispanic , 20 Asian , 17 Black , 14 mixed-race , and 13 Hispanic participants ranging in age from 18 to 40 with quartiles at 21 , 25 , and 30 years of age .
Refer to the Appendix A for an explanation of sample size determination.Materials Study images .
Twenty-four models ( 12 male ) were selected from the NimStim collection of empirically standardized facial images ( Tottenham et al. , 2009 ) .
We selected 19 White , 4 Asian , and 1 Latina models with unambiguous neutral , angry , and happy expressions .
For each image , we generated an averted-gaze version and a direct-gaze version via photo-editing software ( Fig .
1 ) .
Using these images , we generated nine face-sets .
Each face-set included 24 faces ( one of each model ) and all faces within the set exhibited the same emotion .
Yet because our hypotheses regarded the interactive influence of facial-emotion and eye-gaze , we generated three face-sets per emotion .
In mostly-direct conditions , the ratio of direct-gaze faces to averted-gaze faces was 2:1 ( 16 direct-gaze faces and 8 averted-gaze faces ) .
In mostly-averted conditions , the ratio of direct-gaze faces to averted-gaze faceswas 1:2 .
And in equal conditions , the ratio of direct-gaze faces to averted-gaze faceswas 1:1 .
For example , we created three sets of angry faces .
One set included 24 angry faces with most exhibiting direct-gaze , a second set included 24 angry faces with most exhibiting averted-gaze , and a third set included 24 faces with exactly half exhibiting direct-gaze .
In total , we generated nine sets of images ( 3 emotion : neutral , angry , happy × 3 gaze-ratio : mostly-direct , equal , mostly-averted ) .
Each set contained 24 images and each participant viewed only one of these nine sets.Self-esteem measures .
Self-esteem was measured with two scales .
The Heatherton and Polivy ( 1991 ) state self-esteem scale ( HPSE ; here : α = .90 ) includes 20 items that participants respond to by indicating how they felt in that moment ( from 1 , Not at all , to 5 , Extremely ; M = 3.68 , SD = .61 ) .
The Rosenberg ( 1965 ) self-esteem scale ( RSE ; here : α = .91 ) includes 10 statements to which participants indicate their agreement ( from 0 , Strongly Disagree , to 3 , Strongly Agree ; M = 1.94 , SD = .59 ) .
The RSE boasts high test–retest reliability ( Bosson , Swann , & Pennebaker , 2000 ) but is also sensitive to state fluctuations ( e.g. , Leonardelli , Lakin , & Arkin , 2007 ; Morse & Gergen , 1970 ; Wilcox & Laird , 2000 ) .
We used the RSE here for purposes of convergent validity.1 Thismemory testwas part of a separate study—neithermemory accuracy ( d′ ) nor bias ( Criterion C ) were associated with either self-esteem measure ( rs b |.07| , ps N .35 ) and controlling for these variables in analyses did not alter the pattern of results reported be- low .
Consequently , this memory test is not discussed further.Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) .Wemeasured subjectively- experienced emotion with items from the PANAS ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .
Participants used a 1 ( Very slightly or Not at All ) to 5 ( Extremely ) scale to rate their current happiness , anxiety , irritation , hos- tility , pride , sadness , and enthusiasm as well as the extent to which they felt “ good ” and “ bad. ” After reverse-scoring , composite scores were created for emotion ( α = .67 ; M = 3.53 , SD = .57 ) and mood ( α = .67 ; M = 3.79 , SD = .90 ) .Procedure After informed consent , participants read instructions for a “ memory study ” and were then shown ( in random order ) each of 24 faces for 3 s. The particular faces viewed by a participant depended on random assignment in a 3 ( anger , happy , neutral ) × 3 ( mostly-direct , equal , mostly-averted ) independent-groups design .
After viewing facial images , participants completed the PANAS and the HPSE scale .
These scales were described as “ distractors ” prior to a memory test.1 Refer to the Appendix A for information on additional measures .
Participants then completed the RSE scale and demographic questions before being thanked , debriefed , and paid .
Results and discussion A 3 ( neutral , angry , happy ) × 3 ( mostly-direct , equal , mostly- averted ) independent-groups ANOVA revealed the predicted emotion- by-gaze interaction on HPSE scores , F ( 4 , 232 ) = 2.43 , p = .049 ( see Fig .
2 ) .
We conducted simple-effects tests based on our a priori hypoth- eses .
On the HPSE scale ( 1991 ) , participants exhibited lower state self- esteem after exposure to direct-gaze anger than after exposure to direct-gaze joy t ( 51 ) = 2.66 , p= .01 , rpb = .35 , or direct-gaze neutral- ity , t ( 53 ) = 2.58 , p=.01 , rpb=.33 ( all simple-effects tests in this article are two-tailed ) .
Exposure to direct-gaze joy—as compared to exposure to direct-gaze neutrality—did not significantly influence HPSE scores , p = .76 .
There were no significant influences of facial emotion on self- esteem within the averted-gaze condition ( ps N .35 ) or the equal-gaze condition ( ps N .88 ) .
We conducted identical analyses on the RSE .
A 3 × 3 independent- groups ANOVA revealed a main effect of emotion [ F ( 2 , 232 ) = 3.05 , p = .049 ] , indicating the exposure to angry faces reduced self-esteem relative to exposure to neutral faces , t ( 166 ) = 2.36 , p = .02 , rpb = .18 .
Crucially , however , this effect was qualified by an emotion by gaze in- teraction , F ( 4 , 232 ) = 2.97 , p= .02 .
Aswith theHPSE scale , participants exhibited lower self-esteem after exposure to direct-gaze anger than after exposure to direct-gaze joy , t ( 51 ) = 2.43 , p = .02 , rpb = .32 , or direct-gaze neutrality , t ( 53 ) = 3.47 , p = .001 , rpb = .43 .
Exposure to direct-gaze joy—as compared to exposure to direct-gaze neutrality— did not significantly influence RSE scores , p= .34 .
There were no signif- icant influences of facial emotion on self-esteem within the averted- gaze condition ( ps N .11 ) or the equal-gaze condition ( ps N .58 ) .
Thus , the interactive influence of facial expression and eye gaze was quite similar for the HPSE and the RSE .
The RSE is intended as a measure of trait self-esteem but often captures state fluctuations around this trait level and is responsive to contextual manipulations ( Leonardelli et al. , 2007 ; Morse & Gergen , 1970 ; Wilcox & Laird , 2000 ) .We suspect that the influence of nonverbal cues in this study was specific to state fluctuations and indeed , the RSE scale and the HPSE scale were highly correlated , r ( 241 ) = .66 , p b .001 .
Additionally , we conducted a 3 ( emotion ) × 3 ( gaze ) ANCOVA on RSE scores controlling for HPSE scores .
The critical emotion by gaze interac- tion was no longer significant , F ( 4 , 231 ) = .98 , p = .41 .

The more conservative interpretation of this analysis is that nonverbal cues influ- enced variance shared by state and trait self-esteem measures.Fig .

The top panel depicts HPSE scores and the bottom panel depicts RSE scores .
Please see text for inferential statistics.Therefore , in Study 2 we examined whether a state-worded version of the RSE would obtain the same results .
Exploratory analyses Our hypotheses focused on the influence of facial emotion and there- foremotivated the comparisons reported above .
However , we conducted within-emotion comparisons on an exploratory basis .
Among partici- pants exposed to angry faces , HPSE was significantly lower in the mostly-direct-gaze condition than in the mostly-averted-gaze condition , t ( 55 ) = 1.99 , p = .05 , rpb = .26 , or ( marginally ) than in the equal-gaze condition , t ( 54 ) = 1.76 , p=.08 , rpb= .23 .
No otherwithin-emotion com- parisons on HPSE were significant , ps N .15 .
We also conducted exploratory within-emotion comparisons for the RSE .
For participants exposed to angry faces , self-esteem was marginally lower in the mostly-direct-gaze condition than in the mostly-averted- gaze condition , t ( 55 ) = 1.80 , p= .08 rpb = .24 .
For participants exposed to happy faces , self-esteemwashigher in themostly-direct gaze condition than in themostly-averted gaze condition , t ( 47 ) = 2.12 , p=.04 rpb= .30 .
For participants exposed to neutral faces , self-esteem was higher in the mostly-direct gaze condition than in the equal condition , t ( 52 ) = 2.37 , p = .02 , rpb = .31 , or ( marginally ) the mostly-averted gaze condition , t ( 54 ) = 1.62 , p = .11 , rpb = .21 .
This latter effect conceptually replicates Wirth et al .
( 2010 ) .
No other within-emotion comparisons on the RSE were significant , ps N .17 .
Influence of nonverbal cues : Affect , mood , or self-esteem ?
The influence of nonverbal cues on self-esteem conformed to predic- tions .
Yet these effectsmight simply be explained by subjective emotion and/or mood .
Indeed , HPSE and RSE scores were correlated with posi- tive emotion , rs ( 241 ) N .35 , ps b .001 , and mood , rs ( 241 ) N .32 , p b .001 .
However , the critical two-way interactions remained signifi- cant whether controlling for affect ( HPSE p = .02 ; RSE p = .01 ) , mood ( HPSE p = .03 ; RSE p = .03 ) , or both ( HPSE p = .03 ; RSE p = .03 ) in an ANCOVA .
Finally , we conducted ANOVAs with emotion and mood as dependent variables .
These analyses revealed no interactive effects of facial-emotion and eye-gaze , ps N .8 .
Thus , subjective emotional Table 2 Study 2 : Exclusions by condition .

Study 2 Study 1 provided initial evidence that state self-esteem is shaped by a complex environment of nonverbal cues .
An accumulated pattern of exposure to angry facial expressions reduced perceivers ' state self- esteembut onlywhenmost faceswere exhibiting direct-gaze .
Although exposure to several faces was sufficient to influence state self-esteem , participants were not simply exposed to 24 faces—performance of the memory task ostensibly required participants to pay close attention to those faces .
Thus , elaborated processing of others ' facial emotion may be necessary for such faces to influence self-esteem .
In Study 2 , we sought to examinewhether attentionwas indeed nec- essary for the observed effects or if simple exposure to nonverbal cues was sufficient to influence self-esteem .
We set up Study 2 such that prolonged attention to faceswould reduce task performance .
Specifical- ly , participants completed a lexical decision task ( LDT ; Neely , 1977 ) in which a neutral word ( or non-word ) was preceded by an image of either a house or a face .
Reaction-times were used to index the extent to which participants attended to faces versus houses , such that increased reaction-times following faces indexed increased attention to ( or cognitive elaboration of ) faces .
After the LDT , participants com- pleted self-esteem measures .
If focused attention is necessary for facial expressions to influence self-esteem , the results of this study should replicate Study 1 but only to the extent participants attended to faces during the LDT .
Conversely , if focused attention is unnecessary for facial expressions to influence self-esteem , the results of this study should replicate those of Study 1 irrespective of the extent to which partici- pants attended to faces during the LDT .
Method Participants and setting Participants were recruited from undergraduate psychology classes and received extra credit for their participation .
The experiment was conducted on computers using Direct RT© software .
Five participants ' data could not be recovered , three participants completed self-esteem scales prior to the LDT ( experimenter error ) , and one participant was a minor.2 The distribution of exclusions by condition is listed in Table 2 .
After excluding these participants , the final sample was 182 participants ( 136women ) , including 119White , 28 Asian , 23 Latina ( o ) , 7 mixed-race , 4 Black , and 1 Native American .
Ages ranged from 18 to 33 , with quartiles at 18 , 19 , and 20 .
Materials Study images .
Facial imageswere identical to those in Study1 .
Each of six face-sets included all 24 models expressing one emotion-gaze pairing .
We thus employed a 3 ( neutral , angry , happy ) × 2 ( direct , averted ) independent-groups design .
Unlike Study 1 , every face encountered by a participant in Study 2 exhibited the same gaze-direction ( either direct or averted ) .
House images were selected fromGoogle image searches of “ normal house ” ; these 10 images were selected for their affectively neutral appearance , dissimilarity from facial features ( e.g. , two windows centered above a door ) , and location within the USA .
Attention to faces .
Tomeasure attention to faces we used amodified LDT with 72 randomly-ordered trials .
In each trial , participants first saw an image and then a string of letters .
Participants were instructed to ignore the image but to indicate as quickly as possiblewhether or not the string2 Internal Review Board ( IRB ) approval did not include reporting of data for minors.of letters was a word ( words were affectively-neutral according to established norms ; e.g. , content , elbow , glass ; Bradley & Lang , 1999 ) .
Of the 72 trials , 48 were face-trials corresponding to experimental condition .
For example , participants in the direct-gaze anger condition always saw direct-gaze anger on face-trials.3 The remaining 24 trials included images of houses rather than faces and these 24 trials provided a baseline fromwhich tomeasure face-specific attention .
Image presen- tation time was systematically-varied ( 500 , 1000 , or 2000 ms ) to increase task difficulty .
Prior to calculating face-attention scores , we excluded incorrect re- sponses and response times that were 2.5 standard deviations above a given participant 's face or house mean .
Face-attention scores were calculated by subtracting response times to house-trials from response times to face-trials and standardizing the difference .
Self-esteem measures .
We again used the HPSE ( M = 3.78 , SD = .53 , here , α = .88 ) .
However , to reduce ambiguity in the ( state vs. trait ) meaning of the RSE , we followed prior research ( e.g. , Seery , Blascovich , Weisbuch , & Vick , 2004 ) by modifying the wording so that participants indicated how they thought of themselves at the present moment ( not just in general ) ( M = 2.13 , SD = .46 , here , α = .87 ) .
These two measures were highly correlated , r ( 169 ) = .80 , p b .001 , but analyzed separately to examine convergent validity .
Procedure Participants were randomly assigned to one of the six conditions de- scribed above .
After informed consent , participants read instructions for an “ attention task ” ( the LDT ) .
After completing the LDT , participants were told they had completed their first study and would now partici- pate in a second ( questionnaire ) study .
Participants then completed the self-esteem measures and demographics questions before being thanked , debriefed , and paid .
Results and discussion Wehypothesized that participants ' self-esteemwould be lower after exposure to angry faces than after exposure to happy faces ( or neutral faces ) but only when faces exhibited direct-gaze .
To the extent that at- tention moderates the influence of nonverbal cues on self-esteem , these effects should only obtain to the degree that participants had high face-attention scores .
We regressed self-esteem scores onto a dummy-coded gaze variable ( 1 = Averted ) , two dummy-coded variables for the three-level facial emotion factor ( reference group = Anger ) , centered Face-Attention Scores , and all interactions among these variables.4 Following standard ( n = 2 ) were excluded from analyses .
Inclusion of these participants does not alter the pattern of results but several of these participants were also multivariate outliers .

We thus examined simple effects separately for attenders and non- attenders.HPSE For the Heatherton and Polivy ( 1991 ) scale , the Step 1model was not significant , R2 = .05 , F ( 4 , 164 ) = 2.09 , p= .09 .
The addition of the two- way interactions at Step 2 did not account for a significant proportion of variance , ΔR2 = .05 , ΔF ( 5 , 159 ) = 1.93 , p = .09.5 More importantly , the addition of the three-way interactions at Step 3 accounted for sub- stantial variance , ΔR2 = .03 , ΔF ( 2 , 157 ) = 3.12 , p = .047 .
The Anger- vs.-Neutral × Gaze × Attention interaction was significant , β = − .36 , t ( 157 ) =−2.24 , p=.03 , and theAnger-vs.-Joy×Gaze× Attention inter- action was marginally-significant , β = − .22 , t ( 157 ) = −1.87 , p = .06 ( see Fig .
3 ) .
Among attenders exposed to direct-gaze faces , self-esteem was marginally lower after exposure to facial-anger than after exposure to facial-neutrality , β = .33 , t ( 157 ) = 1.98 , p = .049 , and significantly lower after exposure to facial-anger than after exposure to facial-joy , β= .34 , t ( 157 ) = 2.10 , p= .037 .
The comparison of direct-gaze neutral- ity to direct-gaze joywasnot significant , β=.01 , t ( 157 ) = .07 , p=.95 .
As in Study 1 , this pattern of effects only emerged in response to faces exhibiting direct-gaze .
Among attenders exposed to averted-gaze faces , self-esteem was not different after exposure to facial-anger versus facial-joy , β = − .31 , t ( 157 ) = −1.51 , p = .13 , or versus neutrality , β=− .06 , t ( 157 ) =− .36 , p= .72 .
The comparison of averted-gaze neu- trality to averted-gaze joy was not significant , β = .26 , t ( 157 ) = 1.24 , p= .21 .
Among non-attenders ' there were no significant simple effects.RSE For the Rosenberg ( 1965 ) scale , the model was not significant at Step 1 , R2 = .04 , F ( 4 , 164 ) = 1.70 , p = .15 .
The addition of the two- way interactions at Step 2 , however , accounted for significant variance , ΔR2 = .07 , ΔF ( 5 , 159 ) = 2.73 , p = .02 .
The interaction of gaze and joy was significant , β= .38 , t ( 159 ) = 2.72 , p= .007 , but we hesitate to in- terpret this effect because it was qualified by three-way interactions .
Specifically , the addition of the three-way interactions at Step 3 accounted for a significant proportion of variance , ΔR2 = .06 , ΔF ( 2 , 157 ) = 5.60 , p = .004 .
Both of the three-way interactions were signif- icant ( Joy-vs.-Anger × Gaze × Attention , β = .44 , t ( 157 ) = 2.70 , p = .008 ; Neutral-vs.-Anger × Gaze × Attention , β = .33 , t ( 157 ) = 2.86 , p = .005 ; see Fig .
3 ) .
Among attenders exposed to direct-gaze faces , self-esteem was lower after exposure to facial-anger than after exposure to facial- neutrality , β = .37 , t ( 157 ) = 2.28 , p = .02 , or facial-joy , β = .467 t ( 157 ) = 2.95 , p= .004 .
The comparison of direct-gaze neutrality to direct-gaze joy was not significant , β= .10 , t ( 157 ) = .56 p= .57 .
As for HPSE , this pattern only emerged in response to faces exhibiting direct-gaze .
In fact , among attenders exposed to averted-gaze faces , self-esteem was higher after exposure to facial-anger than after expo- sure to facial-joy , β=.50 , t ( 157 ) =−2.50 , p= .01 ( see General Discus- sion ) .
The comparison of averted-gaze anger to averted-gaze neutrality was not significant , β = − .20 , t ( 157 ) = −1.18 , p = .24 , nor was the5 The marginally significant p value owes to an effect of attention by gaze , β = .27 , t ( 159 ) = 2.36 , p = .02 .
Among those exposed to averted-gaze faces , self-esteem did not significantly vary as attention increased β=− .09 , t ( 159 ) =− .63 , p= .53 .
Among those exposed to direct-gaze faces , however , self-esteem significantly increased as attention in- creased , β= .28 , t ( 159 ) = 2.06 , p= .04 .
This interaction is qualified by the three-way in- teraction below.comparison of averted-gaze neutrality to averted-gaze joy , β = .33 , t ( 157 ) = 1.58 , p = .12 .
Non-attenders ' self-esteem did not conform to the pattern observed for attenders .
There was one unexpected significant simple effect : self- esteem was higher among non-attenders exposed to averted-gaze neutrality than averted-gaze joy , β = .37 , t ( 157 ) = 2.14 , p = .03 .
Although several explanations are possible , we are reluctant to specu- late about this unexpected effect .
Exploratory analyses Weagain conductedwithin-emotion comparisons on an exploratory basis .
Among attenders exposed to happy faces , self-esteemwas higher after exposure to direct-gaze faces than after exposure to averted-gaze faces , whether measured with the HPSE β = .47 , t ( 157 ) = 2.10 , p = .04 , or with the RSE , β = .54 , t ( 157 ) = 2.47 , p = .01 .
No significant ef- fects emerged for angry faces on the HPSE but ( p= .18 ) for the RSE , at- tenders exposed to angry faces exhibited lower self-esteem after exposure to direct-gaze faces than after exposure to averted-gaze faces , β = .51 , t ( 157 ) = 3.00 , p = .003 .
No significant effects emerged on either scale for neutral faces ( p N .30 ) .
Study 2 extended the findings of Study 1 by providing evidence in support of the idea that the joint influence of facial emotion and eye- gaze on self-esteem depends upon perceivers ' attention .
In replication of Study 1 , participants exhibited lower state self-esteem after exposure to facial anger than after than after exposure to facial joy or facial neu- trality but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze .
This pattern only emerged to the extent that participants attended to faces , suggest- ing that attention is necessary for facial cues to reliably influence perceivers ' self-esteem .
Meta-analysis We conducted a mini meta-analysis of the two studies to examine the size and reliability of the observed simple effects .
Following stan- dard guidelines ( Rosenthal , 1991 ) , we transformed t statistics to r and Fisher 's Zr.Mean effect sizes ( Zr ) were transformed back to unweighted rs for reporting .
Significance level was computed by summing the stan- dard normal deviates of p and dividing by the square root of k.6 Follow- ing standard guidelines ( Rosenthal , 1995 ) , we also calculated standard error to estimate confidence intervals for each effect size r. Consistent with our hypotheses , we focused on within-gaze comparisons .
The observed effects were specific to people attending to faces and we therefore limited thismeta-analysis to those individuals ( Study 1 partic- ipants and Study 2 attenders ) .
HPSE We first examined the hypothesized influence of direct-gaze anger on perceivers ' HPSE scores .
The effect of direct-gaze anger relative to direct-gaze joy , r = .31 [ .23 , .39 ] , Z = 3.26 , p = .001 , and the effect of direct-gaze anger relative to direct-gaze neutrality , r = .29 [ .22 , .37 ] , Z= 3.13 , p= .001 , were indeedmedium in size and reliable .
Consistent with individual-study analyses , the effect of direct-gaze joy ( relative to direct-gaze neutrality ) was negligible and unreliable , r = .02 [ 0 , .07 ] , Z = .17 , p = .86 .
We next turned our attention to if and how HPSE scores were influ- enced by averted-gaze faces .
One effect emerged thatwas not present in either study analyzed individually : exposure to averted-gaze anger ( rel- ative to averted-gaze joy ) caused a small and marginally-significant in- crease in self-esteem , r = .17 [ .09 , .25 ] , Z = 1.73 , p = .09 .
Other influences of averted gaze faces on HPSE were small and not reliable .
Hence , the effect of averted-gaze anger relative to averted-gaze neutral- ity was small and unreliable , r = .08 [ .02 , .15 ] , Z = .87 , p = .38 , as was6 We did not observe heterogeneity in the significance levels ( HPSE : .44 b p b .86 ; RSE : .45 b p b .98 ) or effect sizes ( HPSE : .44 b r b .78 ; RSE : ( .28 b r b .98 ) from Studies 1 and 2 .

RSE We first examined the hypothesized influence of direct-gaze anger on perceivers ' RSE scores .
The effect of direct-gaze anger relative to direct-gaze joy , r = .34 [ .30 , .39 ] , Z = 3.70 , p b .001 , and the effect of direct-gaze anger relative to direct-gaze neutrality , r = .36 [ .22 , .50 ] , Z = 3.90 , p b .001 , were medium-to-large in size and reliable .
Consis- tent with individual studies , the effect of direct-gaze joy ( relative to direct-gaze neutrality ) was negligible and unreliable , r = .03 [ −.18 , .24 ] , Z = 1.08 , p = .28 .
We next turned our attention to if and how RSE scores were influ- enced by averted-gaze faces .
In our meta-analysis of HPSE scores , the effect of averted-gaze anger relative to averted-gaze joy was small but marginally significant ( see above ) .
For RSE scores , this effect was medi- um and reliable , r = .27 [ .14 , .40 ] , Z = 2.75 , p = .006 ( see General Discussion ) .
Additionally , the effect of averted-gaze joy relative to averted-gaze neutrality was small but reliable , r = .21 [ .20 , .22 ] , Z = 2.22 , p = .03 ( see General Discussion for interpretation ) .
Finally , and as for the HPSE , the effect of averted-gaze anger ( relative to averted- gaze neutrality ) was negligible and unreliable , r = .07 [ −.11 , .24 ] , Z = .94 , p = .35 .
General discussion Few people are ( un ) fortunate enough to be told , from moment-to- moment , how others feel about them .
Yet the social environment is sat- urated with nonverbal cues that can potentially provide such feedback ( cf .
Ambady & Weisbuch , 2010 ) and it appears that self-esteem is responsive to these cues .
Specifically , participants ' self-esteem wasreduced after exposure to angry facial-expressions but only when those expressions were paired with direct-gaze .
Moreover , it appears that this effect depends on perceivers ' attention , as exposure to direct- gaze anger only reduced self-esteem to the extent participants attended to faces .
These findings illustrate sophistication in the response of self- esteem to nonverbal cues .
This response requires perceivers to integrate the self-relevantmeaning of spatially-distributed nonverbal cues and to update memory about nonverbal cues distributed over time and target persons .
Although attention to faces does appear to be necessary for facial cues to reliably influence self-esteem , faces in the studies reported here could not be attended to for more than a few seconds and partici- pants were never instructed to imagine anything meaningful about the faces .
They were simply asked to remember the faces ( Study 1 ) or ig- nore them ( Study 2 ) .
Consequently , attention may be both necessary and sufficient for spatially- and temporally-distributed patterns of non- verbal cues to influence perceivers ' self-esteem .
One component of our predictions was that direct-gaze emotion ex- pressions may be more diagnostic than are averted-gaze emotion ex- pressions .
This same explanation might be applied to another pattern of findings : the influence of direct-gaze facial expressions on self- esteem was driven more by negative than positive facial expressions .
Compared to exposure to direct-gaze neutrality , exposure to direct- gaze anger reduced self-esteem but exposure to direct-gaze joy did not increase self-esteem .
Among Americans , positive facial expressions paired with direct-gaze are normative and expected ( Cole , 1986 ; Hayes & Metts , 2008 ; Matsumoto , 1993 ) .
Direct-gaze joymay seemnor- mative or unspectacular and thus non-diagnostic .
Although negative facial expressions may not be unheard of responses to eye-contact , they are perhaps less normative and thus more diagnostic of others ' evaluations of the self .
137S.A .
Lamer et al .
/ Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 56 ( 2015 ) 130–138Other trends in the data await further examination .
The meta- analytic results indicate that participants ' self-esteem was lower after exposure to averted-gaze joy than after exposure to averted-gaze anger .
According to the meta-analysis , this pattern was significant for the RSE and marginal for the HPSE .
Additionally , participants ' RSE ( but not HPSE ) scores were also lower after exposure to averted-gaze joy than after exposure to averted-gaze neutral cues .
The influence of averted-gaze joy on perceivers ' self-esteemwas somewhat inconsistent across measures , so we are reluctant to interpret this effect .
Nonethe- less , several explanations are possible .
For example , to the extent averted-gaze joy reliably reduces self-esteem , it may be because averted-gaze facial emotion is interpreted as an evaluation of another person thereby influencing participants ' comparison standards .
Social comparison processes might thus reduce perceivers ' self-esteem in re- sponse to averted-gaze joy .
Alternatively , averted-gaze can signal social disengagement ( e.g. , Kleinke , 1986 ) so averted-gaze joymay signal that gazers are pleased that interaction with the perceiver has been discontinued .
Regardless of whether exposure to averted-gaze anger or neutrality enhances perceivers ' self-esteem or does not change it , the influence of facial emotion on perceivers ' self-esteem is clearly moderated by emot- er eye-gaze .
Direct-gaze anger expressions clearly and reliably reduced the self-esteem of people attended to those expressions .
Averted-gaze anger expressions did not .
In conclusion , we have presented the first evidence ( to our knowledge ) that self-esteem tracks complex patterns of nonverbal cues across multiple target persons .
Combined with the high-frequency of nonverbal cues in daily life , the current results are suggestive of the possibility that the nonverbal environment shapes self-esteem on a moment-to-moment basis .
Appendix A. Elaboration of methods Sample size To determine sample size in Study 1 , we recorded the sample sizes and effect sizes of past studies that were methodologically and concep- tually similar ( Leary et al. , 1998 ; Strahan , Spencer , & Zanna , 2002 ; Weisbuch et al. , 2009 ; Winkielman et al. , 2005 ; Wirth et al. , 2010 ) .
Spe- cifically , we identified studies from the last decade in which ( a ) participants were exposed to prolonged nonverbal behavior or repeated instances of nonverbal behavior , ( b ) a between-subject design was used , and ( c ) the outcome measure was something other than emotion .
We identified three such studies ( Strahan et al. , 2002 ; Weisbuch et al. , 2009 ; Winkielman et al. , 2005 ) .
We additionally reviewed the sample sizes in work examining sociometer hypotheses ( Leary et al. , 1998 ; Wirth et al. , 2010 ) .
First , we examined the set of three studies with similar methodolo- gy .
Strahan et al .
( 2002 ) examined persuasiveness in response to sub- liminally presented sad and neutral faces .
The effect size ( d ) was .57 and the average sample size per condition was 23 .
Weisbuch et al .
( 2009 ) examined race bias in response to directed emotion .
In two stud- ies , the average effect size ( d ) was .65 and the average sample size per conditionwas 25.Winkielman et al .
( 2005 ) examined thirst in response to masked happy and angry faces .
In two studies , the average effect size ( d ) was .96 and the average sample size per condition was 17 .
Next , we examined studies regarding the sociometer hypothesis .
Leary et al .
( 1998 ) examined feelings of acceptance in response to ex- plicit feedback .
In three studies , the average effect size ( d ) was 2.38 and the average sample size per condition was 11 .
Wirth et al .
( 2010 ) examined implicit self-esteem and feelings of exclusion in response to averted gaze .
In three studies , the average effect size ( d ) was .68 and the average sample size per condition was 32 .
The median effect size among these five sets of studies was .68 , a medium to large effect size .
Recommended sample size to achieve .8 power with an effect size of .7 is 33 ( Cohen , 1988 ) .
The median sample size per condition among these five sets of studies was 23 .
Based on these two sources ofinformation , we sought 30 participants per condition .
However , after exclusions and eliminating data from several participants whowere in- advertently paid but did not want to participate after reading informed consent , the final sample size was 27 per condition .
Post-hoc power analyses indicate that observed power with this sample size was .71 for HPSE and .81 for RSE .
Data were not analyzed until collection was complete .
In Study 2 , we eliminated one-third of the experimental conditions ( “ equal ” conditions ) .
To estimate power for Study 2 , we calculated f2 from those six conditions in Study 1 .
The effect size estimates for HPSE and RSE yielded an average f-squared of .055 .
With this effect-size esti- mate , we used an a priori power calculator for hierarchical multiple regression in order to calculate a sample size that achieved 80 % power .
This led to a sample size estimate of 185 , which we sought to obtain in Study 2 .
After exclusions , we had a final sample size of 182 .
Due to limitations in funding and the University of Denver subject- pool , we elected to initially analyze the data after two academic quarters of data collection .
Results were marginal but not counter-hypothetical so we identified new funding and completed data collection .
The proce- dure of analyzing data once prior to final analysis results in an increase in Type I error .
Using the O'Brien-Fleming function appropriate for con- firmatory analysis , we arrive at an effective alpha-level significant threshold of p = .043 ( Lakens , 2014 ; O'Brien & Fleming , 1979 ) .
Conse- quently , there are several results in Study 2 that have a p-value of less than .05 but greater than .043 that we describe as marginal rather than significant .
Finally , we wish to note that observed power in Study 2 was .79 for HPSE and .94 for RSE.Additional variables Study 1 was part of a broader investigation regarding personality and memory .
Thus Study 1 also included the following measures : the Ten-Item Personality Inventory ( Gosling , Rentfrow , & Swann , 2003 ) , the Narcissistic Personality Inventory ( Raskin & Terry , 1988 ) , the Self- Consciousness Scale-Revised ( Scheier & Carver , 1985 ) , and the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale ( Watson & Friend , 1969 ) .
Similarly Study 2 included the followingmeasures : the Behavior Inhibition andActivation Scales ( Carver & White , 1994 ) , the International Personality Item Pool Assertiveness and Dominance Scales ( Goldberg , 1999 ) , the Trait Trans- portability Scale ( Dal Cin , Zanna , & Fong , 2004 ) , and a single question that simply asked participants what their self-esteem was ( Robins , Hendin , & Trzesniewski , 2001 ) .
Although we did not have predictions for this last single-item because of its theoretical ambiguity and trait- wording , it could be regarded as relevant to our hypotheses and so we examined it as an outcome variable .
The three-way interaction terms most relevant in Study 2 were not significant for this item , ps N .23.References Adams , J. , Franklin , R.B. , Nelson , A.J. , & Stevenson , M.T .
