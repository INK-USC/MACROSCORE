Introduction Human cooperation is an undeniably appealing phenomenon that has attracted substantial attention from scientists ( Hammerstein , 2003 ) .
One line of research on cooperative behavior has obtained important insights by using strategic games ( e.g .
Mulford , Orbell , Shatto , & Stockard , 1998 ; Kosfeld , Heinrichs , Zak , Fischbacher , & Fehr , 2005 ; Millet & Dewitte , 2006 ; Takahashi , Yamahishi , Tanida , Kiyonari , & Kanazawa , 2006 ; Van den Bergh & Dewitte , 2006 ; Burnham , 2007 ; Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ; Zak et al. , 2009 ; Zethraeus et al. , 2009 ; Eisenegger , Naef , Snozzi , Heinrichs , & Fehr , 2010 ; Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 , 2013 , Lovejoy , Catellier , Evans , Lohiser , & Chiu , 2013 ) .
In strategic games , participants face simplified social situations in the laboratory and receive rewards depending on their decisions as well as those of other participants .
Because these studies use controlled environments , the behavior displayed by subjects is easily measurable and replicable .
In the present study , we define cooperation as an individual behavior aimed to maximize collective interest rather than pure self-interest .
One way of evaluating cooperation with strategic games is through the Prisoners ' Dilemma ( PDG henceforth ) .
The PDG is a strategic game in which collective welfare and self-interest are in stark conflict .
Standard Game Theory postulates that individuals act following their self-interest only and should hence not cooperate in the PDG , even though such behavior eventually leads to a loss in collective welfare .
Early experimental studies demonstrated that such prediction is only partially fulfilled .
Even in one-shot situations , and when playing against complete strangers , humans tend to cooperate in the PDG in sizeable rates ( see Marwell & Ames , 1981 and Dawes & Thaler , 1988 , among many ) .
Undoubtedly , it is of a great interest to explore which individual factors , if any , cause some individuals to be more prone to cooperate than others .
Several recent papers describe the effect of physiology-related variables on human behavior in economic experiments ( Kosfeld et al. , 2005 ; Millet & Dewitte , 2006 ; Van den Bergh & Dewitte , 2006 ; Burnham , 2007 ; Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ; Apicella et al. , 2008 ; Zak et al. , 2009 ; Zethraeus et al. , 2009 ; Eisenegger et al. , 2010 ) .
However , few studies have focused on the relationship between individual features and cooperative behavior in two-person interactions like the PDG ( Mulford et al. , 1998 ; Takahashi et al. , 2006 ; Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ; Lovejoy et al. , 2013 ) .
Even smaller is the number of these studies focusing exclusively on women .
This gap in the literature is rather unsatisfactory given the important physiological differences , especially the endocrine , that exist between sexes ( for exceptions see Buser , 2012 ; Pearson & Schipper , 2013 ) .

Muñoz-Reyes et al .
/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 118–125In the present paper , we investigate the relationship between cooperation among women in the PDG and a number of physiology- related variables with well-established effects on human behavior .
These variables are facial fluctuating asymmetry , facial femininity , waist–hip ratio and body mass index .
Fluctuating asymmetry ( FA ) is a variable with a physiological basis and linked to individual 's fitness .
It can be defined as a departure from symmetry in traits that are symmetrical at the population level ( Van Dongen & Gangestad , 2011 ) .
FA is considered to be the result of developmental instability , reflecting the ability of an organism to maintain a stable development of its morphology and to overcome possible external perturbations ( Møller & Swaddle , 1997 ; Thornhill & Gangestad , 2006 ; Van Dongen & Gangestad , 2011 ) .
Consequently , it has been described as linked to individual fitness in many species ( Møller , 1997 ; Møller & Thornhill , 1998 ) .
In humans , there exists a positive average effect of FA on a variety of outcomes , from hormone levels to health problems .
These effects are robust , especially those related to reproduction ( Van Dongen & Gangestad , 2011 ) .
FA has also been related to human behavior ( Furlow , Gangestad , & Armijo- Prewitt , 1998 ; Manning & Wood , 1998 ; Pound , Penton-Voak , & Brown , 2007 ; Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ; Holtzman , Augustine , & Senne , 2011 ; Muñoz-Reyes , Gil-Burmann , Fink , & Turiegano , 2012 ) .
In particular , FA has been studied in relation to cooperative behavior in males .
Results show that low-FA males ( more symmetric ) cooperate less often in the PDG ( Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ) .
FA is also a determinant of behavior in the ultimatum game ( Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ; Zaatari , Palestis , & Trivers , 2009 ; Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2013 ) .
In both the PDG and in the ultimatum game ( UG henceforth ) , symmetrical men ( with lower FA ) tend to be less pro- social .
Personality measurements corroborate this finding ( Holtzman et al. , 2011 ) .
One possible explanation for the lack of pro-sociality of symmetrical males is their higher capability to obtain resources by themselves , which reduces their need to obtain help from others .
An additional aspect related to the link between FA and fitness is that a low FA is considered to be an attractive feature in many human populations ( reviewed in Johnston , 2006 ; Kościński , 2007 ; Little , Jones , & DeBruine , 2011 ; Thornhill & Gangestad , 1999 ; Van Dongen & Gangestad , 2011 ) .
Another morphometric feature described as an indicator of fitness is the waist–hip ratio ( WHR ) , which results from dividing the waist perimeter by the hip perimeter .
This measure is strongly influenced in women by hormone levels during puberty , which in turn determine the differential allocation of fat between sexes ( Kirschner & Samojlik , 1991 ; Björntorp , 1997 ; Lev-Ran , 2001 ) .
Since the distribution of fat is very different between males and females , WHR can be considered as a secondary sexual characteristic in women .
The standard values of WHR in Caucasian female populations range from 0.67 to 0.80 ( Marti et al. , 1991 ) .
WHR is associated with both health and fertility .
Women with ratios around 0.70 present optimal estrogen levels ( Jasieńska , Ziomkiewicz , Ellison , Lipson , & Thune , 2004 ) and are less likely to develop serious illness , such as diabetes , cardiovascular disorders and ovarian cancer ( reviewed in Singh , 2002 ) .
Regarding fertility , women with values of WHR of 0.80 or higher have significantly lower pregnancy rates than women with lower values , independently of their body mass index ( Singh , 2002 ) .
In addition , it has been pointed out that women with a low WHR present an ideal fat distribution in terms of fertility ( Swami & Tovée , 2007 ) .
The link of this feature to fertility and resistance to illness is to be expected , given that secondary sex characteristics are linked to fitness in many species ( Møller & Alatalo , 1999 ) .
WHR is related to another physiological indicator of health in humans , the body mass index ( BMI ) ( Tovée , Reinhardt , Emery , & Cornelissen , 1998 ; Tovée , Maisey , Emery , & Cornelissen , 1999 , Flegal , Kit , Orpana , & Graubard , 2013 ) , also linked to reproductive potential .
Extreme values of BMI have a negative impact on fertility ( Reid & Van Vugt , 1987 ; Kaplan , 1990 ; Brown , 1993 ; Lake , Power , & Cole , 1997 ) .Given its association with both health and fertility , many researchers have proposed BMI as a primary measure of female attractiveness ( Tovée et al. , 1999 ) , although it is commonly recorded as a nutritional marker .
The World Health Organization considers the range 18.50– 24.99 as standard for adults .
Values under 18.50 are considered underweight , between 25 and 30 as overweight , and equal to or above 30 as obese .
Both WHR and BMI are important indicators of female attractive- ness .
Although related , they display relatively independent effects .
Controlling for BMI , women with a WHR around 0.70 are classified as the most attractive by men of most cultures , including Western Caucasian societies ( Singh , Dixson , Jessop , Morgan , & Dixson , 2010 ) .
Still , the optimal value in terms of attractiveness ranges from 0.60 to 0.80 across different human populations ( Marlowe , Apicella , & Reed , 2005 ; Dixson , Dixson , Morgan , & Anderson , 2007 ) .
Individuals exhibiting a remarkable deviation in their WHR ( for example , women with high WHR and men with low WHR ) are commonly seen as less attractive by the opposite sex ( Pazhoohi & Liddle , 2012 ) .
BMI also influences individual attractiveness .
Low values within the standard range , i.e .
around 20 , are those typically regarded as more appealing ( Tovée et al. , 1998 , Tovée et al. , 1999 ) .
Another variable related with both phenotypic quality and attractiveness is the degree of facial sexual dimorphism .
Facial femininity ( FF henceforth ) in women positively correlates with disease resistance ( Thornhill & Gangestad , 2006 ) , estrogen levels and fertility ( Law Smith et al. , 2006 ) .
Some authors have proposed FF as an individual indicator of the historical energy balance and the capacity to allocate energy for reproduction ( Gangestad & Scheyd , 2005 ) .
Sexual dimorphism in facial features depends on sexual hormones levels during puberty ( Johnston , 2006 ) .
Sexual develop- ment in female faces entails certain noticeable modifications , such as thickening of the lips and thinning of the cheekbones ( Johnston , 2000 ) .
Hormone levels in puberty ( Berenbaum & Beltz , 2011 ) and , more specifically , the degree of masculinity/femininity of the face , have proven to have an effect on adult behavior ( Apicella et al. , 2008 ; Carré , McCormick , & Mondloch , 2009 ; Pound , Penton-Voak , & Surridge , 2009 ; Stirrat & Perrett , 2010 , 2012 ; Haselhuhn & Wong , 2012 ) , although most of these studies have been performed in men .
More importantly , the degree of masculinity/femininity has been described as a good predictor of attractiveness both in women and men ( reviewed in Johnston , 2006 ; Kościński , 2007 ; Little et al. , 2011 ; Thornhill & Gangestad , 1999 ) .
Attractiveness affects human behavior both in individuals ' every- day life and in the laboratory ( e.g. , Mulford et al. , 1998 ; Langlois et al. , 2000 ; Takahashi et al. , 2006 ; Wilson & Eckel , 2006 ) .
This could bring up a potential confound : the observed effects of attractiveness-related features on behavior may operate directly or indirectly , that is , by determining perceived attractiveness which subsequently affects behavior .
In order to control for this possibility , we included a score of self-perceived attractiveness ( SPA henceforth ) as an additional variable .
The effect of SPA on cooperation has already been explored .
Results show that women who find themselves attractive are less cooperative in the PDG ( Mulford et al. , 1998 ) .
In general , individuals who consider themselves attractive are also considered as such by others ( Feingold , 1992 ; Marcus & Miller , 2003 ; Weeden & Sabini , 2007 ) .
Hence , the SPA score allows us to test whether the fitness- related variables we consider influence cooperative behavior directly or through their effect on self-perceived attractiveness .
Our main hypothesis is that women who display features associated with higher fitness—low FA , high FF and low WHR— cooperate less often in the PDG .
We base this hypothesis on previous results indicating that men showing higher fitness are less prone to behave pro-socially ( Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ; Zaatari et al. , 2009 ; Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ; Holtzman et al. , 2011 ) .
The standard explanation for these results is based on the idea that cooperative behavior is a tool to receive future help from others .
Thus , 120 J.A .
Muñoz-Reyes et al .
/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 118–125high-fitness individuals , who enjoy a greater capacity to obtain resources by themselves , need to resort to cooperative behavior less often ( Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ) .
According to our hypothesis , women with a low WHR ( controlling for BMI ) and a high FF should show less cooperative behavior in the PDG .
We also expect to find a positive effect of FA on cooperation , meaning that we expect symmetric women to cooperate less often .
This result has already been found for males ( Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ) , and there is no reason to expect the influence of FA on behavior to be sex dependent .
We are also interested in whether the effects of these variables on cooperation are mediated by attractiveness .
One plausible hypothesis might be that these features solely influence cooperative behavior through attractiveness because high-fit individuals are perceived as more attractive and also feel more attractive themselves .
This can be very important since attractive people tend to receive benefits from others without the expectation of costly reciprocation .
Under this hypothesis , the attractiveness of high-fit individuals accustoms them to receive benefits which lead them to behave less pro-socially .
In the present study , we can examine this hypothesis by analyzing whether the effect of FA , WHR and FF on cooperative behavior depends on SPA .
Still , we conjecture that these variables do not exclusively operate through attractiveness .
This is because high-fit individual is more capable of obtaining resources independently of whether they receive them from others who consider her as attractive .
So , as a second hypothesis , we postulate that all these three features exert their effect on cooperation independently of SPA .
Such result would imply that the biological determinants behind the studied features ( such as developmental stability and hormone levels ) wield their influence on behavior regardless of whether the individual considers herself as attractive or not .

Methods 2.1 .
Design and performance of experiments Experiments were performed at the Faculty of Sciences of the UAM ( Madrid , Spain ) .
Participants were recruited among the student population few weeks before the semester exams in the spring and autumn of 2012 .
Recruitment was made by means of advertisement billboards and e-mail ( sent by non-teaching staff ) as the UAM ethical committee requires .
In total , 176 White Spanish females took part in this study .
Participants played the PDG within a set of different tests ( not considered in the current paper ) .
In the PDG , subjects have to choose between two possible strategies : “ cooperate ” or “ defect. ” If the two players choose “ cooperate ” they both get 90 points , if both choose “ defect ” each one gets 30 points .
If they choose different actions , the one who cooperates gets 10 points and the one who defects obtains 160 points .
The exchange rate used in the experiment was 100 points = 1€ .
Under the standard game-theoretical approach “ defect ” is a dominant strategy because it is the strategy that maximizes the individual benefit regardless of the decision of the counterpart .
In addition to playing the PDG , participants were asked to guess the decision of their opponent ( expected behavior , or EB ) .
This variable has been shown to be a strong determinant of behavior in the PDG ( Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ) .
Participants played a single round of the PDG .
They were informed that they were playing against another female participant from a previous session .
They did not know anything else about their counterpart .
Subjects knew that their decisions would affect participants of a future session in the same way .
The experiment was run employing the Z-Tree 3.2.10 software ( Fischbacher , 2007 ) .
Each participant was allocated a computer terminal .
Experimental sessions had less than 20 subjects each .
Participants received a show-up fee ( 5€ ) and a variable reward dependent on the decisions taken in the different games implemented in the experiment .
Final payment was 13.25 ± 0.08€ ( avg ± SEM ) per person ( PDG average payment was 0.87 ± 0.04€ ) .
Prior to the experiment , participants were informed that their final payment would depend on their decisions in several items of the study , but not in all of them .
Few weeks after the experiment , subjects were informed about the exact payment procedure .
At the end of each experimental session , pictures of each participant were taken to prospectively measure individual FA and FF .
Their height , weight , and both waist and hip perimeter were measured in order to estimate BMI and WHR .
Participants also provided some personal data by filling up a questionnaire ( age , current studies , ethnic group , sexual orientation , SPA ) .
All data remained completely anonymous as required by the ethical commit- tee of the UAM .
2.2 .
Measurement of morphometric variables Three full frontal facial color photographs were taken of each participant , at 3 meters of distance and under standardized light conditions with the zoom completely opened in order to avoid distortion of the facial shape .
Participants were asked to remove any facial adornment , to pose with a neutral expression and to look directly into the camera .
To measure FA from these images , the shape of each face was defined by manually setting 39 predetermined Landmarks ( LMs ) .
These 39 points can be unambiguously identified in each photo ( Fig .
1 ) .
The LMs were placed twice by two of the authors in order to detect possible placement errors .
LMs were located employing the TPS software ( by F.J. Rohlf , available at http : //life.bio .
sunysb.edu/morph/ ) .
To calculate the FA of each image , we compared the LMs of each face and its mirror image ( Klingenberg , Barluenga , & Meyer , 2002 ) .
The asymmetry of a bilateral object can be partially attributed to directional asymmetry ( differences in the population between average right and left size ) and partially to FA ( deviation of each individual 's asymmetry from the overall average asymmetry ) .
We obtained FA by decomposing the Procrustes distance between each image and its mirror image using the Procrustes ANOVA method ( Klingenberg & McIntyre , 1998 ) .
This decomposition was performed with the Morpho J software ( available at http : //www.flywings.org.uk/ MorphoJ_page.htm ) .
As an individual measure of symmetry we used the Mahalanobis distance , which avoids the effect of correlation between variables ( Rodríguez-Salazar , Álvarez-Hernández , & Bravo- Nuñez , 2001 ) .
We thus employed a value of FA that is highly independent of the selected LMs .
To control for the potential error in the LMs placement , FA computation in Morpho J requires two sets of LMs for each face ( each set placed by a different researcher ) .
Error in LM positioning was not significant ( Procrustes ANOVA , error SS = 9297 × 10−3 , df = 13,172 , F = 0.006 , p = 0.989 ) .
We estimated facial femininity ( FF ) by measuring the Procrustes distance between each participant 's average face and a masculine reference face .
The masculine reference face was built from the images of 100 males belonging to the same age and population as the subjects of study .
Participants ' average face was obtained as an average of the three captured pictures and their mirror images .
The use of symmetrical average faces for comparison with the masculine reference face avoids any undesired effect of individual symmetry in the measure of FF .
We computed theWHR by dividing the waist perimeter by the hip perimeter of each participant and trying to minimize the error caused by clothes .
Waist perimeter was measured in the lower girth region of the natural waist , generally right above the umbilicus .
Hip perimeter was measured in the wider point of the gluteus .
During measure- ments , participants stood feet together , loosen arms , normal breath , andwith their bodyweight uniformly distributed .
In order to estimate BMI , the weight and height of each participant were measured barefoot and without heavy clothing .
A female researcher took these measurements from each participant privately and just once .

Self-perceived attractiveness ( SPA ) To obtain SPA , each participant reported an estimation of its own attractiveness in a 1 to 7 Likert-like scale , being 1 the lowest score and 7 the maximum , assessed as deviations of the population average .
Participants who consider themselves on the average were advised to score themselves with 4 .
2.4 .
Statistical analyses We tested for the normality of all variables by means of the Shapiro–Wilk test .
For those variables not normally distributed , we performed the usual logarithmic transformations .
However , both SPA and BMI were resistant to that transformation .
To analyze the results , we employed ( non-parametric ) Spearman rho ( σ ) for correlations , two-tailed Student t tests for the normally distributed variables and Mann–Whitney test for SPA and BMI .
We also employed logistic regressions to analyze the simultaneous effect of several variables on our dichotomous dependent variable ( “ Cooperate ” or “ Defect ” ) .
We employed SPSS 15.0 ( SPSS Inc. ) in all the statistical analyses .

Results Table 1 presents the summary statistics of all the variables considered .
First , we analyzed how the physiological variables relate to SPA .
As expected , SPA correlates negatively with WHR , BMI and FA ( Table 2 ) .
Although our measure of FF did not correlate with SPA , it negatively correlates with WHR .
This is quite remarkable given that both features are strongly influenced by hormone levels during puberty .
Age did not correlate with any of themorphometric variables or with SPA , although it must be noted that the age range of our subjects was very narrow .
Although WHR and BMI do not show aTable 1 Summary statistics for the entire subject population and according to choice in the PDG .

For statistics analysis , the natural logarithm of WHR was employed.significant correlation in our data , we followed the literature and controlled for BMI in any further analysis including WHR .
Regarding behavior in the PDG , 31.30 % ( n = 55 ) of the 176 participants did not cooperate , a fraction consistent with results previously observed in the literature .
We also tested for differences in behavior according to the expectation that participants had on the behavior of their counterpart .
There was a strong and significant association between the behavior of a participant and the behavior she expected from her counterpart ( χ2 = 42.718 , p b 0.001 ) .
Of the participants who expected their counterpart to cooperate ( n = 123 ) , 83.74 % ( n = 103 ) of them cooperated , whereas of the other 53 participants who expected their counterpart to defect , 66.04 % ( n = 35 ) defected .
Next , we analyzed the relationship between behavior in the PDG ( cooperate or defect ) and the individual variables considered ( Table 1 ) .
Results reveal that those subjects who defected displayed a higher WHR and a lower FA than those who cooperated .
In addition , and in line with the literature , participants who defected perceived themselves as attractive ( high SPA ) .
Age , FF and BMI were not significantly different between participants who cooperated and those who defected .
We performed a set of logistic regressions in order to test simultaneously the effect of these variables on cooperation in the PDG ( Table 3 ) .
In an initial analysis , we included all the morphometric variables plus age ( first row of Table 3 ) .
We observed that WHR and FA were statistically significant .
Note that the coefficients associated to these variables are negative and positive respectively .
In other words , participants with low WHR and high FA tended to cooperate more in the PDG .
Next we built a simpler model excluding age and FF given that they were not significant ( second row of Table 3 ) .
In this model , the variables FA and WHR remained significant .
In the following model ( third row of Table 3 ) we included the variableCooperate ( n = 121 ) 21.48 ± 0.24 t174 = −0.419 ; p = 0.675 0.7152 ± 0.004 t174 = 2.184 ; p = 0.030 22.497 ± 0.326 U = 3000 ; N1 = 55 N2 = 121 ; p = 0.296 4.3155 ± 0.046 t174 = −2.631 ; p = 0.009 8.354 ± 0.166 t174 = −0.412 ; p = 0.681 4.198 ± 0.083 U = 2666.5 ; N1 = 55 N2 = 121 ; p = 0.024 Table 2 Spearman rho correlation between considered variables .

/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 118–125SPA ( which correlates with both WHR and FA ) in order to test whether the effect of the morphometric variables on the decision in the PDG depends on how attractive participants find themselves .
In that model , all SPA , WHR and FA were significant .
High values of SPA and WHR led to defection , whereas high values of FA led to cooperation .
Hence , the physiological variables FA andWHR remained significant after including SPA in the logistic regression model .
It is remarkable that both a low SPA and a lowWHR relate with a tendency to cooperate considering that WHR negatively correlates with attractiveness .
Women who see themselves as relatively unattractive cooperate more often , but women with low WHR—an attractive feature—tend to be more cooperative as well .
Finally , we included the variable expected behavior ( EB ) which has been described to strongly affect participants ' decision in the PDG ( fourth row of Table 3 ) .
The resulting model confirmed this finding : When participants expected their counterpart to cooperate , theywere more inclined to cooperate .
It is worth noting that the significance of FA and SPA barely changed after the inclusion of EB .
This result suggests that the effect of FA and SPA on behavior in the PDG does not operate through EB .
However , the inclusion of EB in the model rendered WHR non-significant at the 95 % confidence level .
This leads us to conclude that the effect of WHR on cooperation operates mostly through its influence on the expectation that subjects hold on the behavior of their counterpart .
In fact , there were no significant differences in FA ( t174 = −1.104 ; p = 0.312 ) nor SPA ( U = 3001.5 ; N1 = 53 , N2 = 122 ; p = 0.374 ) between those who expected their counterpart to cooperate and those who expected the opposite .
But there were significant differences in WHR between the two groups ( t174 = 2.519 ; p = 0.013 ) : those participants who expected their opponent to cooperate displayed lower ratios ( 0.715 ± 0.004 ) than those who expected defection ( 0.732 ± 0.006 ) .Table 3 Estimation of the probability of cooperation in the PDG : Logistic models .

Discussion The goal of the present study is to analyze the existing relationship between cooperative behavior in women and a set of individual characteristics previously categorized as indicators of phenotypic quality ( high fitness ) , that are also known to be related with female attractiveness .
Of the studied variables , FA and WHR showed an effect on the decision to cooperate .
Even more interestingly , and in line with our second hypothesis , their effect seems to be independent of the perception that individuals have of their own attractiveness .
This is shown by the fact that FA andWHRmaintained their significance after controlling for SPA .
This independent effect of the physiological variables and SPA on participants ' cooperative behavior in the PDG is undoubtedly the more outstanding result of our study .
Several studies reveal an association between behavior and fitness-related features , particularly symmetry , in humans ( Furlow et al. , 1998 ; Manning & Wood , 1998 ; Pound et al. , 2007 ; Muñoz-Reyes et al. , 2012 ) , and more specifically in relation to cooperative or prosocial behavior ( Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ; Zaatari et al. , 2009 ; Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ; Holtzman et al. , 2011 ) .
Neverthe- less , to date , no study had explored whether the effect of symmetry ( or other physiological variables ) works through the self-perception of personal attractiveness .
A plausible explanation of the observed effect of FA on cooperative behavior might be that a symmetric person should feel more attractive and , therefore , more entitled to obtain resources autonomously due to the benefits conferred by attractive- ness ( reviewed in Langlois et al. , 2000 ; Mulford et al. , 1998 ) .
Our results , however , cast doubts on this explanation .

Muñoz-Reyes et al .
/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 118–125remains significant after controlling for self-perception of attractive- ness .
While remarkable , the independent effect of these two factors is not entirely unexpected .
Results observed in studies withmales reveal that although men who find themselves attractive tend to cooperate more ( Mulford et al. , 1998 , but see Takahashi et al. , 2006 ) , highly symmetrical males cooperate less often ( Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ) .
This occurs even though attractiveness and symmetry are correlated ( reviewed in Johnston , 2006 ; Kościński , 2007 ; Little et al. , 2011 ; Thornhill & Gangestad , 1999 ; Van Dongen & Gangestad , 2011 ) .
The basis of this intriguing relationship between FA and behavior , triggered independently of SPA , could be explained by an unconscious self-adjustment of behavior to its expected consequences based on previous experience .
It has been described that several animal behaviors adjust to mathematical models based on their cumulative rate of success and failure despite animals do not use such models consciously ( Dugatkin & Reeve , 2000 ) .
The link between symmetry and a low tendency to cooperate might be due to other individual characteristics which could be associated to FA , such as self- confidence or perceived self-sufficiency ( the estimation of the own ability to obtain resources ) .
As a matter of fact , symmetry is correlated with several personality traits , like neuroticism , agreeableness and openness to experience , the last two negatively ( Fink , Neave , Manning , & Grammer , 2005 ; Holtzman et al. , 2011 ) .
This association might be behind the link we observe between low FA and a weaker tendency to cooperate .
Even though we find these questions quite interesting , they are beyond the scope of this study .
Independently of the mechanism behind it , the link we find between FA and cooperative behavior in women is to be expected given the results already found in men .
More symmetrical males are less pro-social in the PDG ( Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ) and in the UG ( Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ) , and display fewer pro-social personality traits ( Holtzman et al. , 2011 ) .
Considering their higher phenotypic quality ( Thornhill & Gangestad , 2006 ) , low-FA individuals depend less on maintaining a good relationship with their social environment , and , hence , are not prone to sacrifice personal benefits in order to favor others ( Zaatari & Trivers , 2007 ) .
This explanation ( already proposed in Mulford et al. , 1998 ) also fits with the relationship between attractiveness and cooperative behavior de- scribed in this paper under the hypothesis that attractiveness is a valid indicator of fitness ( Langlois et al. , 2000 ) .
We do not want to imply that the need for resources was behind participants ' behavior in our experiment .
We rather suggest that their different capabilities in obtaining resources and their experiences when sharing them might have shaped subjects ' daily behavior andmade themmore or less pro- social independently of their short-term needs .
The independence between the effects of attractive-related physiological features and of SPA is evident in the case of WHR ( once controlled for BMI ) .
Even though low WHR scores are associated with attractiveness in women ( Singh et al. , 2010 ) , we show that low WHR values associate with cooperative behavior .
This result is unexpected if one exclusively focuses on the relationship between WHR and attractiveness .
It confirms our conclusion that the effect of the attractive-related variables on cooperation does not operate exclusively through their influence on SPA .
A likely explanation for this result stems from the positive association we found between a high WHR and the belief in the defection of the opponent .
The effect of WHR on EB seems to be the strongest determinant of participants ' behavior .
Table 3 shows that EB explains individual behavior in the PDG better than any other variable ( also in Mulford et al. , 1998 ; Sanchez-Pages & Turiegano , 2010 ) .
That is , a high WHR is associated with a tendency to believe that the opponent will not cooperate , and this belief leads to defection .
The relationship we observe between high WHR and the belief on the counterpart 's defection is to be expected , especially given the associations already described in healthy women between this variable and different distrustful behaviors , such as hostility ( Kaye , Folsom , Jacobs , Hughes , & Flack , 1993 ) , low self-perceived social status ( Adler , Epel , Castellazzo , & Ickovics , 2000 ) , and social anxiety ( Landén et al. , 2004 ) .
This may suggest that WHR , beyond of its relationship with fitness ( Singh , 2002 ; Jasieńska et al. , 2004 ; Swami & Tovée , 2007 ) , may be indicating “ desirability as a social partner ” which , in turn , leads to women showing higher values ( low desirability ) to behave distrustfully in social interactions because of their previous experiences .
The FF of the participants had no significant effect on the propensity to cooperate in the PDG .
Although the degree of sexual differentiation of the face has a well-known association with several behaviors , to date , most of the studies on this issue have focused only inmen ( Apicella et al. , 2008 ; Pound et al. , 2009 ; Stirrat & Perrett , 2010 , 2012 ) .
These studies employ the ratio between facial width and height ( both in men and women ) as a measure of masculinization/ feminization .
This feature was initially described as dimorphic between sexes ( Weston , Friday , & Lio , 2007 ; Carré & McCormick , 2008 ) , but has recently been questioned as such ( Kramer , Jones , & Ward , 2012 ; Lefevre et al. , 2012 ) .
In any case , in studies which included female participants , this measure of masculinity ( or femininity ) showed no effect on the propensity to engage in deception or cheating during a negotiation ( Haselhuhn & Wong , 2012 ) , nor in dominance ( Carré & McCormick , 2008 ) .
However , the same measure showed an effect on male behavior under the same experimental conditions .
Therefore , our results are consistent with those stating that facial sexual dimorphismmay influence behavior in men but not in women .
It might be argued that we are not measuring facial femininity properly , but the strong correlation between FF and WHR substantiates the robustness of our femininity measure ( see Table 2 ) .
This correlation is in line with the relationship previously observed between facial and body attractiveness when measured separately , which confirms that these two variables are valid indicators of fitness ( Thornhill & Grammer , 1999 ) .
Although both FF and WHR are related to estrogen levels , it is remarkable that they do not have the same effect on cooperative behavior .
This fact suggests that considering the stage of development in which the feminizing effect of hormones occurs is important in order to ascertain its effects on a specific behavior .
Obviously , additional experiments and physiological studies are needed to deepen our understanding of this result .
Regarding our first hypothesis , of the three variables related to fitness , only FA displayed the expected effect on cooperation , while FF showed no effect and WHR yielded the opposite .
However , the effect of SPA fits with our hypothesis if one considers it as a reliable signal of fitness ( Langlois et al. , 2000 ) .
In summary , two variables confirmed our expectations and two did not .
It is very interesting that WHR and FA , which are strongly correlated ( see Table 2 ) and linked to fitness , have opposite effects on cooperative behavior .
The strong correlation between them and their correlation with SPA confirm them as measures of phenotypic quality , like facial and body attractiveness ( Thornhill & Grammer , 1999 ) , facial and voice femininity ( Feinberg et al. , 2005 ) and symmetry and sexual dimorphism ( Little et al. , 2008 ) .
The fact that their effects on behavior in the PDG follow different directions suggests that they relate to different kinds of high-fit features ( Singh , 2002 ; Gangestad & Scheyd , 2005 ; Swami & Tovée , 2007 ; Van Dongen & Gangestad , 2011 ) .
That aside , this contradiction also casts doubts on the idea that the motivation to cooperate is only related to the possibility of obtaining resources from others through reciprocation .
This is only one of the possible , and not mutually exclusive , motivations of pro-social behavior ( social norms and ethical beliefs are also obvious factors ) .
The mixed results obtained here demonstrate the difficulty of associating any behavior to a single motivation .
Let us remark that the present study is one of the few analyzing pro-social behavior solely in women .
In a public good game played only by females , Buser ( 2012 ) found that contributions were higher 124 J.A .
Muñoz-Reyes et al .
/ Evolution and Human Behavior 35 ( 2014 ) 118–125during the menstrual phase of the menstrual cycle and that those participants with a lower 2D/4D ratio contributed less .
Nevertheless , there exists a vast literature comparing behavior between men and women in strategic games ( reviewed in Balliet , Li , Macfarlan , & Van Vugt , 2011 ) .
Results show consistently that men and women act differently depending on the sex of their counterpart in social dilemmas .
The lowest levels of cooperation are usually found in setups where only women participate .
While in mixed-sex interac- tions women tend to be more cooperative , men tend to be more cooperative in same-sex interactions ( Croson & Gneezy , 2009 ; Balliet et al. , 2011 ) .
Under an evolutionary perspective , these differences are usually attributed to the advantage of males when forming coalitions aimed to obtain resources in hunting and war .
This difference between men and women could in turn mediate the effect of SPA , WHR and FA when women face mixed-sex instead of single-sex strategic interactions .
To conclude , and beyond the interest of the results obtained and their implications , it is important to remark that this study , as many others , was performed using exclusively a university population within a Western culture .
For this reason , before generalizing results to the human species , it would be needed to extend the experiments to a major range of ages and socio-cultural strata , including a wider range of ethnicities .
This is particularly necessary when considering WHR given that its association with numerous features relies partially on the ethnicity of the subjects ( Kaye et al. , 1993 ) .
However , we can conjecture what could be the effect of fitness-related variables on cooperative behavior in non-Western industrialized societies .
As it has been described ( Henrich , Heine , & Norenzayan , 2010 ) , people in many of these societies behave more in line with the predictions of Standard Game Theory .
Following this pattern , one should expect less people to cooperate in the PDG in non-industrialized societies .
Therefore , under the assumption that cooperative behavior is a tool to receive future help from others , only extremely low-fit individuals ( showing remarkable unadaptative values in these variables ) should cooperate often in these societies .
Of course , this can only be elucidated by performing comparable experiments in other societies .
