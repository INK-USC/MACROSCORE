Across two studies using a face perception paradigm, we provide evidence that people use evolved, specialized heuristics for long-term cooperative partner choice to calibrate their generosity toward ultimatum game partners. Men and women played one-shot ultima- tum games for real incentives with partners represented by face photographs. Menweremore generous toward partners who were stronger, and who appeared more attractive, more prosocial, more productive, healthier and higher in social status; the effect of strength was mediated by productivity, but not dangerousness, suggesting thatmen implemented heuristics designed for partner choice rather than the asymmetric war of attrition. More- over, men reduced their earnings by cooperating selectively with valuable long-term partners.Women also gave better treatment to valuable-appearing partners, but appeared to prioritize partner choice less thanmen did, rel- ative to game earnings and intrasexual competition. The results suggest that people treat the ultimatum game as though it were an opportunity to establish a cooperative relationship with a new partner, and implications are discussed for an evolved psychology of cooperative partner choice.senbruch), go.edu (D. Maestripieri),© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Researchers have long used the Ultimatum Game (UG) to study human cooperation and bargaining (Camerer, 2003; Güth &amp; Kocher, 2014). In the UG, a proposer offers a specific split of a fixed sum of money, and the responder either accepts the offer – in which case the proposed split is enacted – or rejects it, in which case both players re- ceive nothing. Behavior in the UG is typically regarded as economically “anomalous” (Thaler, 1988), because people fail to pursue the income- maximizing strategies whereby responders accept any positive offer and prescient proposers therefore make the lowest possible offer. In- stead, proposers in industrial societies typically offer 40%–50% of the en- dowment and responders frequently reject low offers (but see Henrich et al., 2005 regarding cultural differences). To explain these results, economists have developed a variety of models suggesting that people are averse to unequal distributions between the two players (reviewed by Camerer, 2003). Exogenous to these models, however, is a body of research showing that people are sensitive to the traits of their UG partner, not merely to the structure of the game. For example, offers are more likely to be ac- cepted if they are from a smiling proposer (Mussel, Göritz, &amp; Hewig, 2013) or one described as generous (Marchetti, Castelli, Harlé, &amp; Sanfey, 2011); more symmetrical responders receive higher offers (Zaatari, Palestis, &amp; Trivers, 2009); andmore attractive individuals receive higheroffers from proposers but responders also demand more from them in order to accept an offer (Solnick &amp; Schweitzer, 1999). There is comple- mentary evidence from other economic games as well, for example showing that attractive individuals are more likely to be trusted (Wilson &amp; Eckel, 2006) and to have their trust reciprocated (Krupp, DeBruine, &amp; Jones, 2011) in a trust game. These results suggest that peo- ple process economic games, including the UG, as though they are real- world social interactions, inwhich the biological and behavioral traits of their partners matter. Since humans have cognitive adaptations for so- cial exchange relationships (see Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2005), we investi- gated whether behavior in the UG conforms to evolved heuristics for resource division. We identified two adaptationist theories of how resources might be divided in the UG. First, there is evidence suggesting that people divide resources according to the logic of the asymmetric war of attrition (AWA; Hammerstein &amp; Parker, 1982; Maynard Smith, 1979), in which resources are allocated based on the relative ability and willingness of each individual to inflict damage on the other. Physically stronger men feel more entitled to advantageous outcomes and are more willing to use force to resolve conflicts in their favor (Sell, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides, 2009; see also Petersen, Sznycer, Sell, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2013). If re- sources are divided in the UG according to the logic of the AWA, then any cues of the likelihood of winning a violent conflict over resources (e.g., strength, aggressiveness) should lead tomore advantageous treat- ment in the game. The second theory is that people will treat the UG not as a conflict over an existing resource (in which the AWA would apply), but as an 430 A.B. Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439opportunity to initiate a long-term cooperative relationship. Humans evolved in a biological marketplace of long-term cooperative relation- ships, and therefore faced selection pressures to choose (and be chosen by) the most valuable available cooperators (Barclay, 2013; Baumard, André, &amp; Sperber, 2013; Noë &amp; Hammerstein, 1994, 1995). An individual's value in the biological market of cooperators is a function of their ability to create future benefits, their expected generosity in sharing those benefits, and their outside options for production and/or cooperation (Barclay, 2013; Baumard et al., 2013; Zaatari &amp; Trivers, 2007). If mechanisms that evolved for partner choice (PC) govern be- havior in theUG, then participants should offer advantageous treatment to partners who appear high in partner value, as a type of opening bid for the establishment of a cooperative relationship. On this account, any cues that a potential partner is more valuable than alternative pos- sible partners should cause that potential partner to be treated better in the UG. As discussed further below, cues of health, strength, and prosociality, among other traits, likely predicted relative partner value in the ancestral environments in which PC mechanisms evolved. As such, on the PC model, players perceived to possess these traits should receive more generous treatment in the UG. In the present research, we used face photographs that had been measured and rated for various traits as partners in the UG in order to test how perceived traits affect treatment in the game. We initially hy- pothesized effects consistent with the AWA – in which more threaten- ing and formidable individuals should receive better treatment – but initial results suggested that cues of high partner value might be the stronger predictor of treatment in the game. Subsequent data collec- tions were therefore designed to test between the AWA and PCmodels. 1. Study 1a 1.1. Study 1a: Introduction Since humans form rich impressions of others based on limited ex- posure to faces (e.g., Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006), we used a face- perception paradigm to test the effects of various cues on treatment in the UG. In an initial study using male participants, we predicted on the basis of the AWA that cues of the likelihood of escalating and win- ning a violent conflict over resources would lead to more generous treatment in the UG. Recent research suggests that men's facial- width-to-height ratio (fWHR) may be a cue of formidability. Men with greater fWHRs are judged as more aggressive (Carré, McCormick, &amp; Mondloch, 2009), dominant (Alrajih &amp; Ward, 2014) and intimidating (Hehman, Leitner, &amp; Gaertner, 2013), and are in fact more aggressive both in the laboratory and in real-world settings (Carré &amp; McCormick, 2008). Similarly, men with wider faces are trusted less and are less trustworthy in an economic task (Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010). Men with wider faces are more likely to be violent (Christiansen &amp; Winkler, 1992), but less likely to die in fights (Stirrat, Stulp, &amp; Pollet, 2012). In sum, there is evidence to suggest that menwith wider faces may be cal- ibrated to amore aggressive, exploitative interpersonal strategy, and are perceived as such. Therefore, the logic of the AWA predicts that men with a higher fWHR will receive more generous treatment in the UG. 1.2. Study 1a: Materials and methods 1.2.1. Design We tested this prediction using stimulus faces drawn froma sample of men who participated in a study on mating psychology and behavior. These men had been measured for physical strength, and photos of their faces were measured for fWHR and rated for health, attractiveness, dominance, and prosociality. We then used these pictures to represent UG partners (hereafter “targets”) for a new set of male participants. The abovemeasurements and ratingswere initiallymade because of their rel- evance to the larger project on mating psychology, but they also allowed us to test predictors of treatment in the UG. On the basis of the AWA, wepredicted that fWHR would positively predict generosity received in the UG; the other traits were also examined because prior findings suggest that facial traits may be influential in the UG (see Introduction). We employed the strategy method of the UG (see Güth &amp; Kocher, 2014). In the strategy method, the responder states the minimum offer they would accept from the proposer, rather than accepting or rejecting a specific offer.We refer to this as the responder's “demand.” Thismethod allows all subjects to play as both proposer and responder with all possi- ble partners, and elicits continuousmeasures of UG behavior. During ses- sion 1, participants played a series of one-shot ultimatum games (with a $10 endowment) with multiple same-sex partners (“targets”) who were represented by a facial photograph. Participants saw a picture of a target's face and were asked to state either an offer or a demand for that target, and this was repeated for all targets (participants were instructed to skip any targets they recognized). Participantswere randomly assigned to play first as the proposer toward all targets and then as the responder toward all targets, or vice versa. Targets were presented in a random order. These targets had previously played a single, one-shot UG for real money using the strategy method with an anonymous partner (i.e., their partnerswere not identified to them, nor they to their partners, in any way beyond knowing that they were all participants in the same study). These recorded UG decisions allowed us to pay our study 1a par- ticipants based on the actual outcomes of their games. Session 2 occurred a few weeks after session 1. During session 2, subjects rolled a die. If the die came up 6, one of their UG decisions from session 1was chosen at random, and compared to the correspond- ing decision of their target from that round. Participants were then paid their earnings for that round in cash. As such, all participant decisions were incentive-compatible, and there was no deception. All targets, photograph raters, and participants were students at UCSB, who gave informed consent to participate or have their picture used for research. 1.2.2. Male target stimuli Facial photographs of 83 male students were used as stimuli (“targets”) in study 1a. They were 18–26 years old (mean = 20.0, s.d. = 1.85). Thirty-five self-identified as Caucasian, 20 as Asian, 16 as Hispanic, and the rest as multiracial or “Other.” All gave permission for their photographs to be used for research purposes. Photographs were taken directly facing the camera under standard- ized lighting conditions, and were digitally rotated so that the pupils were aligned on ahorizontal axis. fWHRwasmeasured as thedistance be- tween the left and right zygion (the outermost edge of the face, before the ear) divided by the distance from the top of the upper lip to the upper edge of the eyelids. Measurements were made independently by two re- search assistants; there was high agreement between the two sets of measurements (r = .95), and their mean was used in analysis. Photo- graphs were then cropped with an oval around the face. Strength was measured as the composite of grip and chest strength (measured with a dynamometer) and flexed bicep circumference (see Sell et al., 2009). 1.2.3. Raters Due to the design of the study fromwhich these target stimuli were drawn, the target face photographs were rated in two batches. Sixty- nine students (42 female) rated 39 of the male targets; these raters were 17–22 years old (mean=18.6 years, s.d. = 0.99). Forty-eight stu- dents (19 female) rated the other 44 male targets; these raters' ages ranged from 18 to 22 years (mean = 18.6 years, s.d. = 0.99). Target photos were rated for attractiveness (3 items; alpha = .980), health, dominance (3 items; alpha = .946), and prosociality (3 items; alpha = .974). Items were presented in a random order, and target faces were randomized within items. Full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in Appendix A. 1.2.4. Male ultimatum game participants Ninety-ninemen played the UG with the target face photographs as partners. None of these men were among the participants who had Table 2 Zero-order correlations betweenmean generosity received and target traits inmen (study1).

Eleven men showed no variance in their generosity index (see below), likely indicating disengagement from the task, so analysis was restricted to the other 88 participants. (Given the potential uncertainty regarding whether invariance in generosity reflects disen- gagement or a consistent strategy, analyses were also run including all participants, and statistical results were very similar. Generally speak- ing, including all participants changed zero-order correlations only in the third decimal place.) Due to experimenter error, we did not record the ages of these participants. However, they were drawn from the same subject pool as the raters used in study 1a, so we expect a similar age distribution. 1.2.5. Data analysis Mean values for each rating dimension for each target face were computed and used in subsequent analyses. We calculated bivariate correlations in order to evaluate the zero-order effect of each of the tar- get traits (measured fWHR, measured strength, and ratings of attrac- tiveness, health, dominance and prosociality) on how the target faces were treated in the ultimatum game. 1.3. Study 1a: Results Table 1 presents the correlations between fWHR, strength, attrac- tiveness, health, dominance and prosociality for the male targets. (Note that the traits rated in study 1b are included in the same table, for efficiency of presentation.) Surprisingly, fWHRwas not significantly correlated with strength or dominance, suggesting that it may not in fact be a reliable cue of formidability, at least in this sample. Itwas, how- ever, negatively correlated with ratings of attractiveness, prosociality, and health, suggesting that raters had negative impressions of men with wider faces. There was a significant negative correlation between the mean of- fers and mean demands received by targets (i.e., the UG partner in the photograph), r(83) = − .45, p b .001, such that targets who received higher offers also received lower demands. This indicates that partici- pants used offers and demands in concert when responding to UG part- ners; therefore we used mean generosity received by a target (generosity = offer–demand) as the primary measure of treatment in the UG. Table 2 presents the zero-order correlations of mean generosity re- ceived by targets with their fWHR, strength, and ratings of attractive- ness, health, dominance and prosociality (for efficiency of presentation, the traits rated in study 1b are also included in this table). fWHRwas significantly negatively correlatedwith generosity re- ceived, but all of the other traits positively predicted mean generosity received. Effect sizes were especially large for health and attractiveness ratings (which were highly correlated with each other; see Table 1), with these traits accounting for nearly two-thirds of the variance in how well specific targets were treated (rs N 0.75).Table 1 Intercorrelations among fWHR, strength, and the rated traits in Studies 1a and 1b.

Study 1a: Discussion The results of study 1a defied our expectations: fWHR negatively predicted generosity received in the UG. This may be because fWHR in this sample did not reliably cue the likelihood of winning a violent con- flict over resources, as suggested by the lack of significant correlations between fWHR and strength and dominance. The negative correlation between fWHR and prosociality suggests that fWHR was instead used as a cue that an individual was exploitative or uncooperative. More importantly, these results suggested to us that participants may have treated theUG as an opportunity for partner choice. The large effects of health, attractiveness, and prosociality suggest that participants gave preferential treatment to the types of people who are generally in high demand as social partners. As such, these results were consistent with a PC model for explaining UG behavior. On the other hand, the positive ef- fect of dominance is still potentially consistent with the AWA model, given that individuals are generally prone to cede resources to dominant individuals. The effect of strength is consistentwith both the AWA and PC models, since male strength may have been a reliable cue of either dan- gerousness or productivity in ancestral environments (Apicella, 2014; von Rueden, Gurven, &amp; Kaplan, 2008). These ambiguities led us to have the target faces rated for additional traits in order to test between the PC and AWAmodels (Study 1b). 2. Study 1b 2.1. Study 1b: Introduction Study 1b used the same UG decisions as in 1a, but the target faces were rated for additional traits in order to better test the AWA and PC theories against each other. In particular, we obtained ratings of produc- tivity in an ancestral-like environment (e.g., how good the target would be at finding food on a desert island), dangerousness in response to a5. 6. 7. 8. 9. −0.01 0.70⁎⁎ 0.45⁎⁎ 0.34⁎⁎ 0.79⁎⁎ 0.70⁎⁎ −0.29⁎⁎ 0.82⁎⁎ 0.17 0.61⁎⁎ 0.66⁎⁎ 0.56⁎⁎ 0.81⁎⁎ 0.68⁎⁎ 0.18 432 A.B. Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439low offer (e.g., the target's likelihood of starting a fight in response to an insulting offer), and desirability as a friend. On the PC model, partners who appear more productive should receive greater generosity, while those who appear dangerous should receive less generosity. This is be- cause themind will implement algorithms designed to secure coopera- tive relationships with productive, non-exploitative partners in a competitive marketplace of cooperators (Barclay, 2013; Baumard et al., 2013). Desirability as a friendmay then serve as a summary judg- ment of cooperative partner value (Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996; Vigil, 2007).We chose tomeasure cues of ancestral, rather thanmodern, pro- ductivity, because their effects more clearly indicate the operation of evolved heuristics. In other words, if traits that are irrelevant to produc- tivity in modern environments nonetheless have an effect on contem- porary economic decisions, this is evidence that those decisions are implemented by mechanisms that have been tailored by natural selec- tion to the environment in which our species evolved. On the other hand, the AWA model predicts that partners who ap- pear more dangerous will receive more generous treatment, because men will defer to individuals who are likely to win a violent conflict over resources. In addition, the PCmodel predicts that the positive effect of strength on generosity observed in study 1a will be mediated by pro- ductivity, while the AWAmodel predicts that the effect of strength will be mediated by dangerousness. Since perceived productivity is a relatively new addition to the part- ner choice literature (see Barclay &amp; Reeve, 2012; Debove, Baumard, &amp; André, under review for theoretical work on the importance of individ- ual quality and productivity, respectively; see Krupp et al., 2011; Zaatari &amp; Trivers, 2007; Zaatari et al., 2009 for effects of cues of condition), we wanted to test it against other theoretically-relevant partner choice criteria. Most existing research on partner choice focuses on disposi- tional cooperativeness as the criterion by which partners are chosen (e.g., Aktipis, 2004; Delton &amp; Robertson, 2012; Fu, Hauert, Nowak, &amp; Wang, 2008), and health is also a theoretically-important component of partner value (e.g., Barclay, 2013; Krupp et al., 2011; Zaatari &amp; Trivers, 2007).We usedmultiple regression analyses to test the independent ef- fect of productivity, controlling for these other traits. In addition, we tested the PCmodel against other possible models of UG behavior. First, a “beauty premium” has been previously observed in the UG and other economic settings (seeMaestripieri, Henry, &amp; Nickels, in press), which predicts more generous treatment towardmore attrac- tive partners. Second, proposers in study 1a could have attempted to maximize their earnings in the game by matching their offer to the de- mand expected from the responder. Third, participants may have sim- ply reciprocated the treatment they anticipated receiving from their partner. We statistically controlled for each of these possibilities in order to confirm that the effects of PC heuristics obtained above and be- yond these other potential influences. Note that these are particularly stringent tests of the PC model, since attractiveness may contain cues of partner value (see Section 5), and the PC model actually predicts that participants will prefer partners whom they expect to be generous; the PC model, however, uniquely predicts that other cues of partner valuewill matter even controlling for attractiveness halo effects and de- sires to reciprocate expected treatment. 2.2. Study 1b: Materials and methods 2.2.1. Male target stimuli The target stimuli were exactly the same as those used in study 1a. 2.2.2. Raters Eight research assistants (3 female) completed the ratings of dan- gerousness (3 items, e.g., likelihood of starting a fight in response to a low offer; alpha = .851), productivity (2 items, e.g., skill at acquiring food while stranded on a desert island; alpha = .871), and desirability as a friend. These research assistants also estimated how the targets would behave in an ultimatum game, i.e., the offers and demands thateach target would make. Raters were blind to hypotheses, the targets' actual UG behavior, and the treatment the targets received in the UG. They ranged from 19–23 years old (mean = 21.3 years, s.d. = 2.06). Eighteen students (13 female) rated the male target faces for their ap- parent social status (7 items; alpha = .988). These raters were 18–21 years old (mean = 18.8 years, s.d. = 0.86). (Ratings of male so- cial status were performed after study 2, given the strong effect of social status in women.) Items were presented in a random order, and target faces were randomized within items. Full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in Appendix A. 2.2.3. Data analysis Bivariate correlations were employed in order to evaluate the zero- order effects of perceived productivity, dangerousness, desirability as a friend, and social status on generosity received in the UG. The positive effect of target strength observed in study 1a is consistent with both the AWA and PC models. In order to test these two hypotheses against each other, we constructed a model in which ratings of dangerousness and productivity were entered as mediators of the effect of strength on generosity received, using Preacher and Hayes' (2008) INDIRECT macro for SPSS with 2000 random samplings. Multiple regression anal- yses tested the independent effects of perceived productivity on gener- osity received, controlling first for prosociality ratings, and then for prosociality and health ratings. In order to test the effects of target traits beyond attractiveness halo effects, we calculated partial correlations, controlling for attractiveness, between the remaining target traits (from studies 1a and 1b) and gen- erosity received in theUG. In order to control for the possibility that pro- posers might try to maximize their income by matching their offer to the target's expected demand, we calculated partial correlations be- tween all of the target traits and offers received, controlling for the de- mands expected from the targets. We calculated partial correlations between all of the target traits and generosity received, controlling for estimates of the targets' generosity, in order to control for any possible reciprocity motivations. Finally, we tested the effect of participants' use of partner choice heuristics on their earnings in the UG. To do this, we calculated, for each participant, the correlations between UG decisions and target traits. The absolute value of these correlations indexes each participant's sensitivity to the various target traits.We then correlated these sensitiv- ity indexes with the participants' mean earnings across all rounds (if they were to be paid out). The correlation between sensitivity to target traits and mean earnings reveals how sensitivity to various target traits affects earnings in the UG. 2.3. Study 1b: Results Table 1 presents the correlations between the ratings of productivi- ty, dangerousness, desirability as a friend, and social status, aswell as all of the traits rated or measured in study 1a. Of note, the productivity composite generally correlated highly and positivelywith other positive traits (like friend desirability) but also with dangerousness, although dangerousness did not exhibit strong correlations with the positive traits. This suggests that some cues signal both productivity and danger- ousness, but that other cues differentiate between productive individ- uals who are desirable as opposed to undesirable social partners. 2.3.1. Zero-order correlations between perceived traits and generosity received Table 2 presents the zero-order correlations of mean generosity re- ceived by targets with their ratings of productivity, dangerousness, desir- ability as a friend and social status (for convenience, the variables from study 1a are also shown in this table). Dangerousness was significantly, positively correlated with mean generosity received, albeit with a modest effect size; although on its face this supports the AWAmodel, this could be a byproduct of the positive correlation between dangerousness and 433A.B. Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439productivity (see Section 2.3.2 below). Productivity, desirability as a friend, and social statuswere all very highly and positively correlatedwith gener- osity received (r's ≥ 0.7), which is consistent with the PC model. 2.3.2. Mediating the effect of strength Fig. 1 presents the results of the model in which productivity and dangerousness were entered as mediators of the effect of strength on generosity received, and shows that apparent productivity, but not dan- gerousness, significantly and completely mediated the effect of strength. Importantly, when productivity was controlled for, the effect of dangerousness reversed in sign and this variable became a significant negative predictor of generosity received. (This same reversal also oc- curred when productivity (β= .89, t(80) = 9.27, p b .001) and danger- ousness (β=− .31, t(80)=−3.23, p= .002) were entered as the only predictors of generosity received.) These results support the PC model over the AWAmodel. 2.3.3. Independent effects of productivity In the regressionmodel with productivity and prosociality ratings as simultaneous predictors of generosity received, productivity had a sig- nificant positive effect, β = .57, t(80) = 7.64, p b .001, as did prosociality, β= .37, t(80)=4.94, p b .001. Adding health as a predictor improved the accuracy of themodel, R2 change= .101, F(1,79)=27.18, p b .001. Productivity remained a significant predictor, β= .37, t(79)= 4.90, p b .001, and health had a significant positive effect, β = .51, t(79) = 5.21, p b .001, but prosociality was no longer a significant pre- dictor of generosity received, β = .09, t(79) = 1.10, p = .28. In both models, collinearity diagnostics revealed sufficient independence of predictors (all VIFs b 2.6). These models suggest that productivity is an important independent predictor of generosity received, supporting the PC hypothesis, while prosociality has a less robust effect. 2.3.4. Effects on earnings and controlling for alternative explanations Strength, dominance, desirability as a friend, productivity, health, and social status had significant ormarginally significant positive effects above and beyond the effect of attractiveness (see Supplementary On- line Materials (SOM), Table S1, available on the journal's Web site at www.ehbonline.org). Participants were more generous toward targets who were expected to be more generous, r(83) = .43, p b .001, but the effects of target traits on generosity received were virtually un- changed after controlling for expected generosity (see SOM, Table S3). Participants offered less to targets who looked like they would demand more to accept an offer, r(83)=− .39, p b .001, which is the opposite of an income-maximizing strategy, and sensitivity to all target traits (except productivity) had a negative effect on UG earnings (see SOM,Strength Generosity received Perceived productivity Perceived dangerousness .25* (.07, n.s.) .27* .18 .87*** -.31** Indirect effects: Productivity: .23, 95% CI [.06, .43] Dangerousness: -.06, 95% CI [-.15, .01] Fig. 1.

Further details for these variables appear in Supplementary Online Materials (available on the journal's Web site at www.ehbonline.org). 2.4. Study 1b: Discussion The results of study 1b robustly supported the PC hypothesis over the AWA hypothesis. A target's apparent productivity, social status and desirability as a friend all had large positive effects on the generosity that target received in the UG. While apparent dangerousness had a positive zero-order effect on generosity received, dangerousness had a significant negative effect on generosity once productivity was con- trolled for, suggesting that formidability above and beyond implied pro- ductivity is actually penalized in the UG.Moreover, the positive effect of strength on generosity observed in study 1a wasmediated by ratings of productivity, further supporting the partner choice model. The existence of a market of potential cooperators likely limits the ability of even formidable individuals to coerce others into cooperative relationships over the long run, given the effectiveness of alliances (e.g., Wrangham, 1999) and social exclusion (e.g., Aktipis, 2004; Debove, Baumard, &amp; André, 2015) in mitigating risks from exploitative individuals. Thismay explainwhymen appear to respond to apparently dangerous potential partners with aversion, rather than appeasement. However, future research should examine how individual differences (e.g., the perceiver's own formidability) and contextual variables (e.g., the cost of partner switching) moderate the effect of dangerousness on cooperative surplus divisions. In addition, it is possible that the use of target photographs in the controlled setting of the labmuted the effect of target dangerousness (and potentially other target traits), compared to what their effect would be in a spontaneous, face-to-face interaction. Testing the PC and AWA models against each other in more naturalistic settings may be a valuable avenue for future research. Importantly, we observed effects of partner choice heuristics above and beyond attractiveness halo effects, strategies to maximize earnings, and motivations to reciprocate the target's quality of treatment. In fact, participants appeared to implement costly partner choice heuristics: men offered less to targets who looked like they would demand more, thereby reducing the odds of their offer being accepted, and sensitivity to target traits was negatively correlated with participant earnings. While this behavior is “anomalous” with respect to maximizing earn- ings in the UG, it is sensible as an output of a mechanism designed by natural selection for an ecology inwhich the benefits of long-term coop- erative relationships may justify the costs incurred in establishing those relationships (see Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2011). Controlling for the target's expected generosity (i.e., controlling for reciprocity motivations) is a particularly strong test of the PC model, since the PCmodel actually predicts that individuals should bemore gen- erous toward partners whom they expect to be generous in turn (e.g., Barclay, 2013; Baumard et al., 2013). Our results (see Supplementary Online Materials; table S3, available on the journal's Web site at www. ehbonline.org) show that, on top of being generous toward apparently generous partners, people have additional strong preferences for partners who appear to have other components of long-term cooperative value (e.g., those who appear healthy, productive and high in social status). The strong effect of ratings of ancestral productivity is an important ad- dition to the partner choice literature. Previous modeling (e.g., Aktipis, 2004; Fu et al., 2008) and empirical (e.g., Delton &amp; Robertson, 2012) re- search has focused on dispositional cooperativeness as the criterion by which partners are chosen or rejected. While individuals should certainly prefer partners who are cooperative, generous and value them highly, our results show that men also prefer partners who have above-average resourceproduction capabilities. This is consistentwithpartner choice the- ory (Barclay, 2013; Debove et al., under review) and research in other spe- cies on partner choice for competence (Melis, Hare, &amp; Tomasello, 2006; 434 A.B. Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439Vail, Manica, &amp; Bshary, 2014; von Bayern, Clayton, &amp; Emery, 2011). More- over, the fact that contemporary economic decisions were strongly pre- dicted by ratings of productivity in a hunter–gatherer-like environment (which appear irrelevant or even bizarre in a modern context) suggests that humans implement a psychology of partner choice that was designed bynatural selection for anancestral environment. Thepositive effect of tar- get productivity on generosity above and beyond the effect of expected target generosity (see Supplementary OnlineMaterials; table S3, available on the journal's Web site at www.ehbonline.org), and the robustness of the effect of productivity in comparison to prosociality (see Section 2.3.3), raises the possibility that menmight be willing to trade off generosity in a partner in favor of productivity; future research will be necessary to iden- tify theprecise parameters of that tradeoff (seeDebove et al., under review for modeling results to a similar effect). 3. Study 2 3.1. Introduction Study2wasdesigned to testwhetherwomenwould also offer better treatment to same-sex UG partners who possessed indicators of high partner value. We expected replication of the study 1 findings of better treatment of partners who appeared healthier andmore prosocial, since these traits should have predicted larger streams of benefits for women's cooperative partners in ancestral environments.Wemeasured strength in women but did not expect to replicate its positive effect on UG treatment inmen; since women have historically been less involved in large game hunting and coalitional violence (e.g., Marlowe, 2007; Wrangham, 1999), for which strength is beneficial (Apicella, 2014; von Rueden et al., 2008), women's perceived partner value may be less related to this variable. Relatedly,we expected that the effect of pro- ductivitymight be reduced inwomen compared tomen, since gathering has lower variance of outcomes than hunting does (Kaplan &amp; Hill, 1985), female foraging parties tend to be larger than optimal with re- spect to food production (Marlowe, 2010), and female same-sex rela- tionships tend to be less task-oriented than male same-sex relationships (Bakan, 1966; see Benenson et al., 2009 for discussion), all of which suggest that womenmay have facedweaker selection pres- sures than men for choosing partners on the basis of their ability to col- laboratively create food resources. Perceived dangerousness was tested in order to evaluate whether the AWA model might account for women's behavior with same-sex partners; we predicted that it would not. Ratings of target face attractiveness were collected, allowing tests of partial effects of other variables when controlling for attractiveness, as well as allowing us to test whether more attractive individuals are treated better in the UG. To further extend the PCmodel, we identified social status as anoth- er potential component of partner value, since individuals who are high in social status may be able to provide greater benefits to their partners by virtue of their social influence, and high social status may indicate high quality and quantity of outside options for cooperation. We there- fore had the female target faces used in study 2 rated for social status as well, and predicted that social status would positively predict the qual- ity of treatment received in the UG. 3.2. Materials and methods 3.2.1. Design The design of study 2 was largely the same as the design of study 1a (see Section 1.2.1); female participants played one-shot UGs with a se- ries of target partners represented by face photographs that had been measured and rated on various dimensions. The only difference from study 1a is that not all of the targets used as UG partners in study 2 had previously played the UG. Some of the targets had previously played a hypothetical, one-shot UG with a partner with whom they had recently had a conversation; other targets had never played theUG. Participants in study 2 were told truthfully that some of the targets theywould playwith had previously played theUG, but that theywould be unable to tell which targets had or had not played the UG.When par- ticipants returned for session 2, they rolled a die. If they rolled a 6, one of their decisions was matched with the corresponding decision from a target who had previously played the UG, and they were paid their game earnings in cash. Therefore all participant decisions were incentive-compatible, and no deception was used. 3.2.2. Female target stimuli Facial photographs of 100 female students thatwere collected in two unrelated studies were used as targets, i.e., to represent UG partners to the participants in study 2. They ranged in age from 18 to 23 years (mean = 18.6, s.d. = 0.96). Forty-two self-identified as Caucasian, 2 as African-American, 22 as Asian, 24 as Hispanic, and the rest as multi- racial or “Other.” All gave permission for their photographs to be used for research purposes. Photographs were taken and processed in the same way as in study 1a. Strength was computed as the composite of hand grip and chest strength as measured by a dynamometer (bicep circumference was not available for all targets). 3.2.3. Raters A pool of 105 students (66 female) rated the female targets on attractiveness (3 items; alpha = .979), health, prosociality (3 items; alpha = .893), dangerousness (3 items; alpha = .920), productivity (3 items; alpha = .868), and social status (7 items; alpha = .937). These same students also estimated the offer and demand that each tar- get would make if the target were playing the UG. Each rater was ran- domly assigned to rate or estimate 5-6 items, and ratings on specific items continued until intra-class correlations for all rated items were at least .7. Due to experimenter error, we did not record the ages of these raters, but they were drawn from the same subject pool as the raters used for studies 1a and 1b. Ratings of attractiveness were made only by male raters, but other items were rated by both men and women. Items were presented in a random order, and target faces were randomized within items. Full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in Appendix A. 3.2.4. Ultimatum game participants Seventy-four women played the UG with the female targets as part- ners. Seven women showed no variance in their generosity index (generosity = offer–demand), likely indicating disengagement from the task, so analysis was restricted to the other 67 participants (but re- sults were very similar when all participants were included). Due to ex- perimenter error, we did not record the ages of these participants, but theywere drawn from the same subject pool as the raters used for stud- ies 1a and 1b. 3.2.5. Data analysis We used a data analysis strategy similar to that of study 1b (see Section 2.2.3) to evaluate the PC hypothesis, control for alternative ex- planations, and evaluate the effect of partner choice heuristics on UG earnings. First, we tested the zero-order effects of ratings of strength, at- tractiveness, health, prosociality, productivity, dangerousness and social status on treatment received in the UG. We next computed a series of partial correlations in order to control for various alternative explanations. First, in order to control for the ef- fect of attractiveness, we computed partial correlations, controlling for attractiveness, between UG decisions and the remaining target traits. Next, in order to control for the effect of participants' income- maximization strategies, we computed the effects of target traits on mean offers received, controlling for the targets' mean expected de- mands. Third, in order to control for participants' motivation to recipro- cate the quality of treatment the target is expected to provide, we 435A.B. Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439computed partial correlations between UG treatment received and tar- get traits, controlling for the targets' expected decisions. Finally, in order tomeasure the effect of partner choice heuristics on earnings in the UG, we calculated the correlations between participant earnings and sensitivity to each of the target traits tested in study 2 (see Section 2.2.3). 3.3. Study 2: Results Table 3 presents the correlations between all of the measured and rated traits in study 2. Of note, dangerousness and strengthwere uncorre- lated with productivity in the female targets, in contrast to the male tar- gets forwhich productivitywas predicted by these variables (see Table 1). There was a significant positive correlation between themean offers and demands received by targets, r(100) = .20, p = .05. This indicates that women deployed their offers and demands in conflict with each other, such that targets who received higher offers also received higher demands. The generosity index used in study 1would therefore obscure effects on both offers and demands, so offers and demands were ana- lyzed separately. 3.3.1. Zero-order correlations between target traits and UG treatment Table 4 presents the zero-order correlations between target traits and mean offers and demands received. Targets who appeared healthier, more attractive, more prosocial, more productive and higher in social sta- tus all received significantly higher offers, although effect sizes were gen- erally smaller than for men. As expected, strength was uncorrelated with offers received, and dangerousness was marginally, negatively correlated with the size of offers. These patterns appear to support the PC model over the AWA model. When productivity and prosociality were entered into the same regression model predicting mean offers received, prosociality had a significant positive effect, β = .26, t(96) = 2.61, p = .010, while productivity did not, β= .15, t(96) = 1.47, p= .15. This sug- gests that women prioritize prosociality over productivity in a partner, which stands in contrast to the results in men (see Section 2.3.3). For mean demands received (right side of Table 4), however, traits indicative of high partner value actually predicted worse treatment in the game. Targets who appeared healthier, more attractive, and higher in social status received higher demands for their offers to be accepted. Unlike offers received, prosociality and productivity did not predict de- mands received. 3.3.2. Effects on earnings and controlling for alternative explanations Controlling for attractiveness substantially reduced the effects of other target traits on offers and demands received, but social status, prosociality and dangerousness retained at least marginally significant partial correlations with offers received (see SOM, Table S5). There were significant positive correlations between mean offers received by targets and the mean offers they were expected to make, and between the mean demands received by targets and the mean demands they were expected to make (both correlations: r(100) = .37, p b .001). However, ratings of health, social status and attractiveness hadTable 3 Intercorrelations among strength and the rated traits in study 2. Trait 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 1. Strength 2. Health −0.23⁎ 3.

There was a significant positive correlation between the mean demands ex- pected from targets and the mean offers they received, r(100) = .22, p = .028, which is consistent with an income-maximizing strategy, but therewere significant effects of health, prosociality, social status, at- tractiveness, and dangerousness, on offers, controlling for expected de- mands (see SOM, Table S6). Therewere no effects of sensitivity to target traits on participant UG earnings (see SOM, Table S8). These results in- dicate that the observed relationships between target traits and behav- ior in the UG cannot be fully accounted for by attractiveness halo effects, reciprocity motivations, or income maximizing strategies. See Supple- mentary Online Materials (available on the journal's Web site at www.ehbonline.org) for further details.3.4. Study 2: Discussion As expected, female participantsmade higher offers in the UG to tar- gets who appeared healthier, more attractive, more productive, more prosocial and higher in social status. This suggests that women also interpreted the UG as an opportunity to establish a long-term coopera- tive relationship, and therefore offered to divide the surplus based on partner value. However, participants also made higher demands to tar- getswho appeared healthier, more attractive and higher in social status. There are several possible explanations for this inconsistency. Women may implement partner choice heuristics, but may also be more de- manding of attractive mating rivals (contrast Table 4 with Table S5). Women face a tradeoff between forming cooperative same-sex relation- ships and competing with same-sex rivals (see Benenson et al., 2009), and intrasexual competition may be manifested in the UG (Lucas &amp; Koff, 2013; Lucas, Koff, &amp; Skeath, 2007). Alternatively, women may make high offers to apparently-valuable partners to attract them for a cooperative relationship, but then make high demands to those same partners to ensure that they will reciprocate that generosity. This view may be supported by our finding that women prioritize prosociality over productivity in a partner (Section 3.3.1), and research suggesting that equality is emphasized more in female relationships, relative to male relationships (see Benenson, 2013). Future research should disen- tangle these issues. Importantly, the effects of partner choice criteria are robust to con- trolling for income-maximization strategies and reciprocity motiva- tions. While social status, prosociality and dangerousness retained effects on offers after controlling for target attractiveness, controlling for attractiveness substantially reduced the effects of these and all of the other traits. This may represent more than just an attractiveness halo effect; women in ancestral environments likely derived substantial social influence from their attractiveness (see Sell et al., 2009), so attrac- tivenessmay have been an important cue of women's abilities to gener- ate benefits for social partners.Table 4 Zero-order correlations between female target traits and mean offers and demands re- ceived (study 2).

Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439As expected, there was no effect of targets' strength on offers or de- mands received, and the effect of perceived productivity on UG treat- ment was weaker than among men. 4. Sex differences Fig. 2 compares the zero-order effects of strength, health, attractive- ness, prosociality, productivity, dangerousness, social status and esti- mated UG behavior on offers received in men and women. There are statistically significant sex differences in the effects of target strength, attractiveness, dangerousness and expected demands. Descriptively, in all cases the effect size is larger amongmen than amongwomen.We en- tered all of the variables in Fig. 2 into multiple regressions predicting mean offers separately for men and women. The overall R2 for men was .69 and the overall R2 for women was .30; using Fisher's r-to-z transformation, this is a significant difference in total variance predict- ed, z=3.84, p b .001, suggesting that womenwere significantly less in- fluenced overall by cues of partner value than men were. 5. General discussion We found that participants' offers and demands in the ultimatum game were related to facial cues of their partner's value as a long-term cooperative partner. Menweremore generous to targets who appeared more attractive, prosocial, productive, dominant, healthier, stronger, higher in social status and more desirable as a friend. Women made higher offers and higher demands to targets who appeared healthier, more attractive, and higher in social status; higher offers to targets who appeared more prosocial and productive; and lower offers to tar- gets who appeared more dangerous. Most of the effects of perceived partner traits cannot be explained by attractiveness halo effects, income maximizing strategies, or reciprocity motivations. These findings repre- sent the most direct empirical evidence to date of a human psychology of cooperative surplus division based on partner choice criteria, and they suggest a new interpretation of the UG as an opportunity for over- tures to potential cooperative partners. Our results suggest that behavior in the ultimatum game is generat- ed by psychological mechanisms specialized for long-term social ex- change relationships (see Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2005), and therefore that effects of partner traits that are outside of the structure of the game may be central to understanding the UG. Since humans likely evolved in social environments characterized by highly-valuable long- term cooperative relationships (see Delton et al., 2011), a one-shot UG may be interpreted as though it were an opening bid for an ongoing co- operative relationship within a biological market of cooperators (Barclay, 2013; Noë &amp; Hammerstein, 1994, 1995). Therefore, offers and demands in the UG are generated by an evolved heuristic for-0.5 -0.3 -0.1 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 E ff ec t S zi e (r ) Zero-Order Effects on Proposals in Men and Women Women Men * * * *** Fig. 2.

Significant sex differences are indicated, *p b .05, ***p b .001.partner choice that implements a rule like “be more generous to more valuable long-term cooperative partners.” Partner choice theory sug- gests that a potential partner's “market value” as a long-termcooperator is a function of their ability to create future benefits, their expected gen- erosity in sharing those benefits, and their outside options for produc- tion (Barclay, 2013; Baumard et al., 2013; Zaatari &amp; Trivers, 2007); consistent with this, we observed that traits such as apparent health, productivity, prosociality, and social status had important effects on of- fers and demands in the UG. These data illustrate the close link between cooperation and selec- tivity regarding cooperative partners (e.g., McNamara, Barta, Fromhage, &amp; Houston, 2008). The human psychology of partner choice appears de- signed to target valuable partners for relationship initiation and estab- lish acceptable “terms of trade” with new partners, rather than establish the greatest possible number of new cooperative relationships (whichwouldmanifest as indiscriminate hypergenerosity in theUG). In addition, the system is not designed to establish a relationship at any cost, even with apparently valuable partners, because individuals who accepted worse terms of trade than they could receive from either the same or other partners would likely have faced adverse selection pres- sures (Trivers, 1971). While this may not maximize the number of ac- cepted offers in the UG, a heuristic that prioritizes the quality rather than the quantity of cooperative relationships appears well-adapted to an ecology in which potential partners vary in value (e.g., Apicella, 2014; Debove et al., under review), and an individual can only have a limited number of social exchange relationships due to time constraints and the finite nature of social closeness and caring (e.g., DeScioli &amp; Kurzban, 2009; Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996). Our results suggest that the human psychology of partner choice is specialized to an ancestral ecology. Men, but not women, were more generous toward physically stronger partners. This effect was driven by perceptions that strongermenwould bemore productive in an envi- ronment similar to that inwhich our species evolved, but not by percep- tions of dangerousness, suggesting that the psychological mechanisms involved are designed to establish cooperative relationships with stron- ger men rather than merely to avoid violent retribution. In a modern context, this sex difference is senseless: for the types of cooperation that our participants typically engage in (e.g., group assignments for a class), physical strength is equally useless for men and women. Howev- er, men likely faced much stronger selection pressures from coalitional violence and large-game hunting (e.g., Marlowe, 2007; Wrangham, 1999), domains in which physical strength does predict productivity (Apicella, 2014; von Rueden et al., 2008). The effect of strength on men's bargaining psychology is typically framed in terms of the AWA (e.g., Petersen et al., 2013; Sell et al., 2009); however, awidespreadpref- erence for physically strong men as productive partners provides an al- ternative account for why strong men may receive more generous divisions of cooperative surpluses (cf. Debove et al., 2015; see also Lukaszewski, Simmons, Anderson, &amp; Roney, 2016). Additional sex differences suggest that the partner choice interpreta- tion of UG behavior was more strongly supported for men than for women. Men were more sensitive to target traits overall, and only men reduced their earnings by calibrating their decisions to target traits. Women appeared to follow the income-maximizing strategybymatching their offers to the targets' expected demands, while men made lower of- fers to targets with higher expected demands. These results suggest that men, but not women, are willing to incur immediate costs in order to co- operate selectively with partners who display cues of long-term partner value. Women, unlike men, both offered more to and demanded more from seemingly high value partners, suggesting that women's UG behav- ior may have involved an element of competitionwith same-sex rivals or a greater insistence on reciprocity from cooperative partners (Section 3.4). Overall, these sex differences are consistent with evidence suggesting that men are more willing than women to tolerate costs in a relationship in order to maintain access to cooperative partners who can generate future benefits, likely due to selection pressures from 437A.B. Eisenbruch et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 37 (2016) 429–439coalitional violence and large game hunting (Balliet, Li, Macfarlan, &amp; Van Vugt, 2011; Benenson et al., 2009; Vigil, 2007). Alternative explanations for the observed sex differences include the possibility that we did not measure the target traits that are most im- portant in female partner choice, or thatmale faces triggermore power- ful behavioral inferences than do female faces. An additional limitation of thepresent research is that trait inferences from faces are confounded with each other. Alternativemethods of representing targetswill be im- portant for testing the individual effects of traits and their prioritization in computations of partner value. For instance, the reported effect of so- cial status is ambiguous. It is possible that apparently high status targets receive more generous treatment because they are capable of providing additional benefits to partners via social influence, or because they are assumed to have greater outside options. We expect that the human psychology of partner choice will be an ex- citing area of research in the near future. The heuristic we suggest above (“be more generous to more valuable long-term cooperative partners”) is flexible enough to be adaptively implemented in a variety of social and economic contexts. For example, the behaviors that are considered gener- ous, and the cues that contribute to the estimationof partner value,maybe different for different ecologies and types of cooperation. In addition, pa- rameters such as the costs of searching for new partners should calibrate the prioritization of partner choice strategies relative to other behavioral strategies, such as partner control (Barclay &amp; Raihani, 2016; Schino &amp; Aureli, 2016). It will be important for researchers to systematically map the partner choice psychologies of men and women, including individual and contextual variation in partner choice criteria, effects of different infor- mation modalities (e.g., visual information vs. direct experience with a partner vs. communicated information on a partner), and behaviors and judgments in a variety of tasks (e.g., see McCabe, Smith, &amp; LePore, 2000 for possible limitations of the strategy method in economic games). Finally, our data suggest a novel explanation for the advantageous treatment that attractive individuals typically receive in economic set- tings. A proposed explanation for the “beauty premium” is that it is pri- marily the result of men attempting to court or maintain access to attractive women (reviewed by Maestripieri et al., in press). This cannot account for the strong effects of attractiveness thatweobserved, however, given that we conducted the UG exclusively with same-sex partners. We suggest that attractive individuals may be preferred as cooperative part- ners because many of the traits that made individuals desirable as mates alsomade them desirable as cooperators within ancestral environ- ments (for example, apparent health, prosociality and competence), and so attractiveness may serve as a summary judgment of partner value. While this explanation is not mutually exclusive with the courtship- based explanation, it may spur new thinking and research on the topic. 5.1. Conclusion Our findings provide direct empirical evidence that people divide the surpluses of cooperation based on estimates of long-term partner value, and that judgments of partner value incorporate the ability to cre- ate benefits, not merely dispositional cooperativeness or generosity. This psychology of surplus division based on partner choice criteria ap- pears to be specialized for ancestral ecologies, and is likely to be distinct from heuristics that have evolved for dividing fixed resources (Petersen et al., 2013) or for choosing partners for risk-pooling relationships (Delton &amp; Robertson, 2012). Finally, our results suggest that non- income-maximizing behavior in the UG may not be “anomalous” at all (Thaler, 1988), but may instead be an output of adaptations for long- term cooperative relationships (see Barclay, 2013; Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2005; Kenrick et al., 2009).
