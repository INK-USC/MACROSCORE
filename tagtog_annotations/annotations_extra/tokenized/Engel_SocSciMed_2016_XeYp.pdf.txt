However , limited research in this area still exists and the relationship has remained unexplored in the area of Metro Vancouver , Canada .
This study examined the association between the built environment and social cohesion with QoL of 160 community-dwelling older adults ( aged 65 years ) on low income fromMetro Vancouver .
Cross-sectional data acquired from the Walk the Talk ( WTT ) study were used .
Health-related QoL ( HRQoL ) and capability wellbeing were assessed using the EQ-5D-5L and the ICECAP-O , respectively .
Measures of the environment comprised the NEWS-A ( perceived built environment measure ) , the Street Smart Walk Score ( objective built environment measure ) , and the SC-5PT ( a measure of social cohesion ) .
The primary analysis consists of Tobit regression models to explore the associations between environmental features and HRQoL as well as capability wellbeing .
Key findings indicate that after adjusting for covariates , older adults ' capability wellbeing was associated with street connectivity and social cohesion , while no statistically significant associations were found between environmental factors and HRQoL .
Our results should be considered as hypothesis-generating and need confirmation in a larger longitudinal study .

Introduction Associations between environmental conditions , health-related behaviours , and health outcomes are long recognized in theory ( Cunningham and Michael , 2004 ; Lawton , 1977 ; Owen et al. , 2000 ; Wilson and Clearly , 1995 ) , and supported by empirical evidence in areas such as obesity ( Booth et al. , 2001 ) , physical activity ( Humpel et al. , 2002 ) , and chronic diseases ( Freedman et al. , 2011 ) .
Charac- teristics of the environment are , generally , broken down into twoimon Fraser University , 8888components : social and physical characteristics .
The latter refers to the natural environment ( e.g. , plants , water , earth , air quality , climate ) and the built environment .
Features of the built environ- ment comprise the urban design ( the design of the city and the elements within it ) , land-use ( the distribution of activities across space ) , and the transportation system ( including the physical infrastructure of roads , sidewalks , bike paths , railroad tracks , bridges and services provided ) ( Handy et al. , 2002 ) .
The social environment , on the other hand , encompasses interpersonal re- lationships ( e.g. , social support and social networks ) , social in- equalities ( e.g. , socioeconomic position and income inequality , racial discrimination ) , and neighbourhood and community charac- teristics ( e.g. , social cohesion and social capital , neighbourhood factors ) ( Mcneill et al. , 2006a ) .
It comprises broader factors that L. Engel et al .
/ Social Science & Medicine 164 ( 2016 ) 1e112could affect large groups or entire communities such as culture , norms , indicators of social disorder , as well as place attachment that can be understood as a sense of belonging to the neighbour- hood ( Barnett and Casper , 2001 ; Rowles , 1983 ; Sallis , 2009 ) .
The built environment and social environment are of particular importance for older adults .
The extent to which older adults engage with their environments is different compared with most other people , mainly because as individuals age , their environ- ment tends to shrink to the locale of their home or immediate neighbourhood ( King , 2008 ) .
The environmental press theory by Lawton suggests that the environment places a certain degree of ‘ press ’ or stress on individuals ( Lawton , 1977 ) .
How well in- dividuals function in their environment is a reflection of the de- gree to which individuals ' competence meets the press imposed by the environment ( Lawton , 1977 ) .
As physical health declines , older adults are less able to function within their surroundings and , therefore , are more vulnerable to the forces within their environment ( Noreau and Boschen , 2010 ) .
Environmental chal- lenges include , for example , uneven sidewalks , high curbs , increased traffic , or short timing for crosswalks .
A combination of physical impairments and lower neighbourhood walkability pre- sents challenges to moving about , which may lead to loss of in- dependence , social isolation , and the inability to remain in a familiar social environment ( Hanson et al. , 2013 ) .
Social isolation , in turn , can lead to depression and other adverse mental health outcomes ( Rosso et al. , 2011 ) .
The relationship between ageing , chronic diseases and physical inactivity is well established in the literature ( Garin et al. , 2014 ; Levasseur et al. , 2015 ; Liu-Ambrose et al. , 2010 ) .
Treating diseases related to physical inactivity come at a price .
Around $ 2.1 billion , or 2.5 % of the total direct health care costs in Canada , were attributable to physical inactivity in 1999 ( Katzmarzyk et al. , 2000 ) .
As the proportion of older adults in society continues to rise , the attendant increases in public spending on social and health care services are seen as a threat to worldwide economic stability in the 21st Century ( Prince et al. , 2015 ) .
Chronic diseases and disabilities can be prevented or delayed and physical activity can be increased by public health interventions , such as urban planning .
As shown in previous studies , a supportive environment with fewer barriers can pro- mote physical activity ( Morris et al. , 2008 ) as well as social interaction ( Day , 2008 ) , and is associated with better perceived quality of life ( QoL ) ( Rantakokko et al. , 2010 ) .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) defined QoL as a ‘ broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person 's physical health , psychological state , level of independence , social relation- ships , personal beliefs and their relationship to salient features of their environment ’ ( World Health Organization , 1997 ) .
Occasion- ally , QoL is equated with the concepts of life satisfaction or sub- jective wellbeing , and often an explicit reference to health is made ( e.g. , health-related QoL [ HRQoL ] ) to narrow the focus to the effects of health , illness , and treatment on QoL .
Although previous con- ceptual frameworks have emphasized the importance of environ- mental characteristics on QoL ( Ferrans et al. , 2005 ; Wilson and Clearly , 1995 ; World Health Organization , 2002 ) , a recent review has identified only ten studies that explored this association in an older adult population ( Garin et al. , 2014 ) .
These studies , published after 2005 , were predominantly from Europe , used a cross- sectional design ( two were longitudinal studies ) , and included a mix of objective and self-rated built environment measures .
It was shown that accessibility , residential satisfaction , home size , hous- ing type , heavy traffic , higher usability , exterior environment , interior environment , street noise , and safety from traffic were associated with QoL , wellbeing , life satisfaction or successful aging ( Garin et al. , 2014 ) .
However , the authors stress the difficulty to hypothesize on the nature of the relationship due to the different use of environmental variables that may have resulted in conflict- ing findings .
With regard to the social environment , social cohesion has the potential to influence older adults ' QoL .
Social cohesion can be understood as the extent of connectedness and solidarity among groups in society ( Kawachi and Berkman , 2000 ) .
Previous literature indicated that neighbourhood cohesion was predictive of good health , wellbeing and QoL ( Elliott et al. , 2014 ; Friedman et al. , 2012 ; Gale et al. , 2011 ) .
Limited research in this area exists and the association be- tween the built environment and social cohesion with older adults ' QoL has never been explored within the region of Metro Vancouver , Canada e a city with some unique characteristics within which these relationships need to be explored further .
Compared with most other North American regions , Metro Van- couver tends to have a much smaller land base , a higher popula- tion density , and the residents are relatively healthy and physically active ( Frank et al. , 2009 ) .
Like many other cities , Metro Vancouver is facing a major demographic shift and by 2036 the 65 þ population is expected to more than double ( United Way of the Lower Mainland , 2011 ) .
A recent report looking at how to better serve and support the region 's aging population recom- mended investigation of the travel patterns of older adults and the connection of the built environment to various health outcomes ( UnitedWay of the Lower Mainland , 2011 ) .
While previous studies have examined the relation between the built environment and travel behaviour , as well as physical activity within Metro Van- couver ( Chudyk et al. , 2014 ; Winters et al. , 2015 ) , the link between the built environment and social cohesion with health outcomes ( including QoL ) still remains to be explored .
In addition , 12 % of Canadian older adults are of low economic status based on Sta- tistics Canada 's low income cut-off measure ( The Conference Board of Canada , 2013 ) .
The relationship between environ- mental characteristics and QoL is expected to be different for this study population .
Older adults on low income may rely more on their local neighbourhood and amenities that are reachable by walking , as owning a car or taking public transportation may be unaffordable for them .
Because of these unique mobility-related needs and characteristics , this population group requires further consideration .
The objective of this study is to explore the asso- ciation between the built environment and social cohesion with QoL of low income , community-dwelling older adults ( aged 65 years ) living in Metro Vancouver .

Methods 2.1 .
Data source The data used for this secondary analysis are from the ‘ Walk the Talk ( WTT ) : Transforming the Built Environment to Enhance Mobility in Seniors ’ project .
Detailed information on study design and methods have been published elsewhere ( Chudyk et al. , 2014 ) .
Briefly , this cross-sectional study consists of qualitative and quantitative components that investigate the impact of the built environment on the mobility and health of older adults living on low income .
Study participants were older adults that were in receipt of a Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters ( SAFER ) rental subsidy from BC Housing ( BC Housing , n.d. ) .
The rental subsidy is available to British Columbia residents aged 60 years who pay more than 30 % of their gross monthly household income towards the rent of their residence .
This , however , does not imply that SAFER recipients necessarily reside in low income L. Engel et al .
/ Social Science & Medicine 164 ( 2016 ) 1e11 3neighbourhoods .
Individuals were eligible if ( i ) they were current SAFER recipients aged 65 years ( according to WHO 's definition of an older or elderly person ( World Health Organization ) ) , ( ii ) resided in one of eight select cities within Metro Vancouver , ( iii ) self-reported that they were able to participate in a mobility assessment that involved a 4-m walk , ( iv ) were able to walk 10 m with or without mobility aid , ( v ) had left their home to go into the community at least once in a typical week , ( vi ) had not been diagnosed with dementia , and ( vii ) spoke and under- stood the English language .
In total , <SS> 5806 </SS> households in eight select cities within Metro Vancouver were sampled using a stratified design .
Following this , <SS> 200 </SS> households were randomly selected from within each decile of Walk Score® ( n ¼ 2000 ) to ensure diversity across the built environment .
<SS> Five </SS> households were excluded because they were contacted prior for participa- tion in the pilot study .
Out of 1995 mailed invitations , <SS> 161 </SS> par- ticipants agreed to participate in the WTT study .
Participants took part in a two-hour measurement session where they completed questionnaires about their neighbourhood built environment , social cohesion , health ( including QoL ) and phys- ical activity , and underwent performance-based measures of cognition and lower-extremity function.2.2 .
Outcome variables Assessment of QoL was achieved by administering two mea- sures , the EQ-5D-5L and the ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people ( ICECAP-O ) .
The EQ-5D-5L was developed by the EuroQol group ( Szende et al. , 2007 ) and consists of 5 dimensions ( mobility , self-care , usual activities , pain/discomfort , and anxiety/depres- sion ; one question per dimension ) .
Responses to the 5 questions yield a single summary score , ranging from zero ( equivalent to being dead ) to 1 ( full health ) .
Scores below zero are permissible , indicating health states worse than being dead .
While the EQ-5D- 5L is considered a measure of an individual 's HRQoL , previous research indicated that within the context of older adults , the assessment of QoL should include factors other than health ( Netuveli and Blane , 2008 ) .
In recent years , a new measure has been developed , the ICECAP-O ( Coast et al. , 2008a ) .
It covers five attributes e attachment , security , role , enjoyment , and control e with scores ranging from zero ( no capability ) to 1 ( full capability ) .
The ICECAP-O is based on Amartya Sen 's capability approach ( Sen , 1993 ) , which distinguishes between capabilities ( referring to a person 's opportunities to achieve wellbeing ) and achieved func- tionings ( that represent the actual outcomes realized by in- dividuals considering their capabilities , preferences , and social situation ) ( Bleichrodt and Quiggin , 2013 ) .
It accounts for the fact that a person 's capabilities ( what a person can do ) may differ from their functionings ( what a person actually does ) ( Al-Janabi et al. , 2012 ) .
The ICECAP-O is considered to go beyond health-related aspects of QoL and into a broader measure of a person 's capa- bility wellbeing , and was specifically designed for older adults ( Grewal et al. , 2006 ) .
The UK tariff was used to calculate the ICECAP-O index scores ( Coast et al. , 2008a ) , as no value set is available yet for the Canadian population .
To ensure comparability , we also used scores for the EQ-5D-5L that reflect the values of the UK population ( Van Hout et al. , 2012 ) .
The EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O were included in this study because previous work has indicated that these measures are complements ( rather than substitutes ) in regard to providing information about a person 's QoL ( Davis et al. , 2013 ) .
The psychometric properties of the EQ-5D-5L are well established across many countries and population groups ( Alvarado-Bolanos et al. , 2015 ; Feng et al. , 2015 ; Golicki et al. , 2015 ; Herdman et al. , 2011 ) .
Also the ICECAP-O has been validated in a number of studies ( in the UK ( Coast et al. , 2008b ) , Germany ( Makai et al. , 2014 ) , Australia ( Couzner et al. , 2013 ) and the Netherlands ( Makai et al. , 2013 ) ) and has consistently been found to be a valid instrument to measure capability wellbeing .
2.3 .
Explanatory variables The perceived built environment was measured using the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale e Abbreviated ( NEWS-A ) ( Cerin et al. , 2006 ) .
This instrument contains twelve subscales ( A-L ) and describes individuals ' perceptions of their neighbourhood built environment features ( for reference , labels A-L are used later in the paper ) .
Subscales are scored such that higher scores indicate higher walkability , except for subscale G , H , K , and L where higher scores indicate lower walkability .
Scores for ten subscales range from 1 to 4 , while subscale A is anchored on a 173e865 scale and subscale B on a 1e5 scale .
For the WTT study , the NEWS-A was modified ( items were dropped or added ) in order to make it more suitable for older adults .
As a result of these changes , subscale E ( infrastructure and safety ) could not be calculated for this dataset because of a dropped item .
Items that were added to the NEWS-A were not used in this study .
The validity of the NEWS-A was previously established in older adults residing in the United States ( Starnes et al. , 2014 ) .
Next , the perceived social cohesion was measured using Sampson 's 5-item measure of collective efficacy ( SC-5PT ) ( Sampson et al. , 1997 ) .
This measure asks respondents to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree ( on a 5-point scale ) that ‘ this is a close- knit neighbourhood ’ , ‘ people around here are willing to help ’ , ‘ people in this neighbourhood can be trusted ’ , ‘ people in this neighbourhood generally do not get along with other ’ , and ‘ people in this neighbourhood do not share the same values ’ .
After reversing the coding for the last two statements , items are averaged to reflect levels of perceived social cohesion ( average scores ranging from 1 to 5 , where higher scores indicate higher collective efficacy ) .
The SC-5PT showed being a reliable and valid measure in previous literature ( Lochner et al. , 1999 ; Sampson et al. , 1997 ) .
Finally , the Street Smart Walk Score® ( SSWS ) was used as an objective measure of the built environment .
Previous evidence has shown differences between objective and perceived measures of the environment ( Gebel et al. , 2011 ; Leslie et al. , 2005 ; Mcginn et al. , 2007 ) , which suggest that these measure- ment types are likely capturing different constructs and should both be considered ( Rosso et al. , 2011 ) .
The SSWS is based on the Walk Score® ( www.walkscore.com ) , which is a publicly available index that measures the walkability of an address based on distances to nearby destinations ( e.g. , grocery stores , restaurant , shops ) .
Road connectivity characteristics , such as intersection density and block length , are included in the score .
Walk Score® uses data from Google , Education.com , Open Street Map , the U.S. Census , Localeze , and places added by the Walk Score user community .
The SSWS uses an updated methodology that better reflects the pedestrian-walking experience ( Frank , 2013 ) , with scores ranging from zero to 100 , where higher scores denote higher walkability .
2.4 .
Covariates Previous literature has identified a number of covariates rele- vant for studying the relation of interest , including sociodemo- graphic characteristics , health status , personality traits , emotional stability , and social support ( Elliott et al. , 2014 ; Friedman et al. , L. Engel et al .
/ Social Science & Medicine 164 ( 2016 ) 1e1142012 ; Gale et al. , 2011 ) .
In our study , we included age , sex , living arrangements , physical function ( number of comorbidities and gait speed ) , and psychosocial measures ( loneliness and self-efficacy for walking ) as precision variables and potential confounders - although no distinction is being made between these two in the statistical model .
We used a self-report questionnaire to gather participants ' sociodemographic information .
Number of comor- bidities was measured with the Functional Comorbidity Index , a self-report measure of the presence of eighteen comorbid diseases ( Groll et al. , 2005 ) .
Gait speed ( usual pace ) was assessed as part of the 4-mwalk component of the Short Physical Performance Battery ( Guralnik et al. , 1994 ) .
Loneliness was measured with 11 items drawn from the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale ( R-UCLA ) ( Russell et al. , 1980 ) e a measure of social isolation , loneliness , and dissat- isfaction with one 's social interactions .
Finally , self-efficacy for walking was evaluated with the Ambulatory Self Confidence Questionnaire , which assesses perceived self-efficacy to walk in twenty-two different environment situations ( Asano et al. , 2007 ) .
2.5 .
Statistical analyses To examine the association between the built environment and social cohesion with QoL while adjusting for covariates , we used <TN> separate stepwise backward Tobit regression models </TN> for the EQ- 5D-5L and ICECAP-O index scores .
The <TN> Tobit model </TN> is the recom- mended model for QoL measures that are subject to upper censoring ( Austin et al. , 2000 ) .
All covariates ( sex , age , living arrangement , number of comorbidities , gait speed , loneliness , and self-efficacy for walking ) , NEWS-A subscales , SC-5PT , and SSWS were entered into the model .
Backward stepwise elimination was used to remove variables relating to the built environment and social cohesion ; a p-value of greater than <PV> 0.1 </PV> was the criterion for removal .
Covariates were not eligible for removal to explicitly control for them when exploring the associations .
To examine the associations with each environmental feature separately , while controlling for covariates , we fit another set of Tobit models for the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O index scores .
Prior to running the regres- sion models , missing value analysis was carried out to explore the patterns of missing data and to determine whether data were missing at random .
Missing data were imputed using <TN> multiple imputation by chained equations ( MICE ) </TN> and combined estimates and variances were obtained using Rubin 's rule ( Rubin , 2004 ) .
Backward stepwise regression analyses were also repeatedwithin a ‘ complete case ’ sample .
Descriptive statistics are presented asmean ( SD ) and number ( % ) .
All statistical tests performed were two-sided with <PV> p 0.05 </PV> considered to be statistically significant .
STATA version 10 ( Statacorp , 2007 ) was used for all analyses .
3 .
Results Characteristics of the study population are reported in Table 1 .
We included 160 individuals ( women n ¼ 102 ) aged 65 years .
Participants were mostly white , Canadian-born and lived alone .
Although this population is of low socioeconomic status as measured by household income , the percentage of those in- dividuals who completed some high school or less was only 12.5 % , i.e. , the majority was well educated .
Table 1 also presents the characteristics of the study population used for the complete case analysis when applying the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-A , which were similar to the overall sample .
Histograms of the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O index scores , pre- sented in Appendices 1 and 2 , demonstrate that both measures show a certain degree of ceiling effects ; such findings confirmedthe appropriateness of the <TN> Tobit model </TN> .
Based on the missing value analysis , one participant was excluded from further analyses due to language barriers that resulted in missing data .
The missing data analysis also showed a high degree of missing values ( 17 % ) for the NEWS-A subscale I ( parking ) .
Eighty-two percent of in- dividuals who did not respond to this question reported that they had no vehicle at their disposal in the past seven days .
This indicated that the subscale was not applicable for this study population and was dropped from further analyses .
Missing values for the remaining variables ranged from 0 to 5 % .
Each variable was imputed using a regression model conditional on all other vari- ables used for our analyses .
In total , 15 datasets were generated that reflected the percentage of missing values considering all variables ( 16 % overall ) and combined estimates and variances were calculated .
Descriptive statistics for selected instruments are reported in Table 2 .
Mean ( SD ) scores for the EQ-5D-5L and the ICECAP-O were 0.794 ( 0.15 ) and 0.843 ( 0.11 ) , respectively .
Figs .
1 and 2 show the percentage of responses at each level across all di- mensions for the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O .
None of the partici- pants reported the lowest level ( extreme problems ) on any of the EQ-5D-5L dimensions .
Furthermore , with the exception of the ‘ pain or discomfort ’ dimension , the majority of this study popu- lation reported ‘ no problems ’ on all EQ-5D-5L dimensions .
For the ICECAP-O , Fig .
2 indicates that this study population was very independent , with 62 % reporting the highest level ( i.e. , greatest capability ) .
Table 3 ( showing the results of the backward stepwise Tobit regression analysis ) and Table 4 ( showing the results examining each environmental feature separately ) indicate that no statisti- cally significant predictors were found for older adults ' HRQoL using the EQ-5D-5L .
However , when measuring QoL using the ICECAP-O , better social cohesion ( SC-5PT ) was associated with higher ICECAP-O index scores .
In addition , a negative association between NEWS-A subscale D ( street connectivity ) and ICECAP-O was found , i.e. , short distances between intersections and many alternative routes were associated with lower capability well- being .
Overall , associations were small ; an increase in street connectivity by one unit decreased ICECAP-O index scores by 0.028 ( 0.024 when built environment features were analysed separately ; Table 4 ) .
For social cohesion , a 0.029 ( 0.024 when analysed separately ) increase in ICECAP-O index scores was found when social cohesion was increased by one unit .
Results for the complete case analysis are provided in Appendix 3 .
After con- trolling for covariates , determinants of the EQ-5D-5L included land-use ( access ) , aesthetics , and cul-de-sacs , while aesthetics and social cohesion emerged as important predictors of the ICE- CAP-O.4 .
Discussion and conclusion This study contributes to a limited body of literature through exploration of the association between environmental features and older adults ' QoL in Metro Vancouver .
Our findings suggest that street connectivity and social cohesion were associated with older adults ' capability wellbeing .
When considering health-related as- pects of QoL only , the association between the built environment and social cohesion with older adults ' HRQoL were small and not statistically significant .
Throughout all analyses , social cohesion was associated with older adults ' capability wellbeing and seemed to play a bigger role than features of the built environment , where out of ten built environment features only street connectivity appeared as Table 1 Characteristics of the study population .

Similar results were found in the study by Friedman et al .
( 2012 ) , which examined the impact of three neighbourhood-level factors on QoL among older adults attending New York senior centres .
The authors found that social cohesion was a significant correlate of QoL ( as was safety ) , while walkability was not ( Friedman et al. , 2012 ) .
The qualitative component of theWTTstudy also provided evidence that social needs can often shape individuals ' behaviour regardless of whether they live in a highly walkable neighbourhood with amenities in close proximity ( Franke et al. , 2013 ) .
For example , in the qualitativeWTT study a participant reported that he prefers to use small alleyways rather than main streets because of the greater likelihood of meeting others ( Franke Table 3 Backward stepwise Tobit regression analysis a.

Further to this , others have shown that , for older adults , features of the built environment might be secondary to attributes of the social environment in promoting physical activity ( King , 2008 ) .
However , while the social environment , such as social cohesion , is particularly important within the context of older adults , it is important to understand that the social environment often involves interactions that take place within the built envi- ronment .
It is within the neighbourhood space where older adultshave opportunities to interact with others , access opportunities for socialization , and perform their activities of daily living .
The built environment can , therefore , be seen as a facilitator or barrier for the social environment .
In our study , only street connectivity emerged as an important built environment feature where greater street connectivity , defined as shorter distances between intersections and many alternative routes , was associated with lower capability wellbeing .
L. Engel et al .
/ Social Science & Medicine 164 ( 2016 ) 1e118Previous literature has shown that better street connectivity facil- itates walking in the neighbourhood ( Frank et al. , 2005 ; Handy et al. , 2002 ; Rosso et al. , 2011 ; Saelens et al. , 2003 ) and includes other benefits , such as shorter travel trips , increased travel by public transport , and more interactions among neighbourhood residents ( Turrell , 2010 ) .
Therefore , our finding of a negative as- sociation between street connectivity and ICECAP-O scores was unexpected .
These findings can possibly be explained within the context of older adults .
Although a more walkable neighbourhood supports walking , it may be also associated with more traffic ( Villanueva et al. , 2013 ) .
This exposure to traffic might be negatively associated with older adults ' QoL simply because potential re- ductions in vision , hearing and/or physical robustness could in- crease the risk of injury .
The proposition that lower QoL is attributable to higher exposure to traffic was not supported by other results in this study , where the ‘ traffic hazard ’ subscale of the NEWS-A ( which contains three items concerning the amount and speed of traffic in the neighbourhood ) was not significant .
Other literature links better street connectivity with traffic calming since a large number of intersecting streets tends to slow traffic ( Turrell , 2010 ) .
More important , however , is the perceived safety by older adults in relation to street connectivity ( Yen et al. , 2014 ) .
While subscale G ‘ traffic hazard ’ does not refer to safety , subscale E ‘ infrastructure and safety for walking ’ would have provided more insights .
Since this subscale could not be generated , additional as- sociations between QoL and the presence of sidewalks and pedestrian signals that help walkers to cross busy streets could not be explored in our study .
Our findings support previous suggestions that the impact of the built environment needs to be investigated across the life course , as certain relations will differ across age groups ( Villanueva et al. , 2013 ) .
This study also provides further evidence to suggest that subjective and objective measures of the built environment provide complementary information , as we found no associations between QoL and the SSWS but some asso- ciations with the NEWS-A subscales .
4.1 .
Strengths , limitations and directions for further research A major strength of the current study relates to the opportunity to explore social cohesion and built environment factors together when assessing the association with older adults ' QoL .
The appli- cation of a broad concept of QoL ( i.e. , HRQoL and capability well- being ) , allowed us to gain a better understanding of the associations with the built environment and social cohesion .
To our knowledge , only one study has explored this relation before using the EQ-5D-3L ( Ward Thompson et al. , 2014 ) .
Carried out between 2008 and 2010 in locations across England , Wales and Scotland with a longitudinal cohort of older adults aged 65 or older , Ward Thompson and colleagues found that a lack of barriers and perceived nuisances , good paths and cycle ways , and enjoyable routes to local open space were associated with higher EQ-5D-3L scores .
The ICECAP-O has never been applied in previous studies before that explored the association between environmental fea- tures and QoL and should be considered in future .
However , the extent to which the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O are comprehensive enough to measure QoL still requires further attention .
The EQ-5D- 5L and ICECAP-O have their roots in economics and were designed for use in health economic evaluation .
These ‘ preference-based ’ measures are different to more conventional QoL measures since they contain a ‘ descriptive ’ and a ‘ valuation ’ component .
In other words , they do not only measure QoL as perceived by the in- dividuals but also reflect the values of the general population .
Accordingly , the association between the built and social environ- ments and QoL examined in this study is also influenced by societal preferences , which reflect the views of the general population inthe UK .
Another strength of the study can be seen in the reduced likelihood of the occurrence of self-selection , a concept which can be understood as the tendency of people to choose locations based on their travel activities , needs and preferences ( Mokhtarian and Cao , 2008 ) .
There is evidence that individuals whose QoL is higher are likely to be more active and may have chosen to live in a more activity-friendly neighbourhood ( Sugiyama and Ward Thompson , 2007 ) .
Consequently , all features of the neighbour- hood that are potentially related to health and wellbeing may be determined by the characteristics of individuals who reside there .
In our study , we believe self-selection was less of an issue because of individuals ' enrolment in the SAFER rental subsidy program .
Compared with other individuals , this study population may have fewer opportunities to move to a different residence that better suits their current needs and preferences as a result of their low income .
This also implies that the generalizability of our findings to older adults of higher socioeconomic status needs to be made with care .
On the other hand , the characteristics of our study population are different compared with other older adults of low income .
Individuals of low income , generally , also attain lower levels of education ( i.e. , both are characteristics of a low socio- economic position ( Mcneill et al. , 2006a ) ) ; the majority ( 87.5 % ) of participants in our study obtained a high school diploma or any higher degrees .
Previous literature has highlighted that older adults living on a low income may be at an increased risk of morbidity and poor physical function ( Nilsson et al. , 2010 ) .
The number of self-reported comorbidities in our study population is similar to Canadian population norms of older adults ( Wister et al. , 2015 ) .
With respect to the QoL of our study sample , the index scores and distribution of responses across the dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O are similar to population norms available for older adults aged 65 and older in Canada , UK , and Australia ( Couzner et al. , 2013 ; Flynn et al. , 2011 ; Health Quality Council of Alberta , 2014 ) .
Collectively , results suggest that our study popu- lation is different compared with other older adults of low income .
Since our data do not provide information about a person 's so- cioeconomic history , low income could represent either a recent or a lifelong circumstance .
The primary limitations of our study are the small sample size , which may have resulted in the failure to detect associations , and the cross-sectional design , which makes the establishment of causal links methodologically difficult .
The lack of a priori infor- mation about which features of the environment may affect QoL , especially for the NEWS-A subscales , is a further limitation .
This led us to use a backward elimination procedure to reduce the number of variables in the final model .
Such automated selection pro- cedures are problematic as they may lead to bias in parameter es- timates , inconsistencies among model selection algorithms , the inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model , and an inherent problem of multiple hypothesis testing ( Whittingham et al. , 2006 ) .
Multiple hypothesis testing could lead to a Type 1 error , where certain associations may be foundwhen in reality such associations do not exist .
In particular , our results from the com- plete case analysis need to be interpreted with caution because significant predictors may have resulted by chance alone .
Another limitation of the analyses is that we did not take neighbourhood into account .
Individuals living in the same neighbourhood could have correlated observations , thus reducing the effective sample size ( Maas and Hox , 2005 ) .
Multilevel models that account for the fact that individuals are nested within neighbourhoods are needed in future research .
It should also be acknowledged that there is a potential risk that some variables that were considered as con- founders in our study have , in fact , mediated the relation between the built environment and social cohesion and QoL .
A previous Appendix 1 : Histogram of the EQ-5D-5L index scores .
L. Engel et al .
/ Social Science & Medicine 164 ( 2016 ) 1e11 9study provided evidence that self-efficacy , for example , mediated the relation between social and physical environments and physical activity ( Mcneill et al. , 2006b ) .
More longitudinal studies are necessary to understand the dynamic changes in QoL among older adults living across diverse built and social environments .
Other influencing factors , such as the immediate home environment or the natural environment , referring to green spaces ( e.g. , parks , gardens , and forests ) and blue spaces ( e.g. , ocean , lakes , and rivers ) that can provide older adults with opportunities to enhance social connections ( Finlay et al. , 2015 ) , require more attention in future studies .
Our study highlights the need to develop and test environ- mental interventions to support older adults who wish to age in place .
However , the environmental impact differs across life course .
In order to develop effective strategies and policies for all age groups , longitudinal studies of environmental interventions are needed .
Previous literature has indicated that people with lower socio-economic status ( measured by income and education ) , are more likely to perceive their neighbourhood as unattractive and unsafe ( Kamphuis et al. , 2010 ) , which requires special attention when looking at environmental change strategies .
Emotional wellbeing and QoL of older adults can be improved by designing neighbourhoods that promote mobility and social cohesion ; increased physical activity may in turn also reduce health resource utilization ( Liu-Ambrose et al. , 2010 ) .
It should be noted that social cohesion is only one aspect of the social environment and other characteristics of the social environment should be also taken into account , such as interpersonal relationships , social capital , or social inequalities .
In conclusion , our study found that street connectivity and so- cial cohesion might be important for older adults ' capability well- being .
The association between capability wellbeing and other NEWS-A subscales , as well as HRQoL and environmental factors could not be confirmed in our study and need to be examined in future studies .
Our findings should be interpreted with caution and be considered as hypothesis-generating .
Larger studies are required to explain the effect of the various features of the built and social environments on older adult 's QoL.Appendix 2 : Histogram of the ICECAP-O index scores.Acknowledgment : The Walk the Talk ( WTT ) study was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research ( CIHR ) Aging Emerging Team Grant ( grant # 108607 ) .Wewould like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments.Appendix 3 : Backward stepwise Tobit regression analysis ( complete case analysis ) a EQ-5D-5L ( n ¼ 137 ) b ( SE ) 95 % CI Constant 0.459 ( 0.225 ) ( 0.014 , 0.905 ) Covariates Sex ( 1 ¼ female ) 0.010 ( 0.028 ) ( 0.066 , 0.046 ) Age 0.003 ( 0.002 ) ( 0.001 , 0.007 ) Living with someone ( 1 ¼ yes ) 0.016 ( 0.032 ) ( 0.047 , 0.080 ) Functional Comorbidity Index 0.030 ( 0.006 ) ( 0.043 , 0.017 ) Loneliness 0.048 ( 0.029 ) ( 0.105 , 0.008 ) Gait Speed 0.021 ( 0.056 ) ( 0.133 , 0.090 ) Ambulatory 0.050 ( 0.009 ) ( 0.032 , 0.068 ) Perceived built environment ( NEWS-A ) A : Residential density e e B : Land-use mix ( diversity ) e e C : Land-use ( access ) 0.038 ( 0.017 ) ( 0.005 , 0.071 ) D : Street connectivity e e F : Aesthetics 0.043 ( 0.019 ) ( 0.081 , 0.006 ) AppendicesICECAP-O ( n ¼ 135 ) p b ( SE ) 95 % CI p 0.043 1.098 ( 0.133 ) ( 0.836 , 1.361 ) < 0.001 0.720 0.021 ( 0.017 ) ( 0.012 , 0.054 ) 0.210 0.195 0.002 ( 0.001 ) ( 0.004 , 0.001 ) 0.152 0.614 0.020 ( 0.019 ) ( 0.018 , 0057 ) 0.296 < 0.001 0.005 ( 0.004 ) ( 0.012 , 0.003 ) 0.225 0.094 0.139 ( 0.017 ) ( 0.174 , 0.105 ) < 0.001 0.705 0.039 ( 0.034 ) ( 0.027 , 0.106 ) 0.246 < 0.001 0.014 ( 0.006 ) ( 0.003 , 0.025 ) 0.011 - e e - - e e - 0.026 e e - - e e - 0.025 0.038 ( 0.011 ) ( 0.060 , 0.017 ) 0.001 ( continued on next page ) Appendix 3 ( continued ) EQ-5D-5L ( n ¼ 137 ) ICECAP-O ( n ¼ 135 ) b ( SE ) 95 % CI p b ( SE ) 95 % CI p G : Traffic hazardsb e e - e e - H : Crimeb e e - e e - J : Lack of cul-de-sacs 0.027 ( 0.012 ) ( 0.050 , 0.003 ) 0.029 0.015 ( 0.007 ) ( 0.029 , 0.001 ) 0.031 K : Hillinessb e e - e e - L : Physical barriersb e e - e e - Social cohesion SC-5PT e e - 0.029 ( 0.011 ) ( 0.008 , 0.051 ) 0.008 Objective built environment Street Smart Walk Score e e - e e - Statistics BIC 9.498 200.191 AIC 44.538 235.054 LR chi2 ( p-value ) 88.55 ( < 0.001 ) 97.63 ( < 0.001 ) a Backward stepwise elimination was used to remove variables relating to the built and social environments ; <PV> p > 0.1 </PV> was the criterion for removal .
