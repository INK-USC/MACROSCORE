Mills University of California, San Diego Winfried Rief Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany Michael G. Ziegler and Joel E. Dimsdale University of California, San Diego Objective: Several poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular risk, have been associated with both subjective social status (SSS) and sympathetic overactivity. Because prolonged sympathetic overactiva- tion down regulates beta adrenergic receptor (-AR) function, reduced -AR responsiveness is consid- ered an indicator of sympathetic overactivity and a cardiovascular risk factor. Though prior research has focused on objective social status and -AR function, no studies have examined the association between SSS and -AR function. We aimed to learn whether SSS predicts the in vivo responsiveness of -ARs. Methods: We assessed the chronotropic 25 dose (CD25), an in vivo marker of -AR responsiveness, in 94 healthy participants. The MacArthur Scales of Subjective Social Status were used to assess SSS in the USA (SSS-USA) and in the local community (SSS-C). Objective social status was analyzed by calculating the Hollingshead Two-Factor Index. Results: -AR responsiveness was reduced (as indicated by higher CD25 values) in participants with lower SSS-USA (p .007) and lower SSS-C (p .001). The relationship between CD25 and SSS was particularly robust with respect to SSS-C. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that SSS-C remained a significant predictor of CD25 (p .001) and accounted for 14% of the total variance (32%) in CD25 after adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, ethnicity, gender), health factors (exercise, smoking status, body mass index) and objective social status. Conclusion: Our results indicate that -AR function may be an important component of the link between SSS and health. Keywords: -adrenergic receptors, cardiovascular risk, chronotropic 25 dose, MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, socioeconomic status Low social status has been associated with several poor health outcomes including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and neuroen- docrinological pathways have been proposed to underlie causal pathways (Clark, DesMeules, Luo, Duncan, &amp; Wielgosz, 2009; Wilkinson, 1999). In the last decade, a growing body of research has focused on the link between health and subjective social status (SSS), in addition to objective social factors. SSS refers to the individuals’ sense of their place in the social ladder. Prior research shows associations between SSS and several health indicators (e.g., cardiovascular risk, mortality, depression) which persists even after controlling for objective social status or negative affect (Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, &amp; Ickovics, 2000; Ostrove, Adler, Kup- permann, &amp; Washington, 2000; Singh–Manoux, Marmot, &amp; Adler, 2005; Wright &amp; Steptoe, 2005). It was further suggested that SSS might be a more precise measure of the social position since it enables a cognitive averaging of a broader range of status-related information including past and future prospects (Singh–Manoux et al., 2005). The association between social status and poor cardiovascular outcomes may be partly based on prolonged sympathetic overac- tivity which involves increased stimulation of the beta adrenergic receptor (-AR; Leenen, 1999; Palatini, 2001; Remme, 1998; Triposkiadis et al., 2009). -ARs mediate several catecholamine- induced end organ sympathetic responses such as vasodilatation, heart rate increase as well as immune functions (Mills &amp; Dimsdale, 1993). Prolonged -AR overactivity down regulates -AR respon- This article was published Online First October 24, 2011.

Studies using these techniques have shown that factors which may be related to lower SSS predict -AR function; for example perceived stress in the homeless was related with reduced lymphocyte -AR density (Dimsdale, Mills, Patterson, Ziegler, &amp; Dillon, 1994), and in vivo -AR responsiveness was reduced in African Americans compared to Caucasian Americans (Jain, Dimsdale, Roesch, &amp; Mills, 2004). Thus, prolonged -AR overactivation, as indicated by altered -AR responsiveness, may be one mechanism that mediates the effect of SSS on health. Though prior research has focused on associations between objective social factors and -AR function (Jain et al., 2004), no studies have examined if SSS predicts the in vivo responsiveness of -ARs. Considering that i) SSS has been related to cardiovas- cular health, ii) potential features of low SSS predict -AR func- tion and iii) -AR function may be important in the pathophysi- ology of CVD, we tested the hypothesis that SSS significantly predicts the chronotropic 25 dose (CD25), an in vivo marker of -AR responsiveness and chronic -AR stimulation respectively (Cleaveland, Rangno, &amp; Shand, 1972). Method Participants Participants were healthy unmedicated volunteers. As part of a larger study on health of African Americans and Caucasian Amer- icans, the study group for isoproterenol testing was roughly evenly divided between Caucasian Americans (20 women and 30 men) and African Americans (20 women and 24 men). Ages ranged between 19 and 51 years (see Table 1 for sample characteristics). The study was approved by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Institutional Review Board. After prescreening, physical examination by a physician, and giving informed consent, in vivo -AR function was assessed between 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. In Vivo Testing of -Adrenergic Receptor Responsiveness The CD25 isoproterenol stimulation test was used to assess in vivo -AR function. CD25 refers to the dose of isoproterenol, which is necessary to increase heart rate by 25 beats per minute. Low CD25 values indicate high -AR sensitivity (Cleaveland et al., 1972; Mills &amp; Dimsdale, 1993). Participants were connected to an electrocardiogram monitor to measure heart rate. After a 30-min rest and assessment of basal heart rate, an intravenous low-dose bolus (0.1 g) of isoproterenol was administered to ensure that no adverse reactions to the drug occurred. Following the 0.1 g bolus, participants were infused with incremental bolus doses (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 g) until an increase of heart rate by 25 beats/min above basal heart rate was observed or until the 4.0 g bolus was completed. The maximum heart rate after each bolus was calcu- lated as the mean of the three shortest R-R intervals. There was a 5-min time interval between bolus injections. Standardized calcu- lation of CD25 values was performed as described previously (Cleaveland et al., 1972). Social Status and Covariate Measures Participants completed psychological questionnaires the follow- ing day. The MacArthur Scales of Subjective Social Status (see Goodman et al., 2001 for details) were used to assess SSS in the local community (SSS-C) and in the USA (SSS-USA). In short, participants are asked to rate their place on the rung of two “social ladders” in relation to those i) who have the highest and lowest standing in their community (SSS-C) and ii) who are the best and worst off with respect to money, education, and respected jobs in the USA (SSS-USA). Lower scores indicate lower SSS. Objective social status was considered by calculating the Hol- lingshead Two-Factor Index (HTFI), a well established indicator of socioeconomic status which is based on weighted values of education and occupation levels (Hollingshead, 1957). Sociode- mographic and health-related variables such as age, gender, eth- nicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status (smoker/ nonsmoker), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies- Depression Scale, CES-D, Radloff, 1977), and physical activity (weekly activity-score of the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Ques- tionaire; Godin &amp; Shephard, 1997) may influence -AR function (Jain et al., 2004; Mills &amp; Dimsdale, 1993) and may also be confounded with social status and health (Clark et al., 2009). Thus, these variables were considered as control variables. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS version 17.0 for Windows (Chicago, SPSS, Inc.). CD25 values above 3 standard deviations were considered to be outliers and treated as missing values. One case was considered as multivariate outlier (CD25 and SSS) on the basis of studentized deleted residuals and centered leverage values (Fox, 1991) and excluded. The rate of missing values for CD25 was 4% (N  4). With respect to psychosocial measure and covariates, the rate of missing values was below 6% (N  6) for each variable. Correlational analyses were used to examine associations between study variables. Hierarchical regres- sion analyses were conducted to examine if SSS explains variance Table 1 Descriptive Statistics of Study Variables (N  93) Age, years 35.1 (9.3) Body mass index, kg/m2 26.3 (3.7) Females, N (%) 40 (42.6) African Americans, N (%) 44 (46.8) Caucasian Americans, N (%) 50 (53.2) Hollingshead Two-Factor Index 41.5 (14.5) Subjective social status in the community 6.3 (2.0) Subjective social status in the USA 5.5 (2.2) Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 10.7 (9.4) Current smoker, N (%) 11 (11.7) Leisure-time exercise 76.8 (123.7) Baseline heart rate, bpm 65.2 (10.2) Chronotropic 25 dose, g 1.4 (0.8) Note.

Results As shown in Figure 1, CD25 was significantly related to SSS but not to objective social status (bivariate relationships between study variables are presented in Table 2). Hierarchical regression models were separately conducted for each measure of SSS (entered on step 3) to adjust for sociodemographic covariates (entered on step 1) and objective socioeconomic status (HTFI was entered on step 2). Results for step 1 indicated that this model significantly ex- plains variance in CD25 (p .019, R 2  0.173) with gender (  0.341, p .002) being a significant predictor of CD25 but not age (  0.117, p .338), BMI (  0.082, p .525), ethnicity (  0.200, p .115), smoking status (  0.041, p .702), or exercise (  0.136, p .212). Results for step 2 indicated that HTFI was not a significant predictor of CD25 (  0.080, p .490, R2 0.05). When SSS-C was entered on step 3, SSS-C remained significantly related to CD25 (  0.393, p .000) and accounted for 14% of the total variance (32%) explained by this model. When SSS-USA was entered on step 3, SSS-USA accounted for 3% of the total variance (22%) explained by this model but failed to reach significance (  0.191, p .100). Because depression may be related to in vitro -AR function (Mazzola–Pomietto, Azorin, Tramoni, &amp; Jeanningros, 1994) and participants with negative mood may rate themselves low on the SSS ladders (Operario, Adler, &amp; Williams, 2004), exploratory analyses were conducted with sociodemographic covariates on Step 1, depression on Step 2, and SSS measures on Step 3. Results for Step 2 indicated that depression was not a significant predictor of CD25 after controlling for sociodemographic factors (  0.110, p .299, R2 0.012). When SSS-C was entered on Step 3, SSS-C remained significantly related to CD25 (  0.402, p .000) and accounted for 13% of the total variance (32%) explained by this model. When SSS-USA was entered on Step 3, SSS-USA failed to be a significant predictor of CD25 (  0.191, p .105). A number of exploratory analyses were conducted. Since edu- cation and occupation may operate differently, we examined ob- jective social status using separate measures of education and occupation as opposed to the composite HTFI. Moreover, we reran our analyses without participants who were under age 25, because objective social status may be more difficult to ascertain in younger participants. Both approaches did not materially change our basic findings. Finally, because association patterns between social status and health may differ between Caucasian Americans and African Americans (Jain et al., 2004; Ostrove et al., 2000) we examined whether interaction terms (SSS  Ethnicity) explained variance in CD25 in addition to SSS and ethnicity. Interaction terms did not significantly explain variance in addition to SSS and ethnicity (results of exploratory analyses not shown). Discussion Our main finding is that the in vivo responsiveness of -ARs was reduced (i.e., higher CD25 values) in individuals with low SSS. This relationship was robust with respect to SSS in the local community, which remained significantly related to CD25 after adjusting for several covariates, including objective social status and depression. -ARs are important in cardiovascular regulation. Sympathetic overactivity—accompanied by down regulation of -AR responsiveness—is considered a risk factor for CVD (Leenen, 1999; Mills &amp; Dimsdale, 1993; Palatini, 2001; Remme, 1998; Triposkiadis et al., 2009). Thus, our findings support pre- vious research showing that SSS is related to cardiovascular health (Adler et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2010; Singh–Manoux et al., 2005). Although the exact pathways by which SSS might influence health are not known, a potential down regulation of -AR func- tion may result from chronically increased catecholamine levels Figure 1. Individuals with lower subjective social status in the community (SSS-C) and in the USA (SSS-USA) exhibit reduced in vivo -adrenergic receptor responsiveness (i.e., higher chronotropic 25 dose values). 527SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL STATUS AND -ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS since hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been related to lower SSS, and reduced -AR responsiveness is considered a reliable indicator of chronically increased catechol- amine concentrations (Adler et al., 2000; Janicki–Deverts et al., 2007; Mills &amp; Dimsdale, 1993; Wright &amp; Steptoe, 2005). Consistent with prior research demonstrating that SSS can be a better predictor of health indicators than objective status (Singh– Manoux et al., 2005), we found that SSS but not objective social status influences the whole body sensitivity to -AR stimulation. Such findings may support the suggestion that SSS is a more precise measure of the social position because it enables a cogni- tive average of several status-related social variables by taking into account more information of the individual’s sociocultural circum- stances and also past and future prospects (Singh–Manoux et al., 2005). A further perspective, which is not contradictory to the previous, is that not absolute socioeconomic measures but rather a low relative position, as assessed by the SSS ladders, leads to stress inducing negative emotion resulting in poor health outcomes (Wilkinson, 1999). We found that the relationship between SSS and CD25 was stronger and more robust for SSS-C than for SSS-USA. A similar association pattern has been reported by Ghaed and Gallo (2007) for cardiovascular risk factors (pessimism, stress, and increased blood pressure) and may reflect the circumstance that social com- parisons with individuals in the local community are everyday occurrences which influence one’s psychosocial well-being stron- ger and more directly than more abstract comparisons with people in the whole country. SSS-C may also enable a more accurately and broader personal assessment of SSS than SSS-USA, since SSS-C also considers factors beside traditional markers of social status (e.g., perceived respect from others, social standing within religious or other social groups; Ghaed &amp; Gallo, 2007). Our finding that SSS-USA failed to be a significant predictor of CD25 in the adjusted models reflects also that SSS-USA was stronger related to covariates (age and BMI) than SSS-C. Our findings are limited because of the cross-sectional design. Thus, causality in the relation between SSS and -AR function cannot be determined. Moreover, we cannot exclude that the relationship between SSS and CD25 is due to confounding vari- ables, which were not analyzed in this study, although the impact of the most probable covariates (age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, exercise, smoking, objective social status and depression) were carefully examined (see Methods). For example, -AR function decreases with age (Bao et al., 2005; Ebstein, Stessman, Eliakim, &amp; Menczel, 1985) and lower social status may be linked to faster aging (Cherkas et al., 2006). Thus, although we control for nu- merical age, we cannot exclude that the SSS-CD25 relationship is partially confounded by physiologic age since physiologic age may not always match numerical age. Moreover, because partici- pants of this study mainly derived from the area of San Diego, California, the generalizability of our results may be limited. In conclusion, our findings suggest that lower SSS, particularly within the local community, is related to decreased in vivo -AR responsiveness (as indicated by higher CD25 values). This study extends previous research by suggesting that -AR function, is one potential mechanism which may mediate, in part, the effect of SSS on health. References Adler, N. E., Epel, E.
