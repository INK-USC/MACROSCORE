          <p id="s1p2">tHird-Party aggression by Joslyn barnHart* on april 28, 1881, France embarked upon its first new imperial mission in nearly two decades, sending twenty-eight thousand troops to invade the shores of tunisia. by may, France had established an official protectorate over tunisia, incurring no casualties in the pro- cess. What explains this case of territorial conquest?1 i argue that this case and many others like it cannot be understood without acknowledg- ing their direct link to the past. the French foreign minister explicitly acknowledged, for instance, an important relationship between French territorial aggression in the 1880s and the loss of the French provinces of alsace and lorraine roughly ten years prior, stating that “the reverses of some ten or twelve years ago have rendered it necessary for France to make her influence felt among distant populations.”2 the loss of the provinces to Prussia, which prompted Prime minister leon gambetta to say that the French should “think of [the loss] always, but speak of it never,” led France to engage in expansionary acts against a relatively weak third-party actor almost a decade later.3 these reactions prompt the question: Why would a state respond to territorial loss with such acts of aggression? i argue that existing theories of territorial aggression cannot explain this relationship. rather, the evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer resides in concerns about status. * the author is grateful to benjamin J.

In contrast to prior work arguing that humiliation drives a need for revenge, the author demonstrates that great powers only rarely engage in direct revenge. Rather, they pursue the less risky option of projecting power abroad against weaker states to convey their intentions of remaining a great power. The validity of this theory is tested using an expanded and recoded data set of territorial change from 1816 to 2000. Great powers that have experienced a humiliating, involuntary territorial loss are more likely to attempt aggressive territorial gains in the future and, in particular, against third-party states. ABSTRACT There is a growing consensus that status concerns drive state behavior. Although recent attention has been paid to when states are most likely to act on behalf of status concerns, very little is known about which actions states are most likely to engage in when their status is threatened. This article focuses on the effect of publicly humiliating international events as sources of status threat. Such events call into question a state's image in the eyes of others, thereby increasing the likelihood that the state will engage in reassertions of its status. The article presents a theory of status reassertion that outlines which states will be most likely to respond, as well as when and how they will be most likely to do so. The author argues that because high-status states have the most to lose from repeated humiliation, they will be relatively risk averse when reasserting their humiliation &amp; aggression 533 4 see barnhart 2016; sanderson 1974. 5 the magnitude of these effects equals or exceeds that of other key determinants of conflict be- havior in the international relations literature, such as the effects of joint democracy (50 percent) and having an offensive ally (47 percent). see leeds, long, and mitchell 2000. the article presents a novel theory of status threat, arguing that states—and great powers in particular—are more likely to engage in status-seeking acts, such as territorial aggression against weaker states, when they have experienced a humiliating event in which they fail to live up to international expectations. such events threaten a state’s im- age in the eyes of others, and those states with the capabilities to do so will respond by engaging in acts that define their desired international stratum. states seeking to reassert themselves as great powers, for in- stance, will be more likely to engage in acts that define great power sta- tus, such as the projection of power abroad through the use of force, than will established great powers whose status has not been called into question. such status-affirming demonstrates that the state has the requisite capabilities, influence, and far-reaching interests to support its claim to high status. Far from isolated in their effect, acts of status assertion prompted by humiliating events can have significant impli- cations for international stability. French expansion into tunisia, for example, played a significant role in triggering the scramble for africa, an expansionary fray that encompassed 95 percent of the african con- tinent.4 as a test of this theory, i assess the effect of one potential cause of in- ternational humiliation—involuntary territorial loss—on one particu- lar means of status assertion: territorial aggression. the loss of territory through involuntary means, such as conquest or annexation, threat- ens a state’s image in the eyes of others. but territory may also be lost through voluntary means, such as mutual agreement and mutual seces- sion. though the loss of territory through voluntary means on average generates similar strategic and material costs for the losing state, it is unlikely to threaten state status and therefore, according to the present theory, should not correlate with a change in future behavior. to inves- tigate the differential impact of voluntary and involuntary territorial loss on territorial aggression, i use an expanded and recoded data set of all instances of territorial change from 1816 to 2000. the study dem- onstrates that although future territorial aggression does not correlate with past voluntary loss, states that have recently experienced an invol- untary territorial loss are more likely to attempt territorial conquest in the future. among great powers, the likelihood of territorial aggression is 84 percent higher among those states that have recently experienced a coercive territorial loss.5 the vast majority of these acts of aggression ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

(90 percent) target third-party states not involved in the original ter- ritorial loss. these effects do not result from generally heightened ac- tivity in certain regions at certain times or from enduring territorial disputes, and they are robust to a wide range of controls for economic, security, and domestic political influences on state behavior. Further, the increased probability of attempted conquest holds not only for the few years immediately following a territorial loss, but also persists for decades into the future. the article makes three important contributions. First, it contrib- utes to our understanding of how states respond to humiliating events. Prior studies have hypothesized that humiliation leads to a desire for revenge. this article demonstrates further that the behavioral implica- tions of humiliating events often involve aggression directed at third- party states rather than at the original perpetrator of the humiliating offense. Humiliated states engage in third-party aggression to demon- strate their intentions and abilities to pursue a vigorous foreign policy abroad, such as defines a high-status state. second, the article contrib- utes to our understanding of when state concerns about international status are likely to be most salient in shaping state behavior. although states may value high status, they do not seek to augment their status to the same degree at all times. the article argues that states that have experienced an event that calls their existing status into question will be more likely to engage in status-seeking behavior. third, the article sheds light on state motivations for territorial aggression. economic, domestic, and security rationales are those most frequently cited when explaining territorial expansion.6 the evidence presented here suggests that status concerns are also significant drivers of conquest. the article proceeds as follows. it first presents a review of the rel- evant literatures and then presents a theory of how past events, in par- ticular those that may result in a downgrade in status, lead states to behave differently in the future. the article then applies this theoretical framework to the realm of territory, generating novel hypotheses about the relationship between past coerced losses and future coercive gains. it next presents a new data set on territorial change in the international system, describes the research design, and presents the results. the article concludes with a discussion of possible alternative explanations and a consideration of how these results apply to state behavior in the current era. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

          <p id="s1p3">the growing literature on status inconsistency argues that a state is more likely to engage in conflict when it perceives that its attributed status is lower than the level of status it believes it deserves.14 Quanti- tative work in this area has primarily analyzed the disparity in rank be- tween military capabilities and diplomatic representation as a predictor of international conflict.15 this approach assumes that status expecta- tions are based on objective measures of relative material capabilities, an approach that may fail to accurately represent states’ status expec- tations for the following reasons. First, it omits other objective factors, such as economic strength, cultural influence, and demography, which 7 see, among others, Clunan 2009; dafoe, renshon, and Huth 2014; Freedman 2016; Hafner- burton and montgomery 2006; larson and shevchenko 2010; lebow 2008; markey 1999; Paul, larson, and Wohlforth 2014; renshon 2015; renshon 2016; Volgy et al. 2011; Wohlforth 2009. 8 dafoe, renshon, and Huth 2014. 9 renshon 2016. 10 lebow 2008. see also dafoe and Caughey 2016. in social psychology, see mosquera, manstead, and Fischer 2000. 11 Wohlforth 2009. 12 tajfel 2010. 13 larson and shevchenko 2010; mercer 1995. 14 on status inconsistency, see galtung 1964; renshon 2016. 15 see midlarsky 1975; Wallace 1971. east 1972 and Volgy and mayhall 1995 rely on economic position and total military expenditures as two measures of expected status. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Hu- miliating events are those that pose a threat to one’s image or lower it in one’s own estimation and in the eyes of others.18 in that humiliating events have direct implications for perceptions of a state’s social posi- tion, humiliation and status are directly related. although humiliating events often involve intentional degradation, humiliation can also be the unintended consequence of outcomes that a state perceives to be unjust.19 because perceptions of status are formed not only through as- sessments of states’ material characteristics, but also through the per- formance and actions of states on the world stage, the failure of a state to perform as it is expected to in terms of its existing status increases the likelihood that others will question its claims of high status. los- ing a war to a weaker state, for instance, will likely call into question the standing of the defeated state: the more rapid the defeat and the weaker the opponent, the more grave the status threat.20 losing terri- tory through involuntary means is likely to call into question the sta- tus of great powers in particular, because they are expected to be able 16 see Freedman 2105 on this point. see also Clunan 2009. on temporal comparison theory in psychology, see albert 1977; and Zell and alicke 2009. 17 repeated military failures may eventually lead to lowered status expectations as those within the state lose confidence in the state’s abilities. 18 on this definition, see statman 2000, 523. 19 Humiliation differs from shame in that those experiencing humiliation believe that an outcome was unjust and undeserved, and those experiencing shame believe that an outcome is deserved. the perception of injustice generates anger and associated aggressive tendencies, while the perception of guilt generates avoidance. see Klein 1991, 14, 22; and leidner, sheikh, and ginges 2012, 1. on inter- national acts of humiliation by superior groups, see Hartling et al. 2013; lindner 2002; lindner 2006; saurette 2006; and Wolf 2011. 20 see schivelbusch 2003. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

          <p id="s1p4">How exactly should we expect states that have experienced a hu- miliating event to behave? to date, we have very few specific answers to this question. the literature on status inconsistency has focused on the impact of status discrepancies on the broad propensity for military conflict, but it has left largely unexplored the exact targets and types of aggression. social identity theory suggests that status-seeking states turn to competitive strategies when elite group boundaries are per- ceived to be impermeable by new members, though the conditions under which states will pursue particular competitive acts have also gone unexplored.23 in addition, prior research on international humil- iation has focused almost completely on the subsequent drive for re- venge against the state responsible for the humiliation.24 We have no reason to expect, however, that revenge is the sole response to humil- iating events. i argue that the manner in which states respond to sta- tus-threatening events depends upon the exact nature of the threat, as well as upon the current status and capabilities of the state. the most effective reassertion of status might involve the successful pursuit of revenge against one’s humiliator in the manner in which one was hu- miliated. the defeated would desire foremost, therefore, to handily de- feat its aggressor. those who lost territory would above all desire to retrieve it. but as will be shown, humiliated states are relatively risk averse.25 effective reassertions of status require success; repeated failure only increases the likelihood that one’s decline is solidified in the eyes of others. Humiliated states therefore seek ways to effectively reassert their status that involve more certain probabilities of success. this may 21 ranke [1833] 1950 includes the ability to maintain territorial integrity against all other skills as a basic military requirement of great power status. 22 the event need not actually lead to a decline in the state’s status; it needs only to foster the belief within the state that its status has been threatened. 23 see larson and shevchenko 2010. 24 see lebow 2010; lowenheim and Heimann 2008; Harkavy 2000; scheff 1994. on revenge, see also stein 2015. 25 renshon 2015 shows that threats to status lead low-power individuals to throw more good money after bad. this seemingly risk-acceptant action is not at odds with the predicted risk-averse effects of status threat proposed here. a state may be risk acceptant if defeat in a current crisis could solidify its status decline, but it may remain relatively risk averse when choosing how to reassert its status following a humiliating event. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

How do states know which acts define their desired status? Certain behaviors, rooted in common knowledge about how states of a particu- lar status typically behave, have long defined different strata of the in- ternational status hierarchy. great powers, for example, have long been defined by their ability to project military power abroad in pursuit of more globalized interests.28 those states that possess substantial ma- terial capabilities but have not demonstrated a willingness to act as a great power by projecting power abroad are usually not considered to possess great power status.29 great powers have traditionally pursued vigorous and expansive foreign policies—maintaining broad spheres of influence, acquiring long-standing client states and protectorates, and generally influencing the politics of other, often weaker, states through the use of force. With these acts, great powers distinguish themselves from states of lesser standing that cannot project power abroad to the same degree. these specific status-affirming acts are not limited to great powers, as Jack levy notes, since lesser or regional powers may also be able to pursue elements of an expansive foreign policy.30 by con- trast, however, lesser powers are expected to do so to a far lesser degree and for less sustained periods of time.31 What specifically do humiliated states seek to accomplish by engag- ing in status-defining acts? the goals may be both instrumental and 26 attempted revanchist gains may be motivated by a desire to reclaim lost status, but it may also be motivated by other domestic and security considerations. 27 this hypothesized impact of status decline diverges, therefore, from the prediction of prospect theory that actors in the realm of losses will become risk acceptant. the truly risk-acceptant act would be to target the rival state responsible for its original humiliation. 28 this definition of great power status comes from levy 1983, 14. it is in keeping with definitions offered by, among others, Wight 2002; Howard 1971; buzan and Waever 2003. 29 see Volgy et al. 2011, chap. 1. 30 levy 1983. 31 because status resides in social perception, expectations of high-status behavior are subject to change over time. the normative acceptability of unbridled conquest, for example, declined follow- ing World War ii. see Zacher 2001; Fazal 2007. but as addressed in the discussion section, there is evidence that certain states in the international system are again turning to the projection of power abroad as a means of status reassertion following humiliating events. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

First, states value the increased influence and respect that comes with high status. a decline in status is likely accom- panied by a decline in the deference that a state is accorded. to avoid a permanent decline of the state’s international influence, leaders of the humiliated state therefore have an instrumental incentive to en- gage in acts that shore up their state’s image in the eyes of others. status is rooted in higher-order beliefs—beliefs about others’ beliefs—about which states possess the requisite capabilities and admirable qualities to rightfully claim high status.32 a state holds high status not merely when other states believe it does, but also when states believe that other states believe the state holds high status. because status resides in social per- ceptions, states seeking to shore up their image in the eyes of others will seek to engage in highly visible actions that define their desired inter- national strata. in successfully doing so, the humiliated state establishes common knowledge that (1) it meets the qualifications of high status, (2) it currently possesses sufficient international influence to pursue ex- pansive and aggressive policies without being stymied by other high- status states, and (3) it intends to maintain high status. if others allow the state to exercise the prerogatives associated with its desired status, it serves as a signal that those other states must perceive the state as de- serving of high status. in this way, highly visible status-reasserting acts promise to shape higher-order beliefs about a state’s status, and there- fore to augment the existing influence of the state.33 second, research has shown that actors value status as an end in itself and that they are more willing to pay higher costs to avoid status loss than they are to achieve status gain, even in experimental settings in which high status has no instrumental implications.34 because self-esteem is dependent in part upon the social favorability of one’s group, threats to the image and status of one’s group can engender significant nega- tive psychological repercussions, particularly among those who strongly identify with the group.35 demonstrations of anger and successful reas- 32 on second-order beliefs, reputation, and status, see o’neill 2006. and see also dafoe, renshon, and Huth 2014. 33 on the importance of visibility in generating common knowledge, see Chwe 2003; and o’neill 2006. 34 Huberman, loch, and Önçüler 2004. as Pettit, yong, and spataro 2010 show, actors are more willing to pay higher costs to avoid status loss than to achieve status gain. of all negative emotional states, social threat and humiliation can have some of the most deleterious physiological effects. see Kemeny 2009; scheepers and ellemers 2005. 35 tajfel and turner 1979. on the existence of group-based emotions relating to the fate and ac- tions of one’s group, including group-based humiliation, see Fontan 2006; ginges and atran 2008; shepherd, spears, and manstead 2013; and smith and Kessler 2004. on group identification and group-based emotions, see Kessler and Hollbach 2005; mackie, smith, and ray 2008; and leidner, sheikh, and ginges 2012. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

First, great powers are expected to pursue an expansive foreign policy abroad, and they are the states with the greatest resources and military capabilities to do so. second, great powers are the primary holders of status and influence in the international system. they have the most to lose from status-threatening events that might cause them to be down- graded within the club of great powers or pushed out of it, thereby ren- dering them far less influential in the international system. Humiliated great powers may therefore have the greatest incentive to engage, if they are able, in such status-affirming acts as the projection of power abroad. third, the psychological effects of humiliating events may also be more 36 redirected aggression has been witnessed among cichlid fish, baboons, macaque monkeys, hu- mans, and many other species. see barash and lipton 2011. 37 Pedersen et al. 2008; marcus-newhall et al. 2000. 38 barash and lipton 2011, 33–35. 39 see dafoe, renshon, and Huth 2014, 382–83. 40 see also Henrich and gil-White 2001, who argue that the psychological drive to protect and en- hance one’s status evolved because of the instrumental benefits that stable status hierarchies provided for both high-status actors and those who defer. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Finally, in that status-affirming acts sometimes involve aggression against weaker third parties, these acts can be distinguished from those motivated by reputational concerns about strength and credibility.48 al- though much of the literature on reputation has focused on the effect that looking weak has on the behavior of potential rivals, the few stud- ies that have focused on how it affects a state’s own behavior argue that such states will be more likely to initiate or escalate conflict in the future as the number of its rivals increases.49 Joe Clare and Vesna danilovic argue, for example, that a state’s experience with equal or roughly equal adversaries will be most salient for potential rivals drawing inferences about the state’s likely resolve or relative strength in future encoun- ters.50 Weak-looking states would need to engage in events of suffi- cient scale and cost to force rivals to reassess their beliefs about how they would fare in direct competition against them.51 the targeting of weaker states, intended to demonstrate existing influence or to distin- 45 on temporary withdrawal following defeat, see Zarakol 2011; and schivelbusch 2003. 46 trager 2012 describes the russian desire to regain status after its humiliation following the Crimean War and the decision by the russians to “wait for their time to come.” 47 macdonald and Parent 2011. 48 For example, Huth 1988; Jervis 1989; Jervis 2002. For a good review of this literature, see dafoe, renshon, and Huth 2014. as laid out by o’neill 2001, status differs from reputation in that it is held at the level of second-order beliefs. a reputation for honesty or strength meanwhile can exist at the level of first-order beliefs. this distinction is significant in that it allows for symbols of status and the qualities deemed prestigious to be social artifacts that can change as the social consensus shifts. 49 in this conception, a state that has backed down in the past will be vulnerable to increased chal- lenges by rivals. see Huth 1988; Huth 1997. 50 Clare and danilovic 2010. see also sechser, forthcoming; Weisiger and yarhi-milo 2015. 51 For other arguments focusing on how backing down affects the state’s future behavior, see leng 1983, which notes that states that failed to obtain their objectives in past rounds of bargaining will be more aggressive when bargaining with the same state in the future. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

When should we expect states to attempt a coercive gain following an involuntary loss? although scholars have offered numer- ous explanations for territorial conquest, the specific impact that ter- ritorial loss has on the losing state’s attitude toward future conquest, especially against third-party states, has not been studied systemati- cally.52 according to the theory above, the way in which territory is lost likely has a significant impact on attitudes toward territorial expansion in the future. territorial loss resulting from conquest, annexation, or wars of independence is likely to present a greater threat to status than territorial loss resulting from mutual agreement or peaceful secession.53 this prediction therefore differs from that of prospect theory in that fu- ture changes in behavior depend not only on the fact of loss, but also on the manner in which the loss occurred. states experiencing involuntary territorial loss should reassert their status not only by seeking revenge against the state responsible for the original loss, but also more gener- ally by seeking coercive gains at the expense of third-party states in the system. this logic leads to the following hypotheses: —H1. experiencing a coerced territorial loss raises the probability that the losing state will attempt coercive territorial gains in the near future. —H2. the increased probability of attempted gains will come at the expense not only of the states responsible for the recent territorial loss, but also of third-party states. —H3. experiencing a voluntary territorial loss will have no significant impact on the future probability of attempted territorial gains. 52 states are more likely to use force in attempts to acquire territory than they are to use it for other purposes, and fights over territory tend to be more deadly than other conflicts. see Holsti 1991; Vasquez 1993; Hensel 1996; senese and Vasquez 2008. We know less about the impact of territorial loss on future policies toward territorial aggression. gibler and tir 2010; owsiak and rider 2013; and schultz 2013 focus on the generally pacifying effects of voluntary territorial agreement. but this literature does not explain the relationship between past territorial loss and attempted gains against third-party states. 53 annexation differs from conquest in that force is threatened rather than used. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Coercive means are those involving the use of force (“con- quest”) or the recent threat of force (“annexation”). attempted coercive gains were coded from the militarized interstate disputes data set, and are those in which the highest act of hostility listed for the country within a militarized interstate dispute (mid) was either the occupa- tion of territory, even if temporary, or the threat to take territory and 57 tir et al. 1998.

Possible cases of revanchism were coded 1 59 this approach does not account for disputes in which the objective of one party was to take ter- ritory but in which the highest level of hostility surpassed the occupation of territory. 60 but gains are coded as voluntary when the primary mechanism of change is diplomacy. one could argue that whether or not force is used, and therefore whether a gain is coercive, depends on the response of the target. to account for this, the model was run using pooled voluntary and coer- cive attempted gains. the results were not significantly altered. Cases of attempted voluntary gains were not included because of the difficulty of coding all failed attempts to negotiate over territorial outcomes. 61 of the 507 cases, 184 were attempted gains and 323 were successful. more cross-tabulation ap- pears in barnhart 2017, pt. a. 62 barnhart 2017, Figure 1, table 7. 63 Kacowicz 1994 codes and analyzes cases of peaceful territorial change. the codings of voluntary change here correspond with the Kacowicz data in all but a few cases in which there was perceived to be an active threat of force. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Total activity in the system, prior 5 yrs., is a count of the total num- ber of successful and attempted gains in the system made by other states over the last five-year period, divided by ten. Coercive attempted gains in prior 5 yrs. and coercive attempted gains in prior 11–20 yrs. are binary vari- ables capturing whether or not the state itself engaged in other recent gains of its own in the prior five- or eleven-to-twenty-year periods.70 67 For example, Fearon 1994; Clare and danilovic 2010. 68 the variable is coded as 0 if the state exhibited resolve within a dispute in the period following the instance of backing down. alternative models of reputation were also analyzed, including those that consider the number of potential opponents. see barnhart 2017, pt. b.7. in none of the models did the main results reported here differ significantly. 69 see grieco 1988; mastanduno 1991. 70 barnhart 2017, pt. b.2, presents extensive analysis of past activity in the system. these particular variables accounting for past activity were selected because they best report the particular periods of heightened activity in the past. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

While a state might desire a piece of territory for the strategic advantages it provides, there is no reason to think that this de- sire would be correlated with a past status-threatening loss, or that as a result it would bias the relationship between a past involuntary territo- rial loss and the probability of future action.74 results impact of the past on the present: hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 three models were estimated to analyze the effect of a past loss on fu- ture attempted gains.75 as stated above, the models reported here were run on all politically relevant directed-dyad years from 1816 to 2000. the coefficients in all models were estimated using logit, employing cubic polynomials, as suggested by david Carter and Curtis signorino, to control for temporal dependence between observations of the 71 mearsheimer 2003. 72 see singer 1988. they were not available for any of the nonstate actors that often served as targets of expansionary policies. Capability in these cases was coded 0. 73 the Correlates of War (cow) territorial Claims data set offers a wealth of information about the potential material, strategic, and ethnic value of particular territories under dispute. see Hensel et al. 2008. 74 the same is true for domestic variables. see snyder 1991; tir 2010. although domestic variables likely explain some instances of state expansion, they are unlikely to explain a pattern between past losses and future gains. 75 a list of cases can be found in barnhart 2017, pt. a, table 4. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Having backed down in one’s previous international dispute does not significantly correlate with future attempts at conquest. Per- haps unsurprisingly, states are more likely to attempt territorial gains if others in their region have recently taken territory and when they have significantly more power than their dyad partner. but most important, the relationship between past coerced losses and future coercive gains holds even when controlling for revanchist gains, a state’s own recent gains, the total recent activity in the system and one’s region, regime type, whether the attempted gain involved a border dispute, and struc- tural imperatives.79 Figure 1 provides substantive interpretations of the results of model 77 Joint democracy was coded from the Polity data, with the variable coded 1 if both states had a polity score of 6 or higher and coded 0 otherwise. 78 models involving shorter time spans presented in barnhart 2017, Figure 1, p. 17, and table 8, p. 22, show an increase in gains when states have experienced a loss in the last five-, ten-, and fifteen- year periods, as well. 79 the same models were also run using voluntary attempted gains as the dependent variable. in no case did past coerced loss or past voluntary loss correspond with a statistically significant change in voluntary attempted gains. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

          <p id="s1p18">hypotheses 4, 5, and 6 according to the theory above, we should not expect all states to pur- sue gains to the same degree following a territorial loss. to assess the differential impact of territorial loss on major and nonmajor powers, the variable coerced loss, last 20 yrs. was interacted with a dummy vari- able capturing major powers in the system.83 in support of hypothesis 4, the analysis demonstrates that great powers are more likely than non- major powers to seek territorial gains following an involuntary loss, al- though there is a significant increase in attempted gains among both groups (47 percent among nonmajor powers and 84 percent among major powers that have experienced coerced territorial losses).84 the types of states the two groups target also differ. although both types of states are more likely to target third-party states, great powers are far more likely to pursue discontiguous, third-party gains following co- erced losses than are lesser powers, lending support to hypothesis 5. great powers targeted discontiguous states in 80 percent of their coer- cive attempted gains following a coerced territorial loss, while nongreat powers targeted discontiguous states in only 34 percent of their post- loss attempts to gain territory.85 as further evidence, logistic analysis indicates that the predicted probability that a great power targets a dis- contiguous state following a coercive loss is 146 percent higher than it is for lesser powers. this significant difference provides support for the notion that the projection of power abroad distinguishes great powers from lesser states that are either unable or unwilling to pursue such ex- pansive policies. there is also evidence that great powers are less likely to engage in revanchism than they are to target third parties. the likelihood of third-party gains among major powers that have lost territory in the 82 barnhart 2017, pt. b.1. 83 this measure of great power status was taken from the cow data set. the results of this model, as well as a table of predicted probabilities are presented in barnhart 2017, pt. b.3, tables 7 and 8. 84 a two-sample t-test indicates that major powers are in fact 131 percent more likely to pursue territorial gains following a coerced loss than are nonmajor powers. this difference is significant at the .0001 level. 85 Cross-tabulations for major powers and nonmajor power targets can be found in barnhart 2017, pt. a, tables 2a and 2b. the cow data on contiguity were used to assess these percentages. a two- sample t-test indicates that this difference is significant at the .0001 level. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

Conversely, the likelihood that great powers target the specific aggressor states re- sponsible for a recent territorial loss is not significantly higher than the baseline likelihood of territorial aggression by a great power within po- litically relevant dyads.86 although the low number of cases of revan- chism limits our ability to analyze target selection, evidence suggests that states are more likely to engage in revanchism as their relative ca- pabilities within the dyad increase and when the humiliator does not possess a great power defensive ally.87 Within the ten cases of revanch- ist gains attempted by great powers, in no case was the targeted state also a great power. the theory of status threat presented above predicts that humili- ated states will generally be more risk averse than nonhumiliated states. there is significant evidence to support this proposition. First, we find strong support for hypothesis 6, which states that great powers that have involuntarily lost territory will be more likely to target states over which they hold a significant relative military advantage. eighty-three percent of the cases of postloss territorial expansion by great powers oc- cur within dramatically skewed dyads in which the gainer has at least 75 percent of the total dyadic capabilities.88 great powers experienc- ing recent territorial loss attempted gains within dyads in which their relative military advantage is on average 8 percent higher than it is for nonhumiliated great powers attempting territorial aggression. a two- sample t-test indicates that the difference in the relative capabilities of states targeted by great powers is significant at the .05 level. second, the analysis underscores the importance of success to reaffirmation of sta- tus following humiliating events. Humiliated great powers are 12.9 per- cent more likely to be successful in their subsequent acts of attempted gain than are nonhumiliated states attempting to take territory.89 third, 86 it is also possible that great powers seek revenge on past aggressors by engaging in nonterritorial acts of aggression. these acts would not be accounted for in the present models. separate models that assessed the effect of coerced loss on all acts of aggression, including nonterritorial mids, were run. these results indicate a similar pattern: great powers that have recently experienced a coerced loss are 123 percent more likely to engage in aggression against third parties. the likelihood that they will target the specific aggressor state is not higher than the likelihood of acting aggressively within any other politically relevant dyad. 87 For more, see barnhart 2017, pt. b.4. 88 in contrast, nonmajor powers were willing to seek revanchist gains against states that possessed on average 70 percent more capabilities than they had. For more analysis of the role of relative capabili- ties, see barnhart 2017, pt. C.1. 89 this difference is significant at the .05 level.

          <p id="s1p19">hypothesis 7 to analyze the dynamics of coercive attempted gains made by major powers against third parties following losses over time, model 3 was es- timated with an additional count term for the twenty years following a loss along with the next three terms of its taylor series.91 Figure 2 plots the results as a function of time following a territorial loss.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">the black line in the figure represents the probability of attempted gain against a third-party state by a major power over a twenty-year pe- riod following a coerced loss. the grey line along the bottom shows the probability of an attempted coercive gain for a state that has not expe- rienced a loss (.001), a probability that is equivalent in all years. the probability of a gain in the few years following a loss is roughly 1.75 times the average probability of a gain for a state without a recent loss. this period is followed by a moderate decline after a loss in the proba- bility of attempted gains from years six to ten and then a significant leap in the probability from years eleven through seventeen. in year fifteen, the estimated probability of an attempted gain is nearly four times the rate of attempted gain when no coerced loss was experienced. What explains this pattern of conquest over time? the high proba- bility of gains in years three through five following a territorial loss sug- gests that a few states that have the ability to attempt gains against third parties do so relatively soon after a loss. the decrease in probability af- ter the fifth year is possibly accounted for by a decrease in military ca- pabilities among states that must rebuild prior to engaging in expansion again.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">as Figure 3 illustrates, the timing of the second peak of expansionary behavior closely corresponds with the average amount of time it takes states that have previously lost territory to recover their capabilities, ex- cluding those states that lost more than 50 percent of their capabilities in conjunction with territorial loss. the figure shows that states expe- riencing a coerced territorial loss subsequently experience on average a 90 this value was obtained through a t-test using the cow data on defensive alliances. the differ- ence is significant at the .001 level. 91 all observations of the count variable “time since coerced loss” that did not lie within a twenty- year period of a loss were coded as 21. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

C.2. 94 the large majority of cases of aggressive and nonaggressive territorial change did occur in the pre-1946 period. of the 507 cases of coercive attempted gains, only 90 occurred after 1945. of these, twelve were preceded by a coerced loss. one hundred and sixty four of the 417 pre-1946 attempted gains were preceded by a coerced loss. 95 the year 1945 was chosen as a cut point because of its precedence within the literature. to test for structural breakpoints in attitudes toward territorial expansion, Chow tests were conducted for a variety of cut points between 1910 and 1950. no statistically significant cut point was found, suggest- ing that change in attitudes toward territory arose gradually. 96 barnhart 2017, pt. b.4. 97 a likelihood ratio test of the effects of territorial loss in the pre- and post-1945 era confirmed that significantly different patterns existed within the two eras. ht tp s: // do i.o rg /1 0. 10 17 /S 00 43 88 71 17 00 00 28 D ow nl oa de d fr om h tt ps :// w w w .c am br id ge .o rg /c or e.

France is becoming a great Power again.”107 similarly, russia’s decision to acquire exten- 104 gilady 2017; nayar and Paul 2003; scott 2008. 105 Forsberg, Heller, and Wolf 2014; guillory 2014; stent 2014. 106 see barnhart 2017, pt. b.2. 107 Quoted in de Constant 1891, 182.

Humiliated states may now seek to reassert status through other means; they may do so by projecting their power abroad with the intention of overthrowing foreign governments, throwing their weight around in international organizations, or devel- oping sophisticated arms. Just as we assume that individuals’ actions are shaped by their past experiences, the history of a state’s violent inter- actions with other states shapes that state’s present and future policies. Humiliated states will seek to reassert themselves in competitive ways, not only at the expense of the state responsible for the status threat, but likely as well at the expense of third-party states. supplementary material supplementary material for this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1017 /s0043887117000028. 108 see meyer and brysac 2009; tuminez 2000. 109 Callahan 2004; deng 2011; scott 2008. 110 Comment made to andrew Kuchins from meeting with medvedev at the Valdai Conference in september 2008.
