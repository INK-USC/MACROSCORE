However, punishing organizations for wrongdoing is often unsatisfying, perhaps because organizations seem incapable of feeling pain (i.e., they lack perceived experience). Without the ability to suffer, corporations and organizations cannot slake people's thirst for retribution, even with large fines and other penalties. CEOs may provide a potential solution to this \"organization experience deficiency.\" As feeling humans who embody the organizations they lead, CEOs provide a possible source of suffering and therefore organizational redemption. Across five experiments and one pre-registered experiment, we found that CEOs imbue their organizations with the ability to feel (Experiments 1-4b) and ability to suffer (Experiments 2a, 2b, and 3), which makes organizational punishments more satisfying (Experiments 2a, 2b, and 3), and apologies more effective (Experiments 4a and 4b).

Recent research has shown that more abstract thinking about negative events fosters less uncertainty about why those events happened. The present research examined a downstream consequence of this effect, namely, whether causal uncertainty activates a goal to think more abstractly. We drew on principles of goal activation, to show that after leading participants to feel more uncertain about a negative event, they were more likely to resume an experience that afforded an opportunity to think more abstractly ( i.e., focusing on similarities rather than differences; Experiments 1A and 1B). In further support of our motivational framework, we also show that after leading participants to feel more uncertain about a negative event, they no longer exhibited a more positive attitude toward an experience that afforded an opportunity to think more abstractly once they had the opportunity to actually engage in more abstract thinldng (Experiment 2).

We proposed that ambivalence and certainty moderate one another's relationship with temporal attitude stability.

In three studies, we used two-stage designs in which attitudes were assessed twice with an interval ranging from one to twelve months between measurements.

Under extreme social and political circumstances, fear may lead people to emigrate from their land to protect themselves and their families. While ideology is related to differences in behavioral fear reactivity, little is known about how it moderates the effect of fear on flight intentions. In a large experimental study (N = 243), we examined our hypothesis that this moderating effect is context-dependent, such that the context's relation to the ideology determines its influence. In ideologically-irrelevant contexts, because rightists (versus leftists) are assumed to be more behaviorally reactive to fear, their willingness to consider flight should be more affected. In ideologically-relevant intergroup contexts, however, rightist ideology provides clear reaction guidelines ruling out flight, and therefore fear should have a weaker effect on rightists' (versus leftists') flight tendencies. Our findings supported these predictions, and their significance is discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to classify novel exemplars as part of a social category that had a narrower latent scope in a verbal task.

The present research investigated the interpersonal effects of contagion in the context of immoral behavior. The findings from two experiments revealed that after participants came into both indirect and direct physical contact with a moral transgressor, they experienced more state guilt. Further, the effect was moderated by disgust sensitivity - namely, after touching an unethical person, those with high disgust sensitivity reported more guilt than those with low disgust sensitivity. This is the first research to demonstrate that physical contact with a morally tainted person can affect one's own immorality (i.e., guilt) and hence provides evidence for \"moral transfer.\" These findings further highlight disgust sensitivity as an important mechanism undergirding psychological contagion.

Although anthropomorphism may lead to unlikely or incorrect judgments, it fostered accurate sex-differentiation of macaque faces due to an appropriate generalization from the sexually dimorphic cues that distinguish human male and female faces to macaques. As predicted, Koreans performed better than Caucasians in sex-differentiating macaque faces, a difference mediated by Koreans' greater use of sexually dimorphic eye height cues. These results extend and disambiguate evidence of East Asian superiority in sex-differentiating human faces. Whereas an own-race advantage might explain the previous but not the present findings, both can be explained by East Asians' keener sensitivity to sexually dimorphic cues, perhaps owing to the greater subtlety of such cues in East Asian faces. Implications of this sensitivity for other cultural differences in person perception are discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In Study 2 (N=30), participants level of RMA was manipulated experimentally via social norm feedback.

We hypothesized that holistic face processing is more integral to perceiving aesthetic preference and feature-based processing is more integral to sexual preference.

This study examined whether the interplay of race and age would moderate perceptions of hostility by having participants evaluate facial expressions of multiply-categorizable targets. Using a facial emotion change-detection task, we assessed evaluations of onset\/offset of anger and happiness on faces of young and old Black and White men. Significant age by race interactions were observed: while participants perceived anger as lasting longer and appearing sooner on old compared to young White faces, this relationship was reversed for Black faces, with participants perceiving anger lasting longer and appearing sooner on young compared to old Black faces. Similar results were found for perceived happiness. These results suggest that perception during cross-categorization may be more complex than the simple additive function proposed by the double-jeopardy hypothesis, such that co-activation of other stereotypes may sometimes confer a protective benefit against bias.

In seven studies, we examine the consequences of a brief interruption during a financial risk decision. We identify a fundamental feature inherent in an interruption's temporal structure-a repeat exposure to the decision stimuli- and find that this reexposure reduces decision stimuli's subjective novelty. This reduced novelty in turn reduces decision makers' apprehension and increases the amount of risk they take in a wide range of risky financial decision contexts. Consistent with our theoretical framework, this interruption effect disappears when a stimulus's subjective novelty is restored after an interruption. We further find that these consequences are often unique to interruptions are often do not result from other interventions (e.g., time pressure and elongated thinking); this is because an interruption's unique temporal structure (which results in a repeat exposure to the decision stimuli) underlies its consequences. Our findings shed light on how and when interruptions during decision making can influence risk taking.","author_address":"[Kupor, Daniella M.] Boston Univ, Mkt, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Liu, Wendy; Amir, On] Univ Calif San Diego, Mkt, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","reprint_address":"Kupor, DM (reprint author), Boston Univ, Mkt, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","author_email":"dkupor@bu.edu; wendy.liu@rady.ucsd.edu; oamir@ucsd.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","publisher_address":"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0093-5301","eISSN":"1537-5277","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":44.0,"issue":"6","DOI_WOS":"10.1093\/jcr\/ucx092","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000432334000002","pg":"1205-1219","author_last_WOS":"Kupor","author_first_WOS":"Daniella M.","published":"APR 2018","pdf_filename":"Kupor_JournConsRes_2018_QpK","claim2_abstract":"We further \ufb01nd that these conse-quences are often unique to interruptions are often do not result from other inter-ventions (e.g., time pressure and elongated thinking)","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"758","claim2_box":"(x1: 430.36 y1: 316.08) (x2: 467.05 y2: 338.06)","claim3a_concretehyp":"in study 3A we tested this possibility by di-rectly comparing the effect of an interruption to the effectof time pressure; we predicted that an interruption wouldincrease risk taking and that time pressure would not. | All participants were asked to imagine that theywere choosing between two options: option A offered a100% chance of $5, while option B offered a 50% chanceof $12 and a 50% chance of $0.","claim3a_pg":"9 | 9","claim3a_start":"709 | 1486","claim3a_box":"(x1: 104.43 y1: 221.63) (x2: 261.14 y2: 261.13) | (x1: 87.25 y1: 413.54) (x2: 188.65 y2: 453.09)","claim3b_testspec":"An omnibus chi-square revealed that condition signifi-cantly influenced risk decisions, | post-hocs revealed | Further, participants in theunexpected interruption condition took greater risk thandid participants in the time pressure condition (v2 \u00bc 4.76,p \u00bc .029)","claim3b_pg":"9 | 9 | 9","claim3b_start":"4520 | 4671 | 5345","claim3b_box":"(x1: 319.63 y1: 436.67) (x2: 443.98 y2: 452.98) | (x1: 473.39 y1: 459.86) (x2: 548.46 y2: 464.54) | (x1: 440.22 y1: 599.15) (x2: 348.63 y2: 638.65)","claim4_inftest":"participants in theunexpected interruption condition took greater risk thandid participants in the time pressure condition (v2 \u00bc 4.76,p \u00bc .029)","claim4_pg":"9","claim4_start":"5354","claim4_box":"(x1: 475.32 y1: 599.15) (x2: 348.63 y2: 638.65)","corr_author":"Daniella Kupor","corr_email":"dkupor@bu.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"Going against the Flow: The Effects of Dynamic Sensorimotor Experiences on Consumer Choice","author_last_CR":"Kwon","author_first_CR":"Mina","pub_year_CR":2018,"DOI_CR":"10.1093\/jcr\/ucx107","ISSN_CR":"0093-5301","publication_CR":"Journal of Consumer Research","pub_short":"JournConsRes","paper_id":"Wwr","author_full":"Kwon, Mina; Adaval, Rashmi","title_WOS":"Going against the Flow: The Effects of Dynamic Sensorimotor Experiences on Consumer Choice","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH","language":"English","keywords":"sensory motor experiences; embodied cognition; choice; affect; norms","keywords_plus":"SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; INTERPERSONAL TOUCH; GROUNDED COGNITION; EMBODIED COGNITION; BRAND EVALUATION; SELF; JUDGMENTS; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; IMAGERY","abstract":"Sensorimotor experiences of going against the flow can affect the choices consumers make.

Viewing such time-money tradeoffs in terms of a reservation wage rate for consumers, we identify a wage-rate asymmetry between two elicitation procedures: (a) Money-Elicit (MEL): state the minimum amount of money, M, that you would accept in return for spending a given number of hours, T; and (b) Time-Elicit (TEL): state the maximum number of hours, T, that you would spend in return for accepting a given amount of money, M. While these procedures are normatively equivalent, we propose that TEL (vs. MEL) wage rates are higher because time scarcity receives a higher weight in TEL judgments. In eight studies including both hypothetical and real settings, we document the wage-rate asymmetry, the time scarcity process, and a downstream consequence of TEL (vs. MEL) reducing the likelihood of accepting a time-money tradeoff. We discuss the implications for practice, and for research on wage rates, time versus money, procedural invariance, and scarcity.","author_address":"[Monga, Ashwani] Rutgers Business Sch Newark & New Brunswick, Mkt, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [May, Frank; Bagchi, Rajesh] Virginia Tech, Mkt, 2023 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Bagchi, Rajesh] Virginia Tech, Pamplin Coll Business, 2023 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","reprint_address":"Monga, A (reprint author), Rutgers Business Sch Newark & New Brunswick, Mkt, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.","author_email":"amonga@business.rutgers.edu; fmay@vt.edu; rbagchi@vt.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","publisher_address":"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0093-5301","eISSN":"1537-5277","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":44.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1093\/jcr\/ucx066","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000416481300008","pg":"833-852","author_last_WOS":"Monga","author_first_WOS":"Ashwani","published":"DEC 2017","pdf_filename":"Monga_JournConsRes_2017_l4J","claim2_abstract":"While these procedures are normativelyequivalent, we propose that TEL (vs. MEL) wage rates are higher because timescarcity receives a higher weight in TEL judgments.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"696","claim2_box":"(x1: 406.43 y1: 306.72) (x2: 442.19 y2: 328.65)","claim3a_concretehyp":"IV: Elicitation procedure (TEL vs. MEL) \u0003 timescarcity (control vs. low vs. high) Replicate core effect in hypothetical time-money tradeoff for store wait.

This article examines a new signal of self-expressiveness: whether the product is polarizing-that is, whether some people strongly like the product and other people strongly dislike the product. Eight studies examine how polarization and its associated indicator in the online domain (a bimodal distribution of user star ratings) affects consumer preferences. The results indicate that polarizing products are perceived to be more self-expressive and to serve as stronger indicators of one's tastes and personality. As a result, people find products with bimodal rating distributions to be more desirable when they experience temporary or chronic low self-concept clarity. Further, people evaluate products with bimodal distributions more favorably in consumption contexts in which self-expression is important. These effects emerge when the bimodal distribution pertains to a self-expressive attribute (e.g., style) but not when it pertains to a non-self-expressive attribute (e.g., quality). Last, the effect is especially strong when people have the motivation to express an individual-rather than group-level identity. Hence, polarizing products are seen as vehicles for individual self-expression.","author_address":"[Rozenkrants, Bella] Stanford Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wheeler, S.

Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this greenfeminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, genderidentity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors.","author_address":"[Brough, Aaron R.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Mkt, 3555 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Wilkie, James E.

In contrast, this research shows that the impact of corporate social responsibility can extend beyond public relations and customer goodwill to influence the way consumers evaluate a company's products. Specifically, this research documents that acts of social goodwill-even when they are unrelated to the company's core business, as in the case of charitable giving-can alter product perceptions, such that products of companies engaged in prosocial activities are perceived as performing better. More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company's prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the moral undertone of the company's motivation for engaging in socially responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the company's behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by benevolence. By documenting that social goodwill can benefit consumer perceptions of product performance, these findings show that doing good can indeed translate into doing well.","author_address":"[Chernev, Alexander] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Mkt, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Blair, Sean] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","reprint_address":"Chernev, A (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Mkt, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.","author_email":"ach@northwestern.edu; sean-blair@kellogg.northwestern.edu","funding":"MSI [4-1731]","publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","publisher_address":"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0093-5301","eISSN":"1537-5277","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":41.0,"issue":"6","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/680089","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000350807600006","pg":"1412-1425","author_last_WOS":"Chernev","author_first_WOS":"Alexander","published":"APR 2015","pdf_filename":"Chernev_JournConsRes_2015_OOb","claim2_abstract":"More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company\u2019s prosocialactions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumerscan directly observe and experience the product.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"884","claim2_box":"(x1: 268.99 y1: 295.64) (x2: 445.46 y2: 317.26)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Specifically, we examinedwhether and how information about a company\u2019s charitablegiving in\ufb02uences consumer taste perceptions in the contextof a wine-tasting task. | We argued that consumers who were aware of the com-pany\u2019s socially responsible behavior would perceive itsproducts as being functionally superior\u2014a perception thatin the current experiment translated to better taste.","claim3a_pg":"4 | 5","claim3a_start":"5568 | 2419","claim3a_box":"(x1: 446.02 y1: 602.10) (x2: 407.52 y2: 639.54) | (x1: 63.76 y1: 613.06) (x2: 261.97 y2: 650.50)","claim3b_testspec":"To testthis prediction, we analyzed the standardized data using aregression model in which perceived product performancewas a function of the company\u2019s engagement in sociallyresponsible behavior, consumer expertise, and their inter-action. | Consistent with our prediction, analysis at mean lev- | els of expertise","claim3b_pg":"5 | 5 | 5","claim3b_start":"2636 | 2876 | 2930","claim3b_box":"(x1: 265.45 y1: 645.94) (x2: 80.82 y2: 705.29) | (x1: 83.46 y1: 700.73) (x2: 292.95 y2: 705.29) | (x1: 317.00 y1: 78.08) (x2: 379.22 y2: 82.64)","claim4_inftest":"revealed that respondents who were awareof the winery\u2019s monetary donations to a charitable causerated the wine as tasting better (M p 5.07, SD p 1.30; Np 28) than did those who were unaware (M p 4.36, SDp 1.70; N p 28; b p .49, SE p 26, p ! .05).","claim4_pg":"5","claim4_start":"2947","claim4_box":"(x1: 382.72 y1: 78.08) (x2: 509.70 y2: 126.48)","corr_author":"Alexander Chernev","corr_email":"ach@northwestern.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"Consuming Experiential Categories","author_last_CR":"Shah","author_first_CR":"Anuj K.","pub_year_CR":2014,"DOI_CR":"10.1086\/677893","ISSN_CR":"0093-5301","publication_CR":"Journal of Consumer Research","pub_short":"JournConsRes","paper_id":"OaN","author_full":"Shah, Anuj K.; Alter, Adam L.","title_WOS":"Consuming Experiential Categories","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH","language":"English","keywords":null,"keywords_plus":"CONSUMPTION; PREFERENCES; SATIATION; PERCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; JUDGMENTS; OUTCOMES; VARIETY; CHOICE; MONEY","abstract":"How do we maximize enjoyment and minimize displeasure over a variety of events? Previous research has discussed how consumers might focus on savoring individual events or distribute appealing and unappealing events across time to maximize happiness. Building on this work, the current research shows that consumers track not just individual events but also \"categories\" of events. Consequently, a person who visits a modern art gallery, a classic art gallery, the opera, and a symphony concert could either construe these as four distinct experiences or as two categories of experiences (art galleries and musical performances). Consumers seem to naturally consider experiential categories. For positive experiences, consumers are reluctant to choose in a way that eliminates categories, but the opposite is true for negative experiences. People may do this because eliminating categories leads to a greater subjective feeling of making progress in a hedonic experience.","author_address":"[Shah, Anuj K.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Alter, Adam L.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA","reprint_address":"Shah, AK (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","author_email":"anuj.shah@chicagobooth.edu; aalter@stern.nyu.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","publisher_address":"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0093-5301","eISSN":"1537-5277","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":41.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/677893","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000345227600005","pg":"965-977","author_last_WOS":"Shah","author_first_WOS":"Anuj K.","published":"DEC 2014","pdf_filename":"Shah_JournConsRes_2014_OaN","claim2_abstract":"For positive experiences, consumers are reluctantto choose in a way that eliminates categories, but the opposite is true for negativeexperiences.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"890","claim2_box":"(x1: 383.48 y1: 266.82) (x2: 313.07 y2: 289.36)","claim3a_concretehyp":"First, participants were randomly assigned to acondition where they would sample six milk chocolates (apositive experience) or six dark chocolates (a negative ex-perience). | We expected that people would immediately eliminate cate-gories more often when tasting the unpleasant dark chocolates","claim3a_pg":"8 | 8","claim3a_start":"1642 | 2517","claim3a_box":"(x1: 93.93 y1: 447.49) (x2: 93.31 y2: 485.92) | (x1: 53.80 y1: 622.82) (x2: 290.64 y2: 639.34)","claim3b_testspec":"Choosing a chocolate from the brand that had only onesample remaining would eliminate that category from futurechoices.

On the basis of this association, experiments 2 and 3 show that BW (vs. color) imagery promotes high-level (vs. low-level) construal, leading to sorting objects on the basis of high-level (vs. low-level) features, segmenting behaviors into broader (vs. narrower) units, and interpreting actions as ends (vs. means).

The results of five studies suggest that the neglected Delboeuf illusion may explain how the size of dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to overserve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones. A countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware. Although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate with attention and education, changing the color of one's dinnerware or tablecloth may help attenuate them. By showing that the Delboeuf illusion offers a mechanistic explanation for how dinnerware size can bias serving and intake, we open new theoretical opportunities for linking illusions to eating behavior and suggest how simple changes in design can improve consumer welfare.","author_address":"[Van Ittersum, Koert] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Wansink, Brian] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","reprint_address":"Van Ittersum, K (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.","author_email":"koert.vanittersum@mgt.gatech.edu; wansink@cornell.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","publisher_address":"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0093-5301","eISSN":"1537-5277","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":39.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/662615","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000306373600001","pg":"215-228","author_last_WOS":"Van Ittersum","author_first_WOS":"Koert","published":"AUG 2012","pdf_filename":"Van_Ittersum_JournConsRes_2012_gw38","claim2_abstract":"A countercyclicalsinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and therelative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"655","claim2_box":"(x1: 497.25 y1: 296.67) (x2: 523.21 y2: 318.29)","claim3a_concretehyp":"When the diameter ratio between the target serv-ing size and the dinnerware is:H1a: smaller than 0.5 (but larger than 0, which is typ-ical with larger dinnerware), consumers servemore than the target serving size.H1b: larger than 0.5 (but smaller than 1, which is typicalwith smaller dinnerware), consumers serve lessthan the target serving size. | When the diameter ratio approaches zero (i.e., the di-ameter of the serving size approaches zero) or one (i.e., thediameter of the serving size approaches the diameter of thedinnerware), perceptual biases disappear because there is nolonger contrast and assimilation.

Participants watched a simulated crime and were asked to identify the culprit from a photographic lineup. After voicing their identification decisions participants were prompted to re-examine the lineup. Half ot the participants then received confirming feedback for their decisions, regardless of whether they shifted to a new picture or not. Later on, a different experimenter escorted participants to a second room and administered the same lineup again. In Experiment 1 (N = 432), biased instructions were used to encourage choosing, and when participants were prompted to re-examine the lineup 70% changed their identification decisions and selected a different picture When that new selection was reinforced with feedback and participants weie given a second opportunity to identify the culprit at a later time, 72% selected the picture they shifted to as the culprit. Participants who made their decisions more quickly were less likely to shift, but accuracy did not predict shifting. This general pattern of findings was replicated using unbiased instructions in Experiment 2 (N = 237).

One factor thought to motivate suspects' inclination to waive their rights stems from the acquiescence bias whereby suspects mindlessly comply with interrogators' requests. However, research bearing on the phenomenology of innocence has demonstrated the power of innocents' mindset, which could motivate some innocent suspects to waive their rights knowingly (instead of mindlessly complying). To test these ideas, participants (N = 178) were (a) rightfully (guilty) or wrongfully (innocent) accused of wrongdoing during an experimental session, (b) administered 1 of 2 forms that by signing either waived or invoked their rights to a student advocate, and (c) given questions to assess their degree of knowing during the decision-making process (i.e., extent to which individuals were cognizant of their decisions). Results demonstrated that unknowing innocent and guilty individuals tended to passively comply, engaging in a pre-interrogation acquiescence bias by signing waive and invoke forms at similar rates. But, as participants became more cognizant of their decisions, they acquiesced at lower rates and their change from acquiescence differed depending on their status. As innocents became more cognizant, they signed the waiver form at higher rates than the invoke form, thereby demonstrating that innocence can motivate some suspects to knowingly forgo their rights. Conversely, as guilty individuals became more cognizant, they signed the invoke form at higher rates than the waiver form. These findings have implications for reforming pre-interrogation protocols, protecting suspects' civil liberties, and preventing innocents from offering false self-incriminating evidence. Public Significance Statement Innocent and guilty people uniquely approach the decision to forgo their Miranda rights. All people who do not understand the decision process passively comply with interrogators' requests and forgo their rights, but guilty people with better understanding exercise their rights regardless of interrogators' requests. Problematically, innocents with better understanding forgo their rights regardless of interrogators' requests-suggesting that Miranda rights, as currently administered, serve an opposite purpose than originally intended.","author_address":"[Scherr, Kyle C.; Normile, Christopher J.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Psychol, Sloan Hall 101, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Bierstetel, Sabrina J.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Psychol, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Franks, Andrew S.] Lake Super State Univ, Dept Psychol, Sault Ste Marie, MI USA; [Hawkins, Ian] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","reprint_address":"Scherr, KC (reprint author), Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Psychol, Sloan Hall 101, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.","author_email":"kyle.scherr@cmich.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":42.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/lhb0000265","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000425495400003","pg":"26-36","author_last_WOS":"Scherr","author_first_WOS":"Kyle C.","published":"FEB 2018","pdf_filename":"Scherr_LawHuman_2018_a8AB","claim2_abstract":"As innocents became more cognizant,they signed the waiver form at higher rates than the invoke form, thereby demonstrating that innocencecan motivate some suspects to knowingly forgo their rights.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1577","claim2_box":"(x1: 343.53 y1: 352.54) (x2: 327.05 y2: 377.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"However, other research suggests that as innocent sus-pects become increasingly cognizant of their situation, they will bemore likely to sign the waiver form than the invoke form (knowinghypothesis).","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"4394","claim3a_box":"(x1: 353.62 y1: 220.97) (x2: 347.31 y2: 258.99)","claim3b_testspec":"The second set of results focuses onknowing innocent participants comparing their signature decisionsbetween the waive and invoke forms and is followed by the sameanalysis among knowing guilty participants.","claim3b_pg":"6","claim3b_start":"1855","claim3b_box":"(x1: 159.86 y1: 396.97) (x2: 211.28 y2: 434.99)","claim4_inftest":"However, results identified different and distinct patterns amongthe signature decisions of knowing participants.

We hypothesized that perpetrators high on uncertainty avoidance would respond better to negotiators who use formal language and legitimize their position with reference to law, procedures, and moral codes. Data were transcriptions of 53 negotiations from a Dutch-German police training initiative, where police negotiators interacted with a high (German) and low (Dutch) uncertainty-avoidant mock perpetrator. Consistent with accounts of cross-cultural interaction, negotiators tended to achieve more alignment in within-culture interactions compared to cross-cultural interactions. Moreover, German negotiators, who scored higher on uncertainty avoidance than the Dutch negotiators, were found to use more legitimizing messages and more formal language than their Dutch counterparts. Critically, irrespective of the negotiators cultural background, the use of these behaviors was a significant moderator of the degree to which negotiator and perpetrator aligned their communicative frames: Using legitimizing and formal language helped with German perpetrators but had no effect on Dutch perpetrators. Our findings show the effects of cultural background on communication alignment and demonstrate the benefits of using more formal language and messages that emphasize law and regulations when interacting with perpetrators high on uncertainty avoidance.","author_address":"[Giebels, Ellen; Oostinga, Miriam S.

If improvements are observed, these are limited and overall comprehension remains low. It is unclear, however, why this occurs. It is possible that current simplification techniques do not effectively simplify the features of complexity, present in standardized instructions, which have the greatest effect on jurors' comprehension. It is not yet known, however, how much each feature of complexity individually affects jurors' comprehension. To investigate this, the authors used existing data from published empirical studies to examine how simplifying each feature of complexity affects mock jurors' application of instructions, as jurors can only apply instructions to the extent they understand them. The results suggest that reducing the conceptual complexity and proportion of supplementary information was associated with increased application of the instructions; however, reducing both the linguistic complexity and amount of information, and providing the instructions in a written format was not. In addition, results showed an unexpected adverse effect of simplification-reducing the amount of information was associated with an increase in the punitiveness of mock jurors' verdicts, independently of the instruction content. Together, these results suggest a need to make jury instructions comprehensible, highlight the key principles in the decision-process, and identify a way to eliminate the negative effect of reducing the amount of information. Addressing these needs is essential for developing a simplification technique that maximizes jurors' comprehension and application of instructions, while minimizing the previously overlooked negative effects of simplification.","author_address":"[Baguley, Chantelle M.; McKimmie, Blake M.; Masser, Barbara M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, McElwain Bldg, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","reprint_address":"Baguley, CM (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, McElwain Bldg, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","author_email":"c.baguley@uq.edu.au","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":41.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/lhb0000234","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000405175400006","pg":"284-304","author_last_WOS":"Baguley","author_first_WOS":"Chantelle M.","published":"JUN 2017","pdf_filename":"Baguley_LawHuman_2017_AWLO","claim2_abstract":"In addition, results showed an unexpected adverse effect of simplification\u2014reducing the amount of information was associated with an increase in the punitiveness of mock jurors\u2019verdicts, independently of the instruction content.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1368","claim2_box":"(x1: 210.40 y1: 293.34) (x2: 292.10 y2: 317.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The aim of this study is to examine how simplifying each featureof complexity individually affects mock jurors\u2019 application of instruc-tions. | Finally, we found an effect not pre-dicted\u2014reducing the amount of information was significantly as-sociated with an increase in verdict punitiveness, independently ofthe dominant focus of the instruction content (see Table 3)","claim3a_pg":"3 | 12","claim3a_start":"6577 | 3369","claim3a_box":"(x1: 315.00 y1: 660.98) (x2: 324.87 y2: 688.00) | (x1: 410.17 y1: 601.38) (x2: 523.41 y2: 640.00)","claim3b_testspec":"A weighted standard multiple regression analysis was conductedto investigate whether simplifying the individual features of com-plexity was associated with increased application of the instruc-tions.","claim3b_pg":"12","claim3b_start":"884","claim3b_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 550.98) (x2: 67.75 y2: 589.00)","claim4_inftest":"Amount of informationc \u0003.30\u0002\u0002 \u00033.16 .002 [\u0003.04, \u0003.01] \u0003.24","claim4_pg":"13","claim4_start":"4328","claim4_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 154.84) (x2: 545.50 y2: 158.50)","corr_author":"Chantelle M.

Extant research suggests that MHCs can be effective in reducing recidivism, but also demonstrates that effectiveness varies as a function of characteristics of the participants (e.g., criminal history) and the program (e.g., coercion). Less is known regarding the extent to which process-related factors (e.g., length of participation, time between referral and receipt of services) impact effectiveness. Prior research also is limited by a focus on recidivism during MHC as opposed to postexit. To address these knowledge gaps, we examined recidivism 1 year postexit for a group of MHC participants (n = 57) and offenders receiving treatment as usual (TAU; n = 40), total N = 97. We also investigated the influence of individual characteristics and process factors on changes in jail days 1 year preentry to 1 year postexit for MHC participants. Overall, results provide some evidence supporting the effectiveness of MHCs. MHC participants had significantly fewer jail days, but not charges or convictions, relative to TAU participants. Among MHC participants, graduation from the MHC, presence of co-occurring substance use, and longer length of MHC participation were associated with greater reductions in jail days. Other process factors were unrelated to reductions in recidivism. Findings suggest that MHCs may be particularly effective for high-risk participants and that time spent in a MHC has positive effects on recidivism, regardless of graduation status.","author_address":"[Lowder, Evan M.; Desmarais, Sarah L.; Baucom, Daniel J.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Psychol, 640 Poe Hall,Campus Box 7650, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","reprint_address":"Lowder, EM (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Psychol, 640 Poe Hall,Campus Box 7650, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.","author_email":"emlowder@ncsu.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":40.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/lhb0000168","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000373108300002","pg":"118-127","author_last_WOS":"Lowder","author_first_WOS":"Evan M.","published":"APR 2016","pdf_filename":"Lowder_LawHuman_2016_vjaw","claim2_abstract":"MHC participants had significantly fewer jail days, but not charges or convictions, relative toTAU participants.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1291","claim2_box":"(x1: 155.18 y1: 292.54) (x2: 188.72 y2: 307.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Our specific aims are todetermine whether (a) there are significant differences in post-program charges, convictions, and jail days between MHC partic-ipants and a comparison group of offenders with mental illnesses;(b) individual factors (i.e., graduation status, presence of co-occurring substance use, and level of charge) are associated withchanges in pre- and post-program jail days among MHC partici-pants; and (c) process factors (i.e., time in program, time betweenreferral and program entry, and time between referral and firstreceipt of mental health services) are associated with changes inpre- and post-program jail days among MHC participants.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"930","claim3a_box":"(x1: 191.94 y1: 242.98) (x2: 258.12 y2: 358.00)","claim3b_testspec":"For Aim 1 between-groups comparisons, we first conducted a propensity score analysisusing available covariates (i.e., age, gender, and race) to match thecomparison group to the MHC group. | Negative binomial regressionresults for these analyses are presented in Table 2.","claim3b_pg":"4 | 5","claim3b_start":"3245 | 3251","claim3b_box":"(x1: 470.96 y1: 605.98) (x2: 443.71 y2: 644.00) | (x1: 437.63 y1: 298.88) (x2: 492.65 y2: 314.00)","claim4_inftest":"Results showed a significant effect of MHC partic-ipation on post-program jail days served (model fit: \u00062 \u0002 13.50,p \u0002 .001, AIC \u0002 574.01, BIC \u0002 581.73), adjusting for propensity | PS \u00041.24 .47 7.03\u0002\u0002 .29 [.12, .72 | score.","claim4_pg":"5 | 5 | 6","claim4_start":"4333 | 5128 | 0","claim4_box":"(x1: 360.30 y1: 506.98) (x2: 546.01 y2: 534.00) | (x1: 56.00 y1: 692.54) (x2: 305.02 y2: 697.00) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 77.98) (x2: 69.24 y2: 83.00)","corr_author":"Evan M.

Study Part A explored how PTP and jury deliberations affect juror\/jury verdicts, memory, and impressions of the defendant and attorneys. One week before viewing a criminal trial mock-jurors (N = 320 university students) were exposed to Neg-PTP or unrelated crime stories (No-PTP). Two days later deliberating jurors came to a group decision, whereas nondeliberating jurors completed an unrelated task before making an individual decision. Neg-PTP jurors were more likely to vote guilty, make memory errors, and rate the defendant lower in credibility. Deliberation reduced Neg-PTP jurors' memory accuracy and No-PTP jurors' guilty verdicts (leniency bias). Jurors' memory and ratings of the defendant and prosecuting attorney significantly mediated the effect of PTP on guilt ratings. Study Part B content analyzed 30 mock-jury deliberations and explored how PTP influenced deliberations and ultimately jury decisions. Neg-PTP juries were more likely than No-PTP juries to discuss ambiguous trial evidence in a proprosecution manner and less likely to discuss judicial instructions and lack of evidence. All Neg-PTP juries mentioned PTP, after instructed otherwise, and rarely corrected jury members who mentioned PTP. Discussion of ambiguous trial evidence in a proprosecution manner and lack of evidence significantly mediated the effect of PTP on jury-level guilt ratings. Together the findings suggest that judicial admonishments and deliberations may not be sufficient to reduce PTP bias, because of memory errors, biased impressions, and predecisional distortion.","author_address":"[Ruva, Christine L.] Univ South Florida Sarasota Manatee, Dept Psychol, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Guenther, Christina C.] Univ S Florida, Dept Mental Hlth Law & Policy, Tampa, FL USA","reprint_address":"Ruva, CL (reprint author), Univ South Florida Sarasota Manatee, Dept Psychol, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA.","author_email":"ruva@usf.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":39.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/lhb0000117","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000355838800008","pg":"294-310","author_last_WOS":"Ruva","author_first_WOS":"Christine L.","published":"JUN 2015","pdf_filename":"Ruva_LawHuman_2015_K47e","claim2_abstract":"Neg-PTP jurors were more likely to vote guilty, make memory errors, and rate thedefendant lower in credibility.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"866","claim2_box":"(x1: 221.53 y1: 254.34) (x2: 229.66 y2: 268.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We expected PTP to have a significant main effect onindividual mock-jurors\u2019 predeliberation and postsourcememory verdicts and guilt ratings.

In this study Bandura et al.'s (1996) Moral Disengagement (MD) scale and the Impulse Control (IC) scale of the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory (WAI; Weinberger & Schwartz, 1990) served as proxies for proactive and reactive antisocial cognition, respectively. It was hypothesized that proactive antisocial cognition (MD) would mediate the Factor 1-violence relationship and that both proactive antisocial cognition and reactive antisocial cognition (IC) would mediate the Factor 2-violence relationship. A 3-wave path analysis of data from 1,354 adjudicated delinquents produced results consistent with the first part of the hypothesis (i.e., proactive antisocial mediation of the Factor 1-violence relationship) but inconsistent with the second part of the hypothesis (i.e., only proactive antisocial cognition mediated the Factor 2-violence relationship). Whereas the direct path from Factor 1 to violent offending was no longer significant when MD and IC were taken into account, the direct path from Factor 2 to violent offender remained significant even after MD and IC were included as mediators. This suggests that whereas proactive antisocial cognition plays a major role in mediating the Factor 1-violence relationship, the Factor 2-violence relationship is mediated by proactive antisocial cognition and variables not included or not adequately covered in the current study.","author_address":"[Walters, Glenn D.] Kutztown State Univ, Dept Criminal Justice, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA; [DeLisi, Matt] Iowa State Univ, Dept Sociol, Iowa City, IA USA","reprint_address":"Walters, GD (reprint author), Kutztown State Univ, Dept Criminal Justice, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA.","author_email":"walters@kutztown.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":39.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/lhb0000123","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000357816000003","pg":"350-359","author_last_WOS":"Walters","author_first_WOS":"Glenn D.","published":"AUG 2015","pdf_filename":"Walters_LawHuman_2015_YBDZ","claim2_abstract":"It was hypothesized that proactive antisocial cognition(MD) would mediate the Factor 1\u2013violence relationship and that both proactive antisocial cognition andreactive antisocial cognition (IC) would mediate the Factor 2\u2013violence relationship.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"742","claim2_box":"(x1: 284.60 y1: 244.34) (x2: 411.17 y2: 268.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether proactiveantisocial cognition, as measured by a scale currently availablefrom the 11-wave (interview) Pathways database (moral disen-gagement; MD), and reactive antisocial cognition, as measured byanother scale currently available from the Pathways study (impulsecontrol; IC), were capable of mediating the relationship betweenthe two PCL: YV factor scores and subsequent violent or aggres-sive offending (AGG).","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"5275","claim3a_box":"(x1: 315.00 y1: 421.74) (x2: 391.07 y2: 505.33)","claim3b_testspec":"A path analysis was conducted in which the PCL:YV Factor 1 and 2 scores at baseline (Wave 0) served as theindependent variables, the proactive (MD) and reactive (IC) cog-nitive variables at Wave 1 served as mediators, and the summedaggressive offending variety score over Waves 2 through 6 servedas the dependent variable. | Assuch, bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals were usedto evaluate the significance of the total, direct, and indirect effectsobtained in this study (i.e., for an effect to be significant theconfidence interval should not include zero).","claim3b_pg":"4 | 4","claim3b_start":"765 | 1366","claim3b_box":"(x1: 98.40 y1: 223.79) (x2: 144.28 y2: 283.65) | (x1: 278.05 y1: 324.12) (x2: 222.30 y2: 372.83)","claim4_inftest":"PCL-F1 \u00a1 MD-1 \u00a1 AGG-2\u20136 0.053 0.013 0.131","claim4_pg":"7","claim4_start":"4612","claim4_box":"(x1: 56.00 y1: 585.34) (x2: 286.51 y2: 589.00)","corr_author":"Glenn D.

The similar lineup contained individuals who were similar in appearance to the actual culprit and the dissimilar lineup contained individuals who were dissimilar in appearance to the actual culprit. After their identifications, witnesses were given confirming feedback (\"Good job! You identified the suspect.\") or no feedback. The experimenter then feigned having accidentally given the witnesses the wrong photo lineup. After telling witnesses to disregard whatever they saw in the first lineup, the experimenter gave witnesses the \"correct\" (culprit-present) lineup and told the witnesses to do their best to identify the culprit. Identifying a dissimilar individual and receiving confirming feedback after a misidentification had independent impairing effects on memory for the original culprit. Results extend the traditional conceptualization of the postidentification feedback effect by showing that confirming feedback not only distorts witnesses' retrospective self-reports, but it also impairs recognition memory for the culprit.","author_address":"[Smalarz, Laura; Wells, Gary L.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Psychol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","reprint_address":"Smalarz, L (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Psychol, West 112 Lagomarcino Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.","author_email":"lsmalarz@iastate.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":38.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/lhb0000078","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000349173700008","pg":"283-292","author_last_WOS":"Smalarz","author_first_WOS":"Laura","published":"JUN 2014","pdf_filename":"Smalarz_LawHuman_2014_gwpg","claim2_abstract":"Identifying a dissimilar individual and receivingconfirming feedback after a misidentification had independent impairing effects on memory for theoriginal culprit.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1197","claim2_box":"(x1: 310.22 y1: 283.34) (x2: 179.03 y2: 307.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We hypothesized that confirming feedback would be most detri-mental to participants\u2019 memories of the culprit when it reinforcedthe identification of someone who is relatively dissimilar in ap-pearance to the actual culprit.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"4412","claim3a_box":"(x1: 306.00 y1: 274.00) (x2: 415.20 y2: 312.55)","claim3b_testspec":"We tested the effects of confirming feedback and the similaritymanipulation on identification accuracy using a logistic regressionin which feedback, similarity, and the feedback-by-similarity in-teraction were specified as categorical predictors of identificationaccuracy.","claim3b_pg":"7","claim3b_start":"100","claim3b_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 308.88) (x2: 82.23 y2: 357.00)","claim4_inftest":"Consistent with the confirming-feedback impairment hypothe-sis, confirming feedback reduced participants\u2019 abilities to accu-rately identify the culprit from the culprit-present lineup, Wald \u00024.32, p \u0002 .04, exp(B) \u0002 2.09, 95% CI [exp(B)] \u0002 [1.04, 4.17],Cohen\u2019s h \u0002 .34.","claim4_pg":"7","claim4_start":"561","claim4_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 385.88) (x2: 116.04 y2: 434.00)","corr_author":"Laura Smalarz ","corr_email":"lsmalarz@iastate.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"The effects of negotiated and delegated apologies in settlement negotiation.","author_last_CR":"Robbennolt","author_first_CR":"Jennifer K.","pub_year_CR":2013,"DOI_CR":"10.1037\/lhb0000020","ISSN_CR":"0147-7307","publication_CR":"Law and Human Behavior","pub_short":"LawHuman","paper_id":"4dQq","author_full":"Robbennolt, Jennifer K.","title_WOS":"The Effects of Negotiated and Delegated Apologies in Settlement Negotiation","publication_WOS":"LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR","language":"English","keywords":"apology; negotiation; impression; management; motives","keywords_plus":"REMORSE; EXPECTANCIES; CONSEQUENCES; ATTRIBUTIONS; FORGIVENESS; CONFESSION; VIOLATIONS; ATTITUDES; IDENTITY; OUTCOMES","abstract":"Previous work has explored the influence that apologies have on the settlement of civil legal disputes.

A longitudinal, 2-wave, cross-lagged study was used in a cohort of attorneys (N = 107) from the Wisconsin State Public Defender's Office. We assessed changes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and functional impairment over a 10-month period and tested the effects of intensity of contact with trauma-exposed clients on symptom levels over time. Attorneys demonstrated strong and significant symptom stability over time in PTSD, depression, functional impairment, and levels of exposure. Analyses involving cross-lagged panel correlation structural equation modeling path models revealed that attorneys' levels of exposure to trauma-exposed clients had significant positive effects, over time, on PTSD, depression, and functional impairment. Gender, age, years on the job, and office size did not predict any of the outcomes. Level of exposure to trauma-exposed clients predicted reduction of weekly working hours over time, but there was no reciprocal relationship between PTSD, depression, and functional impairment and level of exposure over time. These findings underscore the central role of exposure to trauma-exposed clients in predicting mental health outcomes and emphasize the need to support attorneys by managing the intensity of exposure as well as addressing emerging symptoms.","author_address":"[Levin, Andrew] Westchester Jewish Community Serv, Hartsdale, NY 10530 USA; [Levin, Andrew; Neria, Yuval] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Besser, Avi] Sapir Acad Coll, Ctr Res Personal Life Transit & Stressful Life Ev, Dn Hof Ashkelon, Israel; [Albert, Linda] State Bar Wisconsin, Wisconsin Lawyers Assistance Program, Madison, WI USA; [Smith, Deborah] Wisconsin State Publ Defenders Off, Assigned Counsel Div, Madison, WI USA; [Neria, Yuval] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, New York, NY 10032 USA","reprint_address":"Levin, A (reprint author), Westchester Jewish Community Serv, 141 N Cent Ave, Hartsdale, NY 10530 USA.","author_email":"aplevin2@cs.com","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":36.0,"issue":"6","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/h0093993","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000314275300009","pg":"538-547","author_last_WOS":"Levin","author_first_WOS":"Andrew","published":"DEC 2012","pdf_filename":"Levin_LawHuman_2012_0Ry2","claim2_abstract":"Analyses involving cross-lagged panel correlation structural equa-tion modeling path models revealed that attorneys\u2019 levels of exposure to trauma-exposed clients hadsignificant positive effects, over time, on PTSD, depression, and functional impairment.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1110","claim2_box":"(x1: 248.82 y1: 371.84) (x2: 420.42 y2: 395.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The present study useda longitudinal design in a subsample of attorneys from ourpreviously reported cohort of the Wisconsin State Public De-fender\u2019s Office (Levin et al., 2011) to assess changes in symp-toms of PTSD, depression, and functional impairment over a10-month period.

It analyzed re-arrest data collected during an 18-month period post assessment. Three issues were central, which have been ignored in previous research on family violence risk assessment: (1) analyzing five refined measures of behavioral recidivism, (2) determining whether perpetrator characteristics and types of family and household relationships (beyond just heterosexual intimate partners) moderate the empirical relations between the DVSI-R and the behavioral recidivism measures, and (3) determining whether structured clinical judgment about the imminent risk of future violence to the victim or to others corresponds with recidivism predicted by the DVSI-R total numeric risk scores. The empirical findings showed that the DVSI-R had significant predictive accuracy across all five measures of recidivism. With one exception, these relations did not vary by gender, age, or ethnicity; and again with one exception, no significant evidence was found that types of family or household relationships moderated those empirical relations. In short, the evidence suggested that the DVSI-R was a robust risk assessment instrument, having applicability across different types of perpetrators and different types of family and household relationships. Finally, the empirical findings showed that structured clinical judgment about imminent risk-to-victim and risk-to-others corresponded with the prediction of recidivism by the DVSI-R total numeric risk scores, but the effects of those scores were significantly stronger than the perceived risk-to-victim or the perceived risk-to-others.","author_address":"Univ Calif Riverside, Presley Ctr Crime & Justice Studies, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","reprint_address":"Williams, KR (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Presley Ctr Crime & Justice Studies, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.","author_email":"Kirk.Williams@ucr.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":36.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/h0093977","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000302725300005","pg":"120-129","author_last_WOS":"Williams","author_first_WOS":"Kirk R.","published":"APR 2012","pdf_filename":"Williams_LawHuman_2012_PK5J","claim2_abstract":"The empirical findings showed that the DVSI-R had significant predictive accuracyacross all five measures of recidivism.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1091","claim2_box":"(x1: 195.75 y1: 277.34) (x2: 253.88 y2: 291.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Those scores were significantlyassociated with all recidivism measures, with the AUC coefficients(AUC \u0001 .621\u2013.726)","claim3a_pg":"6","claim3a_start":"1308","claim3a_box":"(x1: 429.38 y1: 182.51) (x2: 382.84 y2: 208.63)","claim3b_testspec":"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was the pri-mary analytic technique to address the central empirical issues ofthis study (Quinsey et al., 2006, pp. 49 \u2013 60).","claim3b_pg":"5","claim3b_start":"2389","claim3b_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 584.88) (x2: 215.25 y2: 611.00)","claim4_inftest":"Total all offenses combined .657 [.640\u2013.676]","claim4_pg":"6","claim4_start":"5610","claim4_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 712.34) (x2: 358.49 y2: 716.00)","corr_author":"Kirk R.William","corr_email":"kirkrw@uci.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"The effect of wanted posters on prospective and retrospective memory.","author_last_CR":"McAllister","author_first_CR":"Hunter A.","pub_year_CR":2011,"DOI_CR":"10.1007\/s10979-010-9224-6","ISSN_CR":"0147-7307","publication_CR":"Law and Human Behavior","pub_short":"LawHuman","paper_id":"JYPB","author_full":"McAllister, Hunter A.; Baiamonte, Brandon A.; Ory, Justin H.; Scherer, Joseph A.","title_WOS":"The Effect of Wanted Posters on Prospective and Retrospective Memory","publication_WOS":"LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR","language":"English","keywords":"Wanted poster; Eyewitness; Prospective memory","keywords_plus":null,"abstract":"The experiment tested prospective and retrospective memory for a person pictured on a wanted poster.

Annl Rev Sociol 23:263-287, 1997), which motivates individuals to conform their beliefs about policy-relevant facts to their cultural values. In a study involving a diverse sample of Americans (N = 1,496), we found that individuals who are hierarchical and communitarian tend to support OCLs, while those who are egalitarian and individualistic tend to oppose them. These relationships, moreover, fit the cultural cognition hypothesis: that is, rather than directly influencing OCL support, cultural values, mediated by affect, shaped individuals' perceptions of how effectively OCLs promote public health and safety. We discuss the implications for informed public deliberation over OCLs.","author_address":"[Kahan, Dan M.] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Braman, Donald] George Washington Univ, Sch Law, Washington, DC USA; [Monahan, John] Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Callahan, Lisa] Policy Res Associates, Delmar, NY USA; [Peters, Ellen] Decis Res, Eugene, OR USA; [Peters, Ellen] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","reprint_address":"Kahan, DM (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Law, POB 208215, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","author_email":"dan.kahan@yale.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER\/PLENUM PUBLISHERS","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0147-7307","eISSN":"1573-661X","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":34.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10979-008-9174-4","WOS_category":"Law; Psychology, Social","category":"Government & Law; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000275541700003","pg":"118-140","author_last_WOS":"Kahan","author_first_WOS":"Dan M.","published":"APR 2010","pdf_filename":"Kahan_LawHuman_2010_JYKk","claim2_abstract":"In a study involving a diverse sample of Americans(N = 1,496), we found that individuals who are hierar-chical and communitarian tend to support OCLs, whilethose who are egalitarian and individualistic tend tooppose them.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"694","claim2_box":"(x1: 51.02 y1: 373.03) (x2: 104.31 y2: 427.34)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Individ-ualism had a negative impact on the attitudes of bothwhites and nonwhites, but was larger in magnitude for theformer.","claim3a_pg":"12","claim3a_start":"1461","claim3a_box":"(x1: 256.89 y1: 385.56) (x2: 80.80 y2: 427.40)","claim3b_testspec":"Ordered logistical regression was performed to disentanglethe effect of various in\ufb02uences from one another (Table 3).The dependent variable was SUPPORT, the item thatmeasured the level of agreement with the statement\u2018\u2018people with psychiatric conditions like schizophreniashould be forced by law to get outpatient treatment from adoctor.\u2019\u2019","claim3b_pg":"11","claim3b_start":"353","claim3b_box":"(x1: 51.01 y1: 568.68) (x2: 84.61 y2: 647.88)","claim4_inftest":"Table 3 Ordered logistic regression analysis of support for OCLs","claim4_pg":"11","claim4_start":"2033","claim4_box":"(x1: 51.02 y1: 63.00) (x2: 281.20 y2: 66.73)","corr_author":"Dan M.

The authors build on this work by examining the impact of management ethnic representativeness-the degree to which the ethnic composition of managers in an organization mirrors or is misaligned with the ethnic composition of employees in that organization. To do so, they integrate signaling theory and a sense-making perspective into a relational demography framework to investigate why and for whom management ethnic representativeness may have an impact on interpersonal mistreatment at work. Specifically, in three complementary studies, the authors examine the relationship between management ethnic representativeness and interpersonal mistreatment. First, they analyze the relationship between management ethnic representativeness and perceptions of harassment, bullying, and abuse the next year, as moderated by individuals' ethnic similarity to others in their organizations in a sample of 60,602 employees of Britain's National Health Service. Second, a constructive replication investigates perceived behavioral integrity as an explanatory mechanism that can account for the effects of representativeness using data from a nationally representative survey of working adults in the United States. Third and finally, online survey data collected at two time points replicated these patterns and further integrated the effects of representativeness and dissimilarity when they are measured using both objective and subjective strategies. Results support the authors' proposed moderated mediation model in which management ethnic representation is negatively related to interpersonal mistreatment through the mediator of perceived behavioral integrity, with effects being stronger for ethnically dissimilar employees.","author_address":"[Lindsey, Alex P.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol, LD 124,402 N Blackford St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Avery, Derek R.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Business, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Dawson, Jeremy F.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [King, Eden B.] George Mason Univ, Dept Psychol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","reprint_address":"Lindsey, AP (reprint author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol, LD 124,402 N Blackford St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.","author_email":"aplindse@iupui.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0021-9010","eISSN":"1939-1854","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":102.0,"issue":"11","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/apl0000238","WOS_category":"Psychology, Applied; Management","category":"Psychology; Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000414766800004","pg":"1545-1563","author_last_WOS":"Lindsey","author_first_WOS":"Alex P.","published":"NOV 2017","pdf_filename":"Lindsey_JournAppPsych_2017_qNvQ","claim2_abstract":"Results support the authors\u2019 proposedmoderated mediation model in which management ethnic representation is negatively related to inter-personal mistreatment through the mediator of perceived behavioral integrity, with effects being strongerfor ethnically dissimilar employees","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1880","claim2_box":"(x1: 342.34 y1: 383.34) (x2: 243.64 y2: 417.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Ethnic dissimilarity will moderate the relation-ship between management representativeness and mistreat-ment, such that the relationship will be stronger for ethnicallydissimilar individuals when compared with more ethnicallysimilar individuals | The interactionterm is negative, suggesting that the relationship between manage-ment ethnic representativeness and mistreatment is more negativefor individuals who are more dissimilar to their colleagues in termsof ethnic background, thus providing support for Hypothesis 2.","claim3a_pg":"5 | 8","claim3a_start":"3582 | 1403","claim3a_box":"(x1: 374.95 y1: 111.08) (x2: 390.00 y2: 159.56) | (x1: 491.04 y1: 401.48) (x2: 546.03 y2: 450.79)","claim3b_testspec":"Within each hospital, the representativeness was calcu-lated to determine the extent to which employees in positions ofline management (accounting for 30% of respondents) were rep-resentative of the remainder of the workforce according to the fivemajor ethnic background categories used in the survey (and used inthe U.K. Census): White, Black\/Black British, Asian\/Asian Brit-ish, Mixed, or Other.

Drawing from conservation of resources (COR) theory, we propose that whether providing assistance to peers enhances or weakens newcomer help providers' resilience to such conflict-based resource drain (i.e., exhaustion) depends on both the type of help given (instrumental vs. emotional) and the orientation (more vs. less empowering) that newcomers adopt when providing it. We test our propositions on the basis of time-lagged data collected from newly hired call center representatives at the end of their first and sixth months on the job.

With the increasing recognition of the importance of time, it is informative to examine a question critical to the dispositional view of job satisfaction: Are genetic influences on job satisfaction stable across different time points? Drawing upon dispositional and situational perspectives on job satisfaction and recent research in developmental behavioral genetics, we examined whether the relative potency of genetic (i.e., the person) and environmental influences on job satisfaction changed over time in a 3-wave longitudinal twin study. Biometric behavioral genetics analyses showed that genetic influences accounted for 31.2% of the variance in job satisfaction measured at approximately Age 21, which was markedly greater than the 18.7% and 19.8% of variance explained by genetic factors at Age 25 and Age 30. Such genetic influences were mediated via positive affectivity and negative affectivity, but not via general mental ability. After partialing out genetic influences, environmental influences on job satisfaction were related to interpersonal conflict at work and occupational status, and these influences were relatively stable across the 3 time points. These results offer important implications for organizations and employees to better understand and implement practices to enhance job satisfaction.","author_address":"[Li, Wen-Dong] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management, Cheng Yu Tung Bldg,12 Chak Cheung St, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Wen-Dong] Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Stanek, Kevin C.; Ones, Deniz S.; McGue, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Zhang, Zhen] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Zhang, Zhen] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","reprint_address":"Li, WD (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management, Cheng Yu Tung Bldg,12 Chak Cheung St, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","author_email":"oceanbluepsy@gmail.com","funding":"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71072024]; Singapore Ministry of Education Research Grants [R-317-000-085-112, R-317-000-95-112, R-317-000-099-112, R-317-000-102-112]; U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [AA09367, AA11886]; National Institute of Mental Health [MH066140]; National Institute on Drug Abuse [DA05147, DA013240, DA036216]; Lingnan (University) College; Sun Yat-sen University","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0021-9010","eISSN":"1939-1854","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":101.0,"issue":"11","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/apl0000057","WOS_category":"Psychology, Applied; Management","category":"Psychology; Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000387964700006","pg":"1598-1619","author_last_WOS":"Li","author_first_WOS":"Wen-Dong","published":"NOV 2016","pdf_filename":"Li_JournAppPsych_2016_zKGr","claim2_abstract":"After partialing out genetic influences, environmentalinfluences on job satisfaction were related to interpersonal conflict at work and occupational status,and these influences were relatively stable across the 3 time points.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1430","claim2_box":"(x1: 284.23 y1: 333.34) (x2: 362.48 y2: 357.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypotheses 5 and 6: With possible genetic influences par-tialed out, environmental influences from occupational status(H5) and interpersonal conflict at work (H6) still affect jobsatisfaction over time","claim3a_pg":"6","claim3a_start":"3581","claim3a_box":"(x1: 322.00 y1: 107.94) (x2: 400.99 y2: 145.00)","claim3b_testspec":"Bivariate biometric analyseswere carried out to test (a) whether general mental ability, PA,and\/or NA mediated genetic influences on job satisfaction at thethree points in time (Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4), as well as themagnitudes of such mediating effects (Research Question 1); and(b) the stability and change of environmental influences related tooccupational status and interpersonal conflict at work on jobsatisfaction over time with genetic influences controlled for (Hy-potheses 5 and 6 as well as Research Questions 2 and 3).

Because the linear relationshipsbetween the focal constructs are more broadly accepted than ourhypothesized curvilinear relationships, we adopted a hierarchicalregression approach. This approach facilitates assessment of theincremental impact associated with the addition of the curvilinearrelationships we propose to each model, following the linear terms(Singh, 1998). In addition, we mean centered all of the indepen-dent variables in the regression models to ease interpretation of theinteractions (Preacher, Curran, & Bauer, 2006) and avoid issuesassociated with multicollinearity (Aiken & West, 1991).We began our hierarchical regression analyses for each outcomewith a main-effects-only model that included all controls and | linear effects (Model 1).

Toassess the curvilinear relationship between team efficacy and teamperformance, we then added a quadratic team efficacy term (Model3).

This question is important to explore as help seeking is commonly enacted in organizations and may come with reciprocation costs that may also diminish creativity. Results based on 291 employees in a single division of a large multinational organization revealed that seeking help predicted creativity and mediated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and creativity. However, help seekers also incurred reciprocation costs in that they tended to give more help to teammates, and giving help to teammates was negatively related to creativity. In general, giving higher levels of help attenuated the positive relationship between help seeking and creativity. We also tested an integrated model to show that help giving moderated the mediated relationship between intrinsic motivation and creativity via help seeking, such that higher levels of help giving attenuated this mediated effect. We discuss theoretical and practical implications recommending additional research regarding the interpersonal creative process in team contexts.","author_address":"[Mueller, Jennifer S.] Univ Penn, Dept Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kamdar, Dishan] Indian Sch Business, Dept Org Behav, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India","reprint_address":"Mueller, JS (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Management, 3620 Locust Walk,Suite 3014 SHDH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","author_email":"jennm@wharton.upenn.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0021-9010","eISSN":"1939-1854","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":96.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0021574","WOS_category":"Psychology, Applied; Management","category":"Psychology; Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000288584400004","pg":"263-276","author_last_WOS":"Mueller","author_first_WOS":"Jennifer S.","published":"MAR 2011","pdf_filename":"Mueller_JournAppPsych_2011_PKAw","claim2_abstract":"Results based on291 employees in a single division of a large multinational organization revealed that seeking helppredicted creativity and mediated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and creativity","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"494","claim2_box":"(x1: 411.07 y1: 203.34) (x2: 429.43 y2: 227.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"In this way, help seekingshould aid individual creativity by allowing the individual greaterlikelihood of accessing as well as integrating different ideas andperspectives held by teammates.Hypothesis 1: Seeking help from teammates during creativeproblem solving positively relates to individual-level creativ-ity.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"809","claim3a_box":"(x1: 197.62 y1: 211.84) (x2: 77.75 y2: 291.41)","claim3b_testspec":"we used multilevel modeling by em-ploying SAS PROC MIXED, which allowed us to control forgroup-level variance and nonindependence (Singer, 1998).

These effects were mediated by the leaders' LMX (leader member exchange) with their employees. Moreover, the tendency of leaders with higher LMX to escape punitive evaluations for their transgressions was stronger when those leaders were more valued within the organization.

The authors instead propose that self-concern and other-orientation are independent. The authors also propose that job performance, prosocial behavior, and personal initiative are a function of (a) individual-level attributes, such as job characteristics when employees are high in self-concern, and (b) group-level attributes, such as justice climate when employees are high in other-orientation. Three studies involving 4 samples of employees from a variety of organizations support these propositions. Implications are discussed for theory oil work behavior and interventions geared toward job enrichment and team-based working.","author_address":"[De Dreu, Carsten K.

Drawing on transaction cost economics and institutional theory, this study uncovers the critical influence of formal and informal institutions (i.e., legal effectiveness and networking expenditure) on the use of governance in deterring opportunism, as well as the moderating role of government support on the efficacy of governance mechanism. The findings from a buyer-supplier dyadic survey and 2secondary datasets reveal that legal effectiveness mitigates opportunism through increased use of both contractual and relational governance; in contrast, networking expenditure reduces opportunism through relational governance, yet increases opportunism via lowering contractual governance. In addition, contractual governance is more efficient in constraining opportunism when government support is high, whereas relational governance deters opportunism more when government support is low. These findings offer important implications for academic research and managerial practice.","author_address":"[Sheng, Shibin] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Collat Sch Business, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Zhou, Kevin Zheng] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Julie Juan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mkt, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Guo, Zhaoyang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China","reprint_address":"Guo, ZY (reprint author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.","author_email":"ssheng@uab.edu; kevinzhou@business.hku.hk; julieli@cityu.edu.hk; zyguo@xmu.edu.cn","funding":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CityU 11507615]","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0092-0703","eISSN":"1552-7824","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":46.0,"issue":"6","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s11747-018-0582-9","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000446505100004","pg":"1014-1031","author_last_WOS":"Sheng","author_first_WOS":"Shibin","published":"NOV 2018","pdf_filename":"Sheng_JournAcaMarkSci_2018_qdyg","claim2_abstract":"In addition, contractual governance is more efficientin constraining opportunism when government support is high","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1308","claim2_box":"(x1: 345.26 y1: 342.65) (x2: 296.03 y2: 359.60)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The negative relationship between contractual gover-nance and opportunism is stronger when governmentsupport is high than when it is low.","claim3a_pg":"7","claim3a_start":"3270","claim3a_box":"(x1: 325.04 y1: 173.86) (x2: 462.34 y2: 203.28)","claim3b_testspec":"For each moderating hypothesis, we comparedthe constrained model in which the path coefficient correspond-ing to the relationship of concern (i.e. the hypothesized moder-ated path) is constrained to remain equal across the two groupsversus an unconstrained model in which the path is estimatedfreely for each group.

Study 1 demonstrates this effect using an experimental manipulation of SBC related to clothing brands, and provides process evidence by analyzing coded thought listings. Study 2 provides convergent evidence by measuring SBC associated with smartphones, and followup analyses show that as SBC increases, the otherwise negative effect of NOWOM steadily transforms to become significantly positive. Study 3 replicates these results using a combination of a national survey conducted by J.D. Power investigating hotel stays and data drawn from TripAdvisor.

It is argued that in green partnerships firms leverage marketing and technology-related capabilities for value-enhancing purposes. The results show that announcements of green marketing partnerships have an immediate positive and significant effect on shareholder value, whereas announcements of green technology partnerships produce an immediate negative and significant effect. Nevertheless, green technology partnerships can accrue positive returns, but over a longer-term (1 year) period. In \"dirtier\" industries, it is more difficult to generate positive returns to green partnerships. Counterintuitively, though, in high-polluting industries, firms having a history of positive environmental performance experience lower financial gains from announcements of green partnerships than firms that were less environmentally responsible in the past.","author_address":"[Sadovnikova, Anna] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Pujari, Ashish] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, DSB 205,1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada","reprint_address":"Sadovnikova, A (reprint author), South Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.","author_email":"sadovna@mcmaster.ca; pujarid@mcmaster.ca","funding":"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada [752-2012-2051]","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0092-0703","eISSN":"1552-7824","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":45.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s11747-016-0490-9","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000394335500008","pg":"251-267","author_last_WOS":"Sadovnikova","author_first_WOS":"Anna","published":"MAR 2017","pdf_filename":"Sadovnikova_JournAcaMarkSci_2017_Geep","claim2_abstract":"The results showthat announcements of green marketing partnerships have animmediate positive and significant effect on shareholder val-ue, whereas announcements of green technology partnershipsproduce an immediate negative and significant effect","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"689","claim2_box":"(x1: 221.08 y1: 372.70) (x2: 286.24 y2: 427.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H2: Announcements of green marketing partnerships willhave a greater positive impact on firm market value thanannouncements of green technology partnerships.","claim3a_pg":"5","claim3a_start":"2303","claim3a_box":"(x1: 50.91 y1: 559.89) (x2: 262.98 y2: 589.30)","claim3b_testspec":"mean difference tests","claim3b_pg":"9","claim3b_start":"3344","claim3b_box":"(x1: 376.83 y1: 622.14) (x2: 461.28 y2: 626.67)","claim4_inftest":"The results of mean difference tests for green marketingversus green technology partnerships | for the event window (0; +1) alsoconfirm that average abnormal returns (AARs) differ acrosspartnership types at a significance level of p < .05, with themarketing partnership sample reporting positive means andthe technology partnership sample reporting negative means(Table W1, web appendix)","claim4_pg":"9 | 9","claim4_start":"3329 | 3467","claim4_box":"(x1: 317.47 y1: 622.14) (x2: 452.65 y2: 639.14) | (x1: 405.75 y1: 647.08) (x2: 410.26 y2: 713.86)","corr_author":"Anna Sadovnikova","corr_email":"sadovna@mcmaster.ca","version":1},{"title_CR":"Explaining the differing effects of corporate reputation across nations: a multilevel analysis","author_last_CR":"Swoboda","author_first_CR":"Bernhard","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1007\/s11747-015-0457-2","ISSN_CR":"0092-0703","publication_CR":"Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science","pub_short":"JournAcaMarkSci","paper_id":"Repb","author_full":"Swoboda, Bernhard; Puchert, Cathrin; Morschett, Dirk","title_WOS":"Explaining the differing effects of corporate reputation across nations: a multilevel analysis","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE","language":"English","keywords":"Corporate reputation; Cross-cultural research; Institutional theory; Multilevel structural equation modeling","keywords_plus":"STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; CONSUMER PRODUCT RESPONSES; GOODNESS-OF-FIT; EMERGING MARKETS; MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE; UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY; DECISION-MAKING; CULTURAL-VALUES; METHOD VARIANCE; BRAND","abstract":"Although multinational corporations increasingly use their reputation as an important differentiation criterion, little is known about the varying effects of corporate reputation in an international context.

This research adds the role of sponsor-sponsee similarity to the discussion of fit. The authors argue that similarity interacts with fit when conditions evoke suspicion or disrupt typical inferences regarding sponsorship relationships. Interaction is particularly important when the sponsor seeks to develop its image by association with a cause, and is also of consequence for the cause in terms of its branding. Three studies test sponsorship effects with respect to blood donation and cancer prevention organizations. Results support the predicted moderated mediation model, showing that similarity between a corporate sponsor and a sponsored cause can interact with fit, influencing sponsorship evaluations directly and shaping attitudes and behavioral intentions toward constituents indirectly.

Our analyses show that green marketing programs are being implemented by firms, and we find evidence of significant performance payoffs. Specifically the results indicate that green product and distribution programs positively affect firms' product-market performance, while green pricing and promotion practices are directly positively related to firms' return on assets. In addition, industry-level environmental reputation moderates the links between green marketing program components and firms' product-market and financial performance.

However, the extant research on organizational identity largely has overlooked the fact that an individual's \"self\" actually is a collection of multiple social identities. This study is the first to propose and empirically demonstrate that marketers can leverage customers' multiple societal roles (e.g., parent, environmentalist, professor) to build and reinforce their relationships with the firm. Specifically, the research introduces the concept of \"identity synergy.\" Identity synergy occurs when individuals' involvement with an organization facilitates their pursuit of other important social identities. Our study shows that customer perception of identity synergy is positively related to identification with an organization. Moreover, the study helps explain the process by which antecedents of organizational identity (identity affirmation, identity support, and value congruence) positively affect customer-firm relationships by proposing and testing identity synergy as a mediator between these antecedents and organizational identification. The study also contributes to our understanding of organizational identity theory by introducing the new concept of peer identification, or identification with other members of the organization, such as other customers or volunteers. The empirical evidence demonstrates identity synergy's role in building peer identification, as well as peer identification's role in building organizational identification.","author_address":"[Fombelle, Paul W.] Northeastern Univ, Coll Business Adm, Mkt Grp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jarvis, Cheryl Burke] So Illinois Univ, Coll Business, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Ward, James; Ostrom, Lonnie] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ USA","reprint_address":"Fombelle, PW (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Coll Business Adm, Mkt Grp, 202 Hayden Hall, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","author_email":"p.fombelle@neu.edu; cbjarvis@cba.siu.edu; James.Ward@asu.edu; lostrom@asu.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0092-0703","eISSN":"1552-7824","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":40.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s11747-011-0254-5","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000304166200006","pg":"587-604","author_last_WOS":"Fombelle","author_first_WOS":"Paul W.","published":"JUL 2012","pdf_filename":"Fombelle_JournAcaMarkSci_2012_vR3L","claim2_abstract":"Our studyshows that customer perception of identity synergy ispositively related to identification with an organization","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1091","claim2_box":"(x1: 245.67 y1: 447.76) (x2: 286.52 y2: 477.18)","claim3a_concretehyp":"An increase in perceived identity synergy is positivelyrelated to an increase in organizational identification.","claim3a_pg":"7","claim3a_start":"2780","claim3a_box":"(x1: 329.85 y1: 61.79) (x2: 536.24 y2: 78.73)","claim3b_testspec":"hypotheses weretested using structural equation modeling","claim3b_pg":"10","claim3b_start":"722","claim3b_box":"(x1: 219.06 y1: 236.12) (x2: 217.31 y2: 253.13)","claim4_inftest":"An increase in identitysynergy, in turn, was related to increased perceptions ofboth organizational identification (\u03b24 = .24, p < .01) | Identity synergy \u2192 Organizational identification H4 .24 15.37","claim4_pg":"10 | 11","claim4_start":"2739 | 2648","claim4_box":"(x1: 444.37 y1: 124.04) (x2: 523.99 y2: 153.46) | (x1: 53.86 y1: 599.03) (x2: 537.21 y2: 602.88)","corr_author":"Paul W.

Research on loyalty programs suggests that customers differentiate between loyalty to a company and loyalty to a loyalty program, yet little is known about the consequences of these two types of loyalty. Therefore, our study intends to make two main contributions: (1) improving our understanding of the constructs \"program loyalty\" and \"company loyalty\", (2) investigating the relative impact of the two types of loyalty on preference, intention, and purchase behavior for the case of a multi-firm loyalty program. Results indicate that company loyalty influences a customer's choice to visit a particular provider and to prefer it over competitors, but it is not a strong predictor of purchase behavior. Conversely, program loyalty is a far more important driver of purchase behavior. This implies that company loyalty primarily attracts customers to a particular provider and program loyalty ensures that once inside the store, more money is spent.","author_address":"[Evanschitzky, Heiner] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Mkt Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Ramaseshan, B.] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Mkt, Perth, WA 6149, Australia; [Woisetschlaeger, David M.; Backhaus, Christof] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Automot Management & Ind Prod, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Richelsen, Verena] Gelsenkirchen Univ Appl Sci, D-46397 Bocholt, Germany; [Blut, Markus] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Mkt, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","reprint_address":"Evanschitzky, H (reprint author), Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Mkt Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.","author_email":"h.evanschitzky@aston.ac.uk; ramaseshanb@cbs.curtin.edu.au; d.woisetschlaeger@tu-braunschweig.de; verenavogel@yahoo.de; markus.blut@tu-dortmund.de; c.backhaus@tu-braunschweig.de","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0092-0703","eISSN":"1552-7824","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":40.0,"issue":"5","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s11747-011-0272-3","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000306797400001","pg":"625-638","author_last_WOS":"Evanschitzky","author_first_WOS":"Heiner","published":"SEP 2012","pdf_filename":"Evanschitzky_JournAcaMarkSci_2012_OkKB","claim2_abstract":"Resultsindicate that company loyalty influences a customer\u2019s choiceto visit a particular provider and to prefer it over competitors,but it is not a strong predictor of purchase behavior.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"962","claim2_box":"(x1: 260.61 y1: 444.42) (x2: 289.12 y2: 486.31)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Company loyalty has a positive impact on | share of visits.","claim3a_pg":"5 | 5","claim3a_start":"3084 | 3201","claim3a_box":"(x1: 329.84 y1: 144.15) (x2: 502.86 y2: 148.68) | (x1: 391.97 y1: 169.04) (x2: 450.78 y2: 173.57)","claim3b_testspec":"we tested the hypotheses using three-stage leastsquare (3SLS) regression analysis | p < .01","claim3b_pg":"8 | 8","claim3b_start":"6 | 1854","claim3b_box":"(x1: 88.67 y1: 298.15) (x2: 186.53 y2: 315.15) | (x1: 306.13 y1: 298.14) (x2: 330.55 y2: 302.67)","claim4_inftest":"companyloyalty significantly influences share of visits (CL:\u03b3 = .981 | p < .01;","claim4_pg":"8 | 8","claim4_start":"1784 | 1854","claim4_box":"(x1: 253.34 y1: 696.63) (x2: 286.78 y2: 713.64) | (x1: 306.13 y1: 298.14) (x2: 333.24 y2: 302.67)","corr_author":"Heiner Evanschitzky","corr_email":"h.evanschitzky@aston.ac.uk","version":1},{"title_CR":"When does salespeople\u2019s customer orientation lead to customer loyalty?

It then investigates which type of customer orientation is more effective with regard to establishing and maintaining customer loyalty, given the specific situation.

Based on the theory of planned behavior, this study explores how control and convenience perceptions influence customers' utilitarian (speed of transaction) and hedonic (exploration) motivations for using an SST. In addition, we explore how trust in a service provider influences customers' future SST intentions. Two studies were undertaken to assess both users and nonusers' evaluations of an SST. The results revealed that perceived control and convenience do impact the intentions of customers to use an SST in the future; however, their impact was mediated through the constructs of speed of transaction, exploration, and trust. Increased control and convenience perceptions influenced exploration, trust and speed evaluations, which in turn were associated with stronger perceived value, higher SST satisfaction judgments, and increased SST usage intentions.

We experimentally investigate entry and bidding behavior in first-price and English clock auctions to determine the revenue implications of entry. Potential bidders observe their value and then decide whether or not to incur a cost to enter. We also vary whether or not bidders are informed regarding the number of entrants prior to placing their bids. Revenue equivalence is predicted in all four environments. We find that, regardless of whether or not bidders are informed, first-price auctions generate more revenue than English clock auctions. Within a given auction format, the effect of informing bidders differs. In first-price auctions, revenue is higher when bidders are informed, while the opposite is true in English clock auctions. The optimal choice for an auction designer who wishes to maximize revenue is a first-price auction with uninformed bidders.","author_address":"[Aycinena, Diego] Univ Rodario, Fac Econ, Calle 12C 6-25, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Rentschler, Lucas] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3500 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA","reprint_address":"Rentschler, L (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3500 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.","author_email":"lucas.rentschler@usu.edu","funding":"International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":21.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-017-9558-8","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000449291500010","pg":"924-949","author_last_WOS":"Aycinena","author_first_WOS":"Diego","published":"DEC 2018","pdf_filename":"Aycinena_ExpEco_2018_OkDO","claim2_abstract":"Wefind that, regardless of whether or not bidders are informed, first-price auctionsgenerate more revenue than English clock auctions.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"793","claim2_box":"(x1: 374.39 y1: 317.19) (x2: 260.28 y2: 345.60)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Consequently, we find that first-price auctions generate more revenuethan English clock auctions.","claim3a_pg":"11","claim3a_start":"483","claim3a_box":"(x1: 101.31 y1: 382.11) (x2: 165.13 y2: 398.55)","claim3b_testspec":"We use a 2 \t 2 design where we vary the auction format on a within-subjectbasis and the information structure on a between-subject basis. | Since behavior within a session may not be independent, we take a conservativeapproach in our analysis.

Meanwhile, many people experience competitive contexts as stressful. We use two laboratory experiments to investigate whether factors related to stress can help explain individual differences in tournament entry. Experiment 1 studies whether stress responses (measured as salivary cortisol) to taking part in a mandatory tournament predict individual willingness to participate in a voluntary tournament. We find that competing increases stress levels. This cortisol response does not predict tournament entry for men but is positively and significantly correlated with choosing to enter the tournament for women. In Experiment 2, we exogenously induce physiological stress using the cold-pressor task. We find a positive causal effect of stress on tournament entry for women but no effect for men. Finally, we show that although the effect of stress on tournament entry differs between the genders, stress reactions cannot explain the well-documented gender difference in willingness to compete.","author_address":"[Buser, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Buser, Thomas] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dreber, Anna] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mollerstrom, Johanna] George Mason Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ, ICES, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden","reprint_address":"Dreber, A (reprint author), Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.","author_email":"t.buser@uva.nl; anna.dreber@hhs.se; jmollers@gmu.com","funding":"Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (Handelsbankens Forskningsstiftelser); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Speerpunt Behavioural Economics of the University of Amsterdam","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":20.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-016-9496-x","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000401066400010","pg":"506-530","author_last_WOS":"Buser","author_first_WOS":"Thomas","published":"JUN 2017","pdf_filename":"Buser_ExpEco_2017_E2AP","claim2_abstract":"Thiscortisol response does not predict tournament entry for men but is positively andsignificantly correlated with choosing to enter the tournament for women.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"881","claim2_box":"(x1: 370.54 y1: 329.15) (x2: 374.32 y2: 357.56)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Given that some studies have found gender differences in the behavioralconsequences of stress responses, we will now investigate whether our null resultfor cortisol hides a differential response of men and women to the stress reactioncaused by the tournament.","claim3a_pg":"13","claim3a_start":"590","claim3a_box":"(x1: 62.36 y1: 399.74) (x2: 163.78 y2: 440.10)","claim3b_testspec":"In Column 1 of Table 4, we regress the choice ofcompensation scheme in Round 3 on standardized cortisol levels after the piece-rateperformance in Round 1, a female dummy and the interaction of the two.

A possible reason, and also a critique of laboratory corruption games, is that the experiment may fail to trigger the intended immorality frame in the minds of the participants, leading many to question the very raison d'etre of laboratory corruption games. To test this idea, we compare behavior in a harassment bribery game with a strategically identical but neutrally framed ultimatum game. The results show that fewer people, both as briber and bribee, engage in corruption in the bribery frame than in the alternative and the average bribe amount is lesser in the former than in the latter. These suggest that moral costs are indeed at work. A third treatment, which relabels the bribery game in neutral language, indicates that the observed treatment effect arises not from the neutral language of the ultimatum game but from a change in the sense of entitlement between the bribery and ultimatum game frames. To provide further support that the bribery game does measure moral costs, we elicit the shared perceptions of appropriateness of the actions or social norm, under the two frames. We show that the social norm governing the bribery game frame and ultimatum game frame are indeed different and that the perceived sense of social appropriateness plays a crucial role in determining the actual behavior in the two frames. Furthermore, merely relabelling the bribery game in neutral language makes no difference to the social appropriateness norm governing it. This indicates that, just as in the case of actual behavior, the observed difference in social appropriateness norm between bribery game and ultimatum game comes from the difference in entitlement too. Finally, we comment on the external validity of behavior in lab corruption games.","author_address":"[Banerjee, Ritwik] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark","reprint_address":"Banerjee, R (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.","author_email":"rbanerjee@econ.au.dk","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":19.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-015-9436-1","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000376426400011","pg":"240-267","author_last_WOS":"Banerjee","author_first_WOS":"Ritwik","published":"MAR 2016","pdf_filename":"Banerjee_ExpEco_2016_J4W9","claim2_abstract":"The results show that fewer people, both as briberand bribee, engage in corruption in the bribery frame than in the alternative and theaverage bribe amount is lesser in the former than in the latter.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"807","claim2_box":"(x1: 189.92 y1: 329.15) (x2: 308.78 y2: 357.56)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We find significant differences across BG and UG treatments both in terms of theproportion of subjects who demanded a bribe\/ultim and the amount of bribedemanded.","claim3a_pg":"13","claim3a_start":"707","claim3a_box":"(x1: 51.02 y1: 228.98) (x2: 94.05 y2: 257.38)","claim3b_testspec":"To test this idea,we compare behavior in a harassment bribery game with a strategically identical butneutrally framed ultimatum game. | The main result from the regression analysis, laid out in Table 2, is consistent withthe result from the mean difference tests discussed above\u2014","claim3b_pg":"1 | 14","claim3b_start":"673 | 167","claim3b_box":"(x1: 320.77 y1: 305.23) (x2: 187.57 y2: 333.63) | (x1: 51.02 y1: 344.91) (x2: 293.35 y2: 361.36)","claim4_inftest":"the bribe amount in theBG treatment is M42 lower than the ultim demanded in the UG treatment even aftercontrolling for gender, age, caste and log of household income [for a study of howcheating behavior depends on demographic characteristics, see Bucciol et al.(2013)]. | The difference is statistically significant as indicated in specification (2).","claim4_pg":"14 | 14","claim4_start":"310 | 580","claim4_box":"(x1: 293.44 y1: 356.88) (x2: 83.45 y2: 409.21) | (x1: 87.14 y1: 404.73) (x2: 388.33 y2: 409.21)","corr_author":"Ritwik Banerjee","corr_email":"rbanerjee@econ.au.dk","version":1},{"title_CR":"Social preferences and lying aversion in children","author_last_CR":"Maggian","author_first_CR":"Valeria","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1007\/s10683-015-9459-7","ISSN_CR":"1386-4157","publication_CR":"Experimental Economics","pub_short":"ExpEco","paper_id":"bGy8","author_full":"Maggian, Valeria; Villeval, Marie Claire","title_WOS":"Social preferences and lying aversion in children","publication_WOS":"EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS","language":"English","keywords":"Lying aversion; Deception; Social preferences; Children; Experiment","keywords_plus":"WHITE LIES; MORAL DISENGAGEMENT; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; DECEPTION; BEHAVIOR; ALTRUISM; AGE; EGALITARIANISM; TRUTHFULNESS","abstract":"While previous research has shown that social preferences develop in childhood, we study whether this development is accompanied by reduced use of deception when lies would harm others, and increased use of deception to benefit others.

Older children lie less than younger children and use self-justification to lie.","author_address":"[Maggian, Valeria] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] IZA, Bonn, Germany","reprint_address":"Villeval, MC (reprint author), Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.; Villeval, MC (reprint author), CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France.; Villeval, MC (reprint author), IZA, Bonn, Germany.","author_email":"valeria.maggian@unimib.it; villeval@gate.cnrs.fr","funding":"French National Research Agency (ANR, HEIDI) [11-EMCO-011 01]; LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-007]","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":19.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-015-9459-7","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000382035300008","pg":"663-685","author_last_WOS":"Maggian","author_first_WOS":"Valeria","published":"SEP 2016","pdf_filename":"Maggian_ExpEco_2016_bGy8","claim2_abstract":"Lying is driven mainly by selfish motives and envy.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"591","claim2_box":"(x1: 120.30 y1: 305.23) (x2: 329.95 y2: 309.71)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Selfish and envious children are more likely to lie than other-regardingchildren.","claim3a_pg":"19","claim3a_start":"1103","claim3a_box":"(x1: 96.43 y1: 273.31) (x2: 86.36 y2: 289.75)","claim3b_testspec":"The experiment consists of two stages and this was made common information.

Despite this, experiments have shown that groups struggle to coordinate on one of the many efficient equilibria. We apply a mechanism used successfully in continuous public goods games, the Hired Gun Mechanism (Andreoni and Gee in J. Public Econ. 96(11-12):1036-1046, 2012), to see if it can successfully get subjects across the threshold. When we use the mechanism to eliminate only inefficient equilibria, without addressing coordination, there is a modest but statistically insignificant improvement with the mechanism. However, when we hone the mechanism to eliminate all but one of the provision-point equilibria, thereby addressing the coordination issue, the mechanism moves all subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost immediately. In fact, after only one round using the hired gun mechanism, all subject are coordinating on the chosen equilibrium. The mechanism can be applied in settings where a group (1) has a plan for public good provision, (2) can measure contributions, (3) can fine members and (4) has an agreed upon standard for expected contributions. In these settings simple punishments, when focused on solving coordination as well as free riding, can greatly improve efficiency.","author_address":"[Andreoni, James] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Andreoni, James] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gee, Laura K.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA","reprint_address":"Gee, LK (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.","author_email":"laura.gee@tufts.edu","funding":"National Science Foundation [SES-1024683]; Science of Generousity Initiative","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":18.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-014-9392-1","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000350243000009","pg":"154-171","author_last_WOS":"Andreoni","author_first_WOS":"James","published":"MAR 2015","pdf_filename":"Andreoni_ExpEco_2015_AgQX","claim2_abstract":"However, when we hone the mechanism to elimi-nate all but one of the provision-point equilibria, thereby addressing the coordinationissue, the mechanism moves all subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost im-mediately.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1003","claim2_box":"(x1: 192.02 y1: 349.08) (x2: 92.97 y2: 389.55)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Prediction 2 We expect to see more symmetric efficient Nash equilibrium play inGunSelect.

A novel experimental environment is developed to capture the tension between increasing returns to group size and attaining a group policy closest to an ideal point. Subjects can move freely between locations, with group policy either fixed by location or determined by member vote. A primary goal is to assess which of two stability concepts common to the group formation literature predicts which groups agents sort into. The same set of Nash stable partitions exist in each condition, with the efficient, strong Nash stable state requiring subjects to form heterogeneous groups and compromise on policy. I find that subjects who are only able to move between locations with fixed policies always over-segregate, rather than build efficient heterogeneous groups. When mobility is combined with the ability to vote on local policy, most subjects reach the efficient partition. This shows outcomes cannot be determined by considering the existence of stable states alone and that consideration must also be given to subtle aspects of the system dynamics. Further, it suggests that experiments may play an important role in understanding these group formation dynamics.","author_address":"[Robbett, Andrea] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA","reprint_address":"Robbett, A (reprint author), Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.","author_email":"arobbett@middlebury.edu","funding":"Caltech Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":18.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-014-9418-8","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000359396900010","pg":"522-541","author_last_WOS":"Robbett","author_first_WOS":"Andrea","published":"SEP 2015","pdf_filename":"Robbett_ExpEco_2015_WE5V","claim2_abstract":"I find that subjects who are only able to move between locations with fixedpolicies always over-segregate, rather than build efficient heterogeneous groups.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"994","claim2_box":"(x1: 81.58 y1: 364.87) (x2: 388.34 y2: 381.31)","claim3a_concretehyp":"I find that the aggregate payoffs are higher in the Votingcondition than in the Fixed Policy condition and this difference is significant","claim3a_pg":"10","claim3a_start":"1622","claim3a_box":"(x1: 159.42 y1: 582.17) (x2: 361.03 y2: 598.56)","claim3b_testspec":"The average efficiency over the final five periods of one population of 8 subjects is taken as a singleobservation.

Out-group bidders react to this bias and reduce significantly their bids, causing an average decay of their earnings throughout the game, with cumulative effects that generate unequal outcomes.

Recently, the core-selecting Combinatorial Clock Auction (CCA) has been used as an alternative to the SMRA in a number of countries promising strong incentives for truthful bidding and high efficiency as a result. We analyze the efficiency and auctioneer revenue of the CCA in comparison to SMRA and examine bidding behavior in both formats. The experiments are based on two value models, which resemble single- and multiband spectrum sales in the field. Such applications often allow for thousands of possible bundles. Bidders in the CCA submitted bids for only a fraction of all bundles with a positive valuation. Bundles were selected based on synergies and payoff after the primary bid rounds. As a consequence, we found efficiency of the CCA to be significantly lower than that of SMRA in the multi-band value model and auctioneer revenue of the CCA to be lower in both value models. In addition, we characterize several properties of the auction format, which result from the two-stage design and the payment and activity rules.","author_address":"[Bichler, Martin; Shabalin, Pasha; Wolf, Juergen] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany","reprint_address":"Bichler, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany.","author_email":"bichler@in.tum.de; shabalin@in.tum.de; wolf@in.tum.de","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":16.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-013-9350-3","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000327060000004","pg":"511-545","author_last_WOS":"Bichler","author_first_WOS":"Martin","published":"DEC 2013","pdf_filename":"Bichler_ExpEco_2013_Vv25","claim2_abstract":"As a consequence, we found efficiency of the CCA to be sig-nificantly lower than that of SMRA in the multi-band value model and auctioneerrevenue of the CCA to be lower in both value models.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1175","claim2_box":"(x1: 135.83 y1: 377.48) (x2: 272.85 y2: 406.88)","claim3a_concretehyp":"he efficiency of the CCA was significantlylower than that of SMRA in the multiband value model in the lab","claim3a_pg":"15","claim3a_start":"665","claim3a_box":"(x1: 221.18 y1: 364.76) (x2: 316.46 y2: 381.28)","claim3b_testspec":"First, we present efficiency and revenue of the different auction formats on an aggre-gate level.","claim3b_pg":"14","claim3b_start":"1723","claim3b_box":"(x1: 51.80 y1: 357.52) (x2: 92.79 y2: 373.76)","claim4_inftest":"Multiband SMRA Lab 98.46 % 93.85 % 80.71 % 0Multiband CCA Lab 89.28% 56.71 % 33.83 % | (SMRA \u0007\u2217 CCA,p < 0.012).","claim4_pg":"15 | 15","claim4_start":"372 | 771","claim4_box":"(x1: 51.91 y1: 292.93) (x2: 325.23 y2: 308.87) | (x1: 319.55 y1: 376.72) (x2: 98.75 y2: 393.31)","corr_author":"Martin Bichler","corr_email":"bichler@in.tum.de","version":1},{"title_CR":"Are happiness and productivity lower among young people with newly-divorced parents?

Under controlled conditions, it measures university students' subjective well-being and productivity (in a standardized laboratory task). It finds no evidence that either of these is negatively associated with recent parental divorce. If anything, happiness and productivity appear to be slightly greater, particularly among males, if their parents have divorced.

We first examine treatments where participants are confronted with the 10 decisions to be made either simultaneously or sequentially. The second treatment variable is the order of appearance of the ten lottery pairs. Probabilities of winning are ranked either in increasing, decreasing, or in random order. Lastly, payoffs were increased by a factor of ten in additional treatments. The rate of inconsistencies was significantly higher in sequential than in simultaneous treatment, in increasing and random than in decreasing treatment. Both experience and salient incentives induce a dramatic decrease in inconsistent behaviors. On the other hand, risk aversion was significantly higher in sequential than in simultaneous treatment, in decreasing and random than in increasing treatment, in high than in low payoff condition. These findings suggest that subjects use available information which has no value for normative theories, like throwing a glance at the whole connected set of pairwise choices before making each decision in a connected set of lottery pairs.","author_address":"[Masclet, David] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France; [Levy-Garboua, Louis; Maafi, Hela; Terracol, Antoine] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Levy-Garboua, Louis; Masclet, David] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Maafi, Hela] GREGHEC HEC Sch Management, Paris, France","reprint_address":"Masclet, D (reprint author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France.","author_email":"louis.levy-garboua@univ-paris1.fr; maafi@hec.fr; david.masclet@univ-rennes1.fr; terracol@univ-paris1.fr","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":15.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-011-9293-5","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000299926400008","pg":"128-144","author_last_WOS":"Levy-Garboua","author_first_WOS":"Louis","published":"MAR 2012","pdf_filename":"Le_vy_Garboua_ExpEco_2012_Vv2X","claim2_abstract":"The rate of inconsistencies was significantlyhigher in sequential than in simultaneous treatment, in increasing and random thanin decreasing treatment.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"968","claim2_box":"(x1: 207.64 y1: 347.49) (x2: 146.84 y2: 375.59)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Table 3b indicates that, on average, there are more inconsis-tencies under the INC frame than under the DEC frames.","claim3a_pg":"8","claim3a_start":"288","claim3a_box":"(x1: 141.82 y1: 270.04) (x2: 283.37 y2: 286.66)","claim3b_testspec":"According to a Wilcoxonsigned rank test on the fact of being inconsistent at the sequence level, the differ-ence between the INC and DEC treatments is significant","claim3b_pg":"8","claim3b_start":"404","claim3b_box":"(x1: 286.39 y1: 282.10) (x2: 284.23 y2: 310.76)","claim4_inftest":"(z = \u22122.722; p < 0.01).","claim4_pg":"8","claim4_start":"567","claim4_box":"(x1: 287.65 y1: 306.20) (x2: 388.56 y2: 310.76)","corr_author":"Louis L\u00e9vy-Garboua","corr_email":"louis.levy-garboua@univ-paris1.fr","version":1},{"title_CR":"Saving behavior and cognitive abilities","author_last_CR":"Ballinger","author_first_CR":"T.

This paper reports the results from a series of experiments comparing the performance of three auction formats in such complex and risky settings. In the experiment, every bidder knows the private value for the project but only a single insider bidder knows the common-value part. In addition to the standard second-price and English auctions we test the \"qualifying auction,\" a two-stage format commonly used in the sale of complex and risky assets. The qualifying auction has a fully \"revealing\" equilibrium that implements the revenue-maximizing outcome but it also has an uninformative \"babbling\" equilibrium in which bidders place arbitrarily high bids in the first stage. In the experiments, the latter equilibrium has more drawing power, which causes the qualifying auction to perform worse than the English auction and only slightly better than a sealed-bid second-price auction. Compared to the two other formats, the English auction is roughly 40% more efficient, yields 50% more revenues, avoids windfall profits for the insider, while protecting uninformed bidders from losses.","author_address":"[Goeree, Jacob K.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Polydoro, Angelo] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Chen, Roy] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Boone, Jan] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","reprint_address":"Goeree, JK (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Mail Code 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","author_email":"jacob.goeree@gmail.com","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"1386-4157","eISSN":"1573-6938","pub_year_WOS":2009.0,"volume":12.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s10683-009-9221-0","WOS_category":"Economics","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000271399000003","pg":"417-436","author_last_WOS":"Boone","author_first_WOS":"Jan","published":"DEC 2009","pdf_filename":"Boone_ExpEco_2009_Ok5L","claim2_abstract":"Compared to the two other formats, the English auction is | roughly 40% more efficient, yields 50% more revenues, avoids windfall profits forthe insider, while protecting uninformed bidders from losses.","claim2_pg":"1 | 2","claim2_start":"1283 | 19","claim2_box":"(x1: 155.52 y1: 402.75) (x2: 388.57 y2: 407.31) | (x1: 51.80 y1: 58.34) (x2: 294.64 y2: 74.82)","claim3a_concretehyp":"TheEnglish auction is highly efficient, produces the most revenue, and provides modestprofits for the informed and uninformed bidders.","claim3a_pg":"14","claim3a_start":"723","claim3a_box":"(x1: 373.05 y1: 194.09) (x2: 249.79 y2: 222.32)","claim3b_testspec":"E = vwinner \u2212 vlowvhigh \u2212 vlow \u00d7 100% | where vwinner is the private value of the auction\u2019s winner, vlow is the lowest privatevalue within the group, and vhigh is the highest private value within the group.","claim3b_pg":"9 | 10","claim3b_start":"1879 | 19","claim3b_box":"(x1: 164.47 y1: 527.88) (x2: 275.89 y2: 532.27) | (x1: 51.80 y1: 58.34) (x2: 362.59 y2: 74.83)","claim4_inftest":"EEnglish \u0005\u2217\u2217 E2nd price \u223c EQualifying. | The magnitude of the inefficiencies that occur in the second price auction can beinferred from the second row of Table 2.

We develop a temporal account of how disagreement episodes begin and are resolved during team interactions, testing explanatory factors at multiple levels: team context (team conflict states and team productivity), individual characteristics and perceptions (individual status and perceptions of team viability), and behavioral patterns (problem solving versus off-task communication) with a statistical discourse analysis of 32,448 turns of talk by 259 employees during 43 team meetings. As hypothesized, problem-solving behaviors (e.g., describing problems and proposing solutions) ignited content disagreements, often by participants who perceived greater team viability. In contrast, after off-task behaviors or talk by higher status team members, participants started fewer content disagreements. Moreover, content disagreements started by higher status individuals were more likely than those started by others to be resolved with agreements, especially via agreements with higher status individuals. Also, problem-solving behaviors facilitated the resolution of disagreement episodes with agreement, whereas off-task behaviors hindered them. Contrary to our hypotheses, team conflict states and productivity were not linked to starting or ending disagreements.

Combining extant stress models with theoretical considerations from team research, we address temporal variations in the buffering effect of trust in teammates. We hypothesize that trust buffers the negative effect of objective physical activity on perceived strain and that this buffering effect is more pronounced during later performance episodes (i.e., when employees complete a series of temporally distinguishable tasks). We tested the hypotheses with a sample of professional firefighters who completed a sequence of 3 performance episodes in a high-fidelity simulation environment. Each participant was equipped with a smartphone capturing individual motion activity, which we used as an indicator of physical activity. In line with our hypotheses, multilevel modeling revealed a buffering effect of trust on the relationship between physical activity and perceived strain. Importantly, this buffering effect was more pronounced in the second performance episode as compared with the first performance episode. Our findings add a temporal perspective to the understanding of the effectiveness of job resources.

Specifically, we examine how the trend, or trajectory, of job complexity over time can explain unique variance of employee job strain. Across two longitudinal data sets, we consistently find that, with the average level of job complexity during a given period held constant, a positive job complexity trajectory (i.e., an increasing trend in complexity) is associated with higher employee job strain. Based on job-demand-control theory and the exposure-reactivity model, we further establish that job autonomy and employee emotional stability jointly moderate the relationship between job complexity trajectory and employee job strain. Specifically, for employees with high emotional stability, job autonomy mitigates the job strain brought by positive job complexity trajectory, whereas for employees with low emotional stability, job autonomy does not help to reduce the adverse effect of the increasing trend. These findings not only contribute to extend the understanding of the job complexity - strain relationship, but also suggest a promising, dynamic avenue to study the effects of work characteristics on employee well-being as well as other outcomes.

Despite emerging interest in this behavior, the antecedents of constructive deviance remain unclear, with particular ambiguity concerning the relationship between organizational identity and constructive deviance.

In Studies 1a and 1b, we develop and validate a measure of normative conflict. In Study 2, we conduct a preliminary test of the model with employed students and find that identity is positively related to constructive deviance only when normative conflict is high. In Study 3, we replicate and extend the model to show that the moderating effect of normative conflict is mediated by experienced psychological discomfort and that organizational identity is positively related to constructive deviance among working adults only when discomfort is high. In total, our findings demonstrate the utility of the normative conflict model for explaining when constructive deviance is mostly likely to occur in the workplace.","author_address":"[Dahling, Jason J.] Coll New Jersey, Dept Psychol, 2000 Pennington Rd, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA; [Gutworth, Melissa B.] Montclair State Univ, Feliciano Sch Business, Montclair, NJ USA","reprint_address":"Dahling, JJ (reprint author), Coll New Jersey, Dept Psychol, 2000 Pennington Rd, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA.","author_email":"dahling@tcnj.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0894-3796","eISSN":"1099-1379","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":38.0,"issue":"8","DOI_WOS":"10.1002\/job.2194","WOS_category":"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management","category":"Business & Economics; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000412180500002","pg":"1167-1182","author_last_WOS":"Dahling","author_first_WOS":"Jason J.","published":"OCT 2017","pdf_filename":"Dahling_JournOrgBehavior_2017_58km","claim2_abstract":"In Study 2, we conduct a preliminary test of the model withemployed students and find that identity is positively related to constructive deviance only whennormative conflict is high.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1166","claim2_box":"(x1: 321.73 y1: 315.96) (x2: 302.16 y2: 345.65)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis 1.

Conservation of resources theory argues that a key to an effective stress recovery process is the replenishment of resources during off-work time (a weekend in the present study). We test a model of the stress recovery process during a weekend whereby two recovery mechanisms (weekend activities and recovery experiences) improve two personal resources (self-regulatory capacity and state optimism), subsequently affecting psychological outcomes (work engagement and burnout) at the start of the next workweek. Employees (n=233) from various jobs responded to online surveys before and after a weekend. Controlling for pre-weekend resource levels and psychological outcomes assessed on Friday, the two weekend stress recovery mechanisms (weekend activities and recovery experiences) contributed to improving or maintaining self-regulatory and optimism resources on Monday. Of note, psychological detachment may result in less rather than more of the resource of state optimism on Monday. Monday resource levels were linked to improved work engagement and burnout. As proposed by conservation of resources theory, employees can benefit from participating in activities that replenish resources necessary to meet work demands upon returning to work after a weekend.

Additionally, the effect of achievement motivation at the implicit level on creative performance is moderated by expectation of evaluation and domain knowledge in a three-way interaction. The main effect for achievement motivation, assessed at the implicit level, as a predictor of creative performance holds when controlling for other factors previously tested as predictors of creativity, including a self-report assessment achievement motivation.

Inspired by social identity, situational strength, and attraction-selection-attrition theories, we proposed that individuals who differ from their coworkers in age, sex, or racioethnicity would feel threatened by their outnumbered status and subsequently motivated to be absent, tardy, or more likely to turnover. However, we expected coworker withdrawal behavior to moderate whether or not dissimilar personnel act on these desires. Results from hierarchical multilevel modeling analyses of data from 470 U.S. call center workers nested in 51 work groups revealed that racioethnic dissimilarity was positively related to time-lagged changes in absenteeism and tardiness as well as heightened turnover likelihood. These effects emerged only among employees whose coworkers engaged in greater withdrawal behavior. Importantly, racioethnically dissimilar employees working in more permissive climates (i.e., those with high levels of coworker absenteeism, tardiness, or turnover) exhibited the greatest increases in absenteeism and tardiness over three months and had the highest supervisor-rated turnover likelihood.

We specifically suggest that the training and development investments of an organization affect its innovative performance by promoting various learning practices. We empirically tested our hypothesis by using time-lagged, multi-source data collected from 260 Korean companies that represent diverse industries. Our analysis showed that corporate expenditure for internal training predicts interpersonal and organizational learning practices, which, in turn, increase innovative performance. The data also revealed that the positive relationship between interpersonal and organizational learning practices and innovative performance is stronger within organizations that have stronger innovative climates. By contrast, investment in employee development through financial support for education outside an organization poses a significant negative effect on its innovative performance and no significant effect on learning practices. The present study provides a plausible explanation for a mechanism through which the investment of an organization in employees enhances its innovative performance. Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors.

Two types of symbolic information conveyed by procedural justice climate are considered. We argue that procedural justice climate reflects the status of or respect for a justice recipient, a work unit within an organization in our context, which then influences the identification of its members with the work unit. Procedural justice climate also reflects the moral attributes of a justice actor, herein an organization, which then influences organizational identification and perceived job security. Consistent with these arguments, results showed that perceived respect for the work unit mediated the relationship between procedural justice climate and identification with the work unit, and both perceived organizational benevolence and integrity mediated the relationship of procedural justice climate with organizational identification and job security. The two types of social identification and perceived job security were related to several outcome variables differently.

The current study examines how shared workplace aggression concerns relate to internal and external organizational outcomes. Drawing on the work stress, social identity, and social contagion literatures, we propose relationships between unit-level aggression concerns and unit-level measures of performance and employee attitudes in a public school sample (2989 employees; 163 schools). We also propose that these relationships differ depending on the resource context of the school. Consistent with our expectations, schools in which teachers had strong shared concerns about aggression also had poorer shared job attitudes and poorer student outcomes, as indicated by average standardized test scores at the school. The impact of shared concerns about aggression on school-level standardized test scores was stronger for resource-rich schools than for schools with fewer resources. The current study contributes to organizational research as it establishes that workplace aggression concerns have adverse consequences for the whole organization, not only for the individuals experiencing the events. Our findings demonstrate that employees' shared concerns about aggression have an impact on organizational outcomes and suggest a prevention-focused approach to workplace aggression.

These results support the modified conclusion that a combination of individualism and collectivism is associated with higher levels of member performance in teams under typical work conditions; that is, conditions in which the tasks of individual members are both individualized and shared.

We tested this possibility by examining whether the effects of uncivil workplace exchanges on employee attitudes and behavior were moderated by conscientiousness. Using matched data from 190 job incumbents and their supervisors, we found (i) the effect of workplace incivility on citizenship performance to be transmitted through affective commitment and (ii) the strength of this effect to depend on individual differences in conscientiousness. As such, the overall pattern of relationships supported moderated mediation, in that, the indirect effect of workplace incivility on citizenship performance through affective commitment was stronger for individuals high (as compared with those low) in conscientiousness. These findings broaden the focus of prior research by illustrating that, in addition to the mediating effects of cognitive and stress-based factors, social exchange processes are important for understanding incivility's adverse effects on citizenship performance and that such exchanges are moderated by individual differences in conscientiousness.

It was hypothesized that procedural justice judgments may be based not only on content information (e. g., \"What are fair aspects of the selection procedure?\"), but also on the felt ease or difficulty with which this content information can be retrieved from memory (ease-of-retrieval; e. g., \"How easily can I recall fair aspects of the selection procedure?\"). Evaluations of the company's online application procedure show that job candidates based procedural justice judgments on content information or on ease-of-retrieval, depending on their uncertainty regarding the online application procedure as well as their prior experiences with online applications. Specifically, experienced applicants who felt certain based their judgments on ease-of-retrieval, whereas all other applicants based their judgments on content information.

We hypothesized that mature job seekers would be grouped into meaningful clusters based on their desires for work and that these groups would differ regarding the work features they were looking for in a new job. Using survey data from a sample of 173 mature job seekers over age forty, we identified three clusters: Those who work primarily for monetary and family reasons (which we labeled satisficers), those who seek personal satisfaction and learning opportunities from employment (free agents), and those who seek employment for a broad variety of reasons (maximizers). These three groups differed in their preferences for work schedule, availability of benefits, and developmental opportunities.

Perceived stress scale (PSS) was administered at two points in time to participants in a two-day selection process for a military unit, whose stressful environment formed the manipulation in this study. Baseline PSS was obtained from soldiers before the selection activity, when threatened with resource loss. PSS was next administered during the selection activity, when individuals had to cope with actual loss of resources and difficulty in regaining them. As expected, participants perceived more stress during the selection activity. Participants with higher CSES, higher cognitive abilities and higher levels of social support perceived lower stress levels prior to the activity. The increase in stress level was lower for participants with better fitness levels, but greater for participants rejected by their peers. Exploratory analysis of resource overlap was conducted and revealed a contribution of few key resources to coping, even in the presence of other resources.

We propose and test a model that places objective underemployment and subjective underemployment in a causal sequence between organizational actions and employees' restoration of equilibrium by obtaining jobs worth keeping. We longitudinally examine relationships between layoff fairness, workers' stress symptoms and appraisal, and subsequent employment Outcomes among 149 laid-off technical employees over the course of one year.

In three experiments, we explored the impact of waste disposal signage design on disposal behavior. Specifically, we were interested in two primary questions in signage design: 1) what type of waste disposal information should be presented; and 2) how the information should be presented. We found that signs containing either icons or pictures of permitted items improved sorting performance compared to signs containing only words of the items; consistent positioning of the signs improved sorting performance compared to random positions for both pictures and icons; and presenting both permitted and prohibited items can interfere with performance when the signs are icons. The current study provides experimental evidence to demonstrate that the design of waste disposal signage can impact waste sorting performance in meaningful ways and highlights the need for graphical signage and bin standardization.","author_address":"[Wu, David W. -L.; Lenkic, Peter J.; DiGiacomo, Alessandra; Zhao, Jiaying; Kingstone, Alan] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Cech, Peter] Metro Vancouver, 4330 Kingsway, Burnaby, BC V5H 4G8, Canada; [Zhao, Jiaying] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","reprint_address":"Kingstone, A (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.","author_email":"alan.kingstone@ubc.ca","funding":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","publisher":"ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","publisher_address":"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","ISSN_WOS":"0272-4944","eISSN":null,"pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":58.0,"issue":null,"DOI_WOS":"10.1016\/j.jenvp.2018.07.009","WOS_category":"Environmental Studies; Psychology, Multidisciplinary","category":"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000445717900010","pg":"77-85","author_last_WOS":"Wu","author_first_WOS":"David W. -L.","published":"AUG 2018","pdf_filename":"Wu_JournEnvPsych_2018_Z7zk","claim2_abstract":"We found that signs containing either icons or pictures of permitted items improved sorting performancecompared to signs containing only words of the items; consistent positioning of the signs improved sortingperformance compared to random positions for both pictures and icons; and presenting both permitted andprohibited items can interfere with performance when the signs are icons.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1210","claim2_box":"(x1: 203.13 y1: 347.81) (x2: 443.39 y2: 379.96)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We predicted, therefore, that images should producefaster and more accurate responses compared to words.","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"5968","claim3a_box":"(x1: 362.44 y1: 364.60) (x2: 504.99 y2: 378.94)","claim3b_testspec":"garbage, recycling, paper, andcompost. | depicted using four di\ufb00erent image renderings (standard pictures, blackand white pictures, icons, or words). | \u201cE\ufb03ciency score\u201d was our main dependent variable (Townsend &Ashby, 1983).

The present research introduces a novel predictor of environmentally friendly behavior: attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist, or the favorability of a mental image someone has of the typical, representative environmentalist. Based on previous findings linking prototype attitudes to behavior, we expected positive attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes to predict greater environmentally friendly behavior. In addition, the current studies used not just explicit, direct self-reports of attitudes, but also indirect measures of implicit attitudes, which are less intentional, less controllable, and less deliberate. As expected, Studies 1 and 2 showed that positive implicit and explicit attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist predict self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors. In Study 2, positive implicit and explicit prototype attitudes also predicted greater likelihood of donating to an environmental charity.

During adolescence, friends and parents may influence transport mode to school. Using a social network survey of 934 high school students we investigated whether students' walking, cycling, bus and car travel to school were predicted by their friends' transport behaviour, accounting for parent encouragement, ride availability, distance to school, gender, school unit and age. In addition, we examined whether descriptive norms, friend encouragement or co-travel requests mediated the effect of friends' active transport behaviour. We found that friends' transport behaviour predicted ego behaviour, particularly for cycling. Descriptive norms and co-travel requests, but not friend encouragement, approached significance as mediators of friends' active transport similarities.

This research used meta-analytic techniques to assess: the mean effect size of the correlation between materialistic values and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors; the 'true effect size' adjusting for the reliability of the measures; and the effects of gender, age, population type and publication year on the size of the correlation. A significant, medium-sized association was found between materialistic values and both environmental attitudes and behaviors; these relationships were moderated by population type and publication year, but not by gender or age. Adjusted for reliability, the effects increased considerably, largely due to the low reliability of both types of environmental measures.

Although interest in how the broader built environment influences sense of community is gaining momentum, there is a dearth of empirical research examining the association between sense of community and the quality of public space. This study investigates the relationship between four public spaces - Public Open Space (POS), community centres, schools and shops - and sense of community in residents of new housing developments in the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia. Data was obtained from a cross-sectional survey (n = 911), a POS audit, and Geographical Information Systems, and analysed using linear regression. The perceived quality of neighbourhood POS and shops was significantly and positively associated with sense of community. This relationship appears to be unaffected by how frequently people use these spaces. High quality public spaces may be important settings for enhancing sense of community within residents of new housing developments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were 34 students randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an office setting with four indoor plants, both flowering and foliage, or the same setting without plants. Attention capacity was assessed three times, i.e. immediately after entering the laboratory, after performing a demanding cognitive task, and after a five-minute break. Attention capacity was measured using a reading span test, a dual processing task known to tap the central executive function of attention.

In this study, an evolutionary and environmental psychology approach is used to analyze affective reactions to advertising depicting specific natural environments or urban scenes, both prominent ingredients of contemporary advertising imagery. The experimental field study exposed 750 participants at random to one advert of a set of 13 experimental green energy advertisements, each displaying a different biome. Six basic emotional responses (pleasure, arousal, happiness, freedom, safety, and interest) as well as attitude toward the ad and brand attitude were assessed subsequently. Anova and structural equation analysis were used for data analysis. Results of the study confirm the leading opinion on generalized more positive behavioral effects toward visual stimuli representing nature scenes with biospheric contents as opposed to pictures of urban environments or desert settings. In line with earlier empirical research, further findings do not support the hypothesis on an innate preference for savanna landscapes in adults but confirm preferences for images of lush green landscapes with water and familiar biomes. Overall results give significant support to the application of environmental and evolutionary psychology to advertising. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, profit-driven enterprise has contributed immensely to human prosperity. Though scholars agree that profit can incentivize societally beneficial behaviors, people may neglect this possibility. In 7 studies, we show that people see business profit as necessarily in conflict with social good, a view we call anti-profit beliefs. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that U.S. participants hold anti-profit views of real U.S. firms and industries. Study 3 shows that hypothetical organizations are seen as doing more harm when they are labeled \"for-profit\" rather than \"non-profit,\"while Study 4 shows that increasing harm to society is viewed as a strategy for increasing a hypothetical firm's long-run profitability. Studies 5-7 demonstrate that carefully prompting subjects to consider the long run incentives of profit can attenuate anti-profit beliefs, while prompting short run thinking does nothing relative to a control. Together, these results suggest that the default view of profits is zero-sum. While people readily grasp how profit can incentivize firms to engage in practices that harm others, they neglect how it can incentivize firms to engage in practices that benefit others. Accordingly, people's stereotypes of profit-seeking firms are excessively negative. Even in one of the most market-oriented societies in history, people doubt the contributions of profit-seeking industry to societal progress.","author_address":"[Bhattacharjee, Amit] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Dana, Jason] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Baron, Jonathan] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","reprint_address":"Bhattacharjee, A (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.","author_email":"bhattacharjee@rsm.nl","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":113.0,"issue":"5","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/pspa0000093","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000412446100002","pg":"671-696","author_last_WOS":"Bhattacharjee","author_first_WOS":"Amit","published":"NOV 2017","pdf_filename":"Bhattacharjee_JournPerSocPsy_2017_Br0x","claim2_abstract":"Study 3 shows that hypothetical organizations are seen as doing more harm when they arelabeled \u201cfor-profit\u201d rather than \u201cnon-profit,\u201d while Study 4 shows that increasing harm to society isviewed as a strategy for increasing a hypothetical firm\u2019s long-run profitability.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"707","claim2_box":"(x1: 164.98 y1: 254.34) (x2: 383.42 y2: 278.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We expected that specifyinga profit motive would reduce perceptions of good societal out-comes","claim3a_pg":"9","claim3a_start":"1323","claim3a_box":"(x1: 442.83 y1: 531.52) (x2: 328.99 y2: 558.55)","claim3b_testspec":"A repeated measures ANOVA","claim3b_pg":"10","claim3b_start":"2589","claim3b_box":"(x1: 315.00 y1: 339.33) (x2: 426.63 y2: 343.45)","claim4_inftest":"Combining across the four organizational de-scriptions, a repeated measures ANOVA found a significant maineffect of firm motives on perceived good to society, F(2, 348) \u000211.42, p \u0004 .001, \u0007p2 \u0002 .062.","claim4_pg":"10","claim4_start":"2772","claim4_box":"(x1: 377.97 y1: 372.67) (x2: 413.49 y2: 410.13)","corr_author":"Amit Bhattacharjee","corr_email":"bhattacharjee@rsm.nl","version":1},{"title_CR":"Desired emotions across cultures: A value-based account.","author_last_CR":"Tamir","author_first_CR":"Maya","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1037\/pspp0000072","ISSN_CR":"0022-3514","publication_CR":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","pub_short":"JournPerSocPsy","paper_id":"GPQj","author_full":"Tamir, Maya; Schwartz, Shalom H.; Cieciuch, Jan; Riediger, Michaela; Torres, Claudio; Scollon, Christie; Dzokoto, Vivian; Zhou, Xiaolu; Vishkin, Allon","title_WOS":"Desired Emotions Across Cultures: A Value-Based Account","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","language":"English","keywords":"emotion; emotion regulation; motivation; values; culture","keywords_plus":"BASIC PERSONAL VALUES; FIT INDEXES; SOCIAL FUNCTIONS; EXPERIENCE; GOALS; SELF; ORIENTATIONS; COVARIANCE; COMPASSION; FEELINGS","abstract":"Values reflect how people want to experience the world; emotions reflect how people actually experience the world. Therefore, we propose that across cultures people desire emotions that are consistent with their values. Whereas prior research focused on the desirability of specific affective states or 1 or 2 target emotions, we offer a broader account of desired emotions. After reporting initial evidence for the potential causal effects of values on desired emotions in a preliminary study (N = 200), we tested the predictions of our proposed model in 8 samples (N = 2,328) from distinct world cultural regions. Across cultural samples, we found that people who endorsed values of self-transcendence (e.g., benevolence) wanted to feel more empathy and compassion, people who endorsed values of self-enhancement (e.g., power) wanted to feel more anger and pride, people who endorsed values of openness to change (e.g., self- direction) wanted to feel more interest and excitement, and people who endorsed values of conservation (e.g., tradition) wanted to feel more calmness and less fear. These patterns were independent of differences in emotional experience. We discuss the implications of our value-based account of desired emotions for understanding emotion regulation, culture, and other individual differences.","author_address":"[Tamir, Maya; Schwartz, Shalom H.; Vishkin, Allon] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Schwartz, Shalom H.] Natl Res Univ, Int Lab Sociocultural Res, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Cieciuch, Jan] Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ, Inst Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Riediger, Michaela] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Berlin, Germany; [Torres, Claudio] Univ Brasilia, Dept Psychol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Scollon, Christie] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Dzokoto, Vivian] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept African Amer Studies, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Zhou, Xiaolu] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Riediger, Michaela] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany","reprint_address":"Tamir, M (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.","author_email":"tamirm@mscc.huji.ac.il","funding":"Israel Science Foundation [794\/11]; HSE Basic Research Program (International Laboratory of Sociocultural Research); Polish National Science Center [2011\/01\/D\/HS6\/04077]; Brazilian National Council for Research-CNPq","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":111.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/pspp0000072","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000379503500005","pg":"67-82","author_last_WOS":"Tamir","author_first_WOS":"Maya","published":"JUL 2016","pdf_filename":"Tamir_JournPerSocPsy_2016_GPQj","claim2_abstract":"Across cultural samples, we found that peoplewho endorsed values of self-transcendence (e.g., benevolence) wanted to feel more empathy and compassion,people who endorsed values of self-enhancement (e.g., power) wanted to feel more anger and pride, peoplewho endorsed values of openness to change (e.g., self-direction) wanted to feel more interest and excitement,and people who endorsed values of conservation (e.g., tradition) wanted to feel more calmness and less fear","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1145","claim2_box":"(x1: 322.79 y1: 362.84) (x2: 463.21 y2: 406.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We expected that even outside the laboratory, the more peopleendorse certain values, the more they would desire emotions thatare consistent with them.","claim3a_pg":"6","claim3a_start":"1286","claim3a_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 345.88) (x2: 141.53 y2: 372.00)","claim3b_testspec":"To take the hierarchical structure of the data into account whentesting the hypotheses, we conducted multilevel modeling analyses","claim3b_pg":"8","claim3b_start":"1252","claim3b_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 298.88) (x2: 288.05 y2: 314.00)","claim4_inftest":"Table 6 pres-ents results of the HLM analyses | In support of","claim4_pg":"8 | 9","claim4_start":"4581 | 910","claim4_box":"(x1: 496.69 y1: 639.37) (x2: 432.58 y2: 654.49) | (x1: 392.26 y1: 232.88) (x2: 443.60 y2: 237.00)","corr_author":"Maya Tamir","corr_email":"tamirm@mscc.huji.ac.il","version":1},{"title_CR":"The expression and recognition of emotions in the voice across five nations: A lens model analysis based on acoustic features.","author_last_CR":"Laukka","author_first_CR":"Petri","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1037\/pspi0000066","ISSN_CR":"0022-3514","publication_CR":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","pub_short":"JournPerSocPsy","paper_id":"zvqm","author_full":"Laukka, Petri; Elfenbein, Hillary Anger; Thingujam, Nutankumar S.; Rockstuhl, Thomas; Iraki, Frederick K.; Chui, Wanda; Althoff, Jean","title_WOS":"The Expression and Recognition of Emotions in the Voice Across Five Nations: A Lens Model Analysis Based on Acoustic Features","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","language":"English","keywords":"culture; dialect theory; emotion; in-group advantage; speech","keywords_plus":"CROSS-CULTURAL DIFFERENCES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; VOCAL EXPRESSIONS; BASIC EMOTIONS; PERCEPTION; COMMUNICATION; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; UNIVERSAL; ACCURACY","abstract":"This study extends previous work on emotion communication across cultures with a large-scale investigation of the physical expression cues in vocal tone. In doing so, it provides the first direct test of a key proposition of dialect theory, namely that greater accuracy of detecting emotions from one's own cultural group-known as in-group advantage-results from a match between culturally specific schemas in emotional expression style and culturally specific schemas in emotion recognition. Study 1 used stimuli from 100 professional actors from five English-speaking nations vocally conveying 11 emotional states (anger, contempt, fear, happiness, interest, lust, neutral, pride, relief, sadness, and shame) using standard-content sentences. Detailed acoustic analyses showed many similarities across groups, and yet also systematic group differences. This provides evidence for cultural accents in expressive style at the level of acoustic cues. In Study 2, listeners evaluated these expressions in a 5 x 5 design balanced across groups. Cross-cultural accuracy was greater than expected by chance. However, there was also in-group advantage, which varied across emotions. A lens model analysis of fundamental acoustic properties examined patterns in emotional expression and perception within and across groups. Acoustic cues were used relatively similarly across groups both to produce and judge emotions, and yet there were also subtle cultural differences. Speakers appear to have a culturally nuanced schema for enacting vocal tones via acoustic cues, and perceivers have a culturally nuanced schema in judging them.

Study 1 (including 4 separate samples from 2 different countries, total N = 6092) provides evidence for the construct and discriminant validity of the DGS in terms of positive correlations with maximization, self-interest, envy, materialism, and impulsiveness, and negative correlations with self-control and life satisfaction. Study 2 (N = 290) presents further evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendencies over and above materialism. Furthermore, the DGS predicts economic behavior: greedy people allocate more money to themselves in dictator games (Study 3, N = 300) and ultimatum games (Study 4, N = 603), and take more in a resource dilemma (Study 5, N = 305). These findings shed light on what greed is and does, how people differ in greed, and how greed can be measured. In addition, they show the importance of greed in economic behavior and provide directions for future studies.","author_address":"[Seuntjens, Terri G.; Zeelenberg, Marcel; van de Ven, Niels; Breugelmans, Seger M.] Tilburg Univ, TIBER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Seuntjens, Terri G.; Zeelenberg, Marcel; van de Ven, Niels; Breugelmans, Seger M.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Social Psychol, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Breugelmans, Seger M.] Higher Sch Econ, Int Sci Educ Lab Sociocultural Res, Moscow, Russia","reprint_address":"Seuntjens, TG (reprint author), Tilburg Univ, TIBER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.","author_email":"t.g.seuntjens@tilburguniversity.edu","funding":"National Research University Higher School of Economics; Stichting Weet Wat Je Besteedt","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":108.0,"issue":"6","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/pspp0000031","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000354609100006","pg":"917-933","author_last_WOS":"Seuntjens","author_first_WOS":"Terri G.","published":"JUN 2015","pdf_filename":"Seuntjens_JournPerSocPsy_2015_PNPz","claim2_abstract":"Study 2 (N \u0002 290) presentsfurther evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendenciesover and above materialism.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"862","claim2_box":"(x1: 372.19 y1: 247.84) (x2: 220.89 y2: 271.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We expectedgreed, and not materialism, to also predict desires for nonmaterialgoods such as food and sex","claim3a_pg":"8","claim3a_start":"3036","claim3a_box":"(x1: 240.93 y1: 683.88) (x2: 147.97 y2: 710.00)","claim3b_testspec":"Next we computed correlations and partial correlations betweengreed and materialism and the four behavioral inclinations","claim3b_pg":"8","claim3b_start":"4234","claim3b_box":"(x1: 306.00 y1: 300.38) (x2: 515.51 y2: 315.50)","claim4_inftest":"We can see that materialism was best at predicting the desire for amaterial good while dispositional greed better predicted the otherthree behavioral intentions | When I am eating a bag of chips, I don\u2019t want to stop until the bag is finished. 2.89 1.21","claim4_pg":"8 | 9","claim4_start":"4624 | 3890","claim4_box":"(x1: 306.00 y1: 366.38) (x2: 403.47 y2: 392.50) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 657.34) (x2: 374.68 y2: 661.00)","corr_author":"Terri G.

Humility is characterized by a willingness to accept the self and life without comforting illusions, and by low levels of self-focus. As a consequence, it was expected to render mortality thoughts less threatening and less likely to evoke potentially destructive behavior patterns. In line with this reasoning, Study 1 found that people high in humility do not engage in self-serving moral disengagement following mortality reminders, whereas people low in humility do. Study 2 showed that only people low in humility respond to death reminders with increased fear of death, and established that this effect was driven uniquely by humility and not by some other related personality trait. In Study 3, a low sense of psychological entitlement decreased cultural worldview defense in response to death thoughts, whereas a high sense of entitlement tended to increase it. Study 4 demonstrated that priming humility reduces self-reported death anxiety relative to both a baseline and a pride priming condition. Finally, in Study 5, experimentally induced feelings of humility prevented mortality reminders from leading to depleted self-control. As a whole, these findings obtained from relatively diverse Internet samples illustrate that the dark side of death anxiety is brought about by a noisy ego only and not by a quiet ego, revealing self-transcendence as a sturdier, healthier anxiety buffer than self-enhancement.","author_address":"[Kesebir, Pelin] Univ Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA","reprint_address":"Kesebir, P (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, 1420 Austin Bluffs Pkwy, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.","author_email":"kesebir@gmail.com","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":106.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0035814","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000333466000007","pg":"610-623","author_last_WOS":"Kesebir","author_first_WOS":"Pelin","published":"APR 2014","pdf_filename":"Kesebir_JournPerSocPsy_2014_8P4W","claim2_abstract":"In line with thisreasoning, Study 1 found that people high in humility do not engage in self-serving moral disengagementfollowing mortality reminders, whereas people low in humility do","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"565","claim2_box":"(x1: 409.46 y1: 222.84) (x2: 341.41 y2: 246.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Study 1 tested the hypothesis that humility as an individualdifference variable would buffer death anxiety","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"3283","claim3a_box":"(x1: 315.00 y1: 96.88) (x2: 477.92 y2: 112.00)","claim3b_testspec":"To test the hypothesis that humility will buffer against moraldisengagement in the face of MS, a hierarchical regression analysiswas conducted on moral disengagement scores.

A clearer picture has emerged from consideration of the HEXACO model of personality though supported entirely by hypothetical behavior as criterion, so far. Thus, in 2 studies and a reanalysis, we investigated \"actual behavior\" in the form of individually and socially consequential distribution decisions. As expected, HEXACO Honesty-Humility consistently predicted prosocial behavior, including a theory-consistent pattern on the facet level. Importantly, this pattern might explain why five-factor Agreeableness has only sometimes been found to account for prosocial behavior. Indeed, further results indicate that five-factor Agreeableness comprises some aspects that are predictive of prosocial behavior aspects well covered by BEXACO Honesty-Humility but also others that play no role for this criterion. As such, the links between five-factor Agreeableness and prosocial behavior are well-covered by HEXACO Honesty-Humility, but not vice versa. Taken together, these findings hint that especially HEXACO Honesty-Humility (and certain aspects of five-factor Agreeableness) account for prosocial behavior thus explaining previous inconsistencies and providing a more nuanced understanding of the links between basic personality and prosocial or cooperative behavior.","author_address":"[Hilbig, Benjamin E.] Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Hilbig, Benjamin E.; Gloeckner, Andreas] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Expt Law & Econ Grp, Bonn, Germany; [Gloeckner, Andreas] Univ Gottingen, Dept Psychol, Gottingen, Germany; [Zettler, Ingo] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Educ Sci & Psychol, Tubingen, Germany","reprint_address":"Hilbig, BE (reprint author), Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.","author_email":"hilbig@psychologie.uni-mannheim.de","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":107.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0036074","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000348334600009","pg":"529-539","author_last_WOS":"Hilbig","author_first_WOS":"Benjamin E.","published":"SEP 2014","pdf_filename":"Hilbig_JournPerSocPsy_2014_D4OY","claim2_abstract":"Asexpected, HEXACO Honesty-Humility consistently predicted prosocial behavior, including a theory-consistent pattern on the facet level","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"844","claim2_box":"(x1: 456.14 y1: 271.84) (x2: 244.43 y2: 295.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"we first predicted that HEX-HH should be linked to prosocialbehavior","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"6877","claim3a_box":"(x1: 306.00 y1: 672.87) (x2: 337.49 y2: 687.99)","claim3b_testspec":"correlations","claim3b_pg":"4","claim3b_start":"1854","claim3b_box":"(x1: 138.78 y1: 639.88) (x2: 181.27 y2: 644.00)","claim4_inftest":"HEX-HH wasassociated with more prosocial allocations in the SVO measure(r \u0002 .37, 95% CI [.13, .64]), yielding a medium to large effect size(Cohen, 1988) in line with the hypotheses.","claim4_pg":"4","claim4_start":"1945","claim4_box":"(x1: 235.57 y1: 650.88) (x2: 206.03 y2: 688.00)","corr_author":"Benjamin E.

The basic premise underlying these conceptual cueing effects is that thinking of a spatial metaphor activates an internal spatial representation which in turn influences the allocation of attention in the visual field. An important step forward in understanding conceptual cues is determining whether the underlying process is bidirectional: Do shifts of attention facilitate activation of corresponding conceptual information? To test this, a peripheral cue was used to induce shifts of attention to a peripheral location, and the effect of this shift on concept processing was measured with a standard lexical-decision task in which participants made word\/nonword responses to a letter string presented at fixation (Experiments 1 and 3), or with a modified lexical-decision task in which participants made English\/Dutch judgments of a word presented auditorily (Experiment 2). If shifts of attention activate spatially compatible concepts, then shifting attention to a peripheral location should speed lexical decisions for spatially compatible concepts such that leftward shifts lead to faster lexical decisions of left relative to right concepts (and likewise for rightward, upward, and downward shifts).

Evolutionary psychologists have argued that the human capacity for group affiliation is a byproduct of adaptations that evolved for tracking coalitions in general. These theories suggest that humans possess a common neural code for the concepts in-group and out-group, regardless of the category by which group boundaries are instantiated. The authors used multivoxel pattern analysis to identify the neural substrates of generalized group concept representations. They trained a classifier to encode how people represented the most basic instantiation of a specific social group (i.e., arbitrary teams created in the lab with no history of interaction or associated stereotypes) and tested how well the neural data decoded membership along an objectively orthogonal, real-world category (i.e., political parties). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex\/middle cingulate cortex and anterior insula were associated with representing groups across multiple social categories. Restricting the analyses to these regions in a separate sample of participants performing an explicit categorization task, the authors replicated cross-categorization classification in anterior insula. Classification accuracy across categories was driven predominantly by the correct categorization of in-group targets, consistent with theories indicating in-group preference is more central than out-group derogation to group perception and cognition.

This assumption enables observers to work backward from agents' observed behavior to their underlying beliefs, preferences, and competencies. Intuitively, however, agents may have incomplete, uncertain, or wrong beliefs about what they want. More formally, agents try to maximize their expected utilities. This understanding is crucial when reasoning about others' behavior: It dictates when actions reveal preferences, and it makes predictions about the stability of behavior over time. In a set of 7 experiments we show that 4- and 5-year-olds understand that agents try to maximize expected utilities, and that these responses cannot be explained by simpler accounts. In particular, these results suggest a modification to the standard belief\/desire model of intuitive psychology.

Using continuous flash suppression (CFS) to render objects invisible, we found that providing valid information about the category membership of the object (e.g., \"car\") before stimulus presentation facilitated awareness of the object, as shown by improved localization performance relative to a noninformative baseline condition and to a condition with invalid prior information. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the effect of expectation on detection generalized to binocular viewing conditions, with valid category cues facilitating the localization and detection of briefly presented objects. Experiment 4 extended these results to simple stimuli (oriented Gabor patches), for which valid orientation information improved localization performance. Finally, in Experiment 5 we found that the effect of expectation on detection and localization performance partly reflects increased perceptual sensitivity, as evidenced by decreased contrast detection thresholds for validly cued stimuli relative to noncued and invalidly cued stimuli.

Drawing on the social contagion literature, the authors examine the effect of online social connections on users' product purchases in an online community. They assess how product, user, and network characteristics influence the social contagion effect in users' spending behavior. The authors use a unique large-scale data set from a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game community-consisting of users' detailed gaming activities, their social connections, and their in-game purchases of functional and hedonic products-to examine the impact of gamers' social networks on their purchase behavior. The analysis, based on a double-hurdle model that captures gamers' decisions of playing and spending levels, reveals evidence of \"social dollars,\" whereby social interaction between gamers in the community increases their in-game product purchases. Interestingly, the results indicate that social influence varies across different types of products. Specifically, the effect of a focal user's network ties on his or her spending on hedonic products is greater than the effect of network ties on the focal user's spending on functional products. Furthermore, the authors find that user experience negatively moderates social contagion for functional products, whereas it positively moderates contagion for hedonic products. In addition, dense networks enhance contagion over functional product purchases, whereas they mitigate the social influence effect over hedonic product purchases. The authors perform a series of tests and robustness checks to rule out the effect of confounding factors. They supplement their econometric analyses with dynamic matching techniques and estimate average treatment effects. The results of the study have implications for both theory and practice and help provide insights on how managers can monetize social networks and use social information to increase user engagement in online communities.","author_address":"[Park, Eunho] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, Mkt, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Rishika, Rishika; Janakiraman, Ramkumar] Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Mkt, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Janakiraman, Ramkumar] Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Houston, Mark B.] Texas Christian Univ, Neeley Sch Business, Mkt, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Yoo, Byungjoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Management Informat Syst, Seoul, South Korea","reprint_address":"Park, E (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, Mkt, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.","author_email":"epark@mays.tamu.edu; rishika@moore.sc.edu; Janakiraman.Ramkumar@gmail.com; m.b.houston@tcu.edu; byoo@snu.ac.kr","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":82.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.16.0271","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000419370600006","pg":"93-114","author_last_WOS":"Park","author_first_WOS":"Eunho","published":"JAN 2018","pdf_filename":"Park_JournMarket_2018_G7xz","claim2_abstract":"The analysis, based on adouble-hurdle model that captures gamers\u2019 decisions of playing and spending levels, reveals evidence of \u201csocial dollars,\u201dwhereby social interaction between gamers in the community increases their in-game product purchases.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"976","claim2_box":"(x1: 480.97 y1: 288.88) (x2: 523.11 y2: 315.44)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: A focal user is more likely to purchase products (i.e., func-tional and hedonic products) when that user\u2019s friends havedone so recently.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"6130","claim3a_box":"(x1: 368.84 y1: 641.30) (x2: 442.81 y2: 665.23)","claim3b_testspec":"a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game(MMORPG) community | We have access to individual gamers\u2019 log data, which captureall the gaming activities and purchase decisions of the gamers inour focal MMORPG community.

However, little research has examined how salesperson involvement in customer solutions can be conceptualized, whether it pays off, and what boundary conditions might heighten its performance effects. This study addresses these gaps and offers a conceptualization of salesperson solution involvement by focusing on the set of salesperson-related activities that enact the four relational processes inherent in customer solutions. The authors collect a unique data set that includes a wide range of firms, industries, and countries, as well as the perspectives of both salespeople and customers, across five studies. Results validate the stability of the conceptualization across contexts. They also reveal that salesperson solution involvement is systematically related to increases in both subjective and objective, time-lagged measures of sales performance. Finally, results show that the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement are amplified under higher levels of firm's product portfolio scope, sales unit cross-functional cooperation, and customer-supplier relationship tie strength. Surprisingly, customer adaptiveness is not found to moderate the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement.","author_address":"[Panagopoulos, Nikolaos G.] Univ Alabama, Mkt, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Rapp, Adam A.] Ohio Univ, Sales, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Ogilvie, Jessica L.] Ohio Univ, Mkt, Athens, OH 45701 USA","reprint_address":"Panagopoulos, NG (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Mkt, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.","author_email":"npanagopoulos@cba.ua.edu; rappa@ohio.edu; ogilvie@ohio.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":81.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.15.0342","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000407161500008","pg":"144-164","author_last_WOS":"Panagopoulos","author_first_WOS":"Nikolaos G.","published":"JUL 2017","pdf_filename":"Panagopoulos_JournMarket_2017_j15g","claim2_abstract":"They also reveal that salespersonsolution involvement is systematically related to increases in both subjective and objective, time-lagged measuresof sales performance.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"969","claim2_box":"(x1: 446.79 y1: 332.71) (x2: 190.51 y2: 359.32)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: Salesperson solution involvement is positively related to salesperformance.","claim3a_pg":"5","claim3a_start":"4750","claim3a_box":"(x1: 368.84 y1: 427.56) (x2: 428.51 y2: 441.58)","claim3b_testspec":"Study 1 was set in a Fortune Global 500 elec-tronics firm that provides energy and electronics solutions toenterprise customers. | an online survey | he entire solutions sales force (168 sales engineers) and theirmanagers (39) | We matched survey responses (time0) toobjective, archival data on sales performance one year afterthe survey (time1). | We employ hierarchical linear mod-eling (HLM) with full maximum likelihood estimation toaccount for the nested structure of data (Table 4). | We employ Garen\u2019s (1984)procedure to correct for this type of endogeneity.

Using two large-scale data sets with more than 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Studies 1 and 2 show consistently nonlinear effects. Although some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too many of them have a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques addressing self-selection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. In addition, novices can benefit more from greater social connections and interactions, yet also suffer more from the diminishing effects. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 shows that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too many of them can introduce an information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.","author_address":"[Zhang, Cheng; Phang, Chee Wei] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Informat Syst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qingsheng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Mkt, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xueming] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Mkt Management Informat Syst & Strategy, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Luo, Xueming] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Global Ctr Big Data & Mobile Analyt, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","reprint_address":"Phang, CW (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Informat Syst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Wu, QS (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Mkt, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","author_email":"zhangche@fudan.edu.cn; phangcw@fudan.edu.cn; qswu@sjtu.edu.cn; luoxm@temple.edu","funding":"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372112, 71522006, 71490721, 71232008]","publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":81.0,"issue":"6","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.16.0038","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000414223000008","pg":"132-155","author_last_WOS":"Zhang","author_first_WOS":"Cheng","published":"NOV 2017","pdf_filename":"Zhang_JournMarket_2017_v8yG","claim2_abstract":"Although somesocial connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too many ofthem have a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"537","claim2_box":"(x1: 530.10 y1: 288.88) (x2: 374.19 y2: 315.44)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: There is a nonlinear relationship between social connections\/interactions and consumer goal attainment, such that (a) somesocial connections\/interactions can facilitate goal attainment(i.e., positive linear term), but (b) too many of them havea reduced marginal effect on goal attainment (i.e., negativesquared term).","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"5567","claim3a_box":"(x1: 368.84 y1: 503.76) (x2: 433.16 y2: 557.63)","claim3b_testspec":"in a context fitting for the purpose\u2014massivelymultiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) markets. | We measured social connections as the number of otherparticipants a player added to his or her friend list in the game. | Wemeasured social interactions using interaction occurrences suchas teaming up to accomplish tasks, sending gifts, and chattingwith friends. | The game system automatically records theseinteractions and computes a score indicating the players\u2019 socialinteraction extent (SIE).

The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate new product introductions using a multimethod design consisting of a survey of manufacturers and a repeated measures experiment with retailers. The results indicate that manufacturers craft increasingly specific contract terms as new product creativity increases when frequency of new product introductions and performance ambiguity are higher. When they are lower, the positive influence of new product creativity on contract specificity weakens and can in some instances become negative. The results also indicate that there is no significant change in a retailer's relational behaviors throughout a contract's duration when contract specificity is lower, regardless of the new product's success. However, under the condition of higher contract specificity, the retailer's relational behaviors increase (decrease) over a contract's duration when the new product is successful (unsuccessful).","author_address":"[Dean, Tereza] Univ Kentucky, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain, Mkt, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Griffith, David A.] Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Mkt, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Griffith, David A.] Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Calantone, Roger J.] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Grad Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Business, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","reprint_address":"Dean, T (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain, Mkt, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.; Griffith, DA (reprint author), Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Mkt, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.; Griffith, DA (reprint author), Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.; Calantone, RJ (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Grad Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Business, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.","author_email":"tde224@uky.edu; david.a.griffith@lehigh.edu; rogercal@msu.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":80.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.14.0333","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000373474400003","pg":"39-58","author_last_WOS":"Dean","author_first_WOS":"Tereza","published":"MAR 2016","pdf_filename":"Dean_JournMarket_2016_LYzr","claim2_abstract":"The results indicate that manufacturers craft increasinglyspecific contract terms as new product creativity increases when frequency of new product introductionsand performance ambiguity are higher.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"637","claim2_box":"(x1: 285.16 y1: 244.95) (x2: 234.96 y2: 271.56)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H2: When performance ambiguity is higher, the positive rela-tionship of new product creativity and contract specificity isgreater than when performance ambiguity is lower.","claim3a_pg":"6","claim3a_start":"1033","claim3a_box":"(x1: 69.90 y1: 262.59) (x2: 270.47 y2: 286.58)","claim3b_testspec":"Study 1 examined the antecedents of contract specificity(H1\u2013H2) by using a survey of consumer packaged goods(CPGs) manufacturers. | We administered an online survey to managers of CPGmanufacturers by a research company. | Our research hypotheses (H1 and H2) specify that the effect ofnew product creativity on contract specificity will shift acrossthe range of frequency of new product introductions andperformance ambiguity.

Yet is it always better to provide some financial benefit as opposed to simply saying \"thank you\"? Although this question has important implications for customer relationship management, research has not yet provided an answer. This article demonstrates that, indeed, a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetary benefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment without a monetary benefit), a phenomenon termed the \"trivialization effect.\" The results explain this effect in terms of shifting evaluation standards: whereas a verbal acknowledgement is evaluated relative to verbal gratitude expression norms, a financial acknowledgment is evaluated relative to both verbal norms and customers' monetary expectations. The authors also demonstrate two practical, theory-consistent ways firms can structure financial acknowledgments to eliminate the trivialization effect. Thus, this research shows both the peril of small financial benefits as a means of expressing customer appreciation and practical, low-cost ways to salvage their potential.","author_address":"[Liu, Peggy J.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Lamberton, Cait] Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Sch Business, Mkt & Business Econ Dept, Business Adm, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Haws, Kelly L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Owen Grad Sch Management, Mkt, Nashville, TN USA","reprint_address":"Liu, PJ (reprint author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Durham, NC 27706 USA.","author_email":"peggy.liu@duke.edu; clamberton@katz.pitt.edu; kelly.haws@vanderbilt.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":79.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.14.0091","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000355553200005","pg":"74-90","author_last_WOS":"Liu","author_first_WOS":"Peggy J.","published":"MAY 2015","pdf_filename":"Liu_JournMarket_2015_9DZl","claim2_abstract":"This article demonstrates that, indeed, a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetarybenefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgmentwithout a monetary benefit), a phenomenon termed the \u201ctrivialization effect.\u201d","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"660","claim2_box":"(x1: 54.00 y1: 231.49) (x2: 381.19 y2: 261.51)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: Consumers  feel  more  appreciated  by  a  firm  when  theyreceive  a  verbal  acknowledgment  rather  than  a  similarlyworded  financial  acknowledgment  with  trivializing compensation","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"4312","claim3a_box":"(x1: 333.00 y1: 207.11) (x2: 397.74 y2: 245.78)","claim3b_testspec":"Study 1a (\u201cHotel Field Study\u201d) captured data from hotelguests who were asked to write a review of their stay.

The authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. Using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical Bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. The results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. In contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.","author_address":"[Gilbride, Timothy J.] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Mkt, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Inman, J.

This article investigates whether a firm's announcement of an increase in distribution intensity or the establishment of a new channel influences firm value. The authors also consider the moderating role of context-specific firm, market, and channel strategy contingencies. They test their hypotheses with an event study of 240 announcements of major channel expansions in the United States, Germany, and China. The results indicate that channel expansions affect firm value (i.e., through abnormal stock returns). However, the two types of channel expansions affect firm value differently. Whereas the establishment of a new channel positively influences firm value, reactions to an increase in distribution intensity are highly contingent. For example, firms operating in exceedingly turbulent or competitive markets experience firm value reductions in response to an increase in distribution intensity.

However, previous research has not examined how this relationship varies across customers and situations. This study contributes to knowledge in this area by developing a conceptual framework that guides the investigation of the role of four moderating factors in strengthening the private label brand share-store loyalty link: (1) customers' price-oriented behavior, (2) degree of commoditization of the product category, (3) product category involvement, and (4) the retailer's price positioning. This article draws on a large-scale empirical study using a household panel and questionnaire data for 35 diverse fast-moving consumer goods product categories. The results of this study show that the relationship between private label share and store loyalty is more complex than previous research has suggested. Specifically, the private label brand share-store loyalty link is stronger for customers with high price-oriented behavior, retailers with a low price positioning, and product categories that are less commoditized and have relatively higher involvement.","author_address":"[Koschate-Fischer, Nicole; Cramer, Johannes] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Hoyer, Wayne D.] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA","reprint_address":"Koschate-Fischer, N (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.","author_email":"Nicole.Koschate-Fischer@wiso.uni-erlangen.de; hannescramer@yahoo.de; Wayne.Hoyer@mccombs.utexas.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":78.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.13.0075","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000340736400005","pg":"69-82","author_last_WOS":"Koschate-Fischer","author_first_WOS":"Nicole","published":"MAR 2014","pdf_filename":"Koschate_Fischer_JournMarket_2014_3qPJ","claim2_abstract":"Specifically,  the  private  label  brand  share\u2013store  loyalty  link  is  stronger  for  customers  with  high  price-oriented  behavior,  retailers  with  a  low  price  positioning,  and  product  categories  that  are  less  commoditized  andhave relatively higher involvement.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1125","claim2_box":"(x1: 106.45 y1: 256.49) (x2: 208.25 y2: 286.51)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: The  higher  customers\u2019  price-oriented  behavior,  thestronger  the  effect  of  customers\u2019  private  label  share  onstore loyalty.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"3097","claim3a_box":"(x1: 333.00 y1: 584.10) (x2: 394.38 y2: 611.75)","claim3b_testspec":"The  study  was  conducted  in  Germany.

By assessing a large-scale customer data set from a global cellular telecommunications provider, the authors show that participation in a referral program also increases existing customers' loyalty. In a field experiment, recommenders' defection rates fell from 19% to 7% within a year, and their average monthly revenue grew by 11.4% compared with a matched control group. A negative interaction between referral program participation and customer tenure reveals that the loyalty effect of voicing a recommendation is particularly pronounced for newer customer-firm relationships. A laboratory experiment further demonstrates that referral programs with larger rewards strengthen attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, whereas smaller rewards affect only the behavioral dimension. This article contributes to our theoretical understanding of the roles played by the commitment-consistency principle and positive reinforcement theory as mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of customer referral programs.","author_address":"[Garnefeld, Ina] Univ Wuppertal, Serv Management, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Wuppertal, Germany; [Eggert, Andreas] Univ Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany; [Helm, Sabrina V.] Univ Arizona, Environm & Sustainabil Initiat, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Tax, Stephen S.] Univ Victoria, Peter B Gustayson Sch Business, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","reprint_address":"Garnefeld, I (reprint author), Univ Wuppertal, Serv Management, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Wuppertal, Germany.","author_email":"garnefeld@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de; andreas.eggert@wiwi.uni-paderborn.de; helm@email.arizona.edu; stax@uvic.ca","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":77.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.11.0423","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000321319700002","pg":"17-32","author_last_WOS":"Garnefeld","author_first_WOS":"Ina","published":"JUL 2013","pdf_filename":"Garnefeld_JournMarket_2013_5WVE","claim2_abstract":"By assessing a large-scale customerdata  set  from  a  global  cellular  telecommunications  provider,  the  authors  show  that  participation  in  a  referralprogram also increases existing customers\u2019 loyalty.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"215","claim2_box":"(x1: 394.06 y1: 168.49) (x2: 280.66 y2: 198.51)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Customer  referral  programs  (CRPs) | H1: Participation in a CRP increases recommenders\u2019 loyalty.","claim3a_pg":"1 | 3","claim3a_start":"2264 | 1264","claim3a_box":"(x1: 52.56 y1: 345.16) (x2: 236.88 y2: 355.47) | (x1: 69.00 y1: 293.25) (x2: 287.34 y2: 300.90)","claim3b_testspec":"Customer  referral  programs  (CRPs)\u2014defined  asdeliberately initiated, actively managed, continuouslycontrolled firm activities aimed to stimulate positiveword  of  mouth  among  existing  customer  bases | Customers  who  par-ticipate in a CRP likely differ substantially from those whodo not, | applied  propensity  score  matching | We  analyzed  data  on  German  customers  whowere  using  prepaid  cellular  phones  offered  by  a  globaltelecommunications  provider. | We  use  churn  and  revenue  to  operationalizeloyalty. | a lower churn rate implies that customers are stayingwith the firm for a longer time.","claim3b_pg":"1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5","claim3b_start":"2264 | 5027 | 6190 | 6844 | 752 | 940","claim3b_box":"(x1: 52.56 y1: 345.16) (x2: 252.59 y2: 389.97) | (x1: 475.07 y1: 329.58) (x2: 346.13 y2: 361.08) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 559.74) (x2: 458.30 y2: 568.24) | (x1: 360.64 y1: 690.32) (x2: 438.02 y2: 721.82) | (x1: 105.09 y1: 188.36) (x2: 83.63 y2: 208.40) | (x1: 87.38 y1: 222.98) (x2: 177.02 y2: 243.02)","claim4_inftest":"An  analysis  using  the  Cox  (1972)  modelrevealed a significant effect of participation in a CRP on theprobability  of  being  an  active  customer,  that  is,  of  notchurning (\uf062 = 2.1, p < .001).","claim4_pg":"5","claim4_start":"1567","claim4_box":"(x1: 119.85 y1: 338.38) (x2: 169.80 y2: 381.50)","corr_author":"Ina Garnefeld","corr_email":"garnefeld@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de","version":1},{"title_CR":"To Buy or Not to Buy: Consumers\u2019 Demand Response Patterns for Healthy versus Unhealthy Food","author_last_CR":"Talukdar","author_first_CR":"Debabrata","pub_year_CR":2013,"DOI_CR":"10.1509\/jm.11.0222","ISSN_CR":"0022-2429","publication_CR":"Journal of Marketing","pub_short":"JournMarket","paper_id":"mykV","author_full":"Talukdar, Debabrata; Lindsey, Charles","title_WOS":"To Buy or Not to Buy: Consumers' Demand Response Patterns for Healthy Versus Unhealthy Food","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF MARKETING","language":"English","keywords":"pricing; food; health; social networks; fear","keywords_plus":"SELF-EFFICACY; FEAR APPEALS; PRICE; BEHAVIOR; GRATIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; DYNAMICS; DECISION; CHOICE; TAXES","abstract":"The authors integrate research on impulsivity from the psychology area with standard economic theories of consumer demand to make novel predictions about the effects of market price changes on consumers' food consumption behavior. The results from multiple studies confirm that consumers exhibit undesirable asymmetric patterns of demand sensitivity to price changes for healthy and unhealthy food. For healthy food, demand sensitivity is greater for a price increase than for a price decrease. For unhealthy food, the opposite holds true. The research further shows that the undesirable patterns are attenuated or magnified for key policy-relevant factors that have been shown to decrease or increase impulsive purchase behavior, respectively. As the rising obesity trend brings American consumers' food consumption behavior under increased scrutiny, the focal findings hold significant implications for both public policy makers and food marketers.","author_address":"[Talukdar, Debabrata; Lindsey, Charles] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Management, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","reprint_address":"Talukdar, D (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Sch Management, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.","author_email":"dtalukda@buffalo.edu; clindsey@buffalo.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":77.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.11.0222","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000315430800008","pg":"124-138","author_last_WOS":"Talukdar","author_first_WOS":"Debabrata","published":"MAR 2013","pdf_filename":"Talukdar_JournMarket_2013_mykV","claim2_abstract":"For  healthy  food,  demandsensitivity is greater for a price increase than for a price decrease.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"715","claim2_box":"(x1: 436.38 y1: 201.49) (x2: 343.91 y2: 220.51)","claim3a_concretehyp":"For healthy food, consumers\u2019 demand response sensitivityis  greater  for  a  price  increase  than  that  for  a  pricedecrease, relative to the last purchase price.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"6545","claim3a_box":"(x1: 347.75 y1: 694.18) (x2: 505.55 y2: 721.83)","claim3b_testspec":"The  survey  was  a  3  (newspaper  article:  pro\u2013unhealthy food prime [Fernandez 2010], fear prime [Leeder2009],  and  peer  prime  [Landro  2006])  \u00d7 2  (food  category:healthy,  unhealthy)  \u00d7  2  (price  change:  increase,  decrease)mixed  design,  with  newspaper  article  serving  as  thebetween-subjects  factor. | We  calculated  the  degree  of  demand  responseasymmetry,  \uf064kc,  for  respondent  k  in  product  category  c  as\uf064kc =  |\u0454 pdkc | \u2013  |\u0454 pikc |,  where  |\u0454 pdkc | is  the  absolute  value  of  theestimated  price  elasticity  in  response  to  a  price  decreasesince  last  purchase and  |\u0454 pikc | is  the  absolute  value  of  theestimated elasticity in response to a price increase since lastpurchase.

Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.","author_address":"[Rust, Roland T.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Excellence Serv, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Rust, Roland T.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Complex Business, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Huang, Ming-Hui] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Informat Management, Coll Management, Taipei, Taiwan","reprint_address":"Rust, RT (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Excellence Serv, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","author_email":"rrust@rhsmith.umd.edu; huangmh@ntu.edu.tw","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":76.0,"issue":"2","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jm.10.0441","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000300653000004","pg":"47-66","author_last_WOS":"Rust","author_first_WOS":"Roland T.","published":"MAR 2012","pdf_filename":"Rust_JournMarket_2012_R1wL","claim2_abstract":"The  research  shows  that  service  productivity  shouldbe lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality andthat  service  productivity  should  be  higher  when  factors  (e.g.,  higher  market  concentration,  higher  wages)discourage the provision of better service quality.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1204","claim2_box":"(x1: 324.68 y1: 207.49) (x2: 269.02 y2: 248.51)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H2 predicts thatthere  is  a  negative  relationship  between  margin  (price)  andoptimal  productivity.","claim3a_pg":"11","claim3a_start":"4357","claim3a_box":"(x1: 494.62 y1: 261.38) (x2: 406.10 y2: 293.04)","claim3b_testspec":"We use a nonlinear least squares estimation with the Gauss\u2013Newton iterative method to estimate the model parameters,which regresses the residuals onto the partial derivatives of | the model with respect to the parameters until the estimatesconverge. | We  focus  our  analysis  on  service  firms  with  NorthAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes of42\u201392  for  2002  and  2007,  so  we  can  investigate  both  therobustness of the results over time and the change over timein  optimal  productivity. | Our  empirical  model  (Equation  24)  predicts  profit  as  theinverted  U-shaped  relationship  between  productivity  andoptimal productivity, covariates of profit, and industry fixedeffects  to  capture  unobserved  heterogeneity. | We operationalize profit as ROA | We  calculate  ROA  as  netincome  divided  by  total  assets. | We  stan-dardized  all  variables  in  the  equations  to  have  a  mean  of  0and a standard deviation of 1 to ensure direct comparability.","claim3b_pg":"9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 11","claim3b_start":"2827 | 3041 | 3291 | 5959 | 291 | 695 | 1730","claim3b_box":"(x1: 54.00 y1: 689.87) (x2: 294.00 y2: 721.83) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 34.34) (x2: 356.96 y2: 54.43) | (x1: 345.40 y1: 117.87) (x2: 415.17 y2: 172.73) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 655.39) (x2: 500.39 y2: 698.66) | (x1: 96.67 y1: 356.38) (x2: 227.55 y2: 364.88) | (x1: 188.17 y1: 427.22) (x2: 187.31 y2: 447.53) | (x1: 257.82 y1: 342.59) (x2: 294.00 y2: 374.46)","claim4_inftest":"as  a  service  firm\u2019s  selling  price  increases,optimal  productivity  decreases  (for  2002,  \uf062 =  \u2013.217,  t  =\u20133.678, p < .001; | \u2013.217 (.059) \u20133.678**","claim4_pg":"11 | 13","claim4_start":"4708 | 1387","claim4_box":"(x1: 382.75 y1: 330.87) (x2: 386.72 y2: 362.53) | (x1: 250.00 y1: 180.29) (x2: 372.51 y2: 187.50)","corr_author":"Roland T.

This study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [SE]) and their partners (other-efficacy [OE]) in financial services. Empirical results from 223 client financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of CP on participants' satisfaction evaluations, with SE positively moderating CP's impact on participation enjoyment. The synergistic effect of SE and OE on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: Even incongruent levels of SE and OE can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.","author_address":"[Yim, Chi Kin (Bennett); Lam, Simon S.

Stability in an NPD team may offer important advantages for decision making; however, its effectiveness as a structural coordination mechanism remains largely unexplored. Therefore, to offer insight into the value of NPD team stability, the authors develop a process-based model that examines the extent to which stability influences certain decision-making processes, which in turn influence new product advantage. They examine these relationships with a sample of cross-functional NPD project teams from 208 high-technology firms. The results reveal that the degree of stability in an NPD project team has a curvilinear relationship to team-level debate and decision-making comprehensiveness. In turn, whereas debate is positively related to decision comprehensiveness, decision comprehensiveness is positively related to new product advantage only at high levels. These curvilinear patterns shed light on anecdotal evidence that currently attributes success to both stable and unstable project teams.","author_address":"[Slotegraaf, Rebecca J.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Atuahene-Gima, Kwaku] China Europe Int Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China","reprint_address":"Slotegraaf, RJ (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.","author_email":"rslotegr@indiana.edu; kwaku@ceibs.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":75.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmkg.75.1.96","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000286364500007","pg":"96-108","author_last_WOS":"Slotegraaf","author_first_WOS":"Rebecca J.","published":"JAN 2011","pdf_filename":"Slotegraaf_JournMarket_2011_ONVb","claim2_abstract":"In turn, whereas debate is positively related to decision comprehensiveness, decision comprehensiveness ispositively related to new product advantage only at high levels.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1218","claim2_box":"(x1: 80.59 y1: 259.64) (x2: 333.26 y2: 275.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H3: NPD  team-level  debate  is  positively  related  to  decision-making comprehensiveness.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"2946","claim3a_box":"(x1: 69.00 y1: 619.97) (x2: 185.07 y2: 634.13)","claim3b_testspec":"Our  sample  consists  of  high-technology  firms  operating  inChina, | From  a  directory  of  2500  high-technology  firms  pro-vided  by  a  local  consulting  firm  in  Shanghai,  we  randomlycontacted  500  firms. | We  asked  the  project  leader  to  selectthe  most  recent  new  product  launched  within  the  last  three | years. | The pro-ject  leader  provided  information  on  project  team  stabilityand  new  product  advantage. | A  second  respondent,  nominated  by  the  firstrespondent as knowledgeable of and involved with the pro-ject selected, provided data on decision-making comprehen-siveness, team-level debate, and the control variables. | To  specify  the  model  and  estimate  the  parameters,  we  useda partial least squares (PLS) estimation approach, which is acomponent-based  structural  modeling  technique | To  assess  the  significance  of  parame-ter estimates, we used a bootstrap approach with 200 resam-ples,  with  each  sample  consisting  of  the  same  number  ofcases as the original sample | Table 2 reports the results for the structural model.","claim3b_pg":"5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 6","claim3b_start":"2186 | 2840 | 3111 | 3262 | 3446 | 3702 | 2319 | 3198 | 4622","claim3b_box":"(x1: 54.00 y1: 530.86) (x2: 80.39 y2: 547.01) | (x1: 69.00 y1: 659.06) (x2: 140.56 y2: 686.87) | (x1: 140.02 y1: 705.68) (x2: 293.99 y2: 721.84) | (x1: 317.99 y1: 38.33) (x2: 341.58 y2: 42.83) | (x1: 523.03 y1: 61.33) (x2: 447.16 y2: 88.83) | (x1: 371.72 y1: 118.83) (x2: 531.84 y2: 157.83) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 74.38) (x2: 526.97 y2: 101.88) | (x1: 404.86 y1: 235.38) (x2: 430.06 y2: 274.38) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 544.83) (x2: 521.96 y2: 549.33)","claim4_inftest":"Furthermore,  team-level  debate  has  a  significant,  posi-tive relationship to decision-making comprehensiveness (b =.35, p < .01), offering support for H3","claim4_pg":"7","claim4_start":"1637","claim4_box":"(x1: 332.99 y1: 333.35) (x2: 466.33 y2: 363.32)","corr_author":"Rebecca J.

At the same time, the effects of \"preshopping\" factors-the shoppers' overall trip goals, store-specific shopping objectives, and prior marketing exposures-are largely unexplored. The authors focus on these out-of-store drivers and, unlike prior research, use panel data to \"hold the shopper constant\" while estimating unbiased trip-level effects. Thus, they uncover opportunities for retailers to generate more unplanned buying from existing shoppers. The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store. Store-linked goals also affect unplanned buying; unplanned buying is higher on trips in which the shopper chooses the store for favorable pricing and lower on trips in which the shopper chooses the store as part of a multistore shopping trip. Although out-of-store marketing has no direct effect, it reinforces the lift in unplanned buying from shoppers who use marketing materials inside the store. The authors discuss the implications for retailers.","author_address":"[Bell, David R.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Corsten, Daniel] IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain; [Knox, George] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands","reprint_address":"Bell, DR (reprint author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","author_email":"davidb@wharton.upenn.edu; daniel.corsten@ie.edu; g.knox@uvt.nl","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":75.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmkg.75.1.31","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000286364500003","pg":"31-45","author_last_WOS":"Bell","author_first_WOS":"David R.","published":"JAN 2011","pdf_filename":"Bell_JournMarket_2011_q5J2","claim2_abstract":"The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically withthe  abstractness  of  the  overall  shopping  trip  goal  that  is  established  before  the  shopper  enters  the  store.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"756","claim2_box":"(x1: 191.78 y1: 226.64) (x2: 527.15 y2: 242.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: Unplanned  buying  increases  monotonically  with  theabstractness of the individual consumer\u2019s overall shoppingtrip goal.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"1756","claim3a_box":"(x1: 69.00 y1: 663.81) (x2: 116.45 y2: 688.35)","claim3b_testspec":"The  diary  panel  contains  more  than  18,000  category  pur-chases from 58 product categories | After  each  trip,  households  completed  ashort  questionnaire  and  checked  off  whether  each  category | purchase was \u201cplanned in advance of the store visit and pur-chased\u201d or \u201cdecided in store and purchased.\u201d | We  estimate  panel  fixed-effects  models  to  controlfor  unobserved  shopper  heterogeneity  that  may  be  corre-lated  with  our  key  measures,  but  this  requires  at  least  twoobservations  per  household. | To  test  H1,  we  elicitshopping  trip  goals  directly,  using  a  continuum  of  abstrac-tion  ranging  from  concrete  goals  (\u201cshopping  for  specialoffers and promotions,\u201d \u201cshopping for immediate consump-tion,\u201d  \u201cshopping  for  a  meal  on  the  same  day\u201d)  to  the  rela-tively  abstract  (\u201cfill-in  trip:  daily  essentials  and  top-upshopping\u201d)  to  the  most  abstract  (\u201cmajor  trip:  shopping  forthe  whole  week  or  more\u201d) | Toaccount  for  the  possibly  endogenous  relationship  betweenunplanned  buying  and  time  spent  in  the  store,  we  use  aninstrumental  variables  Poisson  model  for  the  count  (ofunplanned category purchases per trip) and two Tobit speci-fications that explicitly model the rate of unplanned buyingper unit time spent in the store. | A Poisson Model of Unplanned Buying | the estimates for the fixed-effect Poisson IV, | Hereinafter,  wefocus  on  the  Poisson  results. | TABLE 3 | FE | (Number of Unplanned Category Purchases) | joint test of a monotonic ordering","claim3b_pg":"5 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10","claim3b_start":"5771 | 6040 | 0 | 1253 | 2067 | 6142 | 0 | 4859 | 5210 | 47 | 146 | 171 | 183","claim3b_box":"(x1: 318.00 y1: 595.52) (x2: 454.24 y2: 611.58) | (x1: 392.80 y1: 641.77) (x2: 558.00 y2: 657.83) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 38.33) (x2: 235.55 y2: 54.39) | (x1: 87.68 y1: 269.63) (x2: 169.78 y2: 308.83) | (x1: 208.49 y1: 431.98) (x2: 161.95 y2: 517.44) | (x1: 547.69 y1: 648.33) (x2: 443.63 y2: 721.83) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 574.75) (x2: 238.88 y2: 579.50) | (x1: 380.42 y1: 519.10) (x2: 558.00 y2: 523.60) | (x1: 493.91 y1: 576.60) (x2: 434.41 y2: 592.60) | (x1: 285.40 y1: 38.64) (x2: 326.60 y2: 43.51) | (x1: 312.25 y1: 68.12) (x2: 323.75 y2: 72.50) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 79.62) (x2: 244.49 y2: 84.00) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 73.67) (x2: 187.62 y2: 78.17)","claim4_inftest":"As the overall trip goalbecomes  more  abstract  (the  shopper  and  all  else  are  heldconstant),  there  is  more  unplanned  buying.

The authors propose and test that when consumers have just received their salary (\"the near-salary condition\"), they exhibit promotion motivations in their product preferences. However, they exhibit prevention motivations in their product preferences when significant time has elapsed since their last salary receipt (\"the far-from-salary condition\"). The authors collected data from two longitudinal studies to validate these findings and to test the underlying process. Using actual purchase behavior and collecting product preference during a one-month period, the authors show that consumers' product preferences change in response to temporal distance from their last salary receipt. The findings suggest to managers that the best time to promote products or messages with a promotion appeal is near to consumers' last salary receipt and that the best time to promote products or messages with a prevention appeal is far from consumers' last salary receipt.","author_address":"[Mishra, Himanshu; Mishra, Arul] Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Nayakankuppam, Dhananjay] Univ Iowa, Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","reprint_address":"Mishra, H (reprint author), Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.","author_email":"himanshu.mishra@utah.edu; arul.mishra@utah.edu; dhananjay-nayakankuppam@uiowa.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":74.0,"issue":"5","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmkg.74.5.93","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000281303500007","pg":"93-103","author_last_WOS":"Mishra","author_first_WOS":"Himanshu","published":"SEP 2010","pdf_filename":"Mishra_JournMarket_2010_kmDj","claim2_abstract":"In this article, the authors find that consumers\u2019 preferences change as a function of their temporal distance fromthe receipt of their last salary.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"137","claim2_box":"(x1: 54.00 y1: 171.42) (x2: 186.49 y2: 187.05)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: As people move temporally away from salary receipt,they are more likely to prefer products with prevention-focused attributes than those with promotion-focusedattributes.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"994","claim3a_box":"(x1: 69.00 y1: 252.92) (x2: 119.31 y2: 287.41)","claim3b_testspec":"Data were collected during a one-month period,and study months did not correspond with calendar months. | participants completed a questionnaire each time | they came back from any shopping trip for the next 30 days. | First, participants wereasked to categorize the items they bought into twocategories\u2014items they aspired to buy and items they feltthey ought to buy. | We used a hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) procedure toanalyze the data. | participants responded to questionsseveral times during a one-month period, so from the stand-point of HLM, each response occasion served as a lower-level unit (Level 1) that was nested within each individualparticipant (Level 2). | We formed anindex to calculate aspired products as a proportion of totalproducts purchased at each shopping trip: | A higher proportion of aspired products indicated a greaterpromotion motivation. | The use of elapsed time since last salary receipt as anexplanatory variable","claim3b_pg":"4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5","claim3b_start":"1408 | 3013 | 3103 | 3757 | 175 | 373 | 643 | 786 | 866","claim3b_box":"(x1: 93.05 y1: 383.83) (x2: 294.00 y2: 399.83) | (x1: 92.40 y1: 717.33) (x2: 294.00 y2: 721.83) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 38.33) (x2: 557.82 y2: 42.83) | (x1: 462.87 y1: 189.08) (x2: 392.82 y2: 228.08) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 96.92) (x2: 120.82 y2: 113.07) | (x1: 146.74 y1: 131.87) (x2: 138.78 y2: 182.97) | (x1: 236.50 y1: 194.11) (x2: 221.58 y2: 221.91) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 292.32) (x2: 143.75 y2: 308.47) | (x1: 69.00 y1: 315.62) (x2: 136.85 y2: 331.76)","claim4_inftest":"The use of elapsed time since last salary receipt as anexplanatory variable revealed a significant main effect fortemporal distance from last salary receipt on the proportionof aspired products (b = \u2013.2, t(147) = \u20132.37, p < .02).

Central to the diffusion are important work-group members, or envoys. Through their market-oriented action, top managers serve as market-oriented role models to two important types of observers in work groups-formal middle managers and work-group expert peers. In turn, these observers become top managers' envoys and role models of market-oriented behavior to frontline employees. Empirical results from a three-level data set from a Fortune 500 company support this perspective. While envoys who are neither market oriented nor identified with the firm are the least effective, envoys who are not market oriented but are strongly identified with the firm are also detrimental. Network size hinders the informal route of learning through expert peers but not the formal route through middle managers. By identifying who the important work-group envoys are and under what conditions certain envoys are likely to be most effective, this study helps managers select the best envoys to implement MO.","author_address":"[Lam, Son K.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kraus, Florian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Mkt, Bochum, Germany; [Ahearne, Michael] Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, Sales Excellence Inst, Houston, TX 77004 USA","reprint_address":"Lam, SK (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","author_email":"sonlam@terry.uga.edu; florian.g.kraus@rub.de; mahearne@uh.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2429","eISSN":"1547-7185","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":74.0,"issue":"5","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmkg.74.5.61","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000281303500005","pg":"61-79","author_last_WOS":"Lam","author_first_WOS":"Son K.","published":"SEP 2010","pdf_filename":"Lam_JournMarket_2010_q5AN","claim2_abstract":"While envoys who are neither market oriented noridentified with the firm are the least effective, envoys who are not market oriented but are strongly identified withthe firm are also detrimental.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"755","claim2_box":"(x1: 336.21 y1: 226.42) (x2: 182.60 y2: 253.05)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H3: The higher a middle manager\u2019s OI, the stronger is thetransfer of IMO (a) from the top manager to the middlemanager and (b) from the middle manager to the salesrepresentatives, including the expert peer.","claim3a_pg":"5","claim3a_start":"4326","claim3a_box":"(x1: 333.00 y1: 253.08) (x2: 498.09 y2: 287.27)","claim3b_testspec":"Market orientation (MO) | individual-level MO (IMO) | organizational identification(OI), | We collected data from the sales forceof a U.S.-based Fortune 500 company in the cleaningand sanitizing industry. | In the context of this study, we use the term \u201csalesdirectors\u201d to refer to top managers and the term \u201csales man-agers\u201d to refer to middle managers. | we applied hierarchical linear modeling | The first two modelsare two-level models, with sales managers\u2019 IMO (Model 1)and expert peers\u2019 IMO (Model 2) as dependent variables. | The equations of eachof these HLM models appear in Appendix B. | Model 1: \u03b3 (SE) | Model 1: Top Managers\u2019 IMO \u2192 Sales Managers\u2019 IMO | D_IMO = sales directors\u2019 IMO, | TDR = total number of direct reports\/sales managers per sales director, | A_IMO = mean of IMO per region managed by a sales director, | SM_OI = sales managers\u2019 OI | SM_CI = sales managers\u2019 perceived competitive intensity | Appendix BModel Specification | Model 1: Sales Managers\u2019 IMO as DependentVariable","claim3b_pg":"1 | 2 | 2 | 7 | 7 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 16 | 16","claim3b_start":"2133 | 82 | 981 | 39 | 377 | 127 | 2450 | 2737 | 69 | 127 | 1427 | 1457 | 1575 | 1692 | 1755 | 3062 | 3200","claim3b_box":"(x1: 54.00 y1: 370.73) (x2: 182.35 y2: 366.83) | (x1: 182.51 y1: 49.83) (x2: 294.01 y2: 54.33) | (x1: 176.42 y1: 233.83) (x2: 73.70 y2: 249.83) | (x1: 141.56 y1: 76.68) (x2: 148.16 y2: 104.32) | (x1: 87.38 y1: 146.09) (x2: 196.48 y2: 173.72) | (x1: 88.57 y1: 61.85) (x2: 260.24 y2: 66.35) | (x1: 210.89 y1: 587.98) (x2: 294.00 y2: 616.00) | (x1: 203.98 y1: 646.78) (x2: 240.41 y2: 663.04) | (x1: 202.77 y1: 69.01) (x2: 266.36 y2: 73.18) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 86.51) (x2: 278.21 y2: 90.68) | (x1: 79.12 y1: 655.98) (x2: 185.76 y2: 659.68) | (x1: 187.64 y1: 655.98) (x2: 440.18 y2: 659.68) | (x1: 126.46 y1: 664.98) (x2: 350.21 y2: 668.68) | (x1: 98.14 y1: 673.98) (x2: 199.21 y2: 677.68) | (x1: 326.08 y1: 673.98) (x2: 524.82 y2: 677.68) | (x1: 398.92 y1: 227.33) (x2: 503.91 y2: 247.81) | (x1: 318.00 y1: 289.71) (x2: 356.21 y2: 305.85)","claim4_inftest":"As wepredicted in H3a, sales managers\u2019 OI strengthens the transferof IMO from sales directors to sales managers (H3a: \u03b3 = .15,p < .05; Model 1 and Figure 2, Panel A). | D_IMO \u00d7 SM_OI .15* (.07) H3a","claim4_pg":"9 | 10","claim4_start":"5858 | 323","claim4_box":"(x1: 529.52 y1: 635.57) (x2: 482.38 y2: 674.68) | (x1: 72.00 y1: 186.52) (x2: 530.00 y2: 192.66)","corr_author":"Son K.

A growing stream of product placement research has conducted surveys of consumer and practitioner views on the practice and experiments to gauge product placement's impact on brand awareness, attitudes, and purchase intent. However, there is no evidence of whether firms' investments in film product placements are worthwhile. The event study of 126 product placements in successful films during 2002 reveals a mean cumulative abnormal return of .89% during the film's opening, indicating that product placement in a successful film is associated with positive movements in firm stock prices. Cross-sectional analysis of the returns offers new insight into how product, film, and execution factors influence the placement's worth. The authors find that placement abnormal returns are enhanced by tie-in advertising and brand equity but are inhibited by audience absorption, critical acclaim, and violent film content.

We argue that such intergroup biases may result from an interaction of basic cognitive processes and the structure of the information ecology. This cognitive-ecological model assumes that groups such as minorities and out-groups are often novel to a perceiver. At the level of cognition, novel groups are primarily associated with their unique attributes, that is, attributes that differentiate them from other groups. In the information ecology, however, unique attributes are likely to be negative. Thus, novel groups, and by proxy minorities and out-groups, tend to be associated with negative attributes, leading to an evaluative disadvantage. We demonstrated this disadvantage in three experiments in which participants successively formed impressions about two fictional groups associated with the same number of positive and negative attributes. Participants preferred the first group over the novel group as long as the groups' unique attributes were negative.","author_address":"[Alves, Hans; Koch, Alex; Unkelbach, Christian] Univ Cologne, Social Cognit Ctr Cologne, Richard Strauss St 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","reprint_address":"Alves, H (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Social Cognit Ctr Cologne, Richard Strauss St 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.","author_email":"hans.alves@uni-koeln.de","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0956-7976","eISSN":"1467-9280","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":29.0,"issue":"7","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0956797618756862","WOS_category":"Psychology, Multidisciplinary","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000439608800010","pg":"1126-1133","author_last_WOS":"Alves","author_first_WOS":"Hans","published":"JUL 2018","pdf_filename":"Alves_PsychologSci_2018_AvOr","claim2_abstract":"Participants preferred the first group over the novel group as long as the groups\u2019 unique attributes were negative","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"3957","claim2_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 345.65) (x2: 536.40 y2: 351.15)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hence,  if  (a)  novel  groups  are  associated with  and  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  their  unique  attri-butes and (b) unique attributes are likely to be negative, then people can be expected to form negative impres-sions  about  novel  groups  and  thereby  derogate  out-groups and minorities | We expected preferences for the first group when unique traits were negative and shared attributes were positive.

But can these postures actually cause power? The results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.","author_address":"[Carney, Dana R.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cuddy, Amy J.

In five studies, we found that people in U. S.

Indians showed a greater tendency to construe actions as choices when these actions involved responding to other people than when they did not. These findings show that whether people construe actions as choices is significantly shaped by sociocultural systems of meanings and practices. Together, they suggest that the positive consequences associated with maximizing the availability of personal choice may not be universal and instead may be limited to North American contexts.","author_address":"[Savani, Krishna] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kumar, Satishchandra] Univ Bombay, Bombay 400032, Maharashtra, India; [Berlia, Neha] Apeejay Educ Soc, New Delhi, India","reprint_address":"Savani, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, 450 Serra Mall,Bldg 420, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","author_email":"ksavani@stanford.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0956-7976","eISSN":"1467-9280","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":21.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0956797609359908","WOS_category":"Psychology, Multidisciplinary","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000276076500016","pg":"391-398","author_last_WOS":"Savani","author_first_WOS":"Krishna","published":"MAR 2010","pdf_filename":"Savani_PsychologSci_2010_88xa","claim2_abstract":"In five studies, we found that people in  U.S.  American  contexts,  where  the  disjoint  model  of  agency  is  prevalent,  are  more  likely  than  those  in  Indian  contexts to  construe  their  own  and  other  individuals\u2019  behaviors  as  choices,  to  construe  ongoing  behaviors  and  behaviors  recalled from  memory  as  choices,  to  construe  naturally  occurring  and  experimentally  controlled  behaviors  as  choices,  to  construe mundane and important actions as choices, and to construe personal and interpersonal actions as choices.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"3238","claim2_box":"(x1: 412.18 y1: 265.47) (x2: 483.12 y2: 319.28)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Study 3 tested whether the cultural difference generalizes to the construal of other individuals\u2019 behaviors.

If they consider two discounts-for example, take 18% off the list price, then take an additional 12% off-consumers weight the two percentages to make their evaluations. Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is larger or smaller. Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes.

Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments.

Although extant research has focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues from repurchase. The authors develop a return on investment (ROI) model to capture how service amenities produce financial return from these two sources. They apply the model to hotel amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel company. The authors employ a hierarchical Bayesian formulation to estimate the parameters. They use the estimation results to compare ROI for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across brands. The authors validate the results for one amenity against the ROI from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a natural experiment with a before\/after design with controls. The present research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities are most profitable.","author_address":"[Hamilton, Rebecca W.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Rust, Roland T.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Excellence Serv & Ctr Complex Business, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Wedel, Michel] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, PepsiCo Chair Consumer Sci, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Dev, Chekitan S.] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","reprint_address":"Hamilton, RW (reprint author), Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA.","author_email":"rebecca.hamilton@georgetown.edu; rrust@rhsmith.umd.edu; mwedel@rhsmith.umd.edu; chekitan.dev@cornell.edu","funding":"Center for Excellence in Service at the University of Maryland","publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2437","eISSN":"1547-7193","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":54.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmr.14.0364","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000395374700007","pg":"96-110","author_last_WOS":"Hamilton","author_first_WOS":"Rebecca W.","published":"FEB 2017","pdf_filename":"Hamilton_JournMarketRes_2017_reP8","claim2_abstract":"Although extant research has focused on theeffect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arisefrom two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues fromrepurchase.

Using a unique data set from a wellness program, they find that online social interactions play a key role in driving repeat behavior, and after controlling for contemporaneous correlations from same-office friends, the social influence emanates even from distant friends working in different offices. The authors also find that monetary incentives have a significant impact on repeat usage and that ignoring this may overstate the impact of social influence. Furthermore, what-if scenario analyses show that social interactions are more effective than monetary incentives when both are present. The authors then explore social influence theories to understand the underlying process mechanisms that may operate in the repeat usage context.

They discuss the definitions of the focal constructs-customer engagement (CE) and employee engagement (EE)-in the engagement framework, capture these constructs' multidimensionality, and develop and refine items for measuring CE and EE. They validate the proposed framework with data from 120 companies over two time periods, and they develop strategies to help firms raise their levels of CE and EE to improve performance. They also observe that the influence of EE on CE is moderated by employee empowerment, type of firm (business-tobusiness [B2B] vs. business-to-consumer [B2C]), and nature of industry (manufacturing vs. service); in particular, this effect is stronger for B2B (vs. B2C) firms and service (vs. manufacturing) firms. The authors find that although both CE and EE positively influence firm performance, the effect of CE on firm performance is stronger.

In 2013, global spending on mobile advertising was approximately $16.7 billion, and it is expected to exceed $62.8 billion by 2017. The most prevalent type of mobile advertising is mobile display advertising (MDA), which takes the form of banners on mobile web pages and in mobile applications. This article examines which product characteristics are likely to be associated with MDA campaigns that are effective in increasing consumers' (1) favorable attitudes toward products and (2) purchase intentions. Data from a large-scale test-control field experiment covering 54 U.S. MDA campaigns that ran between 2007 and 2010 and involved 39,946 consumers show that MDA campaigns significantly increased consumers' favorable attitudes and purchase intentions only when the campaigns advertised products that were higher (vs. lower) involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic). The authors explain this finding using established theories of information processing and persuasion and suggest that when MDAs work effectively, they do so by triggering consumers to recall and process previously stored product information.","author_address":"[Stephen, Andrew T.] Univ Pittsburgh, Joseph M Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Sarvary, Miklos] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sarvary, Miklos] Columbia Univ, Media Program, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA","reprint_address":null,"author_email":"Yakov.Bart@insead.edu; AStephen@katz.pitt.edu; miklos.sarvary@columbia.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2437","eISSN":"1547-7193","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":51.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmr.13.0503","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000340863700002","pg":"270-285","author_last_WOS":"Bart","author_first_WOS":"Yakov","published":"JUN 2014","pdf_filename":"Bart_JournMarketRes_2014_pNjB","claim2_abstract":"Data from a large-scale test-control field experimentcovering  54  U.S.  MDA  campaigns  that  ran  between  2007  and  2010  andinvolved  39,946  consumers  show  that  MDA  campaigns  significantlyincreased  consumers\u2019  favorable  attitudes  and  purchase  intentions  onlywhen  the  campaigns  advertised  products  that  were  higher  (vs.  lower)involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1792","claim2_box":"(x1: 303.29 y1: 206.38) (x2: 390.52 y2: 266.01)","claim3a_concretehyp":"mobile  display  advertise-ments (MDAs) | weonly expect an MDA to have significant positive treatmenteffects on attitudes and intentions when the advertised prod-uct is both higher involvement and utilitarian.","claim3a_pg":"2 | 8","claim3a_start":"1668 | 2850","claim3a_box":"(x1: 185.95 y1: 366.32) (x2: 116.08 y2: 381.95) | (x1: 282.17 y1: 579.13) (x2: 232.43 y2: 617.04)","claim3b_testspec":"To address our research question, we use a novel data setfeaturing responses from 39,946 consumers across 54 MDAcampaigns that ran over a three-year period (July 2007 toJune 2010). | We measured attitude as the extent to which partici-pants  had  a  favorable  attitude  toward  the  product | Using the little information about the 11,565 nonrespond-ents that was recorded (i.e., whether their mobile device wasa smartphone), we employed Heckman\u2019s two-step correc-tion  procedure  (Heckman  1979).

Previous consumer research has found that this cycle influences women's clothing and food preferences. The authors propose that the ovulatory cycle actually has a much broader effect on women's economic behavior. Drawing on theory in evolutionary psychology, the authors hypothesize that the week-long period near ovulation should boost women's desire for relative status, which should alter their economic decisions. Findings from three studies show that women near ovulation seek positional goods to improve their social standing. Additional findings reveal that ovulation leads women to pursue positional goods when doing so improves relative standing compared with other women but not compared with men. When playing the dictator game, for example, ovulating women gave smaller offers to a female partner but not to a male partner. Overall, women's monthly hormonal fluctuations seem to have a substantial effect on consumer behavior by systematically altering their positional concerns, a finding that has important implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers.","author_address":"[Durante, Kristina M.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Griskevicius, Vladas] Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Cantu, Stephanie M.; Simpson, Jeffry A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","reprint_address":"Durante, KM (reprint author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.","author_email":"kristina.durante@utsa.edu; vladasg@umn.edu; cant0089@umn.edu; simps108@umn.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER MARKETING ASSOC","publisher_address":"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-2437","eISSN":"1547-7193","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":51.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1509\/jmr.11.0327","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000340863300003","pg":"27-39","author_last_WOS":"Durante","author_first_WOS":"Kristina M.","published":"FEB 2014","pdf_filename":"Durante_JournMarketRes_2014_lkXV","claim2_abstract":"Findings  from  three  studies  show  that  women  nearovulation  seek  positional  goods  to  improve  their  social  standing.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1255","claim2_box":"(x1: 304.94 y1: 207.38) (x2: 532.96 y2: 223.01)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: Ovulation  amplifies  women\u2019s  tendency  to  seek  relativerather  than  absolute  gains  when  the  comparison  group  isother women.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"5243","claim3a_box":"(x1: 328.00 y1: 420.01) (x2: 392.12 y2: 444.23)","claim3b_testspec":"to divide women across the entire cycle into the fol-lowing two groups: (1) a high-fertility group (days 8\u201314, n = 80) and (2) a low-fertility group (days 1\u20137, n = 85; days15\u201328, n = 144).

Using data from the peer-to-peer lending website Prosper.com, the authors find that unverifiable information affects lending decisions above and beyond the influence of objective, verifiable information. As the number of identity claims in narratives increases, so does loan funding, whereas loan performance suffers, because these borrowers are less likely to pay back the loan. In addition, identity content plays an important role. Identities focused on being trustworthy or successful are associated with increased loan funding but ironically are less predictive of loan performance than other identities (i.e., moral and economic hardship).

Using data from over 60,000 participants, we traced the ability to learn new faces from pre-adolescence through middle age. In three separate experiments, we show that face learning ability improves until just after age 30 - even though other putatively related abilities (inverted face recognition and name recognition) stop showing age-related improvements years earlier. Our data provide the first behavioral evidence for late maturation of face processing and the dissociation of face recognition from other abilities over time demonstrates that studies on adult age development can provide insight into the organization and development of cognitive systems.

For any set of con-secutive signatures, a travel path is implied by the routebetween addresses. The distance between any two con-secutive signatories on a petition page is intersignatory | distance (ISD). We calculate intersignatory distance us-ing the straight-line distance between addresses. | This difference between geographically consecutivesignatures and those seemingly drawn at random fromgeographic space can be exploited to classify petitions asbeing walked (the door-to-door method) or placed at acentral location (the attractor method). A canvasser col-lecting signatures at a single attractor point will, all elseequal, have higher average ISD values. | As our first measure, we adopt the average intersig-natory distance per canvasser. | To perform hypothesis testing, we compare the dis-tance on this route to the set (or a sampled distribution)of all possible routes and then, applying principles of ran-domization inference, we calculate its quantile in the nulldistribution.

Increasing inequality shifts the proportion of the population falling into lower socioeconomic categories, thereby increasing the size of the electoral constituency that is receptive toward leftist parties' redistributive economic appeals. In the face of rising inequality, then, leftist parties will emphasize economic issues in their manifestos. By contrast, the nonredistributive economic policies often espoused by rightist parties will not appeal to this burgeoning constituency. Rather, we argue, rightist parties will opt to emphasize values-based issues, especially in those cases where social demand in the electorate for values-based representation is high.

Further, because different cultures are organized by different logics, individual differences mean something different in each. Central to these studies are concepts of honor-related violence and individual worth as being inalienable versus socially conferred. We illustrate our argument with 2 experiments involving participants from honor, face, and dignity cultures.

This article examines how an adult child's migration, both domestically and to the United States, affects the emotional and psychological well-being of parents who remain in the place of origin. Using nationally representative longitudinal data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (N=4,718), the authors found limited evidence that parents whose offspring emigrated to the United States experience worse outcomes than parents of offspring who did not migrate.

Several studies have found indirect support for this hypothesis and have shown that the percentage of neighborhood residents who are Black is positively associated with the perceptions of victimization risk and fear of crime by White residents. To date, however, little research has investigated whether, as theory would suggest, this relationship is either a consequence of or is contingent on Whites holding stereotypes of Blacks as criminals. In this article, we address this issue by examining whether racial typification of crime mediates or moderates the relationships between static and dynamic measures of neighborhood racial composition and the perceptions of victimization risk by Whites. The results offer mixed support for the threat hypothesis and show that racial typification of crime conditions the relationship between perceived changes in neighborhood racial composition and the perceptions of victimization risk by Whites, but neither explains nor influences the association between static measures of racial composition and the latter. The implications of the findings for threat theory and research are discussed.","author_address":"[Pickett, Justin T.; Chiricos, Ted; Golden, Kristin M.; Gertz, Marc] Florida State Univ, Coll Criminol & Criminal Justice, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","reprint_address":"Pickett, JT (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Coll Criminol & Criminal Justice, 634 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.","author_email":"jtp06d@fsu.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":50.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/j.1745-9125.2011.00255.x","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000299734800006","pg":"145-186","author_last_WOS":"Pickett","author_first_WOS":"Justin T.","published":"FEB 2012","pdf_filename":"PICKETT_Criminology_2012_YgPW","claim2_abstract":"The results offer mixed support for the threat hypothesisand show that racial typification of crime conditions the relationshipbetween perceived changes in neighborhood racial composition and the | perceptions of victimization risk by Whites, but neither explains norin\ufb02uences the association between static measures of racial compositionand the latter.","claim2_pg":"1 | 2","claim2_start":"1215 | 18","claim2_box":"(x1: 156.75 y1: 464.58) (x2: 394.30 y2: 493.22) | (x1: 93.18 y1: 81.53) (x2: 154.35 y2: 110.18)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Both the static and the dynamic measures of perceivedneighborhood racial composition will be more consequential for riskperceptions among Whites who typify crime as more of a Blackphenomenon.","claim3a_pg":"10","claim3a_start":"2746","claim3a_box":"(x1: 145.87 y1: 550.98) (x2: 144.69 y2: 591.57)","claim3b_testspec":"To test these hypotheses, we draw on data from two random telephonesurveys of adults (18 years of age or older) that were conducted by publicopinion polling firms in Tallahassee, FL.

They estimate a learning model of store price image (SPI) formation with the impact of actual prices linked to category characteristics on a unique data set combining consumers' store visit and purchase information with their price perceptions. The results identify characteristics that drive categories' store price signaling power for different store formats. \"Big ticket\" categories with a narrow price range strongly shape consumers' store price beliefs, whereas (volatile) prices of frequently or deeply promoted categories are less influential. At traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities and for which quality differentiation is high. For hard discounters, however, SPI is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow assortments. Notably, categories' SPI signaling power is not proportional to their share of wallet at either type of chain.

Building on research on self-signaling, the authors predict that consumers are more likely to give when the donation appeal references a hedonic product than when a utilitarian product is referenced or when no comparison is provided. They posit that this phenomenon occurs because referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal changes the self-attributions, or self-signaling utility, associated with the choice to donate. A series of hypothetical and actual choice experiments demonstrate the predicted effect and show that the increase in donation rates occurs because the self-attributions signaled by a choice not to donate are more negative in the context of a hedonic reference product. Finally, consistent with these experimental findings, a field experiment shows that referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal increases real donation rates in a nonlaboratory setting.

The authors model the adoption decision of individuals as a binary choice affected by three factors: (1) the local network structure formed by already adopted neighbors, (2) the average characteristics of adopted neighbors (influencers), and (3) the characteristics of the potential adopters. Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects. First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect). The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted individuals, average demographics and global network position can predict their influential power on their neighbors.

According to an influential computational model, consistency between predicted and observed action consequences attenuates perceived stimulus intensity, which might provide a marker of agentic control. An important assumption of this model is that these predictions are generated within the motor system. However, previous studies of sensory attenuation have typically confounded motor-specific perceptual modulation with perceptual effects of stimulus predictability that are not specific to motor action. As a result, these studies cannot unambiguously attribute sensory attenuation to a motor locus. We present a psychophysical experiment on auditory attenuation that avoids this pitfall. Subliminal masked priming of motor actions with compatible prime-target pairs has previously been shown to modulate both reaction times and the explicit feeling of control over action consequences. Here, we demonstrate reduced perceived loudness of tones caused by compatibly primed actions. Importantly, this modulation results from a manipulation of motor processing and is not confounded by stimulus predictability.

Through-out all parts of the experiment, i.e. the training session,the pre-test, the experimental task and the control task, vi-sual targets (black arrow outlines pointing to the right or tothe left) were first preceded by visual primes and then by ametacontrast mask.

In the training session and pre-test,superimposed arrows pointing in both directions servedas neutral primes.

Paradoxically, perceptuo-motor decisions appear optimal, or nearly optimal (Trommershauser, Maloney, & Landy, 2008). Here, we highlight limitations to the comparison of performance between and within domains. These limitations are illustrated by means of two perceptuo-motor decision-making experiments. The results indicate that participants did not optimize fundamental performance-related factors (precision and time usage), even though standard analyses may have classed participants as 'optimal'. Moreover, simulations and comparisons across our studies demonstrate that optimality depends on task difficulty. Thus, it seems that a standard model of perceptuomotor decision-making fails to provide an absolute standard of performance. Importantly, this appears to be a limitation of optimal models of human behaviour in general. This, in conjunction with non-trivial evaluative- and methodological differences, suggests that verdicts favouring perceptuo-motor, or perceptual, systems over higher-level cognitive systems in terms of level of performance are premature.

Data analysisThe first block in the experimental session was viewedas a warm up block and was deleted prior to any analyses.Late and anticipatory responses were discounted (see e.g.,Seydell et al., 2008). For the decision session, the meanproportion of late responses was .07 (SD = .06). The meanproportion of anticipatory responses was .07 (SD = .05). To assess participants\u2019 overall performance (i.e., effi-ciency), a reliable estimate of movement variability isneeded. The free choice component of the decision sessionmeant that some targets (e.g., large near targets) had fewor no data points. In order to guarantee a minimum of 20data points for each precision estimate, data sets for eachparticipant were created by adding the last 20 data pointsfrom the practice session to the decision data (for each tar-get location and target size combination).

Given anormal response distribution, circular targets and symmet-ric penalty regions (as employed here) the optimal aimpoint is the target centre. Aim point error describes the dis-tance between a participant\u2019s aim point (the centroid ofeach response distribution) and the target centre.4 Thelower the aim point error \u2013 the closer to optimal the aimpoint choice.

Experiments 1-3 asked whether as patterns in language suggest a structural similarity between representations of spatial length and temporal duration is easier to access than one between length and other dimensions of experience, such as loudness. Adult participants were shown pairings of lines of different length with tones of different duration (Experiment 1) or tones of different loudness (Experiment 2). The length of the lines and duration or loudness of the tones was either positively or negatively correlated. Participants were better able to bind particular lengths and durations when they were positively correlated than when they were not, a pattern not observed for pairings of lengths and tone amplitudes, even after controlling for the presence of visual cues to duration in Experiment 1 (Experiment 3). This suggests that representations of length and duration may functionally overlap to a greater extent than representations of length and loudness. Experiments 4 and 5 asked whether experience with and mastery of words like long and short which can flexibly refer to both space and time itself creates this privileged relationship. Nine-month-old infants, like adults, were better able to bind representations of particular lengths and durations when these were positively correlated (Experiment 4), and failed to show this pattern for pairings of lengths and tone amplitudes (Experiment 5). We conclude that the functional overlap between representations of length and duration does not result from a metaphoric construction processes mediated by learning to flexibly use words such as long and short. We suggest instead that it may reflect an evolutionary recycling of spatial representations for more general purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I argue for a more nuanced understanding of how some democracies that possess specific investigative institutions, such as national security-relevant freedom of information laws, legislative oversight powers, and press freedoms, are able to avoid the problems of which democracy skeptics warn. Using a new dataset on national security accountability institutions in democracies within a Bradley-Terry framework, I find that national security oversight mechanisms raise the probability that a democracy wins international disputes as well as increasing the expected number of enemy casualties, as compared to democracies that lack effective oversight. Contra previous theories of foreign policy efficacy, I find that the chances for democratic foreign policy success are maximized when competitive elections are linked to institutions that increase the retrospective revelation of previously classified information.","author_address":"[Colaresi, Michael] Michigan State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","reprint_address":"Colaresi, M (reprint author) Michigan State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 303 S Kedzie Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.","author_email":"colaresi@msu.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0092-5853","eISSN":"1540-5907","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":56.0,"issue":"3","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/j.1540-5907.2011.00567.x","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000306484900011","pg":"671-689","author_last_WOS":"Colaresi","author_first_WOS":"Michael","published":"JUL 2012","pdf_filename":"Colaresi_AmJourPoliSci_2012_9XrX","claim2_abstract":"Using a new dataset on nationalsecurity accountability institutions in democracies within a Bradley-Terry framework, I find that national security oversightmechanisms raise the probability that a democracy wins international disputes as well as increasing the expected numberof enemy casualties, as compared to democracies that lack effective oversight.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"597","claim2_box":"(x1: 404.76 y1: 217.36) (x2: 369.52 y2: 257.71)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The above discussion leads to the hypothesis that the for-eign policy ability of democracies with national securityoversight institutions should be, ceteris paribus, higherthan democracies that lack these types of institutions.","claim3a_pg":"8","claim3a_start":"3908","claim3a_box":"(x1: 316.09 y1: 374.28) (x2: 552.18 y2: 418.10)","claim3b_testspec":"To measure foreign policy success after 1970, I rely onthe Dyadic Militarized Interstate Dispute data (DYAD-MID) version 2.0 (Maoz 2005). | I code policy success when a stateis either victorious in a dispute or forces the otherside to yield. | The database wasconstructed through historical research and secondaryanalysis of preexisting datasets on the three retrospectiveinformation revelation tools detailed above.

Yet the literature reports mixed results on the product development effectiveness outcomes of sustainable product development strategies, while scant research has investigated how companies integrate environmental aspects into product development. This study develops a model that integrates effectiveness-enhancing outcomes and organizational inputs of eco-friendly product development strategies. Using questionnaire responses from firms from multiple industries, supplemented with lagged primary product development performance data, we find that top management commitment and corporate environmental support policies can facilitate eco-friendly product development strategies, while environmental performance incentives do not. In turn, the adoption of such strategies has a positive effect on firms' product development effectiveness. This effect weakens when business conditions are highly complex but tends to become stronger with increasing levels of munificence in the business environment. These findings have important implications for practitioners and researchers that are discussed.","author_address":"[Katsikeas, Constantine S.; Leonidou, Constantinos N.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Zeriti, Athina] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Queens Campus,Univ Blvd, Thornaby TS17 6BH, Stockton On Tee, England","reprint_address":"Katsikeas, CS (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.","author_email":"csk@lubs.leeds.ac.uk; cl@lubs.leeds.ac.uk; Athina.zeriti@durham.ac.uk","funding":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0092-0703","eISSN":"1552-7824","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":44.0,"issue":"6.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s11747-015-0470-5","WOS_category":"Business","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000385351400002","pg":"660-684","author_last_WOS":"Katsikeas","author_first_WOS":"Constantine S.","published":"NOV 2016","pdf_filename":"Katsikeas_JournAcaMarkSci_2016_m514","claim2_abstract":"Using questionnaire responses from firms from multiple in-dustries, supplemented with lagged primary product develop-ment performance data, we find that top management com-mitment and corporate environmental support policies canfacilitate eco-friendly product development strategies, whileenvironmental performance incentives do not","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"892","claim2_box":"(x1: 51.02 y1: 397.59) (x2: 236.36 y2: 464.36)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: Top management commitment to environmentalpreservation has a positive effect on the extent towhich the firm deploys an eco-friendly productdevelopment strategy.","claim3a_pg":"7","claim3a_start":"5526","claim3a_box":"(x1: 306.11 y1: 671.11) (x2: 420.69 y2: 713.87)","claim3b_testspec":"We tested the hypothesized links using seemingly unrelatedregressions (SUR) in STATA 13.1 | Eco-friendly product development strategy | were the dependent variable | Model 3 adds theeffects of the interactions of the three business environmentvariables with eco-friendly product development strategy.

Here we investigated the consensus and accuracy of judgments of trustworthiness. In Study 1, we showed that the type of photo judged makes a significant difference for whether an individual is judged as trustworthy. In Study 2, we found that inferences of trustworthiness made from the faces of corporate criminals did not differ from inferences made from the faces of noncriminal executives. In Study 3, we found that judgments of trustworthiness did not differ between the faces of military criminals and the faces of military heroes. In Study 4, we tempted undergraduates to cheat on a test. Although we found that judgments of intelligence from the students' faces were related to students' scores on the test and that judgments of students' extraversion were correlated with self-reported extraversion, there was no relationship between judgments of trustworthiness from the students' faces and students' cheating behavior. Finally, in Study 5, we examined the neural correlates of the accuracy of judgments of trustworthiness from faces. Replicating previous research, we found that perceptions of trustworthiness from the faces in Study 4 corresponded to participants' amygdala response. However, we found no relationship between the amygdala response and the targets' actual cheating behavior. These data suggest that judgments of trustworthiness may not be accurate but, rather, reflect subjective impressions for which people show high agreement.","author_address":"[Rule, Nicholas O.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Krendl, Anne C.] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Dept Psychol, Bloomington, IN USA; [Ivcevic, Zorana] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ambady, Nalini] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","reprint_address":"Rule, NO (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.","author_email":"rule@psych.utoronto.ca; nambady@stanford.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":104.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0031050","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000315130400001","pg":"409-426","author_last_WOS":"Rule","author_first_WOS":"Nicholas O.","published":"MAR 2013","pdf_filename":"Rule_JournPerSocPsy_2013_b4Kk","claim2_abstract":"In Study 1, we showed that the type of photo judged makes a significantdifference for whether an individual is judged as trustworthy","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"511","claim2_box":"(x1: 227.40 y1: 262.84) (x2: 329.69 y2: 276.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"our hypothesis was that Nobel Peace Prize laureates wouldbe perceived as significantly more trustworthy than celebrities intheir arrest photos","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"785","claim3a_box":"(x1: 76.89 y1: 212.65) (x2: 114.48 y2: 239.06)","claim3b_testspec":"we averaged their judgmentsacross participants to create a mean score for each target","claim3b_pg":"4","claim3b_start":"1791","claim3b_box":"(x1: 185.15 y1: 416.01) (x2: 255.57 y2: 431.28)","claim4_inftest":"NobelPeace Prize recipients were rated as significantly more trustworthy(M \u0001 4.23, SE \u0001 0.07) than were celebrities when photographedas part of their criminal prosecution (M \u0001 3.13, SE \u0001 0.10):t(74) \u0001 8.95, p \u0004 .001, d \u0001 2.10.","claim4_pg":"4","claim4_start":"1946","claim4_box":"(x1: 266.05 y1: 438.31) (x2: 177.48 y2: 487.02)","corr_author":"Nicholas O.

We found that honeyguides increased the Hadza's rate of finding bee nests by 560%, and that the birds led men to significantly higher yielding nests than those found without honeyguides. We estimate that 8-10% of the Hadza's total diet was acquired with the help of honeyguides. Contrary to most depictions of the human-honeyguide relationship, the Hadza did not actively repay honeyguides, but instead, hid, buried, and burned honeycomb, with the intent of keeping the bird hungry and thus more likely to guide again. Such manipulative behavior attests to the importance of social intelligence in hunter-gatherer foraging strategies.

In this article, we use data on community radio license applications in Brazil to identify both the causal effect of incumbency on politicians' ability to control the media and the causal effect of media control on their future electoral prospects. Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare city council candidates who barely won or barely lost an election, showing that incumbency more than doubles the probability of an application's approval by the Ministry of Communications. Next, using genetic matching, we compare candidates who acquired community radio licenses before an election to similar politicians who did not, showing that a radio station substantially increases one's vote share and probability of victory.

These results suggest that existing levels of segregation in Texas explain a small but meaningful portion of the racial achievement gap.","author_address":"[Hanushek, Eric A.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rivkin, Steven G.] Univ Texas Dallas, Amherst Coll, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Hanushek, Eric A.; Rivkin, Steven G.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","reprint_address":"Hanushek, EA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","author_email":"hanushek@stanford.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","publisher_address":"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0734-306X","eISSN":"1537-5307","pub_year_WOS":2009.0,"volume":27.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/600386","WOS_category":"Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000267405100002","pg":"349-383","author_last_WOS":"Hanushek","author_first_WOS":"Eric A.","published":"JUL 2009","pdf_filename":"Hanushek_JournLabEco_2009_3v4a","claim2_abstract":"The estimates strongly indicate that a higher percentage ofblack schoolmates reduces achievement for blacks, while it implies amuch smaller and generally insignificant effect on whites.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"860","claim2_box":"(x1: 196.77 y1: 505.61) (x2: 407.49 y2: 533.74)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Our empirical analysis shows that the black enrollment share adverselyaffects achievement and that the effects are roughly twice as large for blacks | as for whites.","claim3a_pg":"3 | 4","claim3a_start":"1973 | 19","claim3a_box":"(x1: 159.71 y1: 491.36) (x2: 460.72 y2: 508.83) | (x1: 149.75 y1: 148.96) (x2: 203.67 y2: 154.17)","claim3b_testspec":"The cornerstone of the analysis of racial composition effects on achieve-ment is a unique stacked panel data set of school operations constructedby the UTD Texas Schools Project, | The data we employ track the universe of three successive cohorts ofTexas public elementary students as they progress through school. | This section reports the results of a series of regressions on the effectsof school racial composition on mathematics achievement. | All specifications include indicators for subsidizedlunch eligibility and for various types of student moves, transitions tomiddle school, and the proportion of students who are Hispanic, all fullyinteracted with race.28 Robust standard errors clustered by school accountfor both the level at which peer composition is measured and any serialcorrelation in errors within schools. | Table 1 | (2) | All specifications estimated on combined samples of blacks and whites and include proportionHispanic; indicators for within-district, between-district, and between-region school changes other thantransitions to middle school; indicators for school changes during the school year and multiple changes in1 year; an indicator for a middle school transition; and indicators for subsidized lunch eligibility and female | Table 1 presents coefficients for proportion black ( ), estimated sepa-lrately by race, for a series of different specifications. | estimates in panel 2 control for prior achievement by usingv p 0test score gain as the dependent variable (i.e., maintain that ); | The columns employvarying fixed effects to deal with the underlying school and student het-erogeneity that might contaminate the estimated effects of proportionblack.

Parties typically compel members of Parliament (MPs) to support the party regardless of MPs' individual preferences. Rebellion, however, does occur. Using an original dataset of MP votes and speeches in the British House of Commons from 1992 to 2015, coupled with new estimations of MPs' ideological positions within their party, we find evidence that MPs use rebellion strategically to differentiate themselves from their party. The strategy that MPs employ is contingent upon an interaction of ideological extremity with party control of government. Extremists are loyal when their party is in the opposition, but these same extremists become more likely to rebel when their party controls government. Additionally, they emphasize their rebellion through speeches. Existing models of rebellion and party discipline do not account for government agenda control and do not explain these patterns.","author_address":"[Slapin, Jonathan B.] Univ Essex, Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Slapin, Jonathan B.] Univ Essex, Essex Summer Sch Social Sci Data Anal, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Kirkland, Justin H.; Lazzaro, Joseph A.] Univ Houston, Dept Polit Sci, 3551 Cullen Blvd Room 447, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Leslie, Patrick A.] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [O'grady, Tom] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England","reprint_address":"Slapin, JB (reprint author) Univ Essex, Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.; Slapin, JB (reprint author) Univ Essex, Essex Summer Sch Social Sci Data Anal, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.","author_email":"jslapin@essex.ac.uk; jhkirkland@uh.edu; jlazzaro@Central.uh.edu; palesl@essex.ac.uk; tom.d.ogrady@gmail.com","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-0554","eISSN":"1537-5943","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":112.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/S0003055417000375","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000423546600003","pg":"15-30","author_last_WOS":"Slapin","author_first_WOS":"Jonathan B.","published":"FEB 2018","pdf_filename":"SLAPIN_AmPoliSciRev_2018_xjdk","claim2_abstract":"Additionally, theyemphasize their rebellion through speeches.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1239","claim2_box":"(x1: 433.55 y1: 252.06) (x2: 261.98 y2: 267.75)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis 3: The probability of a parliamentary speechpaired with a dissent increases among more ideologicallyextreme governing party MPs.","claim3a_pg":"5","claim3a_start":"2508","claim3a_box":"(x1: 59.72 y1: 591.61) (x2: 176.80 y2: 615.79)","claim3b_testspec":"We takeadvantage of two changes in government\u2014the switchfrom the Conservative government of John Major tothe Labour government of Tony Blair in 1997, andthe switch from Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour governmentto David Cameron\u2019s Conservative\/Liberal Democratgovernment in 2010. | TABLE 4. | Model 13 | the probability that an MP gives aspeech during a debate in which she has cast a rebel-lious vote (i.e., engages in grandstanding) conditionalon her overall speech-making activity. | our dependent variable is Total Speeches on Rebel VotesTotal Speeches | we model this proportion using afractional logistic regression with varying intercepts forindividual MPs.

The conceptual model is tested using an empirical analysis of cross-border alliances formed by U.S. pharmaceutical companies from 1985 to 2008. We find that while prior alliance experience has a positive association with global innovation generation, diversity of partners has a negative relationship. In addition, whether the alliance is horizontal or vertical has no bearing on the innovation generation, but joint ventures are associated with more global innovation generation than other types of alliances.

Furthermore, we tested 2 randomized interventions designed to help participants attain desired trait changes. Although 1 of the interventions was inefficacious, a second intervention that trained participants to generate implementation intentions catalyzed their ability to attain trait changes. We also tested several theoretical processes through which volitional changes might occur.

The sociofunctional approach to prejudice, combined with a cultural evolutionary theory of religion's effects on cooperation, suggest that anti-atheist prejudice is particularly motivated by distrust. Consistent with this theoretical framework, a broad sample of American adults revealed that distrust characterized anti-atheist prejudice but not anti-gay prejudice (Study 1). In subsequent studies, distrust of atheists generalized even to participants from more liberal, secular populations. A description of a criminally untrustworthy individual was seen as comparably representative of atheists and rapists but not representative of Christians, Muslims, Jewish people, feminists, or homosexuals (Studies 2-4). In addition, results were consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between belief in God and atheist distrust was fully mediated by the belief that people behave better if they feel that God is watching them (Study 4). In implicit measures, participants strongly associated atheists with distrust, and belief in God was more strongly associated with implicit distrust of atheists than with implicit dislike of atheists (Study 5). Finally, atheists were systematically socially excluded only in high-trust domains; belief in God, but not authoritarianism, predicted this discriminatory decision-making against atheists in high trust domains (Study 6). These 6 studies are the first to systematically explore the social psychological underpinnings of anti-atheist prejudice, and converge to indicate the centrality of distrust in this phenomenon.","author_address":"[Gervais, Will M.; Norenzayan, Ara] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1N4, Canada; [Shariff, Azim F.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","reprint_address":"Gervais, WM (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1N4, Canada.","author_email":"will@psych.ubc.ca","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":101.0,"issue":"6.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0025882","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000297415400004","pg":"1189-1206","author_last_WOS":"Gervais","author_first_WOS":"Will M.","published":"DEC 2011","pdf_filename":"Gervais_JournPerSocPsy_2011_12E0","claim2_abstract":"Consistent with this theoretical framework, a broad sample of American adultsrevealed that distrust characterized anti-atheist prejudice but not anti-gay prejudice (Study 1)","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"532","claim2_box":"(x1: 203.42 y1: 234.34) (x2: 452.66 y2: 248.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We hypothesized that distrust would be central to anti-atheist prejudice but that disgust would be central to anti-gayprejudice.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"4160","claim3a_box":"(x1: 337.01 y1: 199.87) (x2: 341.74 y2: 225.99)","claim3b_testspec":"To test this hypothesis, we conducted a 2 (Target: Atheistvs. Gay) \u0001 2 (Trait: Distrust vs. Disgust) repeated-measuresANOVA","claim3b_pg":"5","claim3b_start":"1749","claim3b_box":"(x1: 82.75 y1: 408.88) (x2: 80.49 y2: 435.00)","claim4_inftest":"As predicted, this analysis revealed a significant Tar-get \u0001 Trait interaction, F(1, 350) \u0002 44.81, p \u0003 .001, \u0004G2 \u0002 .01","claim4_pg":"5","claim4_start":"1874","claim4_box":"(x1: 86.44 y1: 430.88) (x2: 271.54 y2: 446.00)","corr_author":"Will Gervais","corr_email":"will@psych.ubc.ca","version":1},{"title_CR":"Polling the face: Prediction and consensus across cultures.","author_last_CR":"Rule","author_first_CR":"Nicholas O.","pub_year_CR":2010,"DOI_CR":"10.1037\/a0017673","ISSN_CR":"0022-3514","publication_CR":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","pub_short":"JournPerSocPsy","paper_id":"OGgb","author_full":"Rule, Nicholas O.; Arnbady, Nalini; Adams, Reginald B., Jr.; Ozono, Hiroki; Nakashima, Satoshi; Yoshikawa, Sakiko; Watabe, Motoki","title_WOS":"Polling the Face: Prediction and Consensus Across Cultures","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","language":"English","keywords":"person perception; cross-cultural psychology; nonverbal behavior","keywords_plus":"SOCIAL PROJECTION; PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS; LEADERSHIP-STYLE; EGOCENTRIC BIAS; PERCEPTION; APPEARANCE; METAANALYSIS; IMPRESSIONS; COMPETENCE; JUDGMENTS","abstract":"Previous work has shown that individuals agree across cultures on the traits that they infer from faces. Previous work has also shown that inferences from faces can be predictive of important outcomes within cultures. The current research merges these two lines of work. In a series of cross-cultural studies, the authors asked American and Japanese participants to provide naive inferences of traits from the faces of U.S. political candidates (Studies 1 and 3) and Japanese political candidates (Studies 2 and 4). Perceivers showed high agreement in their ratings of the faces, regardless of culture, and both sets of judgments were predictive of an important ecological outcome (the percentage of votes that each candidate received in the actual election). The traits predicting electoral success differed, however, depending on the targets' culture. Thus, when American and Japanese participants were asked to provide explicit inferences of how likely each candidate would be to win an election (Studies 3-4), judgments were predictive only for same-culture candidates. Attempts to infer the electoral success for the foreign culture showed evidence of self-projection. Therefore, perceivers can reliably infer predictive information from faces but require knowledge about the target's culture to make these predictions accurately.","author_address":"[Rule, Nicholas O.; Arnbady, Nalini] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Adams, Reginald B., Jr.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ozono, Hiroki; Nakashima, Satoshi; Yoshikawa, Sakiko; Watabe, Motoki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Kyoto, Japan","reprint_address":"Rule, NO (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, 490 Boston Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.","author_email":"nicholas.rule@tufts.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":98.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0017673","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000273275800001","pg":"1-15","author_last_WOS":"Rule","author_first_WOS":"Nicholas O.","published":"JAN 2010","pdf_filename":"Rule_JournPerSocPsy_2010_OGgb","claim2_abstract":"Perceiversshowed high agreement in their ratings of the faces, regardless of culture, and both sets of judgments werepredictive of an important ecological outcome (the percentage of votes that each candidate received inthe actual election)","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"790","claim2_box":"(x1: 432.36 y1: 274.94) (x2: 191.59 y2: 308.60)","claim3a_concretehyp":"predictive value of first impres-sions across culture","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"699","claim3a_box":"(x1: 173.70 y1: 231.98) (x2: 123.25 y2: 247.10)","claim3b_testspec":"The percentage of votes acquired by each politician within hisstate served as the dependent measure, and coders\u2019 ratings of affectand attractiveness were entered as covariates.

The neural and hormonal system originally rooted in parenting and thus grandparenting - that is activated in the process of caregiving has been suggested as a potential proximate mechanism that promotes engagement in prosocial behavior towards kin and non-kin alike. Evidence and theory suggest that activating this caregiving system positively impacts health and may reduce the mortality of the helper. Although some studies have found grandparental care to have beneficial effects on grandparents' health outcomes, most studies have focused on the detrimental health consequences of providing custodial care for grandchildren. Little is known about how non-custodial grandparental and other forms of care giving relate to mortality hazards for the care provider. Using an evolutionary framework, we examined whether caregiving within and beyond the family is related to mortality in older adults. Survival analyses based on data from the Berlin Aging Study revealed that mortality hazards for grandparents who provided non-custodial childcare were 37% lower than for grandparents who did not provide childcare and for non-grandparents. These associations held after controlling for physical health, age, socioeconomic status and various characteristics of the children and grandchildren. Furthermore, the effect of caregiving extended to non-grandparents and to childless older adults who helped beyond their families. Potential ultimate and proximate mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Across two studies using a face perception paradigm, we provide evidence that people use evolved, specialized heuristics for long-term cooperative partner choice to calibrate their generosity toward ultimatum game partners. Men and women played one-shot ultimatum games for real incentives with partners represented by face photographs. Men were more generous toward partners who were stronger, and who appeared more attractive, more prosocial, more productive, healthier and higher in social status; the effect of strength was mediated by productivity, but not dangerousness, suggesting that men implemented heuristics designed for partner choice rather than the asymmetric war of attrition. Moreover, men reduced their earnings by cooperating selectively with valuable long-term partners. Women also gave better treatment to valuable-appearing partners, but appeared to prioritize partner choice less than men did, relative to game earnings and intrasexual competition. The results suggest that people treat the ultimatum game as though it were an opportunity to establish a cooperative relationship with a new partner, and implications are discussed for an evolved psychology of cooperative partner choice.

A prominent theory of music evolution is the sexual selection hypothesis, which proposes that music evolved as a signal of genetic quality to potential mates. The sexual selection hypothesis offers several empirically testable predictions. First, musically skilled and active individuals should have greater mating success than less-skilled individuals. Second, if musical ability functions as an indicator of genetic quality, it is expected to be associated with other traits putatively related to genetic quality. Third, associations as per the first and second predictions are expected to be at least partly due to overlapping genetic influences. We tested these predictions in a large genetically informative sample of 10,975 Swedish twin individuals aged between 27 and 54 years (M = 40.1, SD = 7.7), using musical aptitude and music achievement as measures of musical ability. To assess mating success we examined number of sex-partners, age of first intercourse, sociosexuality, and number of offspring. General intelligence, simple reaction time, and height were used to investigate relationships with traits putatively related to genetic quality. Twin modeling showed moderate genetic influences on musical aptitude for both sexes (heritability estimates were 38% for males and 51% for females). Music achievement was also moderately influenced by genetic influences in males (heritability = 57%), but the genetic influences were low and nonsignificant for females (heritability = 9%). Contrary to predictions, the majority of phenotypic associations between musical ability and music achievement with mating success were nonsignificant or significant in the other direction, with those with greater musical ability scoring lower on the measures of mating success. Genetic correlations between these measures were also nonsignificant. Most correlations of musical aptitude and music achievement with genetic quality measures were significant, including correlations with general intelligence, simple reaction time, and, in females, height (but only for aptitude). However, only the correlation between musical aptitude and general intelligence in men was significantly driven by overlapping genetic influences.

Male participants were led to believe they were competing for a date with an attractive female. Participants believed they were competing against either a strong or weak male. During an interview with the attractive female, participants were prompted to display their creativity to the female by telling funny jokes and interesting stories.

The GFP is assumed to occupy the apex of the hierarchy of human personality structure and is believed to reflect a socially and sexually selected aggregate of behavioral characteristics that are generally valued as \"desirable\" in interpersonal relationships. The relationship between the GFP and parental support tested in this study is predicted by Life History Theory, a midlevel evolutionary account of systematic differences in evolved reproductive strategies. A total of 428 families with mother, father, and two children (range 14-16 years) participated. Parents filled out personality questionnaires (Big Five) and their level of parental support. The children also independently rated the amount of support they perceived from their parents. In the present sample, parents' GFPs were found to explain 33% of the variance in the Big Five. Moreover, the parents' GFPs showed significant relationships with the parents' self-rated parental support, but also with the child-rated parental support. The monoinformant (parents ratings) and multi-informant (parent and child ratings) data support the notion of a substantive GFP that is related to the investment of parents into their offspring.

Based upon a disease avoidance account of stigmatization, we conducted the first empirical test of whether facial disfigurement-naevus flammeus (a port wine stain) here-can trigger the same set of emotional and behavioral responses as a contagious disease (influenza). Ninety-eight participants contacted props, which they had seen used either by a healthy confederate or by a confederate simulating medical conditions affecting the face-birthmark and influenza. Behavioral avoidance (e.g., willingness to handle the prop) and facial display of disgust were recorded across five levels of prop contact varying from no contact to contact with the mouth. Behavioral avoidance and disgust displays, especially with oral contact, were equivalent in the birthmark and influenza conditions, with both significantly exceeding reactions to the healthy confederate. These results support the theory that humans have an evolved predisposition to avoid individuals with disease signs, which is mediated by the emotion of disgust. This implicit avoidance occurs even when they know explicitly that such signs-the birthmark here-result from a noncontagious condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, a link between fertility and anti-black race bias has also been documented, an effect that is argued to serve a sexual coercion avoidance function. Here we demonstrate that both effects can be operative toward the same male target depending on inter-individual differences in race perception of the target. Across two studies, we found that the intention to vote for Barack Obama in the months preceding the 2008 election increased as a function of conception risk across the menstrual cycle. In the second study, we found that the effect is greatest among women who perceived him as more white than black, whereas the opposite was true among women who perceived him as mostly black. Our findings tie together separate conceptual research threads on positive and negative evaluations of men by women across the menstrual cycle - integrating them to shed light on women's voting preferences.

A number of moderately attractive confederates of the opposite gender individually approached 173 men and 216 women. After a standard introduction, the confederates asked each participant one of the following three questions: \"Would you go on a date with me tonight or during the week\/weekend?\", \"Would you come to my place tonight or during the week\/weekend?\", or \"Would you go to bed with me tonight or during the week\/weekend?\" Significantly more men than women consented to a sexual invitation. Specifically, significantly more men than women consented to the \"come to my place\" and \"go to bed with me\" conditions. For female subjects, higher ratings of confederate attractiveness were found to significantly increase the odds of consenting to a sexual invitation, whereas for men, confederate attractiveness was found not to significantly influence consent rates. Finally, relationship status was found to be a significant and strong moderating variable of consent for both men and women. Thus, men and women who are not in a relationship arc significantly more likely to agree to a sexual invitation than those who are in a relationship. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It is well established that in patrilineal societies that sons suffer from the presence of brothers because of competition for inheritance. However, offspring (of both sexes) might also suffer from being born after an elder brother because of the greater costs sons may entail for their mother. Evidence that the cost of producing sons is higher has been gained from studies of ungulates and humans, with some of this cost being manifested as lower birthweight or reproductive performance of offspring born following a male. Using church record data from preindustrial Finland, we shed light on this process by investigating the demographic 'mechanisms' by which offspring born following an elder brother are compromised. First, we show that, for both men and women in this population, being born after an elder male sibling is associated with reduced probability of reproducing, a later age at first reproduction. and longer interbirth intervals. Second, we show that the primary effect of interest is a reduced probability of reproducing in those born after an elder brother (even among only those who married). Finally, we show that the total number of elder brothers who survived to adulthood has a negative effect on male offspring only, and this effect is independent of the elder brother effect above. We highlight that differences in the success of human offspring are not always social in origin as is often perceived but can also be biological, resulting from differential costs for mothers of producing male versus female offspring.

Drawing on both deterrence and rational choice theories, we test the proposition that harsh school-based policies against violence reduce students involvement in violent behavior.

However, debate continues to surround the proper measurement of peer delinquency. Recent research suggests that some respondents are likely to misrepresent their peers' involvement in delinquency when asked in survey questionnaires, drawing into question the traditional (i.e., perceptual) measurement of peer delinquency. Research also has shown that direct measures of peer delinquency (e.g., measures obtained via networking methods such as Add Health), as compared with perceptual measures, differentially correlate with key theoretical variables (e.g., respondent delinquency and respondent self-control), raising the question of whether misperception of peer delinquency is systematic and can be predicted. Almost no research, however, has focused on this issue. This study, therefore, provides detailed information on respondents' misperceptions of peer behavior and investigates whether individual characteristics, the amount of time spent with peers, and peer network properties predict these misperceptions. Findings indicated that 1) some individuals-to varying degrees-misperceived the delinquent behavior of their peers; 2) self-control and self-reported delinquency predicted misperception; 3) respondents occupying densely populated peer networks were less likely to misperceive their peers' delinquent involvement; and 4) peers who occupy networks in which individuals spend a lot of time together were more likely to misperceive peer delinquency. Implications are discussed.","author_address":"[Young, Jacob T. N.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Criminol & Criminal Justice, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Barnes, J.

Early studies focused on individual-level factors related to reporting, but recently, researchers have begun to examine neighborhood-level predictors. Most of these studies, however, omit key individual-level predictors of reporting and provide relatively little insight into the individual-level processes through which neighborhood context might affect reporting. This study uses survey data from a multisite, school-based study to examine whether neighborhood structural characteristics and individual-level attitudes and experiences are related to youths' intentions to report crime. In addition, we assess whether neighborhood characteristics influence reporting via their effect on individual-level attitudes and experiences. We find that neighborhood poverty has an inverse relationship with crime reporting intentions and that numerous individual-level measures are associated with reporting, including attitudes toward the police, delinquency, and perceptions of the community. Importantly, the effects of neighborhood characteristics are reduced when youths' attitudes and experiences are included in the model. Taken together, our findings suggest that neighborhood context might affect reporting by shaping the attitudes and experiences of youth.","author_address":"[Slocum, Lee Ann; Taylor, Terrance J.; Esbensen, Finn-Aage] Univ Missouri, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Brick, Bradley T.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Sociol & Criminal Justice, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","reprint_address":"Slocum, LA (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 324 Lucas Hall,1 Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.","author_email":"slocuml@umsl.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":48.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/j.1745-9125.2010.00212.x","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000284699200006","pg":"1063-1100","author_last_WOS":"Slocum","author_first_WOS":"Lee Ann","published":"NOV 2010","pdf_filename":"ANN_SLOCUM_Criminology_2010_JxXe","claim2_abstract":"We  find  that  neigh-borhood poverty has an inverse relationship with crime reporting inten-tions  and  that  numerous  individual-level  measures  are  associated  withreporting,  including  attitudes  toward  the  police,  delinquency,  and  per-ceptions  of  the  community.","claim2_pg":"2","claim2_start":"458","claim2_box":"(x1: 385.47 y1: 164.62) (x2: 284.24 y2: 217.77)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We  find  that  youth  living  in  higher  poverty  neighbor-hoods  are  less  willing  to  report  crime  they  might  observe  in  the  commu-nity; | net  of  youthdemographic  characteristics  (model  2,  table  3).","claim3a_pg":"19 | 19","claim3a_start":"1435 | 2366","claim3a_box":"(x1: 226.55 y1: 352.53) (x2: 163.17 y2: 381.28) | (x1: 413.09 y1: 485.53) (x2: 359.67 y2: 502.28)","claim3b_testspec":"This study uses survey data from a | multisite,  school-based  study  to  examine  whether  neighborhood  struc-tural  characteristics  and  individual-level  attitudes  and  experiences  arerelated  to  youths\u2019  intentions  to  report  crime.

However, this research has been restricted almost exclusively to U.S. contexts, and often it suffers from key data limitations. As such, an examination of more detailed international sentencing data provides an important opportunity to assess the generalizability of contemporary research and theorizing on criminal punishment in the United States. The current study investigates little-researched questions about the influence of prosecutorial sentencing recommendations, victim\/offender relationships, and extralegal disparities in sentencing by analyzing unique data on the punishment of homicide offenders in the Netherlands. The results indicate that offender, victim, and situational offense characteristics all exert important independent effects at sentencing and that prosecutorial recommendations exert powerful influences over judicial sentences. The article concludes with a discussion of future directions for comparative sentencing research across international contexts.","author_address":"[Johnson, Brian D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [van Wingerden, Sigrid; Nieuwbeerta, Paul] Leiden Univ, Dept Criminol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","reprint_address":"Johnson, BD (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 2220 LeFrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","author_email":"bjohnson@crim.umd.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":48.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/j.1745-9125.2010.00210.x","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000284699200004","pg":"981-1018","author_last_WOS":"Johnson","author_first_WOS":"Brian D.","published":"NOV 2010","pdf_filename":"JOHNSON_Criminology_2010_yN1Q","claim2_abstract":"The  results  indicate  that  offender,victim,  and  situational  offense  characteristics  all  exert  important  inde-pendent  effects  at  sentencing  and  that  prosecutorial  recommendationsexert  powerful  influences  over  judicial  sentences.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1251","claim2_box":"(x1: 318.48 y1: 493.23) (x2: 373.45 y2: 533.98)","claim3a_concretehyp":"As  expected,then, judges are influenced strongly by the prosecutor\u2019s sentencing recom-mendation,  but  ultimately,  they  tend  to  mete  out  less  punishment  thanrequested  by  the  prosecutor.","claim3a_pg":"24","claim3a_start":"1293","claim3a_box":"(x1: 410.83 y1: 284.22) (x2: 270.92 y2: 324.97)","claim3b_testspec":"The  current  study  investigates  little-researched  questions  about  the  influence  of  prosecutorial  sentencingrecommendations, victim\/offender relationships, and extralegal dispari-ties in sentencing by analyzing unique data on the punishment of homi-cide  offenders  in  the  Netherlands. | All multivariate analyses use ordinary least-squares regression with robuststandard  errors. | the  third  model  investigates  theimpact  of  the  prosecutor\u2019s  recommendation  on  the  final  sentence,  as  wellas  the  extent  to  which  case,  offender,  victim,  and  incident  characteristicsremain  important  after  controlling  for  this  effect.19","claim3b_pg":"1 | 20 | 20","claim3b_start":"953 | 332 | 684","claim3b_box":"(x1: 311.52 y1: 445.23) (x2: 314.08 y2: 497.98) | (x1: 144.00 y1: 465.23) (x2: 214.82 y2: 481.98) | (x1: 327.40 y1: 513.23) (x2: 367.95 y2: 551.97)","claim4_inftest":".69*** .02","claim4_pg":"21","claim4_start":"1241","claim4_box":"(x1: 420.18 y1: 378.74) (x2: 463.65 y2: 382.87)","corr_author":"Brian D.

French majority consumers are alienated by culturally incongruent website design, but this negative effect is alleviated by repeated exposure. Tunisian minority consumers tend to prefer website design with a French look and feel, and repeated exposure enhances this effect.

Although scholars have developed sophisticated theoretical models of costly signaling in international relations, we know little about which specific policies leaders can implement to signal their commitments. This article addresses this question with respect to the extended deterrent effects of nuclear weapons. Can nuclear states deter attacks against their friends by simply announcing their defense commitments? Or must they deploy nuclear weapons on a protege's territory before an alliance is seen as credible? Using a new dataset on foreign nuclear deployments from 1950 to 2000, our analysis reveals two main findings. First, formal alliances with nuclear states appear to carry significant deterrence benefits. Second, however, stationing nuclear weapons on a protege's territory does not bolster these effects.

Taken together, our data highlight the relevance of the production function for organization construction and suggest that equal treatment of equals is neither a necessary nor a sufficient prerequisite for eliciting high performance in teams.","author_address":"[Kube, Sebastian] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany","reprint_address":null,"author_email":null,"funding":null,"publisher":"UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","publisher_address":"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0734-306X","eISSN":"1537-5307","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":28.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/653487","WOS_category":"Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor","category":"Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000282374200002","pg":"747-772","author_last_WOS":"Goerg","author_first_WOS":"Sebastian J.","published":"OCT 2010","pdf_filename":"Goerg_JournLabEco_2010_WLpV","claim2_abstract":"Our experimental results demonstratethat unequal rewards can potentially increase productivity by fa-cilitating coordination and that the effect strongly interacts withthe exact shape of the production function.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"602","claim2_box":"(x1: 280.74 y1: 436.87) (x2: 356.34 y2: 474.96)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The discrim-inating reward scheme under the production function of complementarityachieves almost maximum efficiency, whereas it leads to significantlylower efficiency rates under the production function of substitutability.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"578","claim3a_box":"(x1: 405.63 y1: 234.14) (x2: 460.65 y2: 276.11)","claim3b_testspec":"In the experiment,three players work on a joint project and exert costly efforts.

Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime's strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime's strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime. We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of common knowledge and information control in authoritarian regimes.","author_address":"[King, Gary] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pan, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, 450 Serra Mall,Bldg 120, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Roberts, Margaret E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, Social Sci Bldg 301,9500 Gilman Dr 0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","reprint_address":"King, G (reprint author) Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","author_email":"King@Harvard.edu; jp1@stanford.edu; meroberts@ucsd.edu","funding":"DARPA [W31P4Q-13-C-0055\/983-3]; National Science Foundation [1500086]","publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-0554","eISSN":"1537-5943","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":111.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/S0003055417000144","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000406688200004","pg":"484-501","author_last_WOS":"King","author_first_WOS":"Gary","published":"AUG 2017","pdf_filename":"KING_AmPoliSciRev_2017_pwK8","claim2_abstract":"In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chineseregime\u2019s strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discusscontroversial issues.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1337","claim2_box":"(x1: 294.80 y1: 246.08) (x2: 167.67 y2: 272.73)","claim3a_concretehyp":"with 50cparty posts largely comprised of cheerleading and dis-traction rather than engaged argument.","claim3a_pg":"7","claim3a_start":"1164","claim3a_box":"(x1: 257.19 y1: 318.48) (x2: 226.15 y2: 345.13)","claim3b_testspec":"In December 2014, anony-mous blogger \u201cXiaolan\u201d (https:\/\/xiaolan.me\/) releasedan archive of all 2013 and 2014 emails to, and somefrom, the account of the Internet Propaganda Office(\u0002\u0003\u0003), a branch of the propaganda department, ofZhanggong District. | The emails reportedactivities of Internet commentators, including numer-ous 50c posts from workers claiming credit for complet-ing their assignments, and many other communications. | We first analyze the 43,757 50csocial media posts that we harvested from the leakedarchive from Zhanggong.

The average proportion of \"no\" votes is about 40% higher for applicants from (the former) Yugoslavia and Turkey compared to observably similar applicants from richer northern and western European countries. Statistical and taste-based discrimination contribute to varying naturalization success; the rewards for economic credentials are higher for applicants from disadvantaged origins, and origin-based discrimination is much stronger in more xenophobic municipalities.

Yet, the presence of an ethnic quota does not imply that political mobilization takes place along ethnic lines: Cross-cutting affiliations within multi-ethnic party organizations may lessen the tendency of politicians to target benefits to particular ethnic groups. In this article, we evaluate the impact of quotas for the presidencies of village councils in India, a subject of considerable recent research. Drawing on fine-grained information from surveys of voters, council members, presidents, and bureaucrats and using a natural experiment to isolate the effects of quotas in the states of Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Bihar, we find weak distributive effects of quotas for marginalized castes and tribes, but suggestive evidence of the importance of partisanship. We then use survey experiments to compare the influence of party and caste on voting preferences and expectations of benefit receipt. Our results suggest that especially when politicians have dynamic political incentives to allocate benefits along party lines, cross-cutting partisan ties can blunt the distributive impact of ethnic quotas.","author_address":"[Dunning, Thad] Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA;

Aiming to contribute to this momentum, this empirical study investigates how perceptions of organizational virtuousness (OV) predict affective well-being (AWB) and affective commitment (AC). Two hundred five individuals participate. The findings show that perceptions of OV predict AC both directly and through the mediating role of AWB. The study suggests that fostering organizational virtuousness (e.g., through honesty, interpersonal respect, and compassion; combining high standards of performance with a culture of forgiveness and learning from mistakes) improves employees' AWB and promotes a more committed workforce. Considering these findings and mirroring the growing contributions of the positive psychology, positive organizational behavior, and positive organizational scholarship movements, the study suggests that a \"positive-people-management\" perspective should be considered, both by practitioners and scholars.

Here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. Mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' F0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels. Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinizing effect on women's voices.","author_address":"[Pisanski, Katarzyna; Bhardwaj, Kavya; Reby, David] Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Mammal Vocal Commun & Cognit Res Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England","reprint_address":"Pisanski, K (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Mammal Vocal Commun & Cognit Res Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England.","author_email":"k.pisanski@sussex.ac.uk","funding":"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [H2020-MSCA-IF-2014-655859]","publisher":"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","publisher_address":"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA","ISSN_WOS":"1090-5138","eISSN":"1879-0607","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":39.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1016\/j.evolhumbehav.2018.04.002","WOS_category":"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Social Sciences, Biomedical","category":"Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Biomedical Social Sciences","accession_number":"WOS:000437553500009","pg":"457-463","author_last_WOS":"Pisanski","author_first_WOS":"Katarzyna","published":"JUL 2018","pdf_filename":"Pisanski_EvoHumanBehavior_2018_l8zy","claim2_abstract":"Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly followingpregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changesacross corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1092","claim2_box":"(x1: 244.80 y1: 319.75) (x2: 433.92 y2: 342.31)","claim3a_concretehyp":"mothers' F0 valuesdecreased during or after pregnancy relative to pre-conception","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"5317","claim3a_box":"(x1: 492.31 y1: 446.97) (x2: 528.74 y2: 461.26)","claim3b_testspec":"The results of LMMs | Planned pairwise comparisons among pregnancy phases with \u0160id\u00e1kcorrection","claim3b_pg":"3 | 3","claim3b_start":"2110 | 2320","claim3b_box":"(x1: 50.06 y1: 500.61) (x2: 127.23 y2: 504.46) | (x1: 50.06 y1: 542.45) (x2: 73.42 y2: 556.78)","claim4_inftest":"Thus, in the year following the birth of their first child, women'sF0 parameters dropped on average by 14.6 Hz (F0 mean)","claim4_pg":"3","claim4_start":"2657","claim4_box":"(x1: 57.15 y1: 594.77) (x2: 255.18 y2: 609.05)","corr_author":"Katarzyna Pisanski","corr_email":"k.pisanski@sussex.ac.uk","version":1},{"title_CR":"Life history strategies and psychopathology: the faster the life strategies, the more symptoms of psychopathology","author_last_CR":"Hurst","author_first_CR":"Jessie E.","pub_year_CR":2017,"DOI_CR":"10.1016\/j.evolhumbehav.2016.06.001","ISSN_CR":"1090-5138","publication_CR":"Evolution and Human Behavior","pub_short":"EvoHumanBehavior","paper_id":"yypJ","author_full":"Hurst, Jessie E.; Kavanagh, Phillip S.","title_WOS":"Life history strategies and psychopathology: the faster the life strategies, the more symptoms of psychopathology","publication_WOS":"EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR","language":"English","keywords":"Life history theory; Life history strategy; Psychopathology; Aggression; Attachment; Self-harm","keywords_plus":"DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; AGGRESSION; ATTACHMENT; DISORDER; QUESTIONNAIRE; ADOLESCENTS; PERSONALITY; ADAPTATION; MATURATION; BEHAVIOR","abstract":"There is little extant empirical literature examining the associations between life history strategies and symptoms of psychopathology.

Using the dictator game, we demonstrate that this tension characterizes even preschool children's distributive behavior, and that it patterns differently across development and genders. Study 1 contrasted ownership of the resource (mine\/ours\/not mine) with recipients' minimal group membership (in-group\/out-group). We found that only boys generated biased distributions favoring the in-group, and preserved common resources as if they were their own. Study 2 revealed that upon learning of recipients' personal preferences (like\/doesn't like resource), boys and girls complied with in-group members' preferences, but only boys also manifested a behavior that opposed out-group members' preferences. The early emergence of a balance between individual- and group-regarding preferences sheds light on the origins of parochialism, and its gender selectivity is consistent with evolutionary accounts of the origins of group cognition in humans.

Cooperativeness is evaluated through a Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). We consider several morphometric variables related to attractiveness: fluctuating asymmetry (FA), waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and facial femininity (FF). These variables have been shown to predict human behavior. We also include as a control variable a score for self-perceived attractiveness (SPA). We test differences in these variables according to behavior in the PDG. Our results reveal that low-FA women cooperate less frequently in the PDG. We also find that women with lower WHR are more cooperative. This result contradicts the expected relation between WHR and behavior in the PDG. We show that this effect of WHR on cooperation operates through its influence on the expectation that participants hold on the cooperative intent of their counterpart. In addition, we show that the effect of attractive features on cooperation occurs independently of the participants' perception of their own appeal. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of the evolution of cooperative behavior and under the hypothesis that attractiveness is a reliable indicator of phenotypic quality.

Local ecology is likely to modify this association, but details of this presumed relationship are not yet known. We sought to determine whether local ecology modifies the relationship between status and fitness (number of grandchildren). Our approach to the problem was to measure variation in fitness relative to status (landless or with land) and to local ecology (inland versus coastal communities). We also analyzed life history traits that might explain observed variations in fitness. Our results confirm previous findings that both status (landless=9.9 vs. with land=16.5) and ecology (inland=12.3 vs. coast=14.1) affect the number of grandchildren produced by a female in pre-industrial society. We also found that the differences in number of children between the status groups were less pronounced on the coast (landless=12.0 vs. with land=16.1) than inland (landless=7.8 vs: with land=16.8). Our findings are novel because they suggest that the fitness consequences of human status may depend on details of local ecology. We discuss four different mechanisms that could account for these fitness differences: (1) differential reproductive rate of mothers, (2) differential marriage rate of children (3) differential survival rate of children, and (4) different social practices (breastfeeding, inheritance of property and diet).

Here, we present four experiments showing that old-new discrimination was not affected by whether a face was associated with a history of cheating, trustworthy or irrelevant behavior. In contrast, source memory for faces associated with a history of cheating (i.e., memory for the cheating context in which the face was encountered) was consistently better than source memory for other types of faces. This pattern held under a variety of conditions, including different types of judgments participants made about the stimulus persons (attractiveness in Experiment 1; likeability in Experiments 2-4), different retention intervals (a few minutes in Experiments 1, 2 and 4; 1 week in Experiment 3), whether the behaviors were exceptional or ordinary (Experiments 1-3) and whether the social status of the characters was low or high (Experiment 4). Given no differences in old-new discrimination, enhanced source memory for faces of cheaters may be useful for avoiding cheaters in future interactions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Two experiments investigated the relation between this sense of control and the internal processes involved in action selection and cognitive control. Action selection was manipulated by subliminally priming left or right key-press actions in response to a supraliminal visual target. The action caused the display of one of several colours as an action effect. The specific colour shown depended on whether the participant's action was compatible or incompatible with the preceding subliminal prime, and not on the prime identity alone. Unlike previous studies, therefore, the primes did not predict the to-be-expected action effects. Participants rated how much control they experienced over the different colours. Replicating previous results, compatible primes facilitated responding, whereas incompatible primes interfered with response selection. Crucially, priming also modulated the sense of control over action effects: participants experienced more control over colours produced by actions that were compatible with the preceding prime than over colours associated with prime-incompatible actions. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was not solely due to priming modulating action-effect contingencies. These results suggest that sense of control is linked to processes of selection between alternative actions, being strongest when selection is smooth and uncontested. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigate item characteristics that potentially impact single-item internal reliability, retest reliability, and self-other agreement. Across two large samples (N = 6690 and N= 4396), two countries (Estonia and The Netherlands), and two personality inventories (the NEO PI-3 and the HEXACO-PI-R), results show that (i) item variance is a strong predictor of self-other agreement and retest reliability but not of single-item internal reliability; (ii) item variance mediates the relations between evaluativeness and self-other agreement; and (iii) self-other agreement is predicted by observability and item domain. On the whole, weak relations between item length, negations, and item position (indicating effects of questionnaire length) on the one hand, and single-item internal reliability, retest reliability, and self-other agreement on the other, were observed.

This individual difference has been termed affective presence, but little is known about its correlates or consequences. The present study investigated the following: (i) whether affective presence influences others' romantic interest in a person and (ii) what types of people have positive and negative affective presence. Forty volunteers took part in a speed-dating event, during which they dated six or seven opposite-sex partners. A Social Relations Model analysis confirmed that individuals prompted consistent positive emotional reactions in others. Participants were more likely to want to see dates with greater positive affective presence again in the future, and positive affective presence explained the effects of perceived responsiveness on romantic interest. Associations between positive affective presence and trait predictors, including emotion regulation, emotional expressiveness, attachment style, agreeableness and extraversion, were also observed. The findings indicate that what emotionally distinguishes one individual from another lies in part in the emotional consequences of their behaviours on others. (c) 2013 The Authors.

Three main explanations have been put forth. Market failures, due to information asymmetries, mean that credit is rationed even when lenders could potentially benefit from making loans readily available. Political failures, due to state capture, mean that credit will be rationed as a way of generating rents for politically powerful financial incumbents. The state might, however, have its own fiscal reasons for politicizing the supply and price of credit, since financial repression provides easy-to-collect revenues. I draw on the third approach to argue that the state's fiscal imperative is usually the primary reason behind financial repression, and even when private actors benefit, they are subordinate to this concern. A dynamic panel analysis that exploits instrumental variables and a case study of Mexico adduce strong empirical support for my fiscal transaction cost theory.

Occupational  sta-tus  is  observed  over  the  eight  years  of  the survey and is measured with the International Socio-Economic  Index  (ISEI)  (Ganzeboom et al. 1992), as based on a woman\u2019s two-digit code in the International Standard Classifica-tion  of  Occupations  (ISCO).  In  the  sample, occupational  status  ranges  from  16  to  74.5. For the few categories of the two-digit ISCO codes  that  ECHP  combined  for  confidential-ity reasons, we use the mean ISEI value of the two  combined  occupations.  When  not  cur-rently working, respondents are assigned their most  recent  occupational  status  score.  Thus, women  out  of  the  labor  force  with  a  birth  do not  register  the  immediate  status  loss  they might face if they had to work. Because occu-pational  status  immobility  during  a  leave period would likely underestimate short-term status  penalties,  we  address  this  problem  by controlling for career interruptions.Key  independent  variables. We  recon-struct  fertility  histories  based  on  information on  births  during  the  survey  and  on  children living  in  the  household  at  the  first  observa-tion.  We  use  two  time-varying  independent variables for motherhood.Parity-specific  births  are  measured  by three  dummy  variables  indicating  that  a woman had a first, second, or third child born during  the  survey.  We  do  not  consider  the  1 percent  of  births  that  were  fourth  or  higher  order. To ascertain birth order for a child born during  the  survey,  we  consider  not  only  this child and others born to the mother during the survey,  but  also  older  children  present  when the  household  was  first  observed.  A  parity-specific  dummy  variable  is  set  to  one  if  a woman had a child of that birth order and zero otherwise. Thus, the third child indicator cap-tures  the  association  of  a  third  birth  with  the occupational  status  trajectory,  given  the  first two  births  and  compared  to  the  situation before the birth of a third child.Parity-specific time since birth is recorded in  years  for  the  first,  second,  and  third  child born  before  or  during  the  survey.  This  varia-ble indicates whether the effect on a woman\u2019s career  trajectory  for  a  child  of  given  parity remains  constant,  increases,  or  decreases  as the  child  ages.  Time  since  birth  is  calculated based  on  the  age  of  the  child  when  first observed. Thus, we know whether a birth has negative  consequences  for  occupational  sta-tus  developments  in  the  long-run  (i.e.,  for  as much as 24 years following a birth in the case of  a  mother  who  had  a  17-year-old  child  in the  first  wave  and  participated  in  all  eight surveys).  Time  since  birth  is  set  to  one  ini-tially for children born during the survey and updated annually thereafter. For women with-out children, time since birth is set to zero.Age  as  a  control  for  occupational status  trajectory.  Women\u2019s  age  and  age-squared  are  time-varying  measures  that  con-trol  for  the  underlying  time  trajectory  for  all women\u2019s  occupational  status.  To  test  for timing-of-birth differences in the motherhood occupational status penalty, we evaluate inter-actions  between  the  time-invariant  mother\u2019s age at a given birth and the time-varying child parity. | we test our hypotheses with individual fixed-effects regression models predicting the change  in  respondents\u2019  occupational  status over time. | Our  fixed-effects  models  allow  us  to  test whether  women\u2019s  occupational  status  trajec-tories vary according to time-varying charac-teristics,  namely,  motherhood.  We  begin  by documenting  the  motherhood  occupational status  penalty.  With  age  and  its  square  con-trolling  for  the  overall  occupational  time  tra-jectory,  we  first  consider  the  average  change in occupational status associated with having a birth of given parity during the course of the survey. We then add parity-specific time since birth. With these additional controls, the first, second,  and  third  birth  indicators  provide estimates of the motherhood penalty to occu-pational  status  occurring  around  the  time  of each birth.

While much of the current literature on migrant political attitudes focuses on the positive or negative ramifications of individual-level integration outcomes, the author takes a different approach. He claims that the best way to understand political trust and government satisfaction among migrant-origin individuals is through the strong positive correlation with trust and satisfaction among native-origin individuals in the same subnational region. One implication of this argument is that migrant-origin individuals' trust and satisfaction are closer to native-origin individuals living in the same subnational region than to migrants living elsewhere in Europe. The research provides a new perspective for understanding the broad contours of migrant integration and shifts the debate away from whether or not migrants have positive attitudes about European society. The fact that migrant- and native-origin individuals have similar levels of trust and satisfaction is suggestive of successful attitudinal integration, irrespective of whether those attitudes are positive or negative.","author_address":"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","reprint_address":"Maxwell, R (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.","author_email":"rahsaan@polsci.umass.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":65.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0043887112000263","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000313588900004","pg":"116","author_last_WOS":"Maxwell","author_first_WOS":"Rahsaan","published":"JAN 2013","pdf_filename":"Maxwell_WorldPolitics_2013_7QYp","claim2_abstract":"living in the same subnational region than to migrants living elsewhere in Europe. | One implication of this argument is that migrant-origin individuals' trust and satisfaction are closer to native-origin individuals","claim2_pg":"1 | 1","claim2_start":"2521 | 3596","claim2_box":"(x1: 18.81 y1: 39.62) (x2: 162.20 y2: 42.28) | (x1: 197.00 y1: 34.87) (x2: 415.85 y2: 37.53)","claim3a_concretehyp":"i claim that the best way of understanding political trust and government  satisfaction  among  migrant-origin  individuals  in  europe is  through  the  strong  positive  correlation  with  trust  and  satisfaction among  native-origin  individuals  in  the  same  subnational  region.","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"1829","claim3a_box":"(x1: 91.52 y1: 308.96) (x2: 347.69 y2: 354.85)","claim3b_testspec":"european  social  survey | political  trust  is  constructed  from  items about  trust  in  the  national  parliament,  trust  in  the  legal  system,  and trust in the police. | To  test  the  correlation  between  political  attitudes  of  migrant-  and native-origin  individuals  living  in  the  same  subnational  region,  i  con-struct  a  measure  of  the  mean  political  attitude  score  among  native- origin individuals in each subnational region for each of the three latent variables. | subnational coding in the ess uses the nomenclature of the statistical Territorial units (nuts), but unfortunately not all countries are coded at the same level of specificity.

With the present research, we draw on the sociofunctional approach to emotions to propose that an anticipated future status threat can similarly incline employees to feel envy toward, and subsequently undermine, their coworkers. We argue that employees pay special attention to coworkers' past development in relation to their own, because faster-rising coworkers may pose a future status threat even if they are still performing worse in absolute terms in the present. With a set of two behavioral experiments (N = 90 and N = 168), we establish that participants react to faster-rising coworkers with social undermining behavior when the climate is competitive (vs. less competitive). We extended these results with a scenario experiment (N = 376) showing that, in these situations, participants extrapolate lower future status than said coworker and thus respond with envy and undermining behavior. A two-wave field study (N = 252) replicated the complete moderated serial mediation model. Our findings help to explain why employees sometimes undermine others who present no immediate threat to their status.

There is overwhelming evidence that Honesty-Humility predicts prosocial behavior across a vast variety of situations. In the present contribution, we cloud this rosy picture, examining a condition under which individuals high in Honesty-Humility reduce prosocial behavior. Specifically, we propose that under self-uncertainty, it is particularly those individuals high in Honesty-Humility who reduce trust in unknown others and become less prosocial. In 5 studies, we assessed Honesty-Humility, manipulated self-uncertainty, and measured interpersonal trust or trust in social institutions using behavioral or questionnaire measures. In Study 1, individuals high (vs. low) in Honesty-Humility showed higher levels of trust. This relation was mediated by their positive social expectations about the trustworthiness of others. Inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly in individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Studies 2-5). Making use of measuring the mediator (Studies 2 and 3) and applying a causal chain design (Studies 4a and 4b), it is shown that individuals high in Honesty-Humility reduced trust because self-uncertainty decreased positive social expectations about others. We end with an applied perspective, showing that Honesty-Humility is predictive of trust in social institutions (e.g., trust in the police; Study 5a), and that self-uncertainty undermined trust in the police especially for individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Study 5b). By these means, the present research shows that individuals high in Honesty-Humility are not unconditionally prosocial. Further implications for Honesty-Humility as well as for research on self-uncertainty and trust are discussed.","author_address":"[Pfattheicher, Stefan] Ulm Univ, Dept Social Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Boehm, Robert] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Aachen, Germany","reprint_address":"Pfattheicher, S (reprint author), Ulm Univ, Dept Social Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.","author_email":"stefan.pfattheicher@uni-ulm.de","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":114.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/pspp0000144","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000419001200011","pg":"179-194","author_last_WOS":"Pfattheicher","author_first_WOS":"Stefan","published":"JAN 2018","pdf_filename":"Pfattheicher_JournPerSocPsy_2018_521q","claim2_abstract":"Inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly inindividuals high in Honesty-Humility (Studies 2\u20135)","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1106","claim2_box":"(x1: 285.58 y1: 284.34) (x2: 297.54 y2: 298.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Specifically, the third hypothesisreads that under self-uncertainty, individuals high in Honesty-Humility shift toward distrust","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"5145","claim3a_box":"(x1: 423.79 y1: 371.38) (x2: 419.19 y2: 397.77)","claim3b_testspec":"Using logistic regression analyses, trustwas regressed on Honesty-Humility, the experimental condition,as well as their interaction","claim3b_pg":"6","claim3b_start":"4481","claim3b_box":"(x1: 397.54 y1: 486.50) (x2: 406.70 y2: 512.87)","claim4_inftest":"Honesty-Humility \b Condition \u0006.82 .31 \u0005.01 .44 | Third, an interaction between Honesty-Humility andthe experimental condition was found","claim4_pg":"6 | 7","claim4_start":"4961 | 275","claim4_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 639.34) (x2: 338.00 y2: 643.00) | (x1: 95.91 y1: 122.88) (x2: 184.15 y2: 138.00)","corr_author":"Stefan Pfattheicher","corr_email":"stefan.pfattheicher@uni-ulm.de","version":1},{"title_CR":"To lead or to be liked: When prestige-oriented leaders prioritize popularity over performance.","author_last_CR":"Case","author_first_CR":"Charleen R.","pub_year_CR":2018,"DOI_CR":"10.1037\/pspi0000138","ISSN_CR":"0022-3514","publication_CR":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","pub_short":"JournPerSocPsy","paper_id":"52Dq","author_full":"Case, Charleen R.; Bae, Katherine K.; Maner, Jon K.","title_WOS":"To Lead or to Be Liked: When Prestige-Oriented Leaders Prioritize Popularity Over Performance","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","language":"English","keywords":"hierarchy; leadership; motivation; prestige; organizational behavior","keywords_plus":"POWERFUL PERCEIVERS; SOCIAL HIERARCHY; DOMINANCE; SELF; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; FOLLOWERSHIP; CONSEQUENCES; COOPERATION; COMPETITION","abstract":"Leaders often are faced with making difficult decisions for their group, such as when a course of action preferred by group members conflicts with one that is likely to optimize group success. Across 5 experiments (N = 1110), we provide evidence that a psychological orientation toward prestige (but not dominance) causes leaders to adhere publicly to group members' desires at the expense of group task outcomes-to prioritize popularity over performance. Experiments 1-3 demonstrated that, in private, prestige-oriented leaders chose what they saw as best for group performance but that, in public, they chose whichever option was preferred by members of their group. In private, prestige-oriented leaders' tendency to choose the performance-enhancing option was mediated by group performance motives; in public, their adherence to group preferences was mediated by social approval motives.

However, very little is known about the extent to which such a capacity varies with children's group-based experience. Given that between-group competition is a central feature of human social life, this study aimed at examining the influence of group-based competition over risk preference in young children. In total, 234 children from 3 age groups (2-4-year-olds, 5-6-year-olds, and 8 -9-year-olds) engaged in an intergroup competition manipulation, which was followed by a prosocial game assessing children's ingroup egalitarianism and a gambling task measuring children's risk preference. We found that children in the intergroup competition condition tended to be risk-averse compared with those who were in the nonintergroup competition condition. Furthermore, we found that an aversion to risk in the intergroup competition condition was driven by such an aversion observed in children from the losing group. In addition, we found a positive relationship between ingroup egalitarianism and risk preference in children from the winning group rather than those from the losing group. Together, our results contribute to the understanding of the effects of group-based experience on children's risk preference and may have important implications for understanding individuals' risky decisions.","author_address":"[Zhu, Yi; Wang, Jiajie; Lv, Xiaofeng] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Sch, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Li, Yansong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Dept Psychol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Yansong] Res Ctr Social & Behav Sci Jiangsu Prov, Beijing, Peoples R China","reprint_address":"Zhu, Y (reprint author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Sch, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.; Li, YS (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Dept Psychol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","author_email":"soc.zhuyi@gmail.com; Yansongli@nju.edu.cn","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0096-3445","eISSN":"1939-2222","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":145.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/xge0000156","WOS_category":"Psychology, Experimental","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000372550600003","pg":"397-401","author_last_WOS":"Zhu","author_first_WOS":"Yi","published":"APR 2016","pdf_filename":"Zhu_JournExPsychGen_2016_VpyV","claim2_abstract":"Wefound that children in the intergroup competition condition tended to be risk-averse compared withthose who were in the nonintergroup competition condition.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"983","claim2_box":"(x1: 453.77 y1: 288.34) (x2: 330.11 y2: 312.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Our logistic regression analysis revealed a highly significantmain effect of competitive outcomes on risky choices when con-trolling for age groups and sex (winning vs. losing: \u0003 \u0002 1.78, p \u0002.002, OR \u0002 5.60; nonintergroup competition vs. losing: \u0003 \u0002 1.49,p \u0002 .001, OR \u0002 4.45) (Figure 2b).

We report 4 studies that suggest that male participants show a stronger influence of the spatial representation of number as revealed through the spatial numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect, through the numerical distance effect (NDE), and through number-line estimations.

An open question is what are the consequences of this learning for cognition and perception? Here, we present a series of experiments that examine effects of verbal labels on the activation of conceptual information as measured through picture verification tasks. We find that verbal cues, such as the word \"cat,\" lead to faster and more accurate verification of congruent objects and rejection of incongruent objects than do either nonverbal cues, such as the sound of a cat meowing, or words that do not directly refer to the object, such as the word \"meowing.\" This label advantage does not arise from verbal labels being more familiar or easier to process than other cues, and it does extends to newly learned labels and sounds. Despite having equivalent facility in learning associations between novel objects and labels or sounds, conceptual information is activated more effectively through verbal means than through nonverbal means. Thus, rather than simply accessing nonverbal concepts, language activates aspects of a conceptual representation in a particularly effective way. We offer preliminary support that representations activated via verbal means are more categorical and show greater consistency between subjects. These results inform the understanding of how human cognition is shaped by language and hint at effects that different patterns of naming can have on conceptual structure.","author_address":"[Lupyan, Gary] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Thompson-Schill, Sharon L.] Univ Penn, Inst Res Cognit Sci, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","reprint_address":"Lupyan, G (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 419 Brogden Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.","author_email":"lupyan@wisc.edu","funding":"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH070850, R01MH70850]; NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC009209, R01DC009209]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0096-3445","eISSN":"1939-2222","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":141.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0024904","WOS_category":"Psychology, Experimental","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000299584100017","pg":"170-186","author_last_WOS":"Lupyan","author_first_WOS":"Gary","published":"FEB 2012","pdf_filename":"Lupyan_JournExPsychGen_2012_j1ZN","claim2_abstract":"This label advantage does not arise from verbal labelsbeing more familiar or easier to process than other cues, and it does extends to newly learned labels andsounds.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"834","claim2_box":"(x1: 289.52 y1: 243.34) (x2: 153.22 y2: 267.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"In Experiment 4, we controlled participants\u2019 exposure toverbal and nonverbal cues by teaching them to associate novellabels and nonverbal sounds with novel object categories.

First, we use biometrical modelling to estimate the heritability of facial averageness, which is necessary if it reflects genetic quality. We also test for a genetic association between facial averageness and facial attractiveness. Second, we assess whether paternal age at conception (a proxy of mutation load) is associated with facial averageness and facial attractiveness. Our findings are mixed with respect to our hypotheses. While we found that facial averageness does have a genetic component, and a significant phenotypic correlation exists between facial averageness and attractiveness, we did not find a genetic correlation between facial averageness and attractiveness (therefore, we cannot say that the genes that affect facial averageness also affect facial attractiveness) and paternal age at conception was not negatively associated with facial averageness. These findings support some of the previously untested assumptions of the 'genetic benefits' account of facial averageness, but cast doubt on others. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas several studies have shown how individual PPS extension is shaped by external factors, e.g. during interactions with people and objects, no studies have looked at interoceptive influences on PPS extension. We exposed participants to an audio-tactile interaction task, to measure their PPS boundary (Session 1), and to a heartbeat counting task and a time estimation task, to specifically assess their interoceptive accuracy (Session 2). Participants' traits of private self-consciousness and social anxiety were also evaluated, to account for their possible effect on the relation between interoception and PPS representation. We found that higher interoceptive accuracy specifically predicts narrower PPS boundary. Moreover, this relation is moderated by individual traits of private self-consciousness, but not social anxiety. Extending the concept of interoceptive influences on exteroceptive body representations to PPS, our results, first, support the idea that a dynamic balance between intero-exteroceptive processing might represent a general principle underlying bodily self-awareness; second, they shed light on how interoception may affect also the way we interface with the external world. Finally, showing that, in order for interoceptive accuracy to be effective on the intero-exteroceptive balance, it is important that individuals tend to focus on inner sensations and feelings, our results suggest that a comprehensive intero-exteroceptive model of bodily self-awareness should be (at least) a three-dimensional model that includes individual self-consciousness traits.","author_address":"[Ardizzi, Martina] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Unit Neurosci, Parma, Italy; [Ferri, Francesca] Univ Essex, Dept Psychol, Colchester, Essex, England","reprint_address":"Ferri, F (reprint author), Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.","author_email":"fferri@essex.ac.uk","funding":"Research Promotion Fund (Department of Psychology, University of Essex)","publisher":"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","publisher_address":"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","ISSN_WOS":"0010-0277","eISSN":"1873-7838","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":177.0,"issue":null,"DOI_WOS":"10.1016\/j.cognition.2018.04.001","WOS_category":"Psychology, Experimental","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000435061800010","pg":"79-86","author_last_WOS":"Ardizzi","author_first_WOS":"Martina","published":"AUG 2018","pdf_filename":"Ardizzi_Cognition_2018_xKYP","claim2_abstract":"We found that higher interoceptiveaccuracy specifically predicts narrower PPS boundary","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1259","claim2_box":"(x1: 447.08 y1: 328.14) (x2: 374.07 y2: 341.18)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Standard Pearson\u2019s correlation between individual measures of CPand IAcc showed a positive association between PPS boundary andinteroceptive accuracy (rCP,IAcc = .37, p = .02 two-tailed): individualswith narrower PPS boundary (higher CP values) were more accurate intracking their heartbeats (higher IAcc values)","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"6956","claim3a_box":"(x1: 319.07 y1: 688.88) (x2: 464.91 y2: 734.63)","claim3b_testspec":"Heartbeat traces were analysed usingLabChart 5.

Two types of models have been proposed to account for this sensitivity: statistical models, which posit that learners represent statistical relations between elements in the input; and chunking models, which posit that learners represent statistically-coherent units of information from the input. Here, we evaluated the fit of these two types of models to behavioral data that we obtained from 8-month-old infants across four visual sequence learning experiments. Experiments examined infants' representations of two types of structures about which statistical and chunking models make contrasting predictions: illusory sequences (Experiment 1) and embedded sequences (Experiments 2-4). In all four experiments, infants discriminated between high probability sequences and low probability part-sequences, providing strong evidence of learning. Critically, infants also discriminated between high probability sequences and statistically-matched sequences (illusory sequences in Experiment 1, embedded sequences in Experiments 2-3), suggesting that infants learned coherent chunks of elements. Experiment 4 examined the temporal nature of chunking, and demonstrated that the fate of embedded chunks depends on amount of exposure.

We investigated whether infants' expectations about resource distribution can be modulated by information about the dominance structure between the recipients. We first replicated the finding that infants attribute a stable dominance hierarchy to a pair of individuals when their goals conflicted and one individual yielded to the other (Expt. 1), and that this sensitivity is not driven by lower-level perceptual factors (Expt. 2). In Experiments 3-5, we tested our main hypothesis that infants' attention to equal and unequal distributions varies as a function of prior social dominance information. We first replicated and extended prior work by establishing that infants looked significantly longer to unequal than equal resource distributions when no prior information about dominance was provided about recipients (Expt. 3). Critically, following social dominance information, infants looked significantly longer to an equal distribution of resources than a distribution that favored the dominant individual (Expt. 4), and looked significantly longer when the submissive individual received more resources compared to when the dominant individual received more resources (Expts. 4 and 5).

Computational modeling based on Bundesen's Theory of Visual Attention was used to examine the effect of phasic alertness on visual processing speed and threshold of conscious perception. Results show that phasic auditory alertness affects visual perception by increasing the visual processing speed and lowering the threshold of conscious perception (Experiment 1). By manipulating the intensity of the alerting cue, we further observed a positive relationship between alerting intensity and processing speed, which was not seen for the threshold of conscious perception (Experiment 2). This was replicated in a third experiment, in which pupil size was measured as a physiological marker of alertness. Results revealed that the increase in processing speed was accompanied by an increase in pupil size, substantiating the link between alertness and processing speed (Experiment 3). The implications of these results are discussed in relation to a newly developed mathematical model of the relationship between levels of alertness and the speed with which humans process visual information.

Accordingly, some researchers have proposed that the spatial representation of numerical and non-numerical sequences relies on visuomotor routines, like reading habit and finger counting. There is a growing interest in how these two routines contribute to the spatial representation of ordinal sequences, although no investigation has so far directly compared them. The present study aims to investigate how these routines contribute to represent ordinal information in space. To address this issue, bilingual participants reading either from left-to-right or right-to-left were required to map ordinal information to all fingers of their right dominant hand. Critically, we manipulated both the direction of the mapping and the language of the verbal information. More specifically, a finger-mapping compatibility task was adopted in three experiments to explore the spatial representation of numerical (digit numbers and number words) and non-numerical (days of the week, presented in Hebrew and in English) sequences. Results showed that numerical information was preferentially mapped according to participants' finger counting habits, regardless of hand posture (prone and supine), number notation and reading habit. However, for non-numerical ordinal sequences, reading and finger counting directions both contributed to determine a preferential spatial mapping. These findings indicate that abstract knowledge representation relies on multiple over-trained visuomotor routines. More generally, these results highlight the capacity of our cognitive system to flexibly represent abstract ordered information, by relying on different directional experiences (finger counting, reading direction) depending on the stimuli and on the task at hand.

However, in order to learn from iconic gesture, a learner must be able to interpret its iconic form-a nontrivial task for young children. Our study explores how young children interpret iconic gesture and whether they can use it to infer a previously unknown action. In Study 1, 2- and 3-year-old children were shown iconic gestures that illustrated how to operate a novel toy to achieve a target action. Children in both age groups successfully figured out the target action more often after seeing an iconic gesture demonstration than after seeing no demonstration. However, the 2-year-olds (but not the 3-year-olds) figured out fewer target actions after seeing an iconic gesture demonstration than after seeing a demonstration of an incomplete-action and, in this sense, were not yet experts at interpreting gesture. Nevertheless, both age groups seemed to understand that gesture could convey information that can be used to guide their own actions, and that gesture is thus not movement for its own sake. That is, the children in both groups produced the action displayed in gesture on the object itself, rather than producing the action in the air (in other words, they rarely imitated the experimenter's gesture as it was performed). Study 2 compared 2-year-olds' performance following iconic vs. point gesture demonstrations. Iconic gestures led children to discover more target actions than point gestures, suggesting that iconic gesture does more than just focus a learner's attention, it conveys substantive information about how to solve the problem, information that is accessible to children as young as 2.

A largely unanswered question concerns the extent to which self-control changes across the lifespan and in response to major life events. The present research used prospective four-wave data from 539 Dutch individuals to examine the self-control trajectory of first-time parents (n = 246) as compared with individuals who did not have children during the research period (n = 293). New parents (especially mothers) reported higher levels of self-control before birth (i.e. during pregnancy) than did nonparents. New mothers showed significant non-linear decreases in self-control, which were especially strong from pregnancy until 6 months after childbirth. New fathers' self-control remained largely stable. Furthermore, pregnancy-related stress was associated with lower self-control levels during pregnancy in both first-time mothers and fathers. Higher levels of work-family conflict and family-related stress were associated with lower self-control after childbirth in new fathers, but not in new mothers. These results indicate that major life transitions may be linked to changes in adult self-control. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for theory and research on the development of self-control in adulthood.

The present studies examined whether the experience of a natural disaster experience shifts people's values and job preferences toward pro-social directions. In Study 1 (cross-temporal analysis), we analysed job application data in nine cities in Japan over 12years and found that the popularity of pro-social occupations (e.g. firefighter) increased after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, in particular the area hit hardest by the quake. In Study 2 (a large national survey), we found that Japanese respondents who had experienced a major earthquake are more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who never experienced a major earthquake. Together, the current findings suggest that the experience of a major natural disaster shifts human values from the egocentric to the allocentric direction, which in turn could result in a social structure that values pro-social occupations.

However, its relationship to situational depletion of self-regulatory resources has received little attention. We systematically explore the interplay of trait and situational self-control in two studies (total N=264). In contrast with a positive view of TSC, the results show greater ego depletion effects for high (vs. low) self-control abilities across such diverse domains as candy consumption (Study 1), risk-taking behaviour (Study 2) and achievement motivation (Study 2). It is proposed that these ironic effects are attributable to high-TSC individuals' less frequent active inhibition of impulses in everyday life and their resulting lack of experience in resisting acute temptations. A third study (N>=358) corroborated this general reasoning by showing that TSC is indeed associated with less frequent impulse inhibition in daily routines. Our data point to a downside of dispositional self-control in ego depletion paradigms. Other explanations and potential future avenues for resolving inconsistent findings across the literature are discussed.

This paper investigates how two psychological antecedents, (1) need for uniqueness and (2) status aspiration, can influence consumers' attitude with regard to forming procedures toward e-customized products and how perceived risk, another psychological factor, on purchasing e-customized products plays a role of moderating factor. A self-administered online survey of 321 Japanese consumers is conducted to examine a proposed conceptual model with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The analysis using results indicates that the need for uniqueness directly impacts on attitude toward e-customized products while it mediates the effect of status aspiration. A multi-group analysis to test a moderating effect of the perceived risk on purchasing e-customized products highlights the significant effects of psychological factors. The result also provides potential guidelines to e-tailors on. possibility of segmenting markets as well as promoting their customized products using these psychological criteria of their target consumers.

Theoretically bundled within these neighborhood effects are institutions' and actors' social networks that are the foundation of other neighborhood-level processes such as social control, mobilization, and cultural assimilation. Yet, despite such long-standing theoretical links between neighborhoods and social networks, empirical research rarely considers or measures dimensions of geography and social network mechanisms simultaneously. The present study seeks to fill this gap by analyzing how both geography and social networks influence an important social problem in urban America: gang violence. Using detailed data on fatal and non-fatal shootings, we examine effects of geographic proximity, organizational memory, and additional group processes (e. g., reciprocity, transitivity, and status seeking) on gang violence in Chicago and Boston. Results show adjacency of gang turf and prior conflict between gangs are strong predictors of subsequent gang violence. Furthermore, important network processes, including reciprocity and status seeking, also contribute to observed patterns of gang violence.

We interpreted the parameter as the probability of a violent tie forming if two gangs share a turf boundary.Second, to measure the effect of prior con-flict  we  used  homicide  networks  in  Chicago for  the  years  2005  and  2006  and  the  2007 network  in  Boston\u2014essentially,  lagged  ver-sions  of  the  dependent  networks.  We  omitted a  single  year  between  the  time  periods  cov-ered  by  the  dependent  variable  and  the  rela-tional  covariate  to  distinguish  between reciprocity  within  the  dependent  network  (a contemporaneous effect) and institutional his-tory  (an  effect  of  prior  group  conflict).  Most gang  violence,  but  especially  retaliatory  vio-lence,  tends  to  be  episodic  and  short-lived (Block and Block 1993), and the average ten-ure of any individual gang member tends to be less  than  3.5  years  (Thornberry  et  al.  2003). Although  violent  events  within  the  time  peri-ods are likely to be reciprocal in the sense that event Y  is  in  direct  response  to  event  X,  it  is probably less common that events across peri-ods are acts of direct retaliation. We argue that past intergroup conflict drives subsequent vio-lence not simply as retaliation for past wrongs but  as  a  more  general  guide  for  group  behav-iors. The gap between time periods thus offers additional  insurance  that  specific  events  are not  related  across  those  time  periods.  This parameter  measures  the  probability  of  a  tie forming  based  on  whether  two  gangs  had  a past conflict. | We  included  a  reciprocity  parameter  that captures  the  count  of  reciprocal  dyads  in  the observed network. More precisely, this param-eter models the probability that a tie will form if it reciprocates an already existing tie. Given the  past  research  on  retaliation  discussed  ear-lier,  we  expect  this  term  to  be  positive  and significant\u2014gangs are more likely to form ties when they reciprocate already existing ties.To  minimize  the  possibility  that  the  rela-tionship between our dependent network (the  network  at Time  2)  and  our  measure  of  prior dyadic  tie  (the  network  at  Time  1)  might  be spurious,  we  supplemented  our  reciprocity term  with  a  transpose  of  the Time  1  network essentially as a way to control for any delayed reciprocity\u2014that is, an attack from gang j on gang i prior to Time 2 could lead to an attack from  gang  i  on  gang  j  during Time  2.  In  this way, we can differentiate between reciprocity that  happens  within  time  periods  (the  reci-procity  term),  the  direct  effect  of  a  prior dyadic tie between any two groups regardless of  whether  it  is  reciprocal  (the  Time  1  net-work), and unobserved reciprocity that might happen  between  time  periods  (transpose  of the Time 1 network). We expect the transpose to be positive and significant and serve as an indication of reciprocity not detected with the other parameters | Model  1  presents the  baseline  model  with  only  the  edge  statis-tic,  again  demonstrating  that  the  probability of a violent tie between any two gangs is low. Model 2 adds race and size terms. Unlike the Chicago  models,  none  of  the  racial  composi-tion  terms  are  statistically  significant,  thus providing no evidence of racial homophily or sender\/receiver effects for gangs of particular races. However, we do see a negative homoph-ily effect based on gang size\u2014gangs are rela-tively  unlikely  to  form  ties  with  gangs  of  the same  size  category.  Put  another  way,  gangs shoot at gangs of different sizes.Models 3 through 5 add the main theoreti-cal  variables.  Consistent  with  the  Chicago results,  the  geographic  adjacency  and  prior conflict  variables  are  statistically  significant, as  is  the  interaction  term.","claim3b_pg":"12 | 13 | 19","claim3b_start":"1761 | 1784 | 2874","claim3b_box":"(x1: 51.49 y1: 584.40) (x2: 303.27 y2: 649.94) | (x1: 63.49 y1: 524.40) (x2: 319.17 y2: 289.94) | (x1: 365.05 y1: 212.40) (x2: 358.66 y2: 433.94)","claim4_inftest":"Model  6  adds  endogenous  effects  and shows  similarities  and  differences  to  the  Chi-cago models.

Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions' legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.","author_address":"[Wilde, Melissa J.] Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nelson, Shelley L.; Bowman, Emily A.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","reprint_address":"Wilde, MJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Sociol, 3718 Locust Walk,113 McNeil Bldg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","author_email":"mwilde@sas.upenn.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-1224","eISSN":"1939-8271","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":75.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0003122410368927","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000282155000005","pg":"586-606","author_last_WOS":"Wilde","author_first_WOS":"Melissa J.","published":"AUG 2010","pdf_filename":"Wilde_AmSocioRev_2010_4XLv","claim2_abstract":"These characteristics, which we derivefrom Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders\u2019 interests and often lead them to prioritizeconcerns about their institutions\u2019 legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growthrational choice theorists assume are predominant","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"697","claim2_box":"(x1: 274.95 y1: 319.33) (x2: 256.73 y2: 356.64)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Because of the ecumenical movement,bishops in Protestant-dominated countrieswere subjected to more legitimacy critiquesboth generally and about Mary in particular.We thus suspect that their progressivism onthe issue of Mary is spuriously correlatedwith percent Catholic\u2014and is much better ex-plained by our measures of incumbency, field | stability, and the amount of Protestant struc-turation in their countries.The analyses that include our organiza-tional variables provide support for this con-clusion.

Studies in the U.S. and elsewhere have produced a number of valuable insights into how citizens respond to singular, massive attacks like 9\/11. But they are less useful for evaluating how chronic and persistent terrorist attacks erode support for democratic values over the long haul. Our study focuses on political tolerance levels in Israel across a turbulent 30-year period, from 1980 to 2011, which allows us to distinguish the short-term impact of hundreds of terrorist attacks from the long-term influence of democratic longevity on political tolerance. We find that the corrosive influence of terrorism on political tolerance is much more powerful among Israelis who identify with the Right, who have also become much more sensitive to terrorism over time. We discuss the implications of our findings for other democracies under threat from terrorism.","author_address":"[Peffley, Mark] Univ Kentucky, Dept Polit Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Hutchison, Marc L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Polit Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Shamir, Michal] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Polit Sci, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel","reprint_address":"Peffley, M (reprint author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Polit Sci, 1653 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.","author_email":"mpeffl@uky.edu; mlhutch@uri.edu; m3600@post.tau.ac.il","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-0554","eISSN":"1537-5943","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":109.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0003055415000441","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000367429200012","pg":"817-832","author_last_WOS":"Peffley","author_first_WOS":"Mark","published":"NOV 2015","pdf_filename":"PEFFLEY_AmPoliSciRev_2015_vQVL","claim2_abstract":"We find that the corrosivein\ufb02uence of terrorism on political tolerance is much more powerful among Israelis who identify with theRight, who have also become much more sensitive to terrorism over time.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1038","claim2_box":"(x1: 399.50 y1: 213.20) (x2: 381.41 y2: 239.85)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H3a: Israeli Jews who identify with the political Right will beless willing to extend civil liberties to offensive groups afterelevated levels of terrorist attacks","claim3a_pg":"5","claim3a_start":"2934","claim3a_box":"(x1: 310.79 y1: 54.87) (x2: 436.21 y2: 79.05)","claim3b_testspec":"Our survey data consist of 18 surveys administeredfrom 1980 to 2011.

Yet, many nondemocratic countries have partially free or almost free media. In. this article, we develop a theory of media freedom in dictatorships and provide systematic statistical evidence in support of this theory. In our model, free media allow a dictator to provide incentives to bureaucrats and therefore to improve the quality of government. The importance of this benefit varies with the natural resource endowment. In resource-rich countries, bureaucratic incentives are less important for the dictator; hence, media freedom is less likely to emerge. Using panel data, we show that controlling for country fixed effects, media are less free in oil-rich economies, with the effect especially pronounced in nondemocratic regimes.

In theory, ambiguity affects how voters make choices and who wins elections. In practice, measurement and endogeneity problems have impeded empirical research about the consequences of ambiguity. We conducted survey experiments that overcame these obstacles by manipulating a common form of ambiguity: the imprecision of candidate positions. Our data show that, on average, ambiguity does not repel and may, in fact, attract voters. In nonpartisan settings, voters who have neutral or positive attitudes toward risk, or who feel uncertain about their own policy preferences, tend to embrace ambiguity. In partisan settings, voters respond even more positively to ambiguity; they optimistically perceive the locations of ambiguous candidates from their own party without pessimistically perceiving the locations of vague candidates from the opposition. We further find, through analysis of two additional new data sets, that candidates often take and voters frequently perceive-ambiguous positions like the ones in our experiments. The pervasive use of ambiguity in campaigns fits with our experimental finding that ambiguity can be a winning strategy, especially in partisan elections.","author_address":"[Tomz, Michael] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Van Houweling, Robert P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","reprint_address":"Tomz, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall W,Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","author_email":"tomz@stanford.edu; rpvh@berkeley.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-0554","eISSN":"1537-5943","pub_year_WOS":2009.0,"volume":103.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0003055409090066","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000264926400005","pg":"83-98","author_last_WOS":"Tomz","author_first_WOS":"Michael","published":"FEB 2009","pdf_filename":"TOMZ_AmPoliSciRev_2009_Pb9K","claim2_abstract":"In nonpartisan settings, voters who have neutral or positive attitudestoward risk, or who feel uncertain about their own policy preferences, tend to embrace ambiguity.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"747","claim2_box":"(x1: 226.19 y1: 172.32) (x2: 497.17 y2: 188.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Theserisk-neutral and risk-acceptant respondents were morewilling to gamble on ambiguous candidates, even whenprecise alternatives were at least as close.","claim3a_pg":"14","claim3a_start":"4612","claim3a_box":"(x1: 517.72 y1: 451.36) (x2: 487.81 y2: 488.97)","claim3b_testspec":"We designed an experiment to assess the effect of can-didate ambiguity on voter choice and embedded it in anInternet survey of a nationally representative sampleof U.S. adults.

Two theoretical arguments are developed and tested. The first draws on the feminist literature and suggests the presence of a decay mechanism: victims and their families are stigmatized by their community and excluded from social networks. The second integrates new insights from social psychology, psychological trauma research, and anthropology, and argues for a resilience mechanism. It argues that CRSV-affected households have a strong incentive to remain part of their community and will invest more effort and resources into the community to avert social exclusion than unaffected households. Using data on 5,475 Sierra Leonean households, the author finds that exposure to CRSV increases prosocial behavior-cooperation, helping, and altruism-which supports the resilience hypothesis. The results are robust to an instrumental variable estimation.

Using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, women, but not men, showed preferences for speed-dating partners based on MHC-complementarity. The direction of findings varied by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), such that SNPs closer to the major HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genes supported dissimilarity preferences, whereas those farther away supported similarity preferences. The relative effects of MHC-based measures in comparison to an array of behavioral predictors were examined via random forests. Results indicated that for both men and women, the importance of MHC-based indices was comparable to that of a partner's self-reported personality attributes in predicting second date offers.","author_address":"[Wu, Karen] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Chen, Chuansheng; Greenberger, Ellen] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Psychol & Social Behav, 4201 Social & Behav Sci Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Moyzis, Robert K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biol Chem, Coll Med, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Moyzis, Robert K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Inst Genom & Bioinformat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Nuno, Michelle; Yu, Zhaoxia] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, 2214 Bren Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","reprint_address":"Wu, KR (reprint author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.","author_email":"Kwu25@calstatela.edu","funding":"Society of Research on Adolescence [SRA-53016]; Psi Chi National Honor Society [PSICHI-100461]","publisher":"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","publisher_address":"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA","ISSN_WOS":"1090-5138","eISSN":"1879-0607","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":39.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1016\/j.evolhumbehav.2018.04.001","WOS_category":"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Social Sciences, Biomedical","category":"Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Biomedical Social Sciences","accession_number":"WOS:000437553500008","pg":"447-456","author_last_WOS":"Wu","author_first_WOS":"Karen","published":"JUL 2018","pdf_filename":"Wu_EvoHumanBehavior_2018_Dajj","claim2_abstract":"Using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, women,but not men, showed preferences for speed-dating partners based on MHC-complementarity.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1655","claim2_box":"(x1: 350.31 y1: 374.45) (x2: 502.85 y2: 387.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"we predicted that in-dividuals would show preferences based on MHC-complementarity,specifically rating MHC-dissimilar partners higher on overall | mate desirability","claim3a_pg":"2 | 2","claim3a_start":"7939 | 8111","claim3a_box":"(x1: 475.53 y1: 678.45) (x2: 530.93 y2: 703.22) | (x1: 383.01 y1: 709.86) (x2: 443.49 y2: 713.71)","claim3b_testspec":"we then analyzed associations between individual SNPs andspeed-dating outcomes using | linear mixed models for ratings of partners' mate desirability,facial attractiveness, and body scent attractiveness.","claim3b_pg":"5 | 5","claim3b_start":"1326 | 1461","claim3b_box":"(x1: 62.93 y1: 557.69) (x2: 140.00 y2: 572.03) | (x1: 74.44 y1: 578.61) (x2: 220.71 y2: 592.95)","claim4_inftest":"rs2073716 HLA-C 3\u2032 31154970 0.47 0.002 0.26 0.030","claim4_pg":"7","claim4_start":"1267","claim4_box":"(x1: 43.60 y1: 179.36) (x2: 275.54 y2: 182.44)","corr_author":"Karen Wu","corr_email":"Kwu25@calstatela.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"\u00e2\u0080\u009cMIGHT NOT BE A TOMORROW\u00e2\u0080\u009d: A MULTIMETHODS APPROACH TO ANTICIPATED EARLY DEATH AND YOUTH CRIME*","author_last_CR":"BREZINA","author_first_CR":"TIMOTHY","pub_year_CR":2009,"DOI_CR":"10.1111\/j.1745-9125.2009.00170.x","ISSN_CR":"0011-1384","publication_CR":"Criminology","pub_short":"Criminology","paper_id":"AyVj","author_full":"Brezina, Timothy; Tekin, Erdal; Topalli, Volkan","title_WOS":"MIGHT NOT BE A TOMORROW: A MULTIMETHODS APPROACH TO ANTICIPATED EARLY DEATH AND YOUTH CRIME","publication_WOS":"CRIMINOLOGY","language":"English","keywords":"youth violence; fatalism; risk taking","keywords_plus":"COMMUNITY VIOLENCE; OFFENDER MOTIVATION; RISK-TAKING; LIFE-COURSE; ADOLESCENTS; EXPOSURE; VICTIMIZATION; DELINQUENCY; BEHAVIOR; ROBBERY","abstract":"Several researchers point to the anticipation of early death, or a sense of \"futurelessness,\" as a contributing factor to youth crime. It is argued that young people who perceive a high probability of early death may have little reason to delay gratification for the promise of future benefits, as the future itself is discounted. Consequently, these young people tend to pursue high-risk behaviors associated with immediate rewards, which include crime and violence. Although existing studies lend support to these arguments and show a statistical relationship between anticipated early death and youth crime, this support remains tentative. Moreover, several questions remain regarding the interpretation of this relationship, the meanings that offenders attach to the prospect of early death, and the cognitive processes that link anticipated early death to youth crime.

People high in openness to experience, for example, tend to be more creative and have broader general knowledge than people low in openness to experience. In the current study, we use a network science approach to examine if the organization of semantic memory differs between high and low groups of openness to experience. A sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 and Big Five Aspect Scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. Next, the sample was split into half to form high (n=258) and low (n=258) openness to experience groups. Semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. Our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group. We also found that the high openness to experience group generated more responses on average and provided more unique responses than the low openness to experience group. Taken together, our results indicate that openness to experience is related to semantic memory structure.

Specifically, we argue that CEOs with shorter career horizons (as measured by their age) will adopt risk-averse strategies that will, on average, adversely influence future firm performance. Further, we argue that at high levels of CEO ownership, this relationship is exacerbated due to the accompanying power that comes with high ownership. In terms of CEO tenure, we propose that CEOs' paradigms will become increasingly obsolete as their tenure increases with this process hurting future performance in dynamic industries. However, such performance declines may not occur in more stable industries. Using a sample of US-based firms from the S&P 500, we find support for our arguments when examining the future Return on Assets of firms.

Drawing on personnel records of more than half a million seafarers employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) over nearly a century, we show that monitoring was effective in reducing desertion when private trade was conceived as a market activity subordinated to hierarchy.

First, we describe a three-stage process in which a growing productivity gap between the private-manufacturing and public-service sectors disrupts traditional class solidarity. We contend that emerging conflicts between private and public sectors due to public-sector expansion and a growing inter-sectoral productivity gap eventually lead to employment and budget crises, as well as the weakening of coordinated wage-setting institutions. Furthermore, political, institutional, and economic transformations originating from sectoral cleavages and imbalance lead to increased income inequality. We test this argument using an unbalanced panel dataset on 16 advanced industrial democracies from 1971 to 2003. We find that public-sector employment has a strong negative effect on income inequality when the productivity gap between sectors is low. In such situations, public-sector employment fulfills its promise of equality and full employment.

The findings suggest that severely uneven productivity gaps due to different degrees of technological innovations significantly weaken and limit the effectiveness of left-wing governments' policy interventions through public-service expansion.","author_address":"[Lee, Cheol-Sung; Shim, Jae-Mahn] Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kim, Young-Bum] Hallym Univ, Hallym Univ Inst Aging, Chunchon, South Korea","reprint_address":"Lee, CS (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","author_email":"chslee@uchicago.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-1224","eISSN":"1939-8271","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":76.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0003122410396195","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000287715100005","pg":"100-124","author_last_WOS":"Lee","author_first_WOS":"Cheol-Sung","published":"FEB 2011","pdf_filename":"Lee_AmSocioRev_2011_RjkN","claim2_abstract":"However, asthe inter-sectoral productivity gap increases, the negative effect of public-sector expansion onincome inequality evaporates.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1253","claim2_box":"(x1: 384.11 y1: 391.10) (x2: 177.00 y2: 417.41)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis 2: The size of the negative effectof public-service expansion on incomeinequality will diminish and eventuallyevaporate as the productivity gap betweenthe private manufacturing and public-service sectors increases. | The highly sig-nificant, positive effect of the interactionterm suggests that a public-service-expansionstrategy is effective only when productivitygaps between the private-manufacturing andthe public-service sectors are small.","claim3a_pg":"7 | 15","claim3a_start":"1367 | 387","claim3a_box":"(x1: 64.91 y1: 476.02) (x2: 168.45 y2: 534.90) | (x1: 173.11 y1: 177.71) (x2: 201.57 y2: 242.00)","claim3b_testspec":"Considering theadvantages and disadvantages of each esti-mation strategy (including the potential vio-lation of the REM assumption), and moreimportantly, the implications of our theoret-ical framework relying on over-time varia-tions, we report the results from the FEMin the text | aGini based on post-tax, post-transfer (disposable) income.

Holding constant economic and political factors that typically account for changes in union density, we investigate how competition from rival labor federations and from independent unions affect both union density and a measure for the density of the dominant federation (AFL\/AFL-CIO), adjusted for membership changes from mergers and splits. We measure competition by the number of unions and the size of rivals. While much existing literature measures state regulation with categorical coding for specific periods, we measure the effect of state enforcement directly with counts of pro-labor and pro-management unfair labor practice cases adjudicated by the National Labor Relations Board. We assess the effect of left-wing political culture using the popular vote for socialist and communist candidates in presidential elections. Both the number of members in rival unions and the total number of rival unions positively impact the rate of change in overall union density and in AFL density. The size of independent unions has a negative impact on AFL\/AFL-CIO density but no effect on overall union density. Unfair labor practices cases adjudicated for employers negatively affect union density but positively affect AFL\/AFL-CIO density, while cases adjudicated for unions negatively affect AFL\/AFL-CIO density.","author_address":"[Stepan-Norris, Judith] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Southworth, Caleb] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","reprint_address":null,"author_email":"jstepann@uci.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-1224","eISSN":"1939-8271","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":75.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0003122410365308","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000276383000003","pg":"227-251","author_last_WOS":"Stepan-Norris","author_first_WOS":"Judith","published":"APR 2010","pdf_filename":"Stepan_Norris_AmSocioRev_2010_lmev","claim2_abstract":"Both thenumber of members in rival unions and the total number of rival unions positively impactthe rate of change in overall union density and in AFL density.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1160","claim2_box":"(x1: 397.36 y1: 380.10) (x2: 325.26 y2: 406.47)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis 1a: The annual change11 inthe competitor union number ratio ispositively related to the annual rateof change in both union density andAFL density | In accordance withHypotheses 1a and 1b, regression modelsshow an important role for direct competitionbetween rival federations.

Second, evidence from a nationally representative survey experiment suggests that individual preferences for taxation may be influenced by changes in the racial composition of communities. Finally, analyses reveal that in-group solidarity is a key mechanism through which racial threat shapes preferences for taxation.

This article develops a spatiotemporal theory of institutional change by analyzing the evolving infrastructural power of the European Union's legal order using geospatial methods.

Although recent attention has been paid to when states are most likely to act on behalf of status concerns, very little is known about which actions states are most likely to engage in when their status is threatened. This article focuses on the effect of publicly humiliating international events as sources of status threat. Such events call into question a state's image in the eyes of others, thereby increasing the likelihood that the state will engage in reassertions of its status. The article presents a theory of status reassertion that outlines which states will be most likely to respond, as well as when and how they will be most likely to do so. The author argues that because high-status states have the most to lose from repeated humiliation, they will be relatively risk averse when reasserting their status. In contrast to prior work arguing that humiliation drives a need for revenge, the author demonstrates that great powers only rarely engage in direct revenge. Rather, they pursue the less risky option of projecting power abroad against weaker states to convey their intentions of remaining a great power. The validity of this theory is tested using an expanded and recoded data set of territorial change from 1816 to 2000. Great powers that have experienced a humiliating, involuntary territorial loss are more likely to attempt aggressive territorial gains in the future and, in particular, against third-party states.","author_address":"[Barnhart, Joslyn] Wesleyan Univ, Govt, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","reprint_address":"Barnhart, J (reprint author), Wesleyan Univ, Govt, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.","author_email":"joslynbarnhart@gmail.com","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":69.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0043887117000028","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000403690700004","pg":"532","author_last_WOS":"Barnhart","author_first_WOS":"Joslyn","published":"JUL 2017","pdf_filename":"Barnhart_WorldPolitics_2017_3r5G","claim2_abstract":"Great powers that have experienced a humiliating, involuntary territorial loss are more likely to attempt aggressive territorial gains in the future and, in particular, against third-party states.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"3458","claim2_box":"(x1: 334.37 y1: 35.19) (x2: 246.52 y2: 41.85)","claim3a_concretehyp":"First, we find strong  support  for  hypothesis  6,  which  states  that  great  powers  that have involuntarily lost territory will be more likely to target states over which they hold a significant relative military advantage.","claim3a_pg":"23","claim3a_start":"1097","claim3a_box":"(x1: 331.61 y1: 243.94) (x2: 330.52 y2: 289.83)","claim3b_testspec":"humiliation\u2014involuntary  territorial  loss | i  include  a  variable,  relative  capability,  that measures  the  proportion  of  total  capabilities  in  the  dyad  possessed  by one  side  using  the  Composite  index  of  national  Capability  scores  as taken from the Correlates of War data set. | a  two-sample t-test","claim3b_pg":"2 | 18 | 23","claim3b_start":"1838 | 321 | 1797","claim3b_box":"(x1: 101.66 y1: 321.96) (x2: 287.82 y2: 328.87) | (x1: 171.76 y1: 100.96) (x2: 242.43 y2: 146.86) | (x1: 358.82 y1: 360.95) (x2: 128.64 y2: 380.85)","claim4_inftest":"great  powers  experienc-ing  recent  territorial  loss  attempted  gains  within  dyads  in  which  their relative military advantage is on average 8 percent higher than it is for nonhumiliated  great  powers  attempting  territorial  aggression.  a  two-sample t-test indicates that the difference in the relative capabilities of states targeted by great powers is significant at the .05 level.","claim4_pg":"23","claim4_start":"1548","claim4_box":"(x1: 277.82 y1: 321.96) (x2: 337.51 y2: 393.85)","corr_author":"Joslyn Barnhart","corr_email":"joslynbarnhart@gmail.com","version":1},{"title_CR":"Political Repression and the Destruction of Dissident Organizations","author_last_CR":"Sullivan","author_first_CR":"Christopher M.","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1017\/s0043887116000125","ISSN_CR":"0043-8871","publication_CR":"World Politics","pub_short":"WorldPolitics","paper_id":"AQWj","author_full":"Sullivan, Christopher M.","title_WOS":"POLITICAL REPRESSION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS Evidence from the Archives of the Guatemalan National Police","publication_WOS":"WORLD POLITICS","language":"English","keywords":null,"keywords_plus":"STATE REPRESSION; COLLECTIVE ACTION; CIVIL-WAR; EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION; DETERRENCE; VIOLENCE; INSURGENCY; REBELLION; PROTEST; DISSENT","abstract":"To date, answers to this question have been inconclusive.

The analysis employs original, microlevel data collected from previously confidential Guatemalan National Police records to assess the effects of repression during the years 1975 to 1985. Results show that the effects of repression are more complex than previously imagined. When repression targets the clandestine activities necessary to develop and sustain dissident organizations, such as holding meetings, training participants, and campaigning for funds, dissent declines significantly. But when repression is directed at ongoing, overt, collective challenges, it motivates a backlash that escalates dissent.

This debate has become central to the process of foreign investment arbitration because parties to disputes nearly always can choose to hide arbitral outcomes from public view. Working with a new database of disputes at the world's largest investor-state arbitral institution, the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, the authors examine the incentives of firms and governments to keep the details of their disputes secret. The authors argue that secrecy in the context of investment arbitration works like a flexibility-enhancing device, similar to the way escape clauses function in the context of international trade. To attract and preserve investment, governments make contractual and treaty-based promises to submit to binding arbitration in the event of a dispute. They may prefer secrecy in cases when they are under strong political pressure to adopt policies that violate international legal norms designed to protect investor interests. Investors favor secrecy when managing politically sensitive disputes over assets they will continue to own and manage in host countries long after the particular dispute has passed. Although governments prefer secrecy to help facilitate politically difficult bargaining, secrecy diminishes one of the central purposes of arbitration: to allow governments to signal publicly their general commitment to investor-friendly policies. Understanding the incentives for keeping the details of dispute resolution secret may help future scholars explain more accurately the observed patterns of wins and losses from investor-state arbitration as well as patterns of investment.","author_address":"[Hafner-Burton, Emilie M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Int Justice & Human Rights, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Hafner-Burton, Emilie M.; Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Int Law & Regulat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Hafner-Burton, Emilie M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy & Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Steinert-Threlkeld, Zachary C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Int Relat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","reprint_address":"Hafner-Burton, EM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Int Justice & Human Rights, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.; Hafner-Burton, EM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Int Law & Regulat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.; Hafner-Burton, EM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy & Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.","author_email":"ehafner@ucsd.edu; zst@luskin.ucla.edu; david.victor@ucsd.edu","funding":"School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego; BP plc; Electric Power Research Institute; Norwegian Research Foundation","publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":68.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s004388711600006x","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000385303100002","pg":"413","author_last_WOS":"Hafner-Burton","author_first_WOS":"Emilie M.","published":"JUL 2016","pdf_filename":"Hafner_Burton_WorldPolitics_2016_YWBW","claim2_abstract":"Investors favor secrecy when managing politically sensitive disputes over assets they will continue to own and manage in host countries long after the particular dispute has passed.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"3140","claim2_box":"(x1: 40.56 y1: 41.03) (x2: 359.37 y2: 43.69)","claim3a_concretehyp":"H1: arbitration of disputes over long-lived investments is more likely to remain secret.","claim3a_pg":"12","claim3a_start":"2466","claim3a_box":"(x1: 111.00 y1: 510.16) (x2: 155.05 y2: 526.86)","claim3b_testspec":"the  World  bank\u2019s  international  centre  for  settlement  of  investment disputes  (icsid) | our dependent vari-able,  Secret,  describes  whether  the  full  final  outcome  of  a  concluded case was formally disclosed (0) through icsid or through other official sources with the consent of the parties or concealed (1) | a logit model | (in column 2) | over  long-lived  investments | the  intended or  actual  lifespan  of  an  investment  under  dispute | to  evaluate this claim, we code LongLived (1) for disputes pertaining to industries where  foreign  investment  practice  has  focused  on  investments  of  this type (electricity and electric infrastructure; hydrocarbon supply and in-frastructure; mining; and ports, airports, roads, railroads, and transport infrastructure). | all other investments (agriculture, food, drinks, forestry, financial, general industry, general infrastructure, telecommunications, tourism, and a re-sidual \u201cother\u201d category) are coded LongLived (0). | table  1","claim3b_pg":"3 | 18 | 19 | 19 | 19 | 19 | 19 | 19 | 20","claim3b_start":"542 | 1265 | 175 | 310 | 409 | 809 | 889 | 1644 | 765","claim3b_box":"(x1: 48.00 y1: 100.96) (x2: 122.91 y2: 120.87) | (x1: 298.47 y1: 331.96) (x2: 320.76 y2: 377.87) | (x1: 150.64 y1: 74.96) (x2: 211.20 y2: 81.87) | (x1: 91.75 y1: 139.96) (x2: 154.72 y2: 146.87) | (x1: 230.88 y1: 152.96) (x2: 359.24 y2: 159.87) | (x1: 312.37 y1: 217.93) (x2: 283.13 y2: 237.84) | (x1: 320.96 y1: 230.93) (x2: 116.93 y2: 302.81) | (x1: 357.52 y1: 360.88) (x2: 273.63 y2: 406.77) | (x1: 212.91 y1: 61.71) (x2: 249.09 y2: 67.72)","claim4_inftest":"0.816*** | (0.264) | standard errors in parentheses | *** p<0.01 | the  estimates  reported  in table  1,  columns  1  and  2,  indicate  that  se-crecy  is  partly  a  function  of  the  kinds  of  investment  under  dispute\u2014the  coefficient  on  LongLived  is  a  positive  and  statistically  significant predictor of secrecy. in these types of cases, it is in the interest of both parties to conceal results to reduce incentives for public posturing that can lead to breakdowns in negotiations.","claim4_pg":"20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 23","claim4_start":"868 | 887 | 1706 | 1758 | 113","claim4_box":"(x1: 270.50 y1: 108.31) (x2: 299.64 y2: 113.71) | (x1: 267.53 y1: 119.31) (x2: 293.76 y2: 124.71) | (x1: 69.00 y1: 445.91) (x2: 166.25 y2: 450.71) | (x1: 229.94 y1: 445.91) (x2: 261.99 y2: 450.71) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 78.96) (x2: 230.06 y2: 150.85)","corr_author":"Emilie M.

Therefore, if aid agencies are providing funds for the sake of development, these countries should receive more aid and categorically different types of aid as compared with poorly governed countries In poorly governed countries aid should be given in forms that allow for less discretion Using an original data set of all World Bank projects from 1996 to 2002, the author distinguishes programmatic projects from investment projects and national from subnational Investment projects If the World Bank allows more discretion in well-governed countries, then it will choose to provide programmatic and national aid for these recipients The author presents evidence that the World Bank provides a larger proportion of national investment lending in better-governed countries With regard to programmatic lending, he finds mixed evidence Among counties eligible for International Development Association (IDA) aid, good governance surprisingly is associated with a lower proportion of programmatic aid, whereas for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (imp) borrowers, good governance is associated with a higher proportion. The author subjects these results to a number of robustness checks Although he confirms the existing result in the literature that the World Bank provides larger overall amounts of aid to better-governed countries, his examination of the disaggregated data leads to questioning whether both lending wings of the World Bank are designing aid programs in the most prodevelopment way possible","author_address":"Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","reprint_address":"Winters, MS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","author_email":null,"funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":62.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0043887110000092","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000279480200002","pg":"422","author_last_WOS":"Winters","author_first_WOS":"Matthew S.","published":"JUL 2010","pdf_filename":"Winters_WorldPolitics_2010_Gq7j","claim2_abstract":"in better-governed countries. | The author presents evidence that the World Bank provides a larger proportion of national investment lending","claim2_pg":"1 | 1","claim2_start":"3437 | 5005","claim2_box":"(x1: 25.62 y1: 39.62) (x2: 76.53 y2: 42.28) | (x1: 186.35 y1: 34.98) (x2: 379.55 y2: 37.64)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Where  national  governance  is  poor,  the  World Bank might be more likely to create projects that are subnationally tar-geted  such  that  the  government  will  have  less  discretion  over  imple-mentation.","claim3a_pg":"22","claim3a_start":"1450","claim3a_box":"(x1: 152.27 y1: 347.95) (x2: 98.31 y2: 393.85)","claim3b_testspec":"Point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals. outcome variables are the proportion of pro-grammatic lending (versus project lending) and the proportion of national lending (versus subnational lending) in terms of the total value of lending over the period from 1996 to 2002. all models are linear regressions including a constant and regional fixed effects | WB | in  order  to  examine  this  hypothesis,  i  create  an  outcome variable measuring the proportion of nationally targeted aid within the category  of  investment  project  aid\u2014programmatic  aid  is  completely excluded from the data.","claim3b_pg":"20 | 20 | 22","claim3b_start":"129 | 762 | 1663","claim3b_box":"(x1: 56.56 y1: 573.58) (x2: 231.52 y2: 608.38) | (x1: 187.07 y1: 474.85) (x2: 195.60 y2: 477.85) | (x1: 102.08 y1: 386.94) (x2: 156.75 y2: 432.83)","claim4_inftest":"figure 4 | the models indicated by the empty circles in Figure 4 provide sup-port  for  the  idea  that  the  World  Bank  does  pay  attention  to  country governance characteristics in designing aid projects, although the effect is statistically significant only in the combined data. | and just at the 95 percent confidence  level  of  significance  in  the  combined  data  (p<0.05)  in  col-umn  1. | the  substantive  effects  also  are  limited.  in  the  combined  data a one standard deviation increase in governance quality corresponds to a six percentage point increase in national lending (equivalent to one-quarter of a standard deviation of the outcome variable).","claim4_pg":"20 | 22 | 22 | 22","claim4_start":"0 | 1897 | 2383 | 2498","claim4_box":"(x1: 191.65 y1: 519.38) (x2: 228.35 y2: 525.39) | (x1: 59.98 y1: 438.92) (x2: 288.89 y2: 484.81) | (x1: 253.11 y1: 516.96) (x2: 81.35 y2: 549.86) | (x1: 83.97 y1: 542.95) (x2: 306.85 y2: 588.85)","corr_author":"Matthew S.

Reciprocal altruism is a plausible evolutionary mechanism for cooperation within unrelated pairs, as selection may favor individuals who selectively cooperate with those who have cooperated with them in the past. Reciprocity is often observed in humans, but there is only limited evidence of reciprocal altruism in other primate species, raising questions about the origins of human reciprocity. Here, we explore how reciprocity develops in a sample of American children ranging from 3 to 7.5 years of age, and also compare children's behavior to that of chimpanzees in prior studies to gain insight into the phylogeny of human reciprocity. Children show a marked tendency to respond contingently to both prosocial and selfish acts, patterns that have not been seen among chimpanzees in prior studies. Our results show that reciprocity increases markedly with age in this population of children, and by about 5.5 years of age children consistently match the previous behavior of their partners.

Several theories propose to explain why we observe a reduction in offending after marriage including identity changes, strengthened attachments, reduced opportunities, and changes to routine activities. Although mechanisms are hard to measure, we argue that each proposed mechanism implies a specific change process, that is, whether the change that ensues after marriage is enduring (stable) or situational (temporary). Drawing on a medical model framework, we cast the role of marriage as a treatment condition and observe whether the effect of marriage is conditional on staying married or whether the effect persists when the treatment is taken away (i.e., divorce). We use 13 years of monthly level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), a nationally representative sample containing close to 3,000 individuals with an arrest history, to examine changes in relationship status and arrest from adolescence into young adulthood. Estimates from multilevel within-individual models reveal greater support for situational mechanisms in that divorce is detrimental particularly for those in longer marriages; yet they also reveal important caveats that suggest a closer examination of the marriage effect. This research adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding the marriage effect by redirecting desistance research away from asking if marriage matters to asking how marriage affects desistance. A better understanding of this change process has important implications for criminal justice policy.","author_address":"[Bersani, Bianca E.] Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Sociol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Doherty, Elaine Eggleston] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav & Soc, Baltimore, MD USA","reprint_address":"Bersani, BE (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Sociol, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.","author_email":"bianca.bersani@umb.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":51.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12008","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000318626000006","pg":"399-433","author_last_WOS":"Bersani","author_first_WOS":"Bianca E.","published":"MAY 2013","pdf_filename":"BERSANI_Criminology_2013_zmYY","claim2_abstract":"Estimates from  multilevel  within-individual models  reveal | greater support for situational mechanisms in that divorce is detrimentalparticularly for those in longer marriages;","claim2_pg":"2 | 3","claim2_start":"1590 | 19","claim2_box":"(x1: 120.00 y1: 484.12) (x2: 373.99 y2: 488.62) | (x1: 78.00 y1: 71.12) (x2: 257.55 y2: 87.62)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Divorce  has  a  significant  detrimental  effect  on  offending  and  increasesthe likelihood  of  arrest  by  52  percent  (table  3,  model  2).","claim3a_pg":"21","claim3a_start":"2494","claim3a_box":"(x1: 69.00 y1: 565.74) (x2: 302.40 y2: 582.94)","claim3b_testspec":"Drawing on  a  medical  modelframework, we  cast the  role of marriage as  a  treatment condition andobserve whether the effect  of marriage is conditional on staying marriedor whether  the  effect persists when  the  \"treatment\" is  taken  away  (i.e.,divorce).

However, to date, these findings have been restricted to New Zealand samples. We describe two studies examining whether the structure of prejudiced attitudes and the differential prediction by RWA and SDO replicate in the Brazilian context, incorporating context-relevant examples of each grouppoliticians, those from the northeast region of Brazil, and environmentalists. Results broadly supported the three-factor structure of dangerous, derogated, and dissident groups. Consistent with previous research, regression and structural equation analyses showed that RWA explained prejudice against dangerous groups, SDO explained prejudice against derogated groups, and both RWA and SDO explained prejudice against dissident groups. This research provides some evidence for the generalizability of the three-dimensional structure of generalized prejudice and differential prediction by RWA and SDO.

What is unknown is whether these relationships also show cultural variations. Therefore, we conducted a study investigating how self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism predicted pride and embarrassment after success and failure by comparing 363 British and 352 Japanese students. Students were asked to respond to a set of scenarios where they imagined achieving either perfect (success) or flawed (failure) results. In both British and Japanese students, self-oriented perfectionism positively predicted pride after success and embarrassment after failure, whereas socially prescribed perfectionism predicted embarrassment after success and failure. Moreover, in Japanese students, socially prescribed perfectionism positively predicted pride after success and self-oriented perfectionism negatively predicted pride after failure. The findings have implications for our understanding of perfectionism, indicating that the perfectionismpride relationship not only varies between perfectionism dimensions but may also show cultural variations.

The study was conducted at two points of time, Time 1 (2664 participants) and Time 2 (1492 participants), over approximately 4 years, controlling for gender, age, education, and having a chronic disease. Body weight was assessed by body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and the five-factor model by Saucier's Mini-Markers. Cross-sectional regression results indicated that conscientiousness was negatively associated with the three body weight measures, whereas neuroticism and extraversion were positively associated with the three body weight measures. The longitudinal regression results indicate that extraversion was associated with an increase in two of the body weight measures. Neuroticism was associated with increase in all three body weight measures and more strongly for women than for men. Openness was associated with a decrease in all three body weight measures for women, but this association was not significant for men. These findings help identify personality traits that lead to risk of weight gain and point to the modifying role of gender.

Configurations of these two self-concepts were found to be consistently related to performance on intelligence tests in all three studies. For individuals who self-reported high intelligence (high explicit self-concept), a negative implicit self-concept (measured with the Implicit Association Test) led to a decrease in performance on intelligence tests. For participants whose self-report indicated a low self-concept of intelligence, positive automatic associations between the self and intelligence had a similar effect. In line with a stress hypothesis, the results indicate that any discrepant configuration of self-concepts will impair performance. Importantly, the prediction of performance on intelligence tests by the self-concept of intelligence was shown to be independent of self-esteem (Study 3).

At baseline, optimism and social support from the recipients' and the providers' perspective were assessed. Perceived stress was measured at 3 months follow-up.

Consistent with a Big-Five model, low Openness to Experience predicted RWA and therefore dangerous and dissident group prejudice. As predicted, low Emotionality (and Openness) rather than Agreeableness predicted SDO and therefore derogated and dissident group prejudice. Comparison with meta-analytic averages of Big-Five data supported expected similarities and differences in the association of Big-Five and HEXACO models of personality with ideology.

In a democracy, the incentive for improved performance is created by voters' responses to newly available information. Building on this work, donor projects have begun to export transparency interventions to authoritarian regimes under the assumption that nongovernmental organizations and the media can substitute for the incentives created by voters. Such interventions, however, are at odds with an emerging literature that argues that authoritarian parliaments primarily serve the role of co-optation and limited power sharing, where complaints can be raised in a manner that does not threaten regime stability. We argue that under these conditions, transparency may have perverse effects, and we test this theory with a randomized experiment on delegate behavior in query sessions in Vietnam, a single-party authoritarian regime. We find no evidence of a direct effect of the transparency treatment on delegate performance; however, further analysis reveals that delegates subjected to high treatment intensity demonstrate robust evidence of curtailed participation and damaged reelection prospects. These results make us cautious about the export of transparency without electoral sanctioning.","author_address":"[Malesky, Edmund] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Perkins Lib 326, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Schuler, Paul] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Anh Tran] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","reprint_address":"Malesky, E (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Perkins Lib 326, Box 90204, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","author_email":"ejm5@duke.edu; pschuler@ucsd.edu; trananh@indiana.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-0554","eISSN":"1537-5943","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":106.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0003055412000408","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000311519300005","pg":"762-786","author_last_WOS":"Malesky","author_first_WOS":"Edmund","published":"NOV 2012","pdf_filename":"MALESKY_AmPoliSciRev_2012_WNk2","claim2_abstract":"Wefind no evidence of a direct effect of the transparency treatment on delegate performance; however,further analysis reveals that delegates subjected to high treatment intensity demonstrate robust evidenceof curtailed participation and damaged reelection prospects.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1305","claim2_box":"(x1: 506.19 y1: 247.89) (x2: 339.90 y2: 285.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"delegates subjected tohigh treatment intensity, because of higher Internetsubscription rates in their provinces, demonstrate ro-bust evidence of curtailed activity in the query sessions,avoiding participating in legislative activities that couldembarrass regime leaders.","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"2929","claim3a_box":"(x1: 183.71 y1: 669.77) (x2: 161.63 y2: 729.29)","claim3b_testspec":"National Assembly ofthe single-party state of Vietnam (or VNA) | online newspaper | VietnamNet, the major online news-paper in the country | In collaboration with the newspaper, our main inter-vention launched individual web sites on VietnamNetfor randomly selected delegates in the VNA to informcitizens daily about these delegates\u2019 legislative activ-ities. | At the same time, the newspaper put a scorecard oneach delegate\u2019s web site that showed performance interms of (i) the total number of legislative speechesand queries that the delegate made; (ii) the numberof queries by the delegate that were critical of gov-ernment policies; (iii) the number of queries by thedelegate that were relevant to the interests of the del-egate\u2019s constituents, province, and profession; and (iv)a comparison of the delegates\u2019 performance on theseindicators with the highest, average, and lowest del-egates.

A key hypothesis in both economics and political science is that the CCP's cadre evaluation system, combined with China's geography-based governing logic, has motivated local administrators to compete with one another to generate high growth. We raise a number of theoretical and empirical challenges to this claim. Using a new biographical database of Central Committee members, a previously overlooked feature of CCP reporting, and a novel Bayesian method that can estimate individual-level correlates of partially observed ranks, we find no evidence that strong growth performance was rewarded with higher party ranks at any of the postreform party congresses. Instead, factional ties with various top leaders, educational qualifications, and provincial revenue collection played substantial roles in elite ranking, suggesting that promotion systems served the immediate needs of the regime and its leaders, rather than encompassing goals such as economic growth.","author_address":"[Shih, Victor] Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Adolph, Christopher] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Adolph, Christopher] Univ Washington, Ctr Stat & Social Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Liu, Mingxing] Peking Univ, China Inst Educ Finance Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","reprint_address":"Shih, V (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 601 Univ Pl, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.","author_email":"vshih@northwestern.edu; cadolph@uw.edu; liumingxing72@gmail.com","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-0554","eISSN":"1537-5943","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":106.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0003055411000566","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000301263400009","pg":"166-187","author_last_WOS":"Shih","author_first_WOS":"Victor","published":"FEB 2012","pdf_filename":"SHIH_AmPoliSciRev_2012_gpwK","claim2_abstract":"Instead,factional ties with various top leaders, educational qualifications, and provincial revenue collection playedsubstantial roles in elite ranking, suggesting that promotion systems served the immediate needs of theregime and its leaders, rather than encompassing goals such as economic growth.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1109","claim2_box":"(x1: 485.92 y1: 225.97) (x2: 424.03 y2: 263.58)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis F1.

This article suggests that this view is only partially correct: nondemocracies are a heterogeneous grouping, and only some types of authoritarian regimes adopt different foreign economic policies from those of their democratic counterparts. Using the example of exchange rate policy, the authors show that foreign economic policy varies across monarchic, military, and civilian dictatorships. More specifically, they hypothesize that monarchies and military regimes are more likely than democracies and civilian dictatorships to maintain fixed exchange rate regimes because the former regimes have smaller \"selectorates\" than the latter. The authors also expect that monarchies and civilian dictatorships maintain more undervalued exchange rates than democracies and military regimes because the former regimes provide their leaders with greater tenure security than the latter regimes. These hypotheses are evaluated using a time-series-cross-sectional data set of a large sample of developing countries from 1973 to 2006. The statistical results accord with these predictions.

Specifically, when the United States seeks cooperation from countries around the world, do the views of their publics about US foreign policy affect the actual foreign policy behavior of these countries? The authors examine this question using multinational surveys covering fifty-eight countries, combined with information about their foreign policy decisions in 2003, a critical year for the US. They draw their basic conceptual framework from Joseph Nye, who uses various indicators of opinion about the US to assess US soft power. But the authors argue that his theory lacks the specificity needed for falsifiable testing. They refine it by focusing on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy, an underemphasized element of Nye's approach. Their regression analysis shows that foreign public opinion has a significant and large effect on troop commitments to the war in Iraq, even after controlling for various hard power factors. It also has significant, albeit small, effects on policies toward the International Criminal Court and on voting decisions in the UN General Assembly. These results support the authors' refined theoretical argument about soft power: public opinion about US foreign policy in foreign countries does affect their policies toward the US, but this effect is conditional on the salience of an issue for mass publics.","author_address":"[Goldsmith, Benjamin E.] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Horiuchi, Yusaku] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","reprint_address":"Goldsmith, BE (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","author_email":"ben.goldsmith@sydney.edu.au; yusaku.horiuchi@gmail.com","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":64.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0043887112000123","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000305542800005","pg":"555","author_last_WOS":"Goldsmith","author_first_WOS":"Benjamin E.","published":"JUL 2012","pdf_filename":"Goldsmith_WorldPolitics_2012_rdB8","claim2_abstract":"Their regression analysis shows that foreign public opinion has a significant and large effect on troop commitments to the war in Iraq, even after controlling for various hard power factors.","claim2_pg":"2","claim2_start":"3536","claim2_box":"(x1: 367.61 y1: 52.47) (x2: 369.66 y2: 67.93)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis 1.

Recent theories suggest that inequality is among the leading determinants of both democratization and consolidation. By contrast, this article argues that inequality harins consolidation but has no net effect on democratization. The author shows that the existing theories that link inequality to democratization suffer from serious limitations: (1) the), are useful only for understanding transitions from below and thus do not apply to many other transitions (that is, those from above); (2) even for democratization from below, their predictions are unlikely to hold, since inequality actually has two opposite effects; and (3) they ignore collective action problems, which reduces their explanatory power. However, these objections do not affect the relationship between inequality and consolidation. In particular, while inequality has two opposite effects on the probability of transition to democracy, it unambiguously increases the probability of transition away from democracy. This article conducts the most comprehensive empirical test to date of the relationship between inequality and democracy. It finds no support for the main democratization theories. Contrary to what they predict, estimation suggests neither a monotonic negative nor an inverted U-shaped relationship.

However, most of this work has concentrated on movement outcomes, leaving open the question of how external attention changes the movement itself. Somewhat paradoxically, recent research has found that external attention also increases trial-by-trial movement variability. To explain these findings, we propose a theory of attention in motor control, grounded in optimal control theory, wherein variability is minimized along attended aspects of the movement. Internal attention thus reduces variability in individual bodily dimensions (positions and velocities of effectors), whereas external attention minimizes variability in the task outcome. Because the goal of a task defines a dimension in the movement space that is generally oblique to bodily dimensions, external attention should increase correlations among bodily dimensions while allowing their individual variances to grow. The current experiment tests these predictions in a dart-throwing task. External FOA led to more accurate performance and increased variability in the motion of the throwing arm, concomitant with stronger correlations among bodily dimensions (shoulder, elbow, and wrist positions and velocities) in a manner consistent with the task kinematics. These findings indicate a shift in the control policy of the motor system, consistent with the proposed theory. These results suggest an important role of attention as a control parameter in the regulation of the motor system, and more broadly illustrate the importance of cognitive mechanisms in motor behavior.","author_address":"[Lohse, Keith R.; Jones, Matt; Healy, Alice F.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lohse, Keith R.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Kinesiol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Sherwood, David E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","reprint_address":"Lohse, KR (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Kinesiol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.","author_email":"lohse@mail.ubc.ca","funding":"Army Research Office [W911NF-05-1-0153]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research Grant [FA9550-10-1-0177]; Institute of Cognitive Science","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0096-3445","eISSN":"1939-2222","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":143.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0032817","WOS_category":"Psychology, Experimental","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000349768000035","pg":"930-948","author_last_WOS":"Lohse","author_first_WOS":"Keith R.","published":"APR 2014","pdf_filename":"Lohse_JournExPsychGen_2014_q5PZ","claim2_abstract":"External FOA led to more accurate performance and increasedvariability in the motion of the throwing arm, concomitant with stronger correlations among bodilydimensions (shoulder, elbow, and wrist positions and velocities) in a manner consistent with the taskkinematics.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1355","claim2_box":"(x1: 251.46 y1: 295.84) (x2: 165.66 y2: 329.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The results of the current study support the hypothesis that theFOA plays a significant role in determining the control structure ofhuman motor behavior.

Experimental data collected over the last century have raised questions about the dominant theories that are based on frequency relationships between the harmonics of music chords. This study provides experimental evidence that strongly challenges these theories and suggests a new theory of dissonance based on relationships between pitch perception and recognition. Experiment 1 shows that dissonance does not increase with increasing numbers of harmonics in chords as predicted by Helmholtz's (1863\/1954) roughness theory, nor does it increase with fewer pitch-matching errors as predicted by Stumpf's (1898) tonal fusion theory. Dissonance was strongly correlated with pitch-matching error for chords, which in turn was reduced by chord familiarity and greater music training. This led to the proposition that long-term memory templates for common chords assist the perception of pitches in chords by providing an estimate of the chord intervals from spectral information. When recognition mechanisms based on these templates fail, the spectral pitch estimate is inconsistent with the period of the waveform, leading to cognitive incongruence and the negative affect of dissonance. The cognitive incongruence theory of dissonance was rigorously tested in Experiment 2, in which nonmusicians were trained to match the pitches of a random selection of 2-pitch chords. After 10 training sessions, they rated the chords they had learned to pitch match as less dissonant than the unlearned chords, irrespective of their tuning, providing strong support for a cognitive mechanism of dissonance.","author_address":"[McLachlan, Neil; Marco, David; Light, Maria; Wilson, Sarah] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","reprint_address":"McLachlan, N (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.","author_email":"mcln@unimelb.edu.au","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0096-3445","eISSN":"1939-2222","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":142.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0030830","WOS_category":"Psychology, Experimental","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000327108200011","pg":"1142-1158","author_last_WOS":"McLachlan","author_first_WOS":"Neil","published":"NOV 2013","pdf_filename":"McLachlan_JournExPsychGen_2013_YvAK","claim2_abstract":"Dissonance was strongly correlated with pitch-matching error for chords, which inturn was reduced by chord familiarity and greater music training.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"819","claim2_box":"(x1: 195.15 y1: 235.34) (x2: 353.69 y2: 249.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"These data provide strong evidence for the first hypoth-esis: that familiarity of chords increases with music training and isstrongly related to pitch-matching accuracy.","claim3a_pg":"9","claim3a_start":"1660","claim3a_box":"(x1: 84.43 y1: 364.87) (x2: 209.69 y2: 390.99)","claim3b_testspec":"Pearson\u2019s correlations were also undertaken to measure relation-ships between familiarity and pitch-matching accuracy.","claim3b_pg":"9","claim3b_start":"482","claim3b_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 166.88) (x2: 249.69 y2: 182.00)","claim4_inftest":"The over-all correlation between mean familiarity ratings and the percentageof correct pitch-matching estimations collapsed across all chordtunings and levels of music training was strong and significant(r \u0001 .96, p \u0004 .01).","claim4_pg":"9","claim4_start":"601","claim4_box":"(x1: 252.38 y1: 177.88) (x2: 119.03 y2: 226.00)","corr_author":"Neil McLachlan","corr_email":"mcln@unimelb.edu.au","version":1},{"title_CR":"Coregistration of eye movements and EEG in natural reading: Analyses and review.","author_last_CR":"Dimigen","author_first_CR":"Olaf","pub_year_CR":2011,"DOI_CR":"10.1037\/a0023885","ISSN_CR":"0096-3445","publication_CR":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","pub_short":"JournExPsychGen","paper_id":"ylwV","author_full":"Dimigen, Olaf; Sommer, Werner; Hohlfeld, Annette; Jacobs, Arthur M.; Kliegl, Reinhold","title_WOS":"Coregistration of Eye Movements and EEG in Natural Reading: Analyses and Review","publication_WOS":"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL","language":"English","keywords":"EEG; eye tracking; fixation-related potentials; artifact correction; natural viewing","keywords_plus":"INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; AUTOMATIC REMOVAL; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; PERCEPTUAL-SPAN","abstract":"Brain-electric correlates of reading have traditionally been studied with word-by-word presentation, a condition that eliminates important aspects of the normal reading process and precludes direct comparisons between neural activity and oculomotor behavior.

This dual-process explanation of recognition memory has gained wide acceptance among cognitive neuroscientists and some cognitive psychologists. Nonetheless, its difficulty in providing a quantitatively satisfactory description of performance has precluded a consensus not only regarding the theoretical structure of recognition memory but also about how to best measure recognition accuracy. In 2 experiments we show that neither the standard formulation of dual-process signal detection (DPSD) theory flora widely used single-process model called the unequal-variance signal-detection (UVSD) model provides a satisfactory explanation of recognition memory across different types of stimuli (words and travel scenes).

The VRDP can approximate both the DPSD and UVSD. In both experiments it provides a consistently superior fit across materials to the superset of the DPSD and UVSD. The VRDP offers a simple explanation of the form of conjoint item-source judgments, something neither the DPSD nor UVSD accomplishes.

But researchers in other disciplines have found that reported expectations are highly susceptible to exogenous factors (e.g., anchors and question ordering), indicating that such values are somewhat arbitrary responses to probabilistic questions. At the same time, reported expectations are coherent within persons, such that respondents rank order them rationally. For deterrence, then, absolute values reported on arrest risks are likely not stable but individuals still rank order specific crimes in meaningful ways. We examine the interpretability of reported arrest risk for three possibilities: 1) Reported risks are stable probabilistic values; 2) reported risks are arbitrary and uninformative for deterrence research; or 3) reported risks display \"coherent arbitrariness\" with unstable values between individuals but stable rank ordering of crimes within individuals. Through the use of three random experiments of college students, our results indicate that elicited risk perceptions are arbitrary in that they are influenced by the presentation of anchors and question ordering. Nevertheless, the rank ordering of crimes within and across conditions is unaffected by the presentation of anchors, suggesting that reported risks are locally coherent within persons.","author_address":"[Thomas, Kyle J.; Hamilton, Benjamin C.] Univ Missouri, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 331 Lucas Hall, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Loughran, Thomas A.] Univ Maryland Coll Pk, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, College Pk, MD USA","reprint_address":"Thomas, KJ (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 331 Lucas Hall, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.","author_email":"thomaskj@umsl.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":56.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12154","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000425140000003","pg":"59-86","author_last_WOS":"Thomas","author_first_WOS":"Kyle J.","published":"FEB 2018","pdf_filename":"THOMAS_Criminology_2018_9aAq","claim2_abstract":"Through theuse of three random experiments of college students, our results indicate that elicitedrisk perceptions are arbitrary in that they are in\ufb02uenced by the presentation of anchorsand question ordering","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1401","claim2_box":"(x1: 373.74 y1: 382.55) (x2: 160.58 y2: 423.15)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Hypothesis 1: Responses to probabilistic expectations of arrest will be affected byanchoring.

We used a US representative high school sample (N=346660) and a longitudinal design. At baseline, we measured social background, intelligence, personality traits and vocational interests. In two follow-ups (11 and 50years later), we recorded occupations and coded their probability of being computerized based on the skills required and technological developments. Multiple regressions showed that, regardless of social background, people who were more intelligent, mature, interested in arts, and sciences at baseline, and selected into jobs that had a lower probability of computerization. On average, a one standard deviation increase in each of these traits predicted an average of 4 percentage points drop in the probability of one's job of being computerized. At the US population level, this is equivalent with saving 5.8 million people from losing their future careers to computerization. Most effects replicated across time. Path analyses showed that educational attainment mediated these effects and some direct effects remained. This highlights the importance of personality on occupational selection and in shaping the labour market.

National manufactures regularly use brand promotions to fight store brands back. The purpose of this article is to find out whether attitudes toward national brand promotions and store brands have similar or different conceptual antecedents. The study presents and tests a model of the effects of shoppers characteristics (price and non-price-related) on attitudes toward store brand and national brand promotions. The results support that constructs relating to price impact both store brand attitude and national brand promotion attitude, but the strength of some of these relationships differ. Other shopper characteristics like brand loyalty and store loyalty, have similar negative and positive effects, respectively. These slight differences suggest that promotions of national brands might be a good tool for fighting back store brands, but manufacturers need to design and target these promotions carefully in order to avoid head-to-head competition.

Across two experience-sampling studies, we collected data from employees and their spouses multiple times per day in different domains for ten workdays. Results from our two-study examination supported both the resource generation mechanism and the resource depletion mechanism. On days when employees helped colleagues more, they reported higher positive affect, which led to higher support provision to their spouses; meanwhile, higher levels of helping translated in less time for the family, which led to lower support provided to spouses. In Study 2, we tested and found that prosocial motivation enhanced the resource-generating effect of help provision. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Past work suggests that these two decision formats should lead to the same final choice when information about the choice alternatives is held constant. In contrast, this research demonstrates a novel effect: two-stage decisions increase preference for hedonic (vs. utilitarian) options. A regulatory focus account explains this effect. In a two-stage process, after shortlisting, decision-makers feel that they have sufficiently advanced their prevention goals, and this reduces their prevention focus during the final choice stage. Reduced prevention focus, in turn, enhances hedonic preference. Four studies across different decision contexts illustrate this effect and support the underlying process mechanism. The findings suggest that the formal structure of a decision (single-stage vs. two-stage) leads to systematic differences in decision-makers' choices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Standard network theories imply that such alters are avoided or dropped. Drawing on a survey of over 1,100 diverse respondents who described over 12,000 relationships, we examined which among those ties respondents nominated as a person whom they sometimes find demanding or difficult. Those so listed composed about 15 percent of all alters in the network. After holding ego and alter traits constant, close kin, especially women relatives and aging parents, were especially likely to be named as difficult alters. Non-kin described as friends were less likely, and those described as co-workers more likely, to be listed only as difficult alters. These results suggest that normative and institutional constraints may force people to retain difficult and demanding alters in their networks. We also found that providing support to alters, but not receiving support from those alters, was a major source of difficulty in these relationships. Furthermore, the felt burden of providing support was not attenuated by receiving assistance, suggesting that alters involved in reciprocated exchanges were not less often labeled difficult than were those in unreciprocated ones.

This concept has been studied extensively across several disciplines. An analog concept of criminal capital, the focus of some speculation and limited empirical study, remains considerably less developed theoretically and methodologically. This article offers a formal theoretical model of criminal capital indicators and tests for greater illegal wage returns using a sample of serious adolescent offenders, many of whom participate in illegal income-generating activities. Our results reveal that, consistent with human capital theory, important illegal wage premiums are associated with investments in criminal capital, notably an increasing but declining marginal return to experience and a premium for specialization. Furthermore, as in studies of legal labor markets, we find strong evidence that, if left unaccounted for, nonrandom sample selection causes severe bias in models of illegal wages. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these results, along with directions for future research.","author_address":"[Loughran, Thomas A.; Holly Nguyen] Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Piquero, Alex R.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA","reprint_address":"Loughran, TA (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, 2220 Lefrak Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","author_email":"tloughran@umd.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-1224","eISSN":"1939-8271","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":78.0,"issue":"6.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0003122413505588","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000327310900001","pg":"925-948","author_last_WOS":"Loughran","author_first_WOS":"Thomas A.","published":"DEC 2013","pdf_filename":"Loughran_AmSocioRev_2013_YNwl","claim2_abstract":"Our results reveal that, consistent with human capital theory, important illegal wage premiums are associated with investments in criminal capital, notably an increasing but declining marginal return to experience and a premium for specialization","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"2499","claim2_box":"(x1: 296.55 y1: 293.71) (x2: 164.09 y2: 332.01)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We  also  found  important  wage  premiums for  specialization  in  certain  crimes, | We  employed  standard modeling techniques typically used in empiri-cal  labor  economics  to  show  that  ignoring such  selection  biases  greatly  overstated  the magnitudes  of  the  relationships  between wages  and  important  predictors.","claim3a_pg":"17 | 18","claim3a_start":"3635 | 154","claim3a_box":"(x1: 264.00 y1: 440.40) (x2: 397.12 y2: 457.94) | (x1: 131.41 y1: 92.40) (x2: 185.44 y2: 157.94)","claim3b_testspec":"Illegal  wage  rate.

Extant cross-country regressions, however, assume random effects and are run on panel datasets with relatively short time dimensions. Because natural resource reliance is not an exogenous variable, this is not an effective strategy for uncovering causal relationships. Numerous sources of bias may be driving the results, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant heterogeneity. To address these problems, we develop unique historical datasets, employ time-series centric techniques, and operationalize explicitly specified counterfactuals.

Yet, estimating the causal effects of cross-cutting cleavages is difficult. In this article, we present experimental results that help explain why ethnicity has a relatively minor political role in Mali, an ethnically heterogeneous sub-Saharan African country in which ethnic identity is a poor predictor of vote choice and parties do not form along ethnic lines. We argue that the cross-cutting ties afforded by an informal institution called \"cousinage\" help explain the weak association between ethnicity and individual vote choice.

This article explores two aspects of this set of rules: its decentralization and the unusual powers it gives to private actors to invoke dispute settlement. Decentralization has contributed to a competitive environment for ratification of bilateral investment treaties (Bus) and has elevated the importance of dyadic bargaining power in the formation of the regime. Governments of developing countries are more likely to enter into BITS and tie their hands more tightly when they are in a weak bargaining position, which in turn is associated with economic downturns of the domestic economy. Once committed, investors have sued governments with surprising regularity, arguably contributing disproportionately to legal awards that favor the private corporate actors who have the power to convene the dispute settlement system. States have begun to push back, revising their obligations and attempting to annul arbitral awards. One of the conclusions is that it is important not only to consider whether BITs attract capital-which has been the focus of nearly all the empirical research on BIT effects-but also to investigate the governance consequences of the international investment regime generally.","author_address":"Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","reprint_address":"Simmons, BA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","author_email":"bsimmons@wcfia.harvard.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":66.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0043887113000312","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000338695500002","pg":"12","author_last_WOS":"Simmons","author_first_WOS":"Beth A.","published":"JAN 2014","pdf_filename":"Simmons_WorldPolitics_2014_BEjx","claim2_abstract":"bilateral investment treaties (BITs) | Governments of developing countries are more likely to enter into BITs and tie their hands more tightly when they are in a weak bargaining position, which in turn is associated with economic downturns of the domestic economy.","claim2_pg":"1 | 1","claim2_start":"3338 | 3466","claim2_box":"(x1: 224.77 y1: 16.28) (x2: 285.45 y2: 18.94) | (x1: 33.35 y1: 20.28) (x2: 73.24 y2: 27.69)","claim3a_concretehyp":"it shows the results of a probit model that tests the hypothesis that weak gdp growth in a potential host country in the three years leading up to the conclusion of a bit makes it much more likely to agree to arrange-ments  that  provide  for  disputes  to  bypass  local  institutions  and  go  to international arbitration.","claim3a_pg":"14","claim3a_start":"436","claim3a_box":"(x1: 364.05 y1: 126.94) (x2: 161.88 y2: 198.86)","claim3b_testspec":"is  the  United  na-tions Commission on international Trade Law (uncitral) mentioned as  an  option?

The authors' findings support the notion that regime competition stimulated the expansion of the welfare state on both sides of the Iron Curtain in the postwar period.","author_address":"[Obinger, Herbert] Univ Bremens, Ctr Social Policy Res, Bremen, Germany; [Schmitt, Carina] Univ Bremen, Collaborat Res Ctr Transformat State TranState, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany","reprint_address":"Obinger, H (reprint author), Univ Bremens, Ctr Social Policy Res, Bremen, Germany.","author_email":"hobinger@zes.uni-bremen.de; carina.schmitt@sfb579.uni-bremen.de","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":63.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0043887111000025","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000289861400002","pg":"246","author_last_WOS":"Obinger","author_first_WOS":"Herbert","published":"APR 2011","pdf_filename":"Obinger_WorldPolitics_2011_xavJ","claim2_abstract":"The authors' findings support the notion that regime competition stimulated the expansion of the welfare state on both sides of the Iron Curtain in the postwar period.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"2844","claim2_box":"(x1: 91.34 y1: 35.20) (x2: 381.81 y2: 37.86)","claim3a_concretehyp":"the  main  hypothesis  states  that  regime  competition  regarding social provision during the cold war stimulated a welfare race in which the nations affiliated to one bloc attempted to outcompete their coun-terpart (H1).","claim3a_pg":"10","claim3a_start":"362","claim3a_box":"(x1: 81.11 y1: 126.94) (x2: 107.94 y2: 172.83)","claim3b_testspec":"Our  dependent  variable  is  the  annual  change  in  social  expenditure as a percentage of gdp. | we use spatial lag mod-els. | \u0394Y  denotes  the  annual  change  in  social  spending,  \u03c1  is  a  spatial autoregressive  coefficient,  and  Wy  is  the  weighted  average  of  the  de-pendent  variable  (spatial  lag). the  spatial  weight  matrix  W  (NxNxT ) reflects the relative connectivity of each country i to every other coun-try j at time t.

While observers frequently call for greater oversight of policy making, evidence suggests that settlement between states is more likely when negotiations are conducted behind closed doors. The World Trade Organization's (WTO) legal body provides a useful illustration of these competing perspectives. As in many courts, WTO dispute settlement is designed explicitly to facilitate settlement through private consultations. However, this study argues that the privacy of negotiations creates opportunities for states to strike deals that disadvantage others. Looking at product-level trade flows from all disputes between 1995 and 2011, it finds that private (early) settlements lead to discriminatory trade outcomes - complainant countries gain disproportionately more than the rest of the membership. When the facts of a case are made known through a ruling, these disproportional gains disappear entirely. The article also finds that third-party participation - commonly criticized for making settlement less likely - significantly reduces disparities in post-dispute trade. It then draws parallels to domestic law and concludes with a set of policy prescriptions.","author_address":"[Kucik, Jeffrey] CUNY City Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Pelc, Krzysztof J.] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada","reprint_address":"Kucik, J (reprint author), CUNY City Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10031 USA.","author_email":"jkucik@ccny.cuny.edu; kj.pelc@mcgill.ca","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0007-1234","eISSN":"1469-2112","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":46.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0007123414000520","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000385367700009","pg":"861-889","author_last_WOS":"Kucik","author_first_WOS":"Jeffrey","published":"OCT 2016","pdf_filename":"Kucik_BritJournPoliSci_2016_L22B","claim2_abstract":"Lookingat product-level trade \ufb02ows from all disputes between 1995 and 2011, it finds that private (early) settle-ments lead to discriminatory trade outcomes \u2013 complainant countries gain disproportionately more than therest of the membership.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"892","claim2_box":"(x1: 388.62 y1: 228.40) (x2: 132.28 y2: 262.09)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The observable implication is that we expect to see that early settlementsare, on average, discriminatory \u2013 that is, they result in trade outcomes that disadvantage statesnot party to the consultative process.","claim3a_pg":"2","claim3a_start":"2953","claim3a_box":"(x1: 144.97 y1: 454.89) (x2: 212.69 y2: 483.31)","claim3b_testspec":"World Trade Organization | To test our hypotheses, we construct a new database containing dispute histories and trade \ufb02owsfor each WTO dispute from DS1 to DS420 that names specific goods. | As a result, we rely on a dispute-level analysis in which the dependent variable, DisputedImportsi,j,t, is the annual level of imports into defendant i from trade partner j in year t.

It theorizes that constraints on government policy that reduce incentives to vote are more likely to be induced by foreign ownership of capital, while compensation through increased government spending is more likely (if at all) to be the product of structural shifts in production associated with international trade. Using data from twenty-three OECD countries from 1970-2007, the study finds strong support for the ownership-constraint hypothesis in which foreign ownership reduces turnout, both directly and - in strict opposition to the compensation hypothesis - indirectly by reducing government spending (and thus the importance of politics). The results suggest that increased foreign ownership, especially the most mobile capital flows, can explain up to two-thirds of the large declines in turnout over recent decades.","author_address":"[Marshall, John] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fisher, Stephen D.] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","reprint_address":"Marshall, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","author_email":"jlmarsh@fas.harvard.edu; stephen.fisher@sociology.ox.ac.uk","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0007-1234","eISSN":"1469-2112","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":45.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0007123413000422","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000350810600006","pg":"353-389","author_last_WOS":"Marshall","author_first_WOS":"John","published":"APR 2015","pdf_filename":"Marshall_BritJournPoliSci_2015_GOYb","claim2_abstract":"Using data from twenty-three OECD countries from 1970\u20132007,the study finds strong support for the ownership-constraint hypothesis in which foreign ownershipreduces turnout, both directly and \u2013 in strict opposition to the compensation hypothesis \u2013 indirectlyby reducing government spending (and thus the importance of politics).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"848","claim2_box":"(x1: 181.75 y1: 244.13) (x2: 323.34 y2: 277.91)","claim3a_concretehyp":"HYPOTHESIS 4A: Increases in foreign ownership (FDI and portfolio equity) transactionsreduce turnout, and do so more than increases in international trade.","claim3a_pg":"11","claim3a_start":"1412","claim3a_box":"(x1: 51.02 y1: 282.57) (x2: 423.11 y2: 297.97)","claim3b_testspec":"Our primary dependent variable of Aggregate Electoral Turnout | heteroskedasticity and clustering within countries by using cluster-robust standarderrors.108 Secondly, a Wooldridge109 test of the baseline models unsurprisingly indicatedthe presence of first-order serial correlation.110 We model this with a lagged dependentvariable (LDV); model diagnostics indicate that this is sufficient to remove residual (andhigher-order) serial correlation. | Since cross-sectional variation is not required foridentification (even if it enhances efficiency in some cases) and our theory is principallyconcerned with the effects of changes in globalization rather than levels, we includecountry fixed effects (FEs). | In order to capture country-specificdynamics, and thus control for unobserved trends that might induce spurious correlation, wedetrend the data by including quadratic trend terms specific to each country. | For turnout, we estimate Equation 2 using the one-step Arellano and Bond125\u2018difference GMM\u2019 estimator | The results for electoral turnout obtained from estimating Equation 2 with differenceGMM are shown in Table 2.

Fifty healthy females were presented neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant images from the International Affective Picture System while standing on a stabilometric platform and wearing a polar band to assess body sway and heart rate. In the total sample, only unpleasant pictures elicited reduced body sway and reduced heart rate (freezing). Moreover, participants who had experienced 1 or more aversive life events showed greater reductions in heart rate for unpleasant versus pleasant pictures than those who had experienced no such event. In addition, relative to no-event participants, single-event participants showed reduced body sway to unpleasant pictures, while multiple-event participants showed reduced body sway in response to all picture categories. These results indicate that aversive life events affect automatic freezing responses and may indicate the cumulative effect of multiple trauma.

He combines a unique and underutilized collection of postwar testimonies gathered in light of an honorary pension program with postwar trials of pro-Nazi collaborators and literature on nonrescuers, to trace both successful and failed rescue attempts. In line with the theory, the analysis reveals that Catholic rescue groups were more successful in Protestant regions and vice versa because their minority position facilitated mobilization while reducing exposure.

Rather than treating conflict as a direct consequence of ethnic cleavages, the authors argue that ethnicity per se does not affect civil war duration.

They employ a dyadic approach that emphasizes the political context in which both government leaders and nonstate challengers can capitalize on the ascriptive nature of ethnicity. They show that although states can initially benefit from politicizing ethnic relations, once violent conflict breaks out, such policies may backfire on the government and make it difficult for incumbent governments to accept settlements that could terminate conflicts. Past policies of ethnic exclusion also benefit rebel organizations fighting the government, since the resulting grievances increase collective group solidarity and render individual fighters more cost tolerant.

Gathering a dataset of almost a million utterances in parliament between the First and Fourth Reform Acts, the study provides a novel method of identifying Shadow Cabinet members using the surges in term use from their speeches.

This study suggests that both positions can be correct under different conditions.

We demonstrate that increasing class heterogeneity does not account for the decline of the class-party association, which occurs primarily as a result of ideological convergence between the main parties resulting from New Labour's shift to the centre.","author_address":"[Evans, Geoffrey; Tilley, James] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","reprint_address":"Evans, G (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.","author_email":"Geoffrey.evans@nuffield.ox.ac.uk","funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0007-1234","eISSN":"1469-2112","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":42.0,"issue":null,"DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s0007123411000202","WOS_category":"Political Science","category":"Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000298112700006","pg":"137-161","author_last_WOS":"Evans","author_first_WOS":"Geoffrey","published":"JAN 2012","pdf_filename":"Evans_BritJournPoliSci_2012_d1Zm","claim2_abstract":"We demonstrate that increasing class heterogeneity does not account for the decline of theclass\u2013party association, which occurs primarily as a result of ideological convergence between themain parties resulting from New Labour\u2019s shift to the centre.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"786","claim2_box":"(x1: 110.32 y1: 228.20) (x2: 302.84 y2: 252.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"HYPOTHESIS 3: Ideological convergence\/polarization by the two main political parties alongthe left\u2013right dimension affects the strength of the class\u2013party associationonly from the mid-1970s onwards.","claim3a_pg":"8","claim3a_start":"1604","claim3a_box":"(x1: 72.06 y1: 335.35) (x2: 287.27 y2: 362.72)","claim3b_testspec":"lower service (lower professionaland managerial workers) | We can test these claims a little more rigorously using aseries of multilevel models, presented in Table 1.

Research findings reveal that illegal firearms are usually acquired through a variety of means, including theft and diversions from legitimate firearms commerce. Little is known, however, about the underground gun markets supplying the gang and drug networks responsible for a large share of gun violence in U.S. cities. In this article, we take a mixed-methods approach, combining trace analyses of recovered handguns with ethnographic interviews of high-risk gun users to develop new insights on the entry of guns into three criminal networks in Boston. We find that guns possessed by Boston gang members are of a different character compared with other crime guns; these guns are more likely to be older firearms originating from New Hampshire, Maine, and I-95 southern states. The results of our qualitative research reveal that gang members and drug dealers pay inflated prices for handguns diverted by traffickers exploiting unregulated secondary market transactions, with significant premiums paid for high-caliber semiautomatic pistols. Taken together, these findings provide an analytic portrait of the market for illicit guns among those most proximate to violence, yielding novel empirical, theoretical, and practical insights into the problem of criminal gun access.","author_address":"[Hureau, David M.] SUNY Albany, Sch Criminal Justice, 135 Western Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Braga, Anthony A.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Braga, Anthony A.] Northeastern Univ, Sch Criminol & Criminal Justice, Boston, MA 02115 USA","reprint_address":"Hureau, DM (reprint author), SUNY Albany, Sch Criminal Justice, 135 Western Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.","author_email":"dhureau@albany.edu","funding":"Fund for a Safer Future; Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston; Harvard University Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality & Social Policy (NSF-IGERT Grant) [0333403]; Everytown for Gun Safety","publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":56.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12187","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000441433300004","pg":"510-545","author_last_WOS":"Hureau","author_first_WOS":"David M.","published":"AUG 2018","pdf_filename":"HUREAU_Criminology_2018_dm4V","claim2_abstract":"We find that guns possessed by Boston gang members are of a different character com-pared with other crime guns; these guns are more likely to be older firearms originatingfrom New Hampshire, Maine, and I-95 southern states.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"894","claim2_box":"(x1: 60.30 y1: 287.91) (x2: 296.44 y2: 316.55)","claim3a_concretehyp":"and were 52.3 percentless likely to recovered by police within 3 years of their first retail sales relative to tracedguns recovered from nongang members (p < .01)","claim3a_pg":"16","claim3a_start":"1598","claim3a_box":"(x1: 331.79 y1: 278.02) (x2: 259.01 y2: 306.66)","claim3b_testspec":"Table 3 presents the results of the multivariate logistic regression of N = 416 tracedfirearms recovered from gang possessors relative to N = 814 traced firearms recoveredfrom nongang possessors during the same time period on selected firearm characteris-tics.

Most researchers tend to agree that support for and participation in vigilantism occurs in stateless locations, that is, when formal justice institutions are weak or absent. Despite this general consensus, quantitative evidence of this relationship is limited to a handful of country-specific studies that used only subjective survey-based measures of institutional weakness. This study seeks to extend research on vigilantism by assessing the relationship between subjective and objective conditions of formal justice institutions and public support for vigilantism across 323 provinces in 18 Latin American countries by using the 2012 AmericasBarometer Survey. Specifically, this study uses multilevel logistic regression techniques to examine the variability of public support for lethal vigilantism within and across Latin American countries. When controlling for a wide range of potential confounds, the results show that the most robust predictors of support for violent vigilantism are subjective indicators of institutional illegitimacy, personal victimization, and punitive attitudes. Evidence also exists that objective insecurity, as measured by province-level homicide rates, fosters public support for violent vigilantism in certain situations.","author_address":"[Nivette, Amy E.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, Padualaan 14, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands","reprint_address":"Nivette, AE (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, Padualaan 14, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.","author_email":"A.E.Nivette@uu.nl","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":54.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12099","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000370446200006","pg":"142-175","author_last_WOS":"Nivette","author_first_WOS":"Amy E.","published":"FEB 2016","pdf_filename":"NIVETTE_Criminology_2016_W70w","claim2_abstract":"When controlling for awide range of potential confounds, the results show that the most robust predictorsof support for violent vigilantism are subjective indicators of institutional illegitimacy","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1125","claim2_box":"(x1: 326.17 y1: 317.79) (x2: 420.44 y2: 346.44)","claim3a_concretehyp":"In sum, both violent vigilantism and punitiveness stem from feelings that formal insti-tutions are somehow ineffective in providing security.

There is a limited understanding of how neighborhood social processes affect variation in these perceptions.

These hypotheses are tested with multilevel regression models applied to data from a sample of 689 African Americans located in 39 neighborhoods. Findings from the regression models indicate that the positive association between structural disadvantage and perceptions of injustice is accounted for by moral and legal cynicism. Furthermore, adverse police encounters significantly increase perceptions of injustice; controlling for these encounters reduces the strength of the association between cynicism and injustice perceptions. Finally, the findings reveal that cynicism intensifies the association between adverse police encounters and perceptions of criminal injustice.

The empirical basis for this conclusion is the failure in several previous studies to find a sizable negative relationship between dispositional and situational crime attributions, or between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies. We suggest, however, that public pragmatism may be an artifact of the use of unidirectional question batteries in prior research to measure attribution styles and policy support. When such questions are used, acquiescent responding can introduce systematic error that is positively correlated across items and scales. Drawing on data from an experiment with a national sample (N = 826) of Internet panelists, we examine how this methodological approach impacts the bivariate correlations and multivariate relationships between attribution styles and between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies. The findings reveal that using unidirectional sets of questions to measure these concepts likely results in 1) inflated alpha reliability coefficients, 2) an underestimation of the magnitude of the negative relationships between attribution styles and between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation, and 3) an underestimation of the extent to which punitiveness and support for rehabilitation are driven by the same factors, working in opposite directions.","author_address":"[Pickett, Justin T.] SUNY Albany, Sch Criminal Justice, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Baker, Thomas] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, L DouglasWilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","reprint_address":"Pickett, JT (reprint author), SUNY Albany, Sch Criminal Justice, 135 Western Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.","author_email":"jpickett@albany.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":52.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12035","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000335155100003","pg":"195-222","author_last_WOS":"Pickett","author_first_WOS":"Justin T.","published":"MAY 2014","pdf_filename":"PICKETT_Criminology_2014_P1rY","claim2_abstract":"The findingsreveal that using unidirectional sets of questions to measure these concepts likely re-sults in 1) in\ufb02ated alpha reliability coefficients, 2) an underestimation of the magnitudeof the negative relationships between attribution styles and between punitiveness andsupport for rehabilitation, and 3)","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1282","claim2_box":"(x1: 374.05 y1: 339.71) (x2: 206.27 y2: 392.27)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The use of unilaterally positive items to measure crime attributions andpolicy support will lead to an underestimation of the size of the hydraulic relation be-tween dispositional and situational attribution styles, and between support for punitiveand rehabilitative policies.","claim3a_pg":"7","claim3a_start":"1292","claim3a_box":"(x1: 116.48 y1: 284.82) (x2: 168.42 y2: 325.41)","claim3b_testspec":"Drawing on data from an experiment with a nationalsample (N = 826) of Internet panelists, we examine how this methodological approachimpacts the bivariate correlations and multivariate relationships between attributionstyles and between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies.","claim3b_pg":"1","claim3b_start":"989","claim3b_box":"(x1: 199.74 y1: 303.84) (x2: 371.35 y2: 344.44)","claim4_inftest":"\u2212.171\u2217\u2217 | An inspection of table 4 reveals that the two attribution styles are not sig-nificantly related in the unidirectional group.

Building on the conceptualization of social support as a volatile resource, we examine how daily fluctuations in social support at work and at home influence the process through which work interferes with family life. A total of 112 employees participated in the study and were asked to respond to daily surveys in the work and home domains. Results showed that social support at work and at home-as volatile resources-buffered the daily work-family conflict process within their respective domains. First, a supportive supervisor mitigated the within-individual effect of workload on emotional exhaustion. Second, a supportive spouse protected the strained employee from the effect of emotional exhaustion on work-family conflict, and spousal support also moderated the indirect effect from workload to work-family conflict through emotional exhaustion. The findings suggest that enacting a dual social support system can effectively reduce the adverse effects of excessive job demands on exhaustion and work-family conflict, but buffering effects are highly dependent on the timely availability of social support.","author_address":"[Pluut, Helen] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Ilies, Remus] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Curseu, Petru L.] Open Univ Netherlands, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Curseu, Petru L.] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Liu, Yukun] Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia","reprint_address":"Pluut, H (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Dept Business Studies, Kamerlingh Onnes Bldg,Steenschuur 25,Room B3-14, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.","author_email":"h.pluut@law.leidenuniv.nl","funding":null,"publisher":"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","publisher_address":"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0749-5978","eISSN":"1095-9920","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":146.0,"issue":null,"DOI_WOS":"10.1016\/j.obhdp.2018.02.001","WOS_category":"Psychology, Applied; Management; Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology; Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000434746200001","pg":"1-13","author_last_WOS":"Pluut","author_first_WOS":"Helen","published":"MAY 2018","pdf_filename":"Pluut_OrgBehavior_2018_E0by","claim2_abstract":"First, a supportive supervisor mitigated the within-individual e\ufb00ect of workload on emotional ex-haustion","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1290","claim2_box":"(x1: 235.10 y1: 370.06) (x2: 230.37 y2: 384.09)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Daily social support at work (from coworkers andsupervisor) moderates the within-individual e\ufb00ect of workload onemotional exhaustion such that this relationship is weaker on dayswhen one receives more rather than less social support at work.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"4972","claim3a_box":"(x1: 365.33 y1: 160.61) (x2: 535.38 y2: 195.87)","claim3b_testspec":"weutilized the multilevel modeling approach outlined by Bauer,Preacher, and Gil (2006), with work and home support variables asmoderators.","claim3b_pg":"6","claim3b_start":"3885","claim3b_box":"(x1: 547.42 y1: 500.60) (x2: 349.59 y2: 535.86)","claim4_inftest":"the interactionbetween workload and supervisor support was significant (B = \u22120.19,p = .025)","claim4_pg":"7","claim4_start":"1110","claim4_box":"(x1: 235.89 y1: 439.38) (x2: 71.32 y2: 464.15)","corr_author":"Helen Pluut","corr_email":"h.pluut@law.leidenuniv.nl","version":1},{"title_CR":"Why and when do employees imitate the absenteeism of co-workers?","author_last_CR":"ten Brummelhuis","author_first_CR":"Lieke L.","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1016\/j.obhdp.2016.04.001","ISSN_CR":"0749-5978","publication_CR":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","pub_short":"OrgBehavior","paper_id":"E0dj","author_full":"ten Brummelhuis, Lieke L.; Johns, Gary; Lyons, Brent J.; ter Hoeven, Claartje L.","title_WOS":"Why and when do employees imitate the absenteeism of co-workers?","publication_WOS":"ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES","language":"English","keywords":"Absenteeism; Absence culture; Social exchange; Social learning; Team processes","keywords_plus":"ABSENCE CULTURE; SICKNESS ABSENCE; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; WORK GROUPS; MONKEY SEE; BEHAVIOR; CONSEQUENCES; MULTILEVEL; INTERDEPENDENCE; HEALTH","abstract":"We aimed to shed light on the reason why individual employees adjust their absence levels to their co-workers' absence behavior and under what conditions imitation is most likely by integrating social learning theory and social exchange theory.

It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965-99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions.","author_address":"[Edelman, Lauren B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Study Law & Soc, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eliason, Scott R.] Univ Arizona, Inst BIO5, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Eliason, Scott R.] Univ Arizona, Stat Grad Program, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Mellema, Virginia] US Equal Employment Opportun Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Krieger, Linda H.] Univ Hawaii, William S Richardson Sch Law, Ulu Lehua Scholars Program, Manoa, HI USA; [Albiston, Catherine R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Jurisprudence & Social Policy Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Albiston, Catherine R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Law Sch, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","reprint_address":"Edelman, LB (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Study Law & Soc, 2240 Piedmt Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","author_email":"ledelman@law.berkeley.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","publisher_address":"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0002-9602","eISSN":"1537-5390","pub_year_WOS":2011.0,"volume":117.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/661984","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000297572700005","pg":"888-954","author_last_WOS":"Edelman","author_first_WOS":"Lauren B.","published":"NOV 2011","pdf_filename":"Edelman_AmJournSocio_2011_VDWK","claim2_abstract":"Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout andwhen the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable orga-nizational attributes.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1373","claim2_box":"(x1: 113.79 y1: 416.40) (x2: 173.33 y2: 441.68)","claim3a_concretehyp":"We also expectedgreater relevance of and deference to organizational structures in disparatetreatment opinions because the ambiguity of the intent requirement wouldlead judges to infer the rationality and fairness of organizational gover-nance from the presence of institutionalized practices.","claim3a_pg":"41","claim3a_start":"1508","claim3a_box":"(x1: 303.65 y1: 356.73) (x2: 304.31 y2: 408.90)","claim3b_testspec":"As discussed earlier, legal endogeneity is measured by its three observablemanifestations that represent progressive stages of endogeneity: reference,relevance, and deference. | Y p X b \u0002 j \u0002 t \u0002 g \u0002 \u0001 ,ijt ijt i t it ijtRel Rel Rel Rel Rel RelY p X b \u0002 j \u0002 t \u0002 g \u0002 \u0001 , (1)ijt ijt i t it ijtDef Def Def Def Def DefY p X b \u0002 j \u0002 t \u0002 g \u0002 \u0001 , | J","claim3b_pg":"29 | 33 | 42","claim3b_start":"181 | 896 | 0","claim3b_box":"(x1: 65.75 y1: 145.53) (x2: 174.73 y2: 173.79) | (x1: 133.40 y1: 205.30) (x2: 309.28 y2: 249.50) | (x1: 297.78 y1: 45.90) (x2: 302.20 y2: 50.25)","claim4_inftest":"Specifically, as shown in table 2, deference to structures in thedistrict courts is 15% (1.93\/1.67 p 1.15) more likely when disparate treat-ment theory is invoked relative to hostile work environment theory, andalmost twice as likely (1.93, P ! .01) when disparate treatment theory isinvoked compared to all other theories.","claim4_pg":"42","claim4_start":"1946","claim4_box":"(x1: 103.11 y1: 392.59) (x2: 239.14 y2: 444.76)","corr_author":"Lauren B.

They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from \"elite\" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.","author_address":"[Wimmer, Andreas] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lewis, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","reprint_address":"Wimmer, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, 264 Haines Hall,Box 951551, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","author_email":"awimmer@soc.ucla.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","publisher_address":"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0002-9602","eISSN":"1537-5390","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":116.0,"issue":"2.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/653658","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000285139000006","pg":"583-642","author_last_WOS":"Wimmer","author_first_WOS":"Andreas","published":"SEP 2010","pdf_filename":"Wimmer_AmJournSocio_2010_Q7zd","claim2_abstract":"Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily re-garding nonracial categories (e.g., students from \u201celite\u201d backgroundsor those from particular states) all in\ufb02uence the tie formation processmore than does racial homophily.","claim2_pg":"2","claim2_start":"1348","claim2_box":"(x1: 173.66 y1: 490.93) (x2: 317.66 y2: 526.66)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Notably, socioeconomic status also emerges as one of the most im-portant dimensions of social closure among these students.

Method: Beginning in the senior year of high school, 197 late adolescents with T1D (M-age = 17.77) reported on their student status and living situation, and completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms and adherence to the diabetes regimen, annually at 3 time points. Glycemic control was gathered from hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) assay kits at the same time points. Results: Results of multilevel models demonstrated high depressive symptoms at baseline, with significant increases in depressive symptoms across time when participants were not living in their parental home, but no change when living with parents. Participants with higher mean levels of depressive symptoms relative to peers (between-person association) had poorer adherence and glycemic control (i.e., higher HbA1c) on average. Within-person fluctuations in depressive symptoms were significantly associated with adherence: greater increases in depressive symptoms (relative to adolescents' own average) were associated with greater deteriorations in adherence. There was not a significant within-person effect of depressive symptoms on glycemic control. Conclusions: The transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood is particularly challenging for those with T1D. The findings that individuals with greater depressive symptoms have poorer adherence and glycemic control relative to those with lower depressive symptoms, and that increases in depressive symptoms are associated with declines in adherence, highlight the importance of screening and monitoring depressive symptoms during this life transition.","author_address":"[Baucom, Katherine J.

We aimed to investigate whether a presurgical expressive writing intervention could improve surgical wound healing. Method: Seventy-six patients undergoing elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized either to write emotionally about traumatic life events (expressive writing) or to write objectively about how they spent their time (daily activities writing) for 20 min a day for 3 consecutive days beginning 2 weeks prior to surgery. A wound drain was inserted into a laparoscopic port site and wound fluid analyzed for proinflammatory cytokines collected over 24 hr postoperatively. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene tubes were inserted into separate laparoscopic port sites during surgery and removed after 14 days. Tubes were analyzed for hydroxyproline deposition (the primary outcome), a major component of collagen and marker of healing. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Results: Patients who wrote about daily activities had significantly more hydroxyproline than did expressive writing patients, t(34) = -2.43, p=.020, 95% confidence interval [-4.61, -0.41], and higher tumor necrosis factor-alpha, t(29) = -2.42, p=.022, 95% confidence interval [-0.42, -0.04]. Perceived stress significantly reduced in both groups after surgery. Conclusions: Expressive writing prior to bariatric surgery was not effective at increasing hydroxyproline at the wound site 14 days after surgery. However, writing about daily activities did predict such an increase. Future research needs to replicate these findings and investigate generalizability to other surgical groups.","author_address":"[Koschwanez, Heidi; Robinson, Hayley; Broadbent, Elizabeth] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol Med, Auckland, New Zealand;

The current study extends this research to real life, and examines whether daily physical activity attenuates negative affect that occurs in response to naturally occurring daily stressors. Method: The current study used data from the second wave of the National Study of Daily Experiences, a sub-study of the second wave of the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS-II) of 2,022 individuals aged 33-84 questioned nightly for eight consecutive days about their general affect and affective responses to stressful events and their engagement in physical activity. Results: Results indicated that while negative affect is significantly elevated on days with stressful events compared to days free of events in all individuals, these effects are attenuated in those who remain physically active when compared to those who were underactive. This was also true for any day participants were physically active. Importantly, negative affect in response to any specific stressor was reduced the closer in time that the stressor occurred to the bout of exercise in underactive participants, while, in active participants, negative affect in response to any stressor remained low throughout the entire day that participants reported that they were active. Conclusion: Given the significant mental and physical health implications of elevated affective reactivity observed in previous studies, the current study sheds further light on the importance of remaining physically active in times of stress.","author_address":"[Puterman, Eli; Beauchamp, Mark R.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Kinesiol, 104-2176 Hlth Sci Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Weiss, Jordan] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mogle, Jacqueline] Penn State Univ, Coll Nursing, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Almeida, David M.] Penn State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","reprint_address":"Puterman, E (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Kinesiol, 104-2176 Hlth Sci Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.","author_email":"eli.puterman@ubc.ca","funding":"National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health [R00 HL 109247]; Population Research Training Grant - National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NIH T32 HD007242]; National Institute of Aging (NIA) [P01-AG020166, R01-AG019239]; John D. and Catherine T.

Episodic memory was assessed using the old-new face recognition paradigm in which memory for younger and older faces was tested. Results: Compared to younger adults, older adults reported being less physically and sociocognitively active while engaging in more passive behaviors such as TV viewing. A positive association was observed between physical activity and episodic memory for young adults but not for older adults. Interestingly, TV viewing was negatively associated with episodic memory in older adults but not younger adults. No relationship was found between sociocognitive activity and episodic memory for either younger or older adults. Although the own-age effect was observed for older adults, face age did not interact with lifestyle activities. Conclusion: The positive cognitive benefits of physical activity extend to younger adults; however, the interplay between physical activity and cognition may differ across the life span. Furthermore, TV viewing may be particularly detrimental to cognitive performance later in life.","author_address":"[Heisz, Jennifer J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Vandermorris, Susan; McIntosh, Anthony R.; Ryan, Jennifer D.] Baycrest Hlth Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wu, Johnny; McIntosh, Anthony R.; Ryan, Jennifer D.] Rotman Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada","reprint_address":"Heisz, JJ (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Kinesiol, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.","author_email":"heiszjj@mcmaster.ca","funding":"Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canada Research Chairs Program","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":34.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/hea0000046","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000346920200009","pg":"83-88","author_last_WOS":"Heisz","author_first_WOS":"Jennifer J.","published":"JAN 2015","pdf_filename":"Heisz_HealthPsych_2015_J1xJ","claim2_abstract":"A positiveassociation was observed between physical activity and episodic memory for young adults but not forolder adults.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1466","claim2_box":"(x1: 431.26 y1: 357.34) (x2: 168.98 y2: 381.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Young adults who were more physicallyactive had better face memory, consistent with the existing liter-ature showing a direct benefit of exercise on episodic memory inyounger adult populations (Pereira et al., 2007).","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"2866","claim3a_box":"(x1: 401.53 y1: 450.88) (x2: 484.66 y2: 488.00)","claim3b_testspec":"The experiment took place during a 1.5-hr session.

It remains unclear, however, whether these early unions 1) are associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization, 2) interrupt victim continuity or victim-offender overlap through protective and prosocial bonds, or 3) are inconsequential. By using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 11,928; 18-34 years of age), we examine competing hypotheses for the effect of early union timing among victims of youth violence (n = 2,479)differentiating across victimization only, perpetration only, and mutually combative relationships and considering variation by gender. The results from multinomial logistic regression models indicate that YVV increases the risk of IPV victimization in first unions, regardless of union timing; the null effect of timing indicates that delaying union formation would not reduce youth victims' increased risk of continued victimization. Gender-stratified analyses reveal that earlier unions can protect women against IPV perpetration, but this is partly the result of an increased risk of IPV victimization. The findings suggest that YVV has significant transformative consequences, leading to subsequent victimization by coresidential partners, and this association might be exacerbated among female victims who form early unions. We conclude by discussing directions for future research.","author_address":"[Kuhl, Danielle C.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Sociol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Warner, David F.; Warner, Tara D.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Sociol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","reprint_address":"Kuhl, DC (reprint author), Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Sociol, Williams Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.","author_email":"dckuhl@bgsu.edu","funding":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921]; Center for Family and Demographic Research, Bowling Green State University - Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R24HD050959-07]","publisher":"WILEY-BLACKWELL","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":53.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12075","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000360081200005","pg":"427-456","author_last_WOS":"Kuhl","author_first_WOS":"Danielle C.","published":"AUG 2015","pdf_filename":"KUHL_Criminology_2015_qlzw","claim2_abstract":"The resultsfrom multinomial logistic regression models indicate that YVV increases the risk ofIPV victimization in first unions, regardless of union timing;","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1097","claim2_box":"(x1: 379.25 y1: 320.78) (x2: 323.81 y2: 349.43)","claim3a_concretehyp":"As the results from table 4 suggest, YVV is significantly associated with an increasedrisk of victimization only IPV, relative to being in a nonviolent union, independentof union timing.","claim3a_pg":"20","claim3a_start":"1532","claim3a_box":"(x1: 50.34 y1: 289.80) (x2: 112.18 y2: 318.44)","claim3b_testspec":"By using data from the National LongitudinalStudy of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 11,928; 18\u201334 years of age), we examinecompeting hypotheses for the effect of early union timing among victims of youth vi-olence (n = 2,479)\u2014differentiating across victimization only, perpetration only, andmutually combative relationships and considering variation by gender. | The relative risk of experiencing IPV victimization in first unions, com-pared with being in a nonviolent union","claim3b_pg":"1 | 18","claim3b_start":"735 | 454","claim3b_box":"(x1: 227.85 y1: 272.97) (x2: 375.02 y2: 325.51) | (x1: 114.16 y1: 122.42) (x2: 207.45 y2: 139.11)","claim4_inftest":".327\u2217\u2217","claim4_pg":"19","claim4_start":"584","claim4_box":"(x1: 349.00 y1: 203.44) (x2: 369.18 y2: 204.32)","corr_author":"Danielle C.

Using multi-level, multi-source data from 185 employees nested within 43 teams and their team leaders, we find that employees who hold central positions in the formal, workflow network in the team are more likely to speak up with ideas and suggestions. This relationship is weakened when they are central to the team's avoidance network. In addition to employees' own network positions, team leaders' positions in such informal networks also play a role in qualifying the employee workflow centrality voice relationship. Specifically, the positive relationship between employees' workflow centrality and their voice is strengthened when their team leaders occupy central positions in the friendship network, but is weakened when they are central to the avoidance network in the team.

Prior work has found that highly confident individuals attained higher status regardless of whether their confidence was justified by actual ability (Anderson, Brion, Moore, & Kennedy, 2012). However, those initial findings were observed in contexts where individuals' actual abilities were unlikely to be discovered by others. What happens to overconfident individuals when others learn how good they truly are at the task? If those individuals are penalized with status demotions, then the status costs might outweigh the status benefits of overconfidence - thereby casting doubt on the benefits of overconfidence. In three studies, we found that group members did not react negatively to individuals revealed as overconfident, and in fact still viewed them positively. Therefore, the status benefits of overconfidence outweighed any possible status costs, lending further support to the status-enhancement theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas feelings of ownership caused individuals to embrace the adoption of suggestions that expanded upon their possessions (additive change), it simultaneously made them shun the adoption of suggestions that shrank them (subtractive change) (Studies 1 and 2).

Our primary question is how ethnicity, social class, nativity, and family composition affect where people live. Segregation is usually studied one dimension at a time, but these social differences are interrelated, and thus a multivariate approach is needed to understand their effects. We find that ethnicity is the main basis of local residential sorting, while occupational standing and, to a lesser degree, family life cycle and nativity also are significant. A second concern is the geographic scale of neighborhoods: in this study, the geographic area within which the characteristics of potential neighbors matter in locational outcomes of individuals. Studies of segregation typically use a single spatial scale, often one determined by the availability of administrative data. We take advantage of a unique data set containing the address and geo-referenced location of every resident. We conclude that it is the most local scale that offers the best prediction of people's similarity to their neighbors. Adding information at larger scales minimally improves prediction of the person's location. The 1880 neighborhoods of Newark, New Jersey, were formed as individuals located themselves among similar neighbors on a single street segment.","author_address":"[Logan, John R.] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Box 1916, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Shin, Hyoung-jin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Sociol, 1370 Sankyuk Dong, Daegu 702701, South Korea","reprint_address":"Logan, JR (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Box 1916, Providence, RI 02912 USA.","author_email":"john_logan@brown.edu","funding":"National Science Foundation [0647584]; National Institutes of Health [1R01HD049493-01A2]; Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University [R24 HD041020]","publisher":"SPRINGER","publisher_address":"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0070-3370","eISSN":"1533-7790","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":53.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1007\/s13524-016-0487-5","WOS_category":"Demography","category":"Demography","accession_number":"WOS:000382995700009","pg":"1085-1108","author_last_WOS":"Logan","author_first_WOS":"John R.","published":"AUG 2016","pdf_filename":"Logan_Demography_2016_WN3V","claim2_abstract":"We find that ethnicity is the main basis of local residential sorting,while occupational standing and, to a lesser degree, family life cycle and nativity also aresignificant.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"656","claim2_box":"(x1: 142.17 y1: 287.15) (x2: 92.04 y2: 316.47)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Newark, New Jersey, in 1880 | Newark in this period, people lived near similarpeople at a very local scale,","claim3a_pg":"2 | 20","claim3a_start":"356 | 2947","claim3a_box":"(x1: 113.83 y1: 108.06) (x2: 235.23 y2: 113.45) | (x1: 204.56 y1: 526.49) (x2: 163.77 y2: 543.85)","claim3b_testspec":"The multivariate analysis is based on discrete choice models for residential location(Duncombe et al. 2001; Bruch and Mare 2006, 2012; McFadden 1973, 1978; Quillian2015).

The study presented here was designed to examine whether there were pain processing differences in Native Americans relative to non-Hispanic White controls. Methods: Participants were healthy, pain-free Native Americans (n = 22, 8 females) and non-Hispanic Whites (n = 20, 7 females). Pain processing was assessed from electric pain threshold\/tolerance, ischemia pain threshold\/tolerance, nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFR; an electrophysiological measure of spinal nociception), pain ratings of suprathreshold electric stimuli, and temporal summation of pain and NFR (an electrophysiological measure of spinal cord sensitization). The institutional review board approved all procedures. Results: Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Native Americans had dampened pain perception (higher ischemia pain tolerance, higher electric pain threshold, lower ratings of electric stimuli). Additionally, temporal summation of NFR was reduced in Native Americans, suggesting sensitization was reduced at the spinal level. Conclusions: Findings suggest Native Americans have dampened pain and pain signaling, perhaps due to overactivation of descending pain inhibition mechanisms. Given research indicating that other ethnic groups at risk for chronic pain (e.g., African Americans) show enhanced pain and enhanced central sensitization on experimental pain measures, chronic pain risk could be different for Native Americans, thus emphasizing the need for different treatment interventions.","author_address":"[Palit, Shreela; Kerr, Kara L.; Kuhn, Bethany L.; Terry, Ellen L.; DelVentura, Jennifer L.; Bartley, Emily J.; Shadlow, Joanna O.; Rhudy, Jamie L.] Univ Tulsa, Dept Psychol, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA","reprint_address":"Rhudy, JL (reprint author), Univ Tulsa, Dept Psychol, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.","author_email":"jamie-rhudy@utulsa.edu","funding":"Psi Chi; National Honors Society for Psychology; University of Tulsa Office of Research and Sponsored Programs","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":32.0,"issue":"11.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0031057","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000326851700003","pg":"1127-1136","author_last_WOS":"Palit","author_first_WOS":"Shreela","published":"NOV 2013","pdf_filename":"Palit_HealthPsych_2013_dOdV","claim2_abstract":"Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Native Americans had dampened pain perception (higher ischemiapain tolerance, higher electric pain threshold, lower ratings of electric stimuli).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1126","claim2_box":"(x1: 129.00 y1: 266.04) (x2: 388.57 y2: 280.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"nociceptive flexion reflex,NFR | Native Americans had higher electric pain thresh-olds, higher ischemia pain tolerances, and lower ratings of suprath-reshold electric stimuli (during NFR threshold and temporal sum-mation testing)","claim3a_pg":"1 | 6","claim3a_start":"3677 | 3392","claim3a_box":"(x1: 447.24 y1: 517.98) (x2: 323.50 y2: 534.00) | (x1: 363.71 y1: 493.98) (x2: 363.52 y2: 532.00)","claim3b_testspec":"The \b level was set at p \t .05 (two-tailed) for all analyses.

In Study 2, a national sample of youth ages 10-14 years (N = 6,522) was surveyed by telephone; exposure to tobacco\/alcohol use in movies was assessed. Good self-control was measured in both studies.

Results: In Study 1, the effect of tobacco\/alcohol advertising on predisposition for substance use was lower among persons scoring higher on good self-control. In Study 2, the effect of movie smoking\/alcohol exposure on adolescent tobacco\/alcohol use was lower, concurrently and prospectively, among persons scoring higher on good self-control. Moderation occurred primarily through reducing the effect of movie exposure on positive smoking\/alcohol expectancies and the effect of expectancies on adolescent use; some evidence for moderation of social processes was also noted.

Whereas the separation properties of all three diversity sources, as well as the variety properties of openness diversity, are evident in newly-formed groups, the variety properties of agreeableness and ethnic diversity are only manifest in mature groups.

However, past research has focused on public goods of fixed and known value, for which the added value of the produced public good is obvious. Research has largely ignored public goods whose eventual value is uncertain at the time contribution decisions are made. Two studies explored the effects of outcome variance on individuals' contributions to a public good and their reasons for contributing. Contributions were negatively affected by loss prospects in the distribution of possible outcomes. Further, loss prospects directly discouraged contributions because of loss aversion, and indirectly discouraged contributions by fueling fears that others would not contribute. The negative effects of loss prospects were stronger when social uncertainty was low. Implications for social dilemma research and the effective management of collective action are discussed.

Participants also evaluated the utilities of possible outcomes more positively when the outcomes could follow only from the preferred alternative and more negatively when they could follow only from the competing alternative. Such circular reasoning is antithetical to the normative consequentialist principles underlying decision analysis.

The relative education hypothesis posits that when college degrees are rare, individuals with more education have less competition to enter highly-skilled occupations. When college degrees are more common, there may not be enough highly-skilled jobs to go around; some college-educated workers lose out to others and are pushed into less-skilled jobs. Using new measurements of occupation-level verbal, quantitative, and analytic skills, this study tests the changing effect of education on skill utilization across 70 years of birth cohorts from 1971 to 2010, net of all other age, period, and cohort trends. Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and college-educated workers are at greater risk for underemployment in less cognitively demanding occupations. This raises questions about the sources of rising income inequality, skill utilization across the working life course, occupational sex segregation, and how returns to education have changed across different life domains.","author_address":"[Horowitz, Jonathan] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 123 W Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA","reprint_address":"Horowitz, J (reprint author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 123 W Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.","author_email":"jonathanhorowitzresearch@unc.edu","funding":"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [T32 HD007168, P2C HD050924]","publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-1224","eISSN":"1939-8271","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":83.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0003122418785371","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000439348300006","pg":"771-801","author_last_WOS":"Horowitz","author_first_WOS":"Jonathan","published":"AUG 2018","pdf_filename":"Horowitz_AmSocioRev_2018_exBp","claim2_abstract":"Higher-education expansion erodes the value of a college degree, and  college-educated  workers  are  at  greater  risk  for  underemployment  in  less  cognitively demanding occupations","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"2626","claim2_box":"(x1: 163.27 y1: 290.71) (x2: 150.68 y2: 318.01)","claim3a_concretehyp":"First, we  would  expect  individuals  with  college degrees  to  work  in  less  cognitively  demand-ing jobs when more of their peers have gradu-ated  from  college | thus, although individuals with col-lege  experience  use  verbal  skills  more  than those  without  a  college  background  do,  this advantage  declines  as  the  proportion  of college-educated individuals increases","claim3a_pg":"6 | 15","claim3a_start":"3082 | 70","claim3a_box":"(x1: 413.65 y1: 284.40) (x2: 323.76 y2: 337.94) | (x1: 90.93 y1: 469.37) (x2: 205.84 y2: 522.91)","claim3b_testspec":"I develop  occupational  skill  ratings  using O*NET data alongside a measure of substan-tive  significance  to  interpret  the  effect  of education  on  skill  utilization  as  the  higher-education  system  expands.

In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has partly displaced not only family and school, but also neighborhood, friends, and the workplace as venues for meeting partners. The Internet increasingly allows Americans to meet and form relationships with perfect strangers, that is, people with whom they had no previous social tie. Individuals who face a thin market for potential partners, such as gays, lesbians, and middle-aged heterosexuals, are especially likely to meet partners online. One result of the increasing importance of the Internet in meeting partners is that adults with Internet access at home are substantially more likely to have partners, even after controlling for other factors.

This secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial examined persuasion, pressure, and indirect social control among cohabiting couples and the effect of these supports on weight loss. Methods: Couples (N-Couples = 130) were randomized to either Weight Watchers (WW) or a self-guided control condition (SG). Only one member of each couple received the intervention; the other member of the couple was untreated. Couples were weighed and completed study measures at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Results: Dyadic multilevel models examined BMI change and differences across role (treated participant\/untreated spouse) and condition (WW\/SG). Prescriptive support predicted BMI change for treated participants in the WW condition only. For treated WW participants, there was no significant decrease in BMI when pressure was high (+1SD), B = -.25. p = .22, but a significant decrease when pressure was low (0), B = -.96, p < .001. Additionally, high levels of indirect social control (+ 1SD) predicted greater decreases in BMI compared to low (- 1SD) indirect social control, B = -.91, p < .001, and, B = -.41. p < .01. Conclusions: Considering both the type and context of support for weight management is worthwhile. Intervention participants had access to treatment resources that may have engendered more effective responses to spouses' concerns or a sense of obligation to their spouse (indirect social control), whereas pressures to lose weight while engaged in treatment-may have undermined behavior-change efforts.","author_address":"[Cornelius, Talea] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Gettens, Katelyn; Lenz, Erin; Gorin, Amy A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Wojtanowski, Alexis C.; Foster, Gary D.] Weight Watchers Int Inc, New York, NY USA; [Foster, Gary D.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","reprint_address":"Cornelius, T (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Behav Cardiovasc Hlth, 622 West 168th St PH-319, New York, NY 10032 USA.","author_email":"tmc2184@cumc.columbia.edu","funding":"Weight Watchers International, Inc.;  [T32MH074387]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":37.0,"issue":"8.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/hea0000630","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000442396700008","pg":"775-781","author_last_WOS":"Cornelius","author_first_WOS":"Talea","published":"AUG 2018","pdf_filename":"Cornelius_HealthPsych_2018_xkZJ","claim2_abstract":"For treated WWparticipants, there was no significant decrease in BMI when pressure was high (\u00031SD), B \u0002 \u0004.25, p \u0002.22, but a significant decrease when pressure was low (0), B \u0002 \u0004.96, p \u0005 .001.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1371","claim2_box":"(x1: 409.81 y1: 365.54) (x2: 383.53 y2: 390.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Stated otherwise, higher levels of pres-sure were detrimental to weight loss.","claim3a_pg":"4","claim3a_start":"3430","claim3a_box":"(x1: 402.66 y1: 352.98) (x2: 442.98 y2: 369.00)","claim3b_testspec":"body mass index (BMI) | Toaccount for this interdependence, multilevel models were spec-ified | In this model, absolute BMI is the outcome, andthe coefficient for time indicates the predicted change betweeneach assessment.

Method: Participants were 2,098 girls enrolled in the ongoing Pittsburgh Girls Study, who were between the ages of 12 and 15 years in 2008, and their primary caregivers. The study was conducted in the 2 years after the deployment of the first HPV vaccine approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Primary caregivers were asked about HPV vaccine uptake. Girls were interviewed about pubertal development and sexually intimate behavior. Results: Approximately 60% of the girls had initiated the HPV vaccine in the past year. Among the hypothesized predictors of initiation, African-American race decreased the likelihood and level of sexually intimate behavior in the previous year increased the likelihood of uptake. Controlling for receipt of public assistance, African-American girls were close to 40% less likely to be vaccinated than European-American girls. Conclusion: Racial disparities in use of preventive interventions such as the HPV vaccine exist. Lack of information about public financing of the vaccine, timing of vaccination relative to sexual activity, and perceptions of preventive value may limit uptake among those at highest risk for infection and negative sequelae from infection. Further research to probe knowledge and attitudes toward HPV vaccination and the impact of the media on vaccine initiation and uptake may reveal specific targets of intervention.","author_address":"[Keenan, Kate] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hipwell, Alison; Stepp, Stephanie] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","reprint_address":"Keenan, K (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat MC 3077, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","author_email":"kekeenan@uchicago.edu","funding":"National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH56630, K01 MH71790]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":31.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0026812","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000299261200005","pg":"31-34","author_last_WOS":"Keenan","author_first_WOS":"Kate","published":"JAN 2012","pdf_filename":"Keenan_HealthPsych_2012_74r9","claim2_abstract":"Controlling for receipt of public assistance, African-Americangirls were close to 40% less likely to be vaccinated than European-American girls.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1010","claim2_box":"(x1: 261.47 y1: 263.34) (x2: 399.13 y2: 277.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Controlling for receipt of publicassistance, African-American girls were close to 40% less likelythan European-American girls to be vaccinated.","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"1071","claim3a_box":"(x1: 173.41 y1: 459.17) (x2: 224.71 y2: 485.70)","claim3b_testspec":"Logistic regressions were computed to test the effects of race,age, poverty, pubertal status, and sexual behavior on vaccineinitiation in the following year, using PASW Statistics 18 (PASWStatistics 18).

To understand the process of relapse on patch, we investigated differences in the antecedents (withdrawal, setting, triggers) of lapse episodes experienced on high-dose (35 mg) nicotine patches versus placebo. Design: Participants were smokers who lapsed during a randomized, double-blind trial of active patches (n = 100) versus placebo (n = 85). Participants used electronic diaries to monitor their smoking, affect, and activities in real time for 5 weeks during their cessation attempt. Results: We analyzed 490 lapse episodes (active: 266; placebo: 224). Lapses on nicotine patch were characterized by significantly lower positive affect and higher negative affect than placebo lapses. Participants treated with high-dose patch were also significantly more likely to lapse in situations involving little or no craving. Situational antecedents of lapses on patch resembled those on placebo. Conclusion: The results suggest that treatment with patch may set a higher threshold for affective stimuli to provoke lapses, but does not change the proximal cues that trigger lapses. This suggests that behavioral relapse-prevention strategies developed for unmedicated smokers should also apply to those treated with nicotine patch.","author_address":"[Ferguson, Stuart G.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Pharm, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ferguson, Stuart G.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Res Inst, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Shiffman, Saul] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","reprint_address":"Ferguson, SG (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Pharm, Private Bag 26, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.","author_email":"stuart.ferguson@utas.edu.au","funding":"National Institute on Drug Abuse [DA06084]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2010.0,"volume":29.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0019367","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000280350600007","pg":"358-366","author_last_WOS":"Ferguson","author_first_WOS":"Stuart G.","published":"JUL 2010","pdf_filename":"Ferguson_HealthPsych_2010_aq21","claim2_abstract":"Participants treated with high-dose patch were also signifi-cantly more likely to lapse in situations involving little or no craving.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"920","claim2_box":"(x1: 272.19 y1: 251.64) (x2: 357.33 y2: 266.10)","claim3a_concretehyp":"we compared lapses occurring on patch treatmentwith those on placebo | Wehypothesized that lapses on patch would be more likely to occur inthe absence (or near absence) of craving.","claim3a_pg":"2 | 2","claim3a_start":"3339 | 3446","claim3a_box":"(x1: 111.13 y1: 671.07) (x2: 130.82 y2: 687.09) | (x1: 276.23 y1: 682.07) (x2: 197.29 y2: 709.09)","claim3b_testspec":"To test the effect of patch on the likelihood of \u201cautomatic\u201d lapses,we compared the patch groups on the frequency of lapses that werepreceded by very low levels of craving | As each participant could contribute multiple observations, alltreatment comparisons were conducted using generalized estima-tion equations | For presentation, continuous variables (craving and withdrawalseverity) are shown as least-squares means (which take into ac-count the clustering of the data),","claim3b_pg":"4 | 4 | 5","claim3b_start":"4690 | 5622 | 185","claim3b_box":"(x1: 306.68 y1: 316.08) (x2: 450.94 y2: 343.10) | (x1: 315.68 y1: 481.08) (x2: 357.57 y2: 508.10) | (x1: 57.68 y1: 110.08) (x2: 175.50 y2: 137.10)","claim4_inftest":"Only 6.9% of the lapse events analyzed met ourcriteria for very low prelapse craving levels, but, as hypothesized,these were more likely to occur on active patches (effect size \u00013.5; see Table 1). | Nicotine patch (n \u0001 266) Placebo (n \u0001 224) | Low craving lapses, % [95% CI] 10.2 [6.5, 13.8] 3.1 [0.9, 5.4] 3.5 .03 | Effect sizes are odds ratios for the categoricalvariables and Cohen\u2019s d scores for the continuous variables.","claim4_pg":"5 | 6 | 6 | 7","claim4_start":"1970 | 89 | 728 | 6011","claim4_box":"(x1: 104.61 y1: 513.38) (x2: 113.14 y2: 551.40) | (x1: 247.60 y1: 125.64) (x2: 428.12 y2: 130.10) | (x1: 48.68 y1: 251.14) (x2: 546.18 y2: 255.60) | (x1: 401.23 y1: 239.64) (x2: 246.15 y2: 253.10)","corr_author":"Saul Shiffman","corr_email":"shiffman@pinneyassociates.com","version":1},{"title_CR":"Places and Preferences: A Longitudinal Analysis of Self-Selection and Contextual Effects","author_last_CR":"Gallego","author_first_CR":"Aina","pub_year_CR":2016,"DOI_CR":"10.1017\/s0007123414000337","ISSN_CR":"0007-1234","publication_CR":"British Journal of Political Science","pub_short":"BritJournPoliSci","paper_id":"Xb2v","author_full":"Gallego, Aina; Buscha, Franz; Sturgis, Patrick; Oberski, Daniel","title_WOS":"Places and Preferences: A Longitudinal Analysis of Self-Selection and Contextual Effects","publication_WOS":"BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE","language":"English","keywords":null,"keywords_plus":"GENERAL-ELECTION; MOBILITY EXPERIMENT; BRITISH ELECTORATE; GREAT-BRITAIN; SOCIAL-CLASS; PANEL-DATA; NEIGHBORHOOD; VOTE; POLITICS; MODELS","abstract":"Contextual theories of political behaviour assert that the contexts in which people live influence their political beliefs and vote choices.

In both effects, increases in preference involve enhanced familiarity. Prominent memory theories assume that familiarity depends on a match between the target and similar items in memory. These theories predict that when individual items are weakly learned, their blends (morphs) should be relatively familiar, and thus liked-a beauty-in-averageness effect (BiA). However, when individual items are strongly learned, they are also more distinguishable. This \"differentiation\" hypothesis predicts that with strongly encoded items, familiarity (and thus, preference) for the blend will be relatively lower than individual items-an ugliness-in-averageness effect (UiA). We tested this novel theoretical prediction in 5 experiments. Experiment 1 showed that with weak learning, facial morphs were more attractive than contributing individuals (BiA effect). Experiments 2A and 2B demonstrated that when participants first strongly learned a subset of individual faces (either in a face-name memory task or perceptual-tracking task), morphs of trained individuals were less attractive than the trained individuals (UiA effect). Experiment 3 showed that changes in familiarity for the trained morph (rather than interstimulus conflict) drove the UiA effect. Using a within-subjects design, Experiment 4 mapped out the transition from BiA to UiA solely as a function of memory training. Finally, computational modeling using a well-known memory framework (REM) illustrated the familiarity transition observed in Experiment 4. Overall, these results highlight how memory processes illuminate classic and modern social preference phenomena.","author_address":"[Carr, Evan W.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Carr, Evan W.; Winkielman, Piotr] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Huber, David E.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pecher, Diane; Zeelenberg, Rene] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Halberstadt, Jamin] Univ Otago, Dept Psychol, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Winkielman, Piotr] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Behav Sci Grp, Warwick, England; [Winkielman, Piotr] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland","reprint_address":"Carr, EW (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Management, Columbia Business Sch, 3022 Broadway,7L Uris, New York, NY 10027 USA.","author_email":"ewc2138@columbia.edu","funding":"United States Department of Defense (DoD), via the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship [32 CFR 168a]; Army Research Office (ARO), via the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship [32 CFR 168a]; UCSD Academic Senate Grant; NSF [BCS-1232676]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-3514","eISSN":"1939-1315","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":112.0,"issue":"6.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/pspa0000083","WOS_category":"Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000401329800001","pg":"787-812","author_last_WOS":"Carr","author_first_WOS":"Evan W.","published":"JUN 2017","pdf_filename":"Carr_JournPerSocPsy_2017_12pD","claim2_abstract":"Experiment 1 showed that withweak learning, facial morphs were more attractive than contributing individuals (BiA effect).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1351","claim2_box":"(x1: 365.06 y1: 347.54) (x2: 438.03 y2: 362.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"that when many individual exemplars arepresented without strong learning of any of the specific exemplars,the morphs of those exemplars would be rated as more attractiveand familiar","claim3a_pg":"5","claim3a_start":"1356","claim3a_box":"(x1: 134.11 y1: 355.98) (x2: 93.94 y2: 395.50)","claim3b_testspec":"weused mixed-effects modeling via restricted maximum likelihood. | To obtain p value estimates forfixed-effects, we used Type III Satterthwaite approximations","claim3b_pg":"5 | 5","claim3b_start":"3237 | 4092","claim3b_box":"(x1: 535.55 y1: 96.13) (x2: 546.06 y2: 112.29) | (x1: 423.02 y1: 263.34) (x2: 546.08 y2: 279.50)","claim4_inftest":"As pre-dicted, participants rated morphs as more attractive (M \u0002 4.32,SD \u0002 1.17) than individuals (M \u0002 4.20, SD \u0002 1.15), F(1,150.00) \u0002 26.42, p \u0003 .001","claim4_pg":"5","claim4_start":"4913","claim4_box":"(x1: 517.04 y1: 408.16) (x2: 403.70 y2: 446.59)","corr_author":"Evan W.

This article innovates, first, by examining an unusually broad set of measures (from the 2004 GSS) tapping national identification, ethnocultural and civic criteria for national membership, domain-specific national pride, and invidious comparisons to other nations, thus providing a fuller depiction of Americans' national self-understanding. Second, we use latent class analysis to explore heterogeneity, partitioning the sample into classes characterized by distinctive patterns of attitudes. Conventional distinctions between ethnocultural and civic nationalism describe just about half of the U.S. population and do not account for the unexpectedly low levels of national pride found among respondents who hold restrictive definitions of American nationhood. A subset of primarily younger and well-educated Americans lacks any strong form of patriotic sentiment; a larger class, primarily older and less well educated, embraces every form of nationalist sentiment. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and partisan identification, these classes vary significantly in attitudes toward ethnic minorities, immigration, and national sovereignty. Finally, using comparable data from 1996 and 2012, we find structural continuity and distributional change in national sentiments over a period marked by terrorist attacks, war, economic crisis, and political contention.","author_address":"[Bonikowski, Bart] Harvard Univ, Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [DiMaggio, Paul] NYU, Sociol, New York, NY 10003 USA","reprint_address":"Bonikowski, B (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, 636 William James Hall, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","author_email":"bonikowski@fas.harvard.edu","funding":"Russell Sage Foundation","publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","publisher_address":"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0003-1224","eISSN":"1939-8271","pub_year_WOS":2016.0,"volume":81.0,"issue":"5.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1177\/0003122416663683","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000385492100005","pg":"949-980","author_last_WOS":"Bonikowski","author_first_WOS":"Bart","published":"OCT 2016","pdf_filename":"Bonikowski_AmSocioRev_2016_ql97","claim2_abstract":"Second,  we  use  latent  class  analysis  to  explore  heterogeneity,  partitioning  the  sample  into classes characterized by distinctive patterns of attitudes. | Controlling  for sociodemographic characteristics and partisan identification, these classes vary significantly in  attitudes  toward  ethnic  minorities,  immigration,  and  national  sovereignty.","claim2_pg":"1 | 1","claim2_start":"2105 | 2779","claim2_box":"(x1: 51.49 y1: 301.71) (x2: 286.82 y2: 318.01) | (x1: 372.80 y1: 367.69) (x2: 374.19 y2: 395.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Ardent nationalists were also significantly more likely than  creedal  nationalists | to agree that immigrants cause crime","claim3a_pg":"19 | 19","claim3a_start":"2369 | 2493","claim3a_box":"(x1: 407.26 y1: 92.40) (x2: 350.13 y2: 121.94) | (x1: 315.70 y1: 128.40) (x2: 274.37 y2: 145.94)","claim3b_testspec":"We begin by using latent class analysis (LCA) to  identify  classes  (subsets  of  respondents) with  distinctive  response  patterns  across  all the  survey  items  measuring  nationalist  atti-tudes. | All  the  models  use  a  three-step  ordinal-logit  LCA  model  for  distal outcomes with a correction for misclassifica-tion (Bakk et al. 2013). | Note: Data are from the 2004 GSS.

The reorganization of work in corporate America over the last two decades provides a test case. Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregation leads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. This study finds that when employers adopt popular team and training programs that increase cross-functional collaboration, ascriptive inequality declines. Similar programs that do not transcend job boundaries do not lead to such increases. The results point to different effects at the intersection of gender and race.","author_address":"Univ Arizona, Dept Sociol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","reprint_address":"Kalev, A (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Sociol, Social Sci Bldg,Room 400,1145 E S Campus Dr, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","author_email":"akalev@email.arizona.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","publisher_address":"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0002-9602","eISSN":"1537-5390","pub_year_WOS":2009.0,"volume":114.0,"issue":"6.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1086\/597175","WOS_category":"Sociology","category":"Sociology","accession_number":"WOS:000266286200001","pg":"1591-1643","author_last_WOS":"Kalev","author_first_WOS":"Alexandra","published":"MAY 2009","pdf_filename":"Kalev_AmJournSocio_2009_ADmY","claim2_abstract":"This studyfinds that when employers adopt popular team and training pro-grams that increase cross-functional collaboration, ascriptive in-equality declines.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1024","claim2_box":"(x1: 416.37 y1: 383.68) (x2: 246.33 y2: 420.56)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Both self-directed work teams and cross-trainingprograms have significant positive effects on the odds that managers arewhite women, black women, and black men and a negative effect onwhite men\u2019s odds of being in management.","claim3a_pg":"26","claim3a_start":"1632","claim3a_box":"(x1: 254.56 y1: 453.51) (x2: 333.06 y2: 494.88)","claim3b_testspec":"Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organi-zations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregationleads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. | The outcome variables are the proportions of white men, white women,black women, and black men among managers in an establishment, ascalculated from the EEO-1 data. | I thus use seemingly unrelated regres-sion, a generalized least squares (GLS) estimation that takes into accountthis covariance between the errors (Zellner 1962; Felmlee and Hargens1988).12 | In addition to including in the analysis an expansive series ofcontrol variables that may affect the outcome variable, I address thisconcern by using a fixed-effects specification for establishment and year","claim3b_pg":"1 | 19 | 25 | 25","claim3b_start":"838 | 1563 | 148 | 724","claim3b_box":"(x1: 173.66 y1: 362.76) (x2: 414.57 y2: 389.18) | (x1: 149.75 y1: 438.57) (x2: 294.88 y2: 467.98) | (x1: 296.59 y1: 161.62) (x2: 180.89 y2: 199.00) | (x1: 186.05 y1: 269.21) (x2: 460.64 y2: 298.62)","claim4_inftest":"\u0001.081** | Afterthe adoption of self-directed work teams, the odds that managers arewhite men decline by an average of 8%,","claim4_pg":"27 | 29","claim4_start":"282 | 1045","claim4_box":"(x1: 311.29 y1: 232.65) (x2: 339.83 y2: 236.85) | (x1: 438.60 y1: 340.94) (x2: 314.73 y2: 370.35)","corr_author":"Alexandra Kalev","corr_email":"akalev@email.arizona.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"Revolution, Reform, and Status Inheritance: Urban China, 1949\u20131996","author_last_CR":"Walder","author_first_CR":"Andrew\u00a0G.","pub_year_CR":2009,"DOI_CR":"10.1086\/595949","ISSN_CR":"0002-9602","publication_CR":"American Journal of Sociology","pub_short":"AmJournSocio","paper_id":"qxe7","author_full":"Walder, Andrew G.; Hu, Songhua","title_WOS":"Revolution, Reform, and Status Inheritance: Urban China, 1949-1996","publication_WOS":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY","language":"English","keywords":null,"keywords_plus":"COMMUNIST-PARTY MEMBERSHIP; REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; MARKET TRANSITION; INCOME INEQUALITY; CULTURAL-REVOLUTION; EARNINGS INEQUALITY; REGIONAL-VARIATION; RUSSIA; MOBILITY; STRATIFICATION","abstract":"Do regime change and market reform disrupt patterns of intergenerational mobility?

Primary outcomes were readiness to seek information or talk with family and friends about mental health treatment, readiness to seek mental health treatment, and actual treatment linkage. Method: Participants were 76 college students (45 women, 31 men; mean age = 22.9 years, SD = 5.0 years) at a large public university who screened positive for suicide risk, defined by at least 2 of the following: suicidal thoughts, history of suicide attempt, depression, and alcohol abuse. Racial\/ethnic self-identifications were primarily Caucasian (n = 54) and Asian (n = 21). Students were randomized to eBridge or the control condition (personalized feedback only, offered in plain report format). Outcomes were measured at 2-month follow-up. Results: Despite relatively modest engagement in online counseling (29% of students posted >= 1 message), students assigned to eBridge reported significantly higher readiness for help-seeking scores, especially readiness to talk to family, talk to friends, and see a mental health professional. Students assigned to eBridge also reported lower stigma levels and were more likely to link to mental health treatment. Conclusions: Findings suggest that offering students personalized feedback and the option of online counseling, using motivational interviewing principles, has a positive impact on students' readiness to consider and engage in mental health treatment. Further research is warranted to determine the robustness of this effect, the mechanism by which improved readiness and treatment linkage occurs, and the longer term impact on student mental health outcomes.","author_address":"[King, Cheryl A.; Czyz, Ewa; Kramer, Anne; Horwitz, Adam; Chermack, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [King, Cheryl A.; Czyz, Ewa; Horwitz, Adam] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [King, Cheryl A.; Eisenberg, Daniel; Kramer, Anne; Chermack, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Depress Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Eisenberg, Daniel; Zheng, Kai] Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zheng, Kai] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","reprint_address":"King, CA (reprint author), Rachel Upjohn Bldg,4250 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","author_email":"kingca@umich.edu","funding":"National Institute of Mental Health [1 R34 MH083032, K24 MH077705]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-006X","eISSN":"1939-2117","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":83.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0038805","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000355167300018","pg":"630-636","author_last_WOS":"King","author_first_WOS":"Cheryl A.","published":"JUN 2015","pdf_filename":"King_JournConsClinPsy_2015_5EQD","claim2_abstract":"Despite relatively modest engagement in onlinecounseling (29% of students posted \u00021 message), students assigned to eBridge reported significantlyhigher readiness for help-seeking scores, especially readiness to talk to family, talk to friends, and see amental health professional.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1304","claim2_box":"(x1: 313.36 y1: 328.04) (x2: 215.10 y2: 362.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"At 2-month follow-up, the students randomizedto the eBridge group reported significantly higher readiness scores,particularly readiness to talk to family and friends about seeing amental health professional, and readiness to see a mental healthprofessional.","claim3a_pg":"6","claim3a_start":"83","claim3a_box":"(x1: 112.40 y1: 275.98) (x2: 94.24 y2: 325.00)","claim3b_testspec":"Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9 | Alcohol Use Disorders IdentificationTest (AUDIT | Readiness to access help | seeking help from a mental health professional; | Differencesbetween groups at 2-month follow-up also adjusted for covariates(gender, age; baseline PHQ-9 score, AUDIT score, suicidal ide-ation\/attempt), and were estimated using logistic regressions forbinary outcomes and linear regressions for other outcomes. | Table 3 | Readiness: See mental health professional (0\u201310) | Linear regressions were estimated for Likert\/rating scale outcomes | Covariates include: age, gender, andbaseline suicide risk factors (PHQ-9 score, AUDIT score, suicidal ideation or previous attempt).","claim3b_pg":"2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5","claim3b_start":"5861 | 155 | 2866 | 3392 | 189 | 2692 | 3098 | 3966 | 4078","claim3b_box":"(x1: 441.39 y1: 550.98) (x2: 332.70 y2: 567.00) | (x1: 152.98 y1: 99.98) (x2: 97.63 y2: 116.00) | (x1: 57.00 y1: 605.97) (x2: 145.08 y2: 610.99) | (x1: 85.26 y1: 693.97) (x2: 259.32 y2: 698.99) | (x1: 246.09 y1: 283.23) (x2: 266.17 y2: 332.25) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 433.98) (x2: 75.99 y2: 439.00) | (x1: 56.00 y1: 539.54) (x2: 217.28 y2: 544.00) | (x1: 52.66 y1: 671.54) (x2: 273.38 y2: 676.00) | (x1: 425.52 y1: 671.54) (x2: 365.88 y2: 685.00)","claim4_inftest":"Despite the modest level of engagement in online counseling, at2-month follow-up, the eBridge group had significantly higherreadiness scores (see Table 3), especially readiness to talk tofamily and friends about seeing a mental health professional, andto see a mental health professional. | Regression-adjusted | Effect p | Readiness: See mental health professional (0\u201310) | 3.16 .001","claim4_pg":"5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5","claim4_start":"1378 | 2796 | 2870 | 3098 | 3167","claim4_box":"(x1: 315.00 y1: 209.97) (x2: 439.65 y2: 258.99) | (x1: 468.71 y1: 464.54) (x2: 533.59 y2: 469.00) | (x1: 476.89 y1: 487.04) (x2: 540.50 y2: 491.50) | (x1: 56.00 y1: 539.54) (x2: 217.28 y2: 544.00) | (x1: 482.99 y1: 539.54) (x2: 545.50 y2: 544.00)","corr_author":"Cheryl A.

Method: Therapist report was obtained at the close of 145 cases seen by 77 therapists, each of whom was randomized to a Standard evidence-based treatment (EBT), modular EBT, or usual care (UC) condition. Results: Analysis of satisfaction items revealed 2 correlated factors representing perceived effectiveness and perceived responsiveness of the treatments. Therapist total satisfaction scores were significantly higher for cases in the modular condition than for those in the standard EBT or UC conditions. With regard to specific dimensions, the modular and UC cases were rated significantly higher than standard EBT cases on the Responsiveness scale, whereas modular and standard EBT cases were rated significantly higher than UC on the Effectiveness scale. Finally, increases in Effectiveness scores from first to second case were significantly larger for Modular cases than for cases in both other study conditions, and increases from first to second case in Total Satisfaction scores were significantly larger for modular cases than for UC cases. Conclusions: Therapist satisfaction with a treatment approach has independent dimensions, which can vary as a function of the protocol design. By virtue of being perceived as more effective than UC and more responsive than standard EBTs, the modular protocol design was also viewed as more overall satisfying than both, and secondary analysis suggested that these results were not due to mere first impressions of the protocols.","author_address":"[Chorpita, Bruce F.; Park, Alayna; Tsai, Katherine; Krull, Jennifer] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Korathu-Larson, Priya; Higa-McMillan, Charmaine K.; Nakamura, Brad J.] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weisz, John R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","reprint_address":"Chorpita, BF (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","author_email":"chorpita@ucla.edu","funding":"John D. and Catherine T.

Conclusions: Results suggest that the Mom-Net intervention is effective as a remotely delivered intervention for economically disadvantaged mothers.","author_address":"[Sheeber, Lisa B.; Feil, Edward G.; Seeley, John R.; Leve, Craig; Gau, Jeff M.; Davis, Betsy] Oregon Res Inst, 1776 Millrace Dr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Allan, Steve] Opt Counseling, Eugene, OR USA","reprint_address":"Sheeber, LB (reprint author), Oregon Res Inst, 1776 Millrace Dr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.","author_email":"lsheeber@ori.org","funding":"National Institute for Mental Health","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-006X","eISSN":"1939-2117","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":85.0,"issue":"4","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/ccp0000175","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000399743400006","pg":"355-366","author_last_WOS":"Sheeber","author_first_WOS":"Lisa B.","published":"APR 2017","pdf_filename":"Sheeber_JournConsClinPsy_2017_KZNd","claim2_abstract":"Relative to participants in the MIRS condition, participants in Mom-Netdemonstrated significantly greater reduction in depression as indexed by self-report questionnaire(primary outcome), interviewer-rated symptoms, and diagnostic outcomes.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1114","claim2_box":"(x1: 219.40 y1: 313.04) (x2: 368.04 y2: 337.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"cognitive\u2013behavioral therapy (CBT) | Internet-facilitatedCBT intervention (Mom-Net) | Par-ticipants in the Mom-Net condition demonstrated significantlygreater reduction in depression as indexed by self-report question-naire (primary outcome), interviewer-rated symptoms, and diag-nostic outcomes.","claim3a_pg":"1 | 3 | 8","claim3a_start":"3555 | 1588 | 3281","claim3a_box":"(x1: 508.05 y1: 649.29) (x2: 401.10 y2: 665.43) | (x1: 217.70 y1: 387.98) (x2: 163.72 y2: 404.00) | (x1: 531.08 y1: 372.15) (x2: 366.74 y2: 421.53)","claim3b_testspec":"Hamilton Depression RatingScale (HDRS | Group differences in continuous posttestdepression scores (PHQ-9 and HDRS) were examined separatelywith mixed effects regression models | All models included the pretest score as a covariateand study condition as a two-level predictor with Mom-Net as thereference group. | PHQ \u0002 Patient Health Questionnaire-9","claim3b_pg":"4 | 7 | 7 | 8","claim3b_start":"232 | 953 | 1301 | 5737","claim3b_box":"(x1: 183.04 y1: 418.98) (x2: 97.37 y2: 435.00) | (x1: 132.41 y1: 253.97) (x2: 185.51 y2: 280.99) | (x1: 94.56 y1: 319.97) (x2: 107.03 y2: 346.99) | (x1: 232.20 y1: 190.54) (x2: 358.95 y2: 195.00)","claim4_inftest":"Motivational Interview andReferral to Services (MIRS). | Mixed effects regression models showed theMom-Net group had significantly lower posttest adjusted PHQ-9(estimate \u0002 \u00051.51, t \u0002 \u00052.44, p \u0002 .015, d \u0002 .27) and HDRS(estimate \u0002 \u00051.85, t \u0002 \u00052.35, p \u0002 .019, d \u0002 .24) scorescompared with MIRS participants (Bonferroni-corrected p \u0002 .05\/2 \u0002 .025).","claim4_pg":"3 | 7","claim4_start":"1638 | 4209","claim4_box":"(x1: 180.85 y1: 398.98) (x2: 159.77 y2: 415.00) | (x1: 385.91 y1: 517.98) (x2: 345.61 y2: 578.00)","corr_author":"Lisa B.

We use fixed-effects models which allow us to control for time-invariant individual and municipal characteristics affecting both exposure to violence and mental health. The results indicate a substantial increase in fear and psychological distress for individuals living in communities that suffered a rise in the local homicide rate even when exposure to other forms of victimization and more personal experiences with crime are taken into account. Because DTO killings occur in response to factors external to a specific neighborhood, they generate fear and psychological distress at a larger geographical scale. They also seem to create a generalized sense of insecurity, leading to increased fear of other types of crimes. We examine the effect of large surges in homicide and the presence of military and paramilitary groups combatting DTOs as these conditions may approximate those in conflict zones elsewhere in the world. We also explore differences in the relative sensitivity to homicide rates between sociodemographic groups.","author_address":"[Villarreal, Andres; Yu, Wei-Hsin] Univ Maryland, Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","reprint_address":"Villarreal, A (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 3131 Art Sociol Bldg,834 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","author_email":"avilla4@umd.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":55.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12150","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000419170600004","pg":"779-805","author_last_WOS":"Villarreal","author_first_WOS":"Andres","published":"NOV 2017","pdf_filename":"VILLARREAL_Criminology_2017_3KAJ","claim2_abstract":"The results indicate a substantial increase in fear and psychologicaldistress for individuals living in communities that suffered a rise in the local homiciderate even when exposure to other forms of victimization and more personal experi-ences with crime are taken into account.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"707","claim2_box":"(x1: 145.02 y1: 239.45) (x2: 237.71 y2: 280.04)","claim3a_concretehyp":"The results from models 4 and 5 show that a surge in the state-level homicide rate hasan even larger effect on psychological distress compared with a similar increase in themunicipal homicide rate | individuals are beingaffected by crimes occurring away from their immediate surroundings.","claim3a_pg":"16 | 16","claim3a_start":"406 | 916","claim3a_box":"(x1: 50.34 y1: 122.42) (x2: 145.13 y2: 151.07) | (x1: 333.03 y1: 182.20) (x2: 343.43 y2: 198.89)","claim3b_testspec":"Dataare drawn from more than 30,000 respondents to a national longitudinal survey ofMexican households.

Although originally uncompromising-almost anyone with a criminal record could be denied employment-court rulings and policy changes have forced criminal background checks to become more nuanced. One motivation for allowing more individuals with criminal records to work is to decrease recidivism and encourage desistance. In this article, we estimate the causal impact of receiving a clearance to work on subsequent arrests for individuals with criminal records who have been provisionally hired to work in certain nonlicensed health-care jobs in New York State (N = 6,648). We employ an instrumental variable approach based on a substantive understanding of the state-mandated criminal background check process. We examine age-graded effects within this group of motivated individuals and differential effects by sex in the rapidly growing health-care industry, which is typically dominated by women. Our estimated local average treatment effect indicates a 2.2-percentage-point decrease in the likelihood of a subsequent arrest in 1 year and a 4.2-percentage-point decrease over 3 years. We find meaningful variations by sex; men are 8.4 percentage points less likely to be arrested over the 3-year period when cleared compared with a 2.4-percentage-point (and nonsignificant) effect for women.

This literature predominantly has treated neighborhoods as independent of their surroundings despite rapidly growing ecological evidence on the geographic clustering of crime that suggests otherwise. This study proposes that to understand neighborhood effects, investigating youth's wider surroundings holds theoretical and empirical value. By revisiting longitudinal data on more than 1500 low-income youth who participated in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) randomized intervention, this article explores the importance of extended neighborhoods (neighborhoods and surroundings) and different concentrated disadvantage configurations in shaping gender differences in risk taking and delinquency. The results from two-stage, least-squares analyses suggest that the extended neighborhoods matter and they matter differently by gender. Among girls, extended neighborhoods without concentrated disadvantage were associated with lower risk-taking prevalence than extended neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage. In contrast, among boys, localized concentration of disadvantage was associated with the highest prevalence of risk taking and delinquency. Interactions between the immediate and surrounding neighborhoods were similarly associated with differential opportunity and social disorganization mediators. Among the more critical potential mediators of the link between localized disadvantage and boys' risk taking were delinquent network ties, strain, and perceived absence of legitimate opportunities for success.","author_address":"[Graif, Corina] Penn State Univ, Dept Sociol & Criminol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Graif, Corina] Penn State Univ, Populat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","reprint_address":"Graif, C (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Sociol & Criminol, 603 Oswald Tower, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","author_email":"corina.graif@psu.edu","funding":"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholars Program at the University of Michigan; Penn State's Population Research Institute (NICHD Award) [R24 HD041025]","publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":53.0,"issue":"3.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12078","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000360081200003","pg":"366-398","author_last_WOS":"Graif","author_first_WOS":"Corina","published":"AUG 2015","pdf_filename":"GRAIF_Criminology_2015_QGrm","claim2_abstract":"The results from two-stage, least-squares analyses suggest that the extended neighborhoods matter and theymatter differently by gender.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1165","claim2_box":"(x1: 328.89 y1: 330.75) (x2: 182.88 y2: 359.39)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Compared with living in extended environments of concentrateddisadvantage, low-income youth living under localized concentrated disadvantageare expected to exhibit a higher prevalence of risk taking and delinquency andhigher scores on both social disorganization and differential opportunity mediators.","claim3a_pg":"7","claim3a_start":"2703","claim3a_box":"(x1: 116.80 y1: 550.48) (x2: 411.00 y2: 591.08)","claim3b_testspec":"longitudinal data on more than 1500 low-income youth who participated in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) randomizedintervention, this article explores the importance of extended neighborhoods (neigh-borhoods and surroundings) and different concentrated disadvantage configurationsin shaping gender differences in risk taking and delinquency. | TSLS analyses by gender are conducted to estimaterisky behavior and delinquency while using the 10 site-by-treatment instruments andcontrolling for baseline covariates.

This study extends the SST model by incorporating the role of contexts for action. Furthermore, the study advances tests of the SST by incorporating a measure of criminogenic situational definitions to assess whether such definitions mediate the effects of schemas and contexts on crime. Structural equation models using 10 years of panel data from 582 African American youth provided strong support for the expanded theory. The results suggest that childhood and adolescent social adversity fosters a criminogenic knowledge structure as well as selection into criminogenic activity spaces and risky activities, all of which increase the likelihood of offending largely through situational definitions. Additionally, evidence shows that the criminogenic knowledge structure interacts with settings to amplify the likelihood of situational definitions favorable to crime.","author_address":"[Simons, Ronald L.; Lei, Man-Kit] Univ Georgia, Dept Sociol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Burt, Callie H.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Criminol & Criminal Justice, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Barr, Ashley B.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Stewart, Eric] Florida State Univ, Sch Criminol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","reprint_address":"Simons, RL (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Sociol, 324 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","author_email":"rsimons@uga.edu","funding":"NIDA NIH HHS [R01 DA021898, P30 DA027827]; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH062669]; NIAAA NIH HHS [R01 AA012768]","publisher":"WILEY","publisher_address":"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","ISSN_WOS":"0011-1384","eISSN":"1745-9125","pub_year_WOS":2014.0,"volume":52.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1111\/1745-9125.12053","WOS_category":"Criminology & Penology","category":"Criminology & Penology","accession_number":"WOS:000345369100004","pg":"655-687","author_last_WOS":"Simons","author_first_WOS":"Ronald L.","published":"NOV 2014","pdf_filename":"SIMONS_Criminology_2014_R8rk","claim2_abstract":"The results suggest that childhood and adoles-cent social adversity fosters a criminogenic knowledge structure as well as selection intocriminogenic activity spaces and risky activities, all of which increase the likelihood ofoffending largely through situational definitions.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1222","claim2_box":"(x1: 233.53 y1: 346.68) (x2: 268.22 y2: 387.28)","claim3a_concretehyp":"With respect to the development of the CKS, figure 3 shows that all of the adolescentsocial-environmental variables are significantly associated with the criminogenic knowl-edge structure as predicted. | Whereas both criminogenic community context and racialdiscrimination are positively associated with this knowledge structure (\u03b3 = .235 and .103,respectively), supportive parenting is negative in its association (\u03b3 = \u2013.269).","claim3a_pg":"21 | 21","claim3a_start":"915 | 1117","claim3a_box":"(x1: 54.57 y1: 194.16) (x2: 167.00 y2: 222.80) | (x1: 170.65 y1: 218.07) (x2: 375.79 y2: 246.71)","claim3b_testspec":"Structural equa-tion models using 10 years of panel data from 582 African American youth providedstrong support for the expanded theory","claim3b_pg":"1","claim3b_start":"1085","claim3b_box":"(x1: 358.90 y1: 322.77) (x2: 228.75 y2: 351.41)","claim4_inftest":"supportive parenting is negative in its association (\u03b3 = \u2013.269)","claim4_pg":"21","claim4_start":"1276","claim4_box":"(x1: 105.42 y1: 241.98) (x2: 373.31 y2: 246.71)","corr_author":"Ronald L.

How do people respond to such performance resets, a type of fresh start on performance records, particularly when resets are not anticipated? Three laboratory experiments and one field study analyzing 40 years of data from professional baseball players demonstrate their impact. Specifically, unanticipated resets increase self-efficacy and thus boost motivation and future performance when they follow weak performance. However, such resets decrease self-efficacy and thus harm motivation and future performance when they follow strong performance. By identifying the conditions that determine whether performance resets improve or harm motivation, and highlighting the role of self-efficacy, this paper provides novel insights into how different ways of tracking performance influence motivation, as well as how fresh starts change behavior.","author_address":"[Dai, Hengchen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, 110 Westwood Plaza,Suite A-405, Los Angeles, CA 90051 USA","reprint_address":"Dai, HC (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, 110 Westwood Plaza,Suite A-405, Los Angeles, CA 90051 USA.","author_email":"hengchen.dai@anderson.ucla.edu","funding":"Penn's Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics; Olin Business School; Wharton Behavioral Lab; UCLA Anderson's Behavioral Lab","publisher":"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","publisher_address":"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0749-5978","eISSN":"1095-9920","pub_year_WOS":2018.0,"volume":148.0,"issue":null,"DOI_WOS":"10.1016\/j.obhdp.2018.06.002","WOS_category":"Psychology, Applied; Management; Psychology, Social","category":"Psychology; Business & Economics","accession_number":"WOS:000447112200002","pg":"12-29","author_last_WOS":"Dai","author_first_WOS":"Hengchen","published":"SEP 2018","pdf_filename":"Dai_OrgBehavior_2018_P8OJ","claim2_abstract":"Specifically, unanticipated resets increase self-e\ufb03cacy and thus boost motivation andfuture performance when they follow weak performance","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"883","claim2_box":"(x1: 287.26 y1: 317.70) (x2: 385.22 y2: 330.75)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Specifically, resets will increase self-e\ufb03cacy fol-lowing weak past performance but decrease self-e\ufb03cacy followingstrong past performance","claim3a_pg":"3","claim3a_start":"3292","claim3a_box":"(x1: 113.50 y1: 626.12) (x2: 123.84 y2: 650.89)","claim3b_testspec":"planned contrast analysis","claim3b_pg":"6","claim3b_start":"3152","claim3b_box":"(x1: 306.60 y1: 61.29) (x2: 400.28 y2: 65.14)","claim4_inftest":"planned contrast analysis showed that when participants imaginedweak past performance, a performance reset increased self-e\ufb03cacy(M = 5.63, SD = 1.84) relative to the control condition (M = 4.35,SD = 2.12), F(1, 357) = 22.05, p < 0.0001, 95% CIdi\ufb00erence = [0.69,1.87], d = 0.64","claim4_pg":"6","claim4_start":"3152","claim4_box":"(x1: 306.60 y1: 61.29) (x2: 363.53 y2: 106.98)","corr_author":"Hengchen Dai","corr_email":"hengchen.dai@anderson.ucla.edu","version":1},{"title_CR":"When is ignorance bliss?

In a survey experiment (study 3), he finds that recalling their eBay feedback scores made participants more trusting and trustworthy.

Conversely, when at least one party fails to win representation on the council, there is a credible opposition with the incentive and ability to threaten exposure of rent seeking among council members. The theory is tested using a regression discontinuity design where the electoral threshold to win a single seat is, within a narrow band, an exogenous determinant of whether or not there is an out-party or credible opposition. Exploiting the fact that Mali's decentralization produces within-country variation in both electoral and governance outcomes, the author uses data from commune council elections alongside local-level public goods provision as a measure of rent seeking. Poorer public goods provision is indeed more likely when all political parties in a district win seats on the council. To show that collusion is the mechanism driving this relationship, the author tests several observable implications in the data and uses qualitative evidence as illustration. This examination of when it is in the strategic interest of parties to engage in uncompetitive behavior contributes to the literature on when elections fail to produce democratic accountability.","author_address":null,"reprint_address":null,"author_email":null,"funding":null,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","publisher_address":"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0043-8871","eISSN":"1086-3338","pub_year_WOS":2015.0,"volume":67.0,"issue":"1.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1017\/s004388711400032","WOS_category":"International Relations; Political Science","category":"International Relations; Government & Law","accession_number":"WOS:000346979000001","pg":"1-36","author_last_WOS":"Gottlieb","author_first_WOS":"Jessica","published":"JAN 2015","pdf_filename":"Gottlieb_WorldPolitics_2015_XOvb","claim2_abstract":"Poorer public goods provision is indeed more likely when all political parties in a district win seats on the council.

This study tested whether intervention-induced reductions in unprotected intercourse during a 12-month period endured over a 54-month period and whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of STIs, which increase risk for HIV. Method: Grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.4 years) participated in a 12-month trial in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, in which 9 matched pairs of schools were randomly selected and within pairs randomized to a theory-based HIV\/STI risk-reduction intervention or an attention-control intervention. They completed 42- and 54-month postintervention measures of unprotected intercourse (the primary outcome), other sexual behaviors, theoretical constructs, and, at 42- and 54-month follow-up only, biologically confirmed curable STIs (chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis) and herpes simplex virus 2. Results: The HIV\/STI risk-reduction intervention reduced unprotected intercourse averaged over the entire follow-up period (OR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.22, 0.84]), an effect not significantly reduced at 42- and 54-month follow-up compared with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The intervention caused positive changes on theoretical constructs averaged over the 5 follow-ups, although most effects weakened at long-term follow-up. Although the intervention's main effect on STIs was nonsignificant, an Intervention Condition x Time interaction revealed that it significantly reduced curable STIs at 42-month follow-up in adolescents who reported sexual experience. Conclusion: These results suggest that theory-based behavioral interventions with early adolescents can have long-lived effects in the context of a generalized severe HIV epidemic.","author_address":"[Jemmott, John B., III] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jemmott, John B., III; Carty, Craig; Heeren, G.

The utility of the model for predicting substance use was tested in two diverse populations of younger adolescents. Method: A survey was administered in classrooms to middle-school students in Westchester County, New York (N = 601) and Honolulu, Hawaii (N = 881). The New York sample was 8% African American, 5% Asian American, 47% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, and 9% other ethnicity. The Hawaii sample was 21% Asian American, 8% Caucasian, 26% Native Hawaiian\/Pacific Islander, 34% Filipino, and 10% other ethnicity. Structural equation modeling analyses tested pathways from the four regulation variables through six hypothesized mediators to a criterion construct of substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana). Results: Results were replicated across samples and were consistent with prediction. Unique contributions were found for good self-control and poor regulation, including both behavioral and emotional aspects. Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily through relations to higher levels of protective factors (e. g., academic competence). Poor regulation independently had a risk-promoting effect on substance use through relations to higher levels of risk factors (e. g., negative life events). Conclusions: Two field studies showed the dual-process model is robust across different populations. Substance prevention programs should consider approaches for enhancing good self-control as well as procedures for reducing poor regulation and minimizing its impact. Extensions to health behaviors including dietary intake and physical activity are discussed.","author_address":"[Wills, Thomas A.; Bantum, Erin O'Carroll; Pokhrel, Pallav] Univ Hawaii, Ctr Canc, Prevent & Control Program, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Ainette, Michael G.] Dominican Coll, Div Social Sci, Orangburg, NY USA; [Morehouse, Ellen; Fenster, Bonnie] Student Assistance Serv Inc, Tarrytown, NY USA","reprint_address":"Wills, TA (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Ctr Canc, Prevent & Control Program, 677 Ala Moana Blvd,Suite 200, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.","author_email":"twills@cc.hawaii.edu","funding":"National Institute on Drug Abuse [R01 DA021856]; National Cancer Institute [P30 CA071789]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":32.0,"issue":"5.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0027634","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000318523400008","pg":"533-542","author_last_WOS":"Wills","author_first_WOS":"Thomas A.","published":"MAY 2013","pdf_filename":"Wills_HealthPsych_2013_0xv2","claim2_abstract":"Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily throughrelations to higher levels of protective factors (e.g., academic competence).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1496","claim2_box":"(x1: 234.92 y1: 335.84) (x2: 357.87 y2: 349.50)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Good self-control is predicted to be positively related tooutcomes that require effort and persistence, particularly academicperformance. | Overall,our theoretical approach hypothesizes indirect relations of regulationconstructs to substance use through intermediate variables, rather thandirect effects on substance use.","claim3a_pg":"3 | 3","claim3a_start":"1886 | 2549","claim3a_box":"(x1: 77.61 y1: 397.87) (x2: 95.73 y2: 423.99) | (x1: 260.03 y1: 496.87) (x2: 157.23 y2: 533.99)","claim3b_testspec":"To test pathways from the dual-process constructs to substanceuse we specified a structural equation model with the four regu-lation measures as exogenous (i.e., not predicted by any priorconstruct in the model) together with covariates of parental supportand conflict, family structure (three binary contrast variables),ethnicity (two\u2013three binary contrast variables), and parental edu-cation.

Because prolonged sympathetic overactivation down regulates beta adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) function, reduced beta-AR responsiveness is considered an indicator of sympathetic overactivity and a cardiovascular risk factor. Though prior research has focused on objective social status and beta-AR function, no studies have examined the association between SSS and beta-AR function. We aimed to learn whether SSS predicts the in vivo responsiveness of beta-ARs. Methods: We assessed the chronotropic 25 dose (CD25), an in vivo marker of beta-AR responsiveness, in 94 healthy participants. The MacArthur Scales of Subjective Social Status were used to assess SSS in the USA (SSS-USA) and in the local community (SSS-C). Objective social status was analyzed by calculating the Hollingshead Two-Factor Index. Results: beta-AR responsiveness was reduced (as indicated by higher CD25 values) in participants with lower SSS-USA (p = .007) and lower SSS-C (p < .001). The relationship between CD and SSS was particularly robust with respect to SSS-C. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that SSS-C remained a significant predictor of CD25 (p < .001) and accounted for 14% of the total variance (32%) in CD adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, ethnicity, gender), health factors (exercise, smoking status, body mass index) and objective social status. Conclusion: Our results indicate that beta-AR function may be an important component of the link between SSS and health.","author_address":"[Euteneuer, Frank; Rief, Winfried] Univ Marburg, Div Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Euteneuer, Frank; Mills, Paul J.; Dimsdale, Joel E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Ziegler, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","reprint_address":"Euteneuer, F (reprint author), Univ Marburg, Div Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Gutenbergstr 18, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.","author_email":"frank.euteneuer@staff.uni-marburg.de","funding":"National Institutes of Health [HL36005, HL57269, HL44915, 1UL1RR031980]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0278-6133","eISSN":"1930-7810","pub_year_WOS":2012.0,"volume":31.0,"issue":"4.0","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0025990","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000306386600016","pg":"525-529","author_last_WOS":"Euteneuer","author_first_WOS":"Frank","published":"JUL 2012","pdf_filename":"Euteneuer_HealthPsych_2012_mzpZ","claim2_abstract":"\u0001-AR responsiveness was reduced (as indicatedby higher CD25 values) in participants with lower SSS-USA ( p \u0002 .007) and lower SSS-C ( p \u0003 .001).","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1336","claim2_box":"(x1: 312.53 y1: 352.78) (x2: 465.02 y2: 367.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"subjective social status(SSS) | we tested the hypothesis that SSS significantlypredicts the chronotropic 25 dose (CD25), an in vivo marker of\u0001-AR responsiveness and chronic \u0001-AR stimulation respectively(Cleaveland, Rangno, & Shand, 1972).","claim3a_pg":"1 | 2","claim3a_start":"2492 | 1326","claim3a_box":"(x1: 463.44 y1: 493.88) (x2: 327.01 y2: 509.16) | (x1: 109.34 y1: 309.87) (x2: 190.96 y2: 347.00)","claim3b_testspec":"The CD25 isoproterenol stimulation test was used to assess invivo \u0001-AR function.

Method: Seventy-seven graduate students (M = 30.3 years, SD = 6.09; 76.6% female) in mental health training programs were randomly assigned to receive either the trainer-led or self-paced BA training. Both trainings consisted of 4 weekly sessions covering 4 core BA strategies. Primary outcomes were changes in BA skills as measured by an objective role-play assessment and self-reported use of BA strategies. Assessments were conducted at pre-, post-, and 6-weeks after training. A series of longitudinal mixed effect models assessed changes in BA skills and a longitudinal model implemented with generalized estimating equations assessed BA use over time. Results: Significantly greater increases in total BA skills were found in the trainer-led training condition. The trainer-led training condition also showed greater increases in all core BA skills either at posttraining, follow-up, or both. Reported use of BA strategies with actual clients increased significantly from pre- to posttraining and maintained at follow-up in both training conditions. Conclusions: This trial adds to the literature on the efficacy of online training as a method to disseminate BA. Online training with an active learning, modular approach may be a promising and accessible implementation strategy. Additional strategies may need to be paired with the online BA training to assure the long-term implementation and sustainability of BA in clinical practice.","author_address":"[Puspitasari, Ajeng J.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 1101 East 10th Sreet, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kanter, Jonathan W.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Busch, Andrew M.] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Providence, RI USA; [Busch, Andrew M.; Dunsiger, Shira] Miriam Hosp, Ctr Behav & Prevent Med, Providence, RI 02906 USA; [Leonard, Rachel] Rogers Mem Hosp, FOCUS Residential & Partial Hospitalizat Program, Oconomowoc, WI USA; [Dunsiger, Shira] Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav & Social Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Cahill, Shawn; Martell, Christopher] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Psychol, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Koerner, Kelly] PracticeGround Learning Commun, Seattle, WA USA","reprint_address":"Puspitasari, AJ (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 1101 East 10th Sreet, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.","author_email":"apuspita@indiana.edu","funding":null,"publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-006X","eISSN":"1939-2117","pub_year_WOS":2017.0,"volume":85.0,"issue":"8","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/ccp0000223","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000406288000005","pg":"814-825","author_last_WOS":"Puspitasari","author_first_WOS":"Ajeng J.","published":"AUG 2017","pdf_filename":"Puspitasari_JournConsClinPsy_2017_LpNB","claim2_abstract":"Significantly greater increases in total BA skills were found in the trainer-led training condition.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1510","claim2_box":"(x1: 157.63 y1: 408.54) (x2: 465.04 y2: 413.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Behavioral activation (BA) | Findings from this study indicated that trainer-led online BA train-ing outperformed self-paced online BA training with respect to over-all BA skill improvements,","claim3a_pg":"2 | 9","claim3a_start":"1475 | 1070","claim3a_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 341.97) (x2: 161.33 y2: 346.99) | (x1: 315.00 y1: 558.24) (x2: 402.17 y2: 585.81)","claim3b_testspec":"Behavioral activation skills assessment (BASA). | All models were conductedon the intent-to-treat sample, with all randomized participantsincluded in the analysis.

Treatments were 20 individual clinic-based sessions over 10-12 weeks. OST involved skills building provided primarily to the child. PATHKO trained parents and teachers to reinforce children contingently for meeting end-point target goals. Primary outcomes were the Children's Organizational Skills Scales (COSS-Parent, COSS-Teacher). Other relevant functional outcomes were assessed. Percentage of participants no longer meeting inclusion criteria for OTMP impairments informed on clinical significance. Assessments occurred at post-treatment, 1-month post-treatment, and twice in the following school year. Results: OST was superior to WL on the COSS-P (Cohen's d = 2.77; p < .0001), COSS-T (d = 1.18; p < .0001), children's COSS self-ratings, academic performance and proficiency, homework, and family functioning. OST was significantly better than PATHKO only on the COSS-P (d = 0.63; p < .005). PATHKO was superior to WL on most outcomes but not on academic proficiency. Sixty percent of OST and PATHKO participants versus 3% of controls no longer met OTMP inclusion criteria. Significant maintenance effects were found for both treatments. Conclusions: Two distinct treatments targeting OTMP problems in children with ADHD generated robust, sustained functional improvements. The interventions show promise of clinical utility in children with ADHD and organizational deficits.","author_address":"[Abikoff, Howard; Gallagher, Richard; Huang, Lei; Lu, Feihan; Petkova, Eva] NYU, Langone Med Ctr, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wells, Karen C.; Murray, Desiree W.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Durham, NC 27706 USA","reprint_address":"Abikoff, H (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Child Study, 1 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.","author_email":"howard.abikoff@nyumc.org","funding":"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH074013, R01MH074013]","publisher":"AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","publisher_address":"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","ISSN_WOS":"0022-006X","eISSN":"1939-2117","pub_year_WOS":2013.0,"volume":81.0,"issue":"1","DOI_WOS":"10.1037\/a0029648","WOS_category":"Psychology, Clinical","category":"Psychology","accession_number":"WOS:000314255400012","pg":"113-128","author_last_WOS":"Abikoff","author_first_WOS":"Howard","published":"FEB 2013","pdf_filename":"Abikoff_JournConsClinPsy_2013_PXOw","claim2_abstract":"OSTwas superior to WL on the COSS-P (Cohen\u2019s d \u0001 2.77; p \u0002 .0001), COSS-T (d \u0001 1.18; p \u0002 .0001),children\u2019s COSS self-ratings, academic performance and proficiency, homework, and family functioning.","claim2_pg":"1","claim2_start":"1443","claim2_box":"(x1: 449.92 y1: 321.54) (x2: 465.05 y2: 346.00)","claim3a_concretehyp":"Organization, time management, and planning (OTMP) | organizational skills training (OST) | Children treated with OSTimproved substantially at home and school in their OTMP com-pared to controls,","claim3a_pg":"1 | 2 | 11","claim3a_start":"2303 | 3717 | 4994","claim3a_box":"(x1: 57.00 y1: 471.98) (x2: 256.47 y2: 477.00) | (x1: 372.60 y1: 89.16) (x2: 500.45 y2: 94.18) | (x1: 448.04 y1: 542.83) (x2: 370.98 y2: 569.87)","claim3b_testspec":"wait-list control (WL) | teacher-completed Children\u2019s Organizational Skills Scale(COSS-T) | Intervention effects were es-timated based on analyses of covariance for end of treatmentscores.
