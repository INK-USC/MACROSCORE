Analytic-Thinking Predicts Hoax Beliefs and Helping Behaviors in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic	Stanley	Matthew	2020.0	2020-03-30	10.31234/osf.io/m3vth	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the WHO in March of 2020. During that same month, the number of confirmed cases and the death rate grew exponentially in the United States, creating a serious public-health emergency. Unfortunately, many Americans dismissed the pandemic as a hoax and failed to properly engage in helpful behaviors like social-distancing and increased hand-washing. Here, we examine a disposition—willingness to engage in analytic-thinking—that might predict beliefs that the pandemic is a hoax and failures to change behavior in positive ways. Our results indicate that individuals less willing to engage effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes were more likely to believe the pandemic was a hoax, and less likely to have recently engaged in social-distancing and hand-washing. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding and addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fighting COVID-19 misinformation on social media: Experimental evidence for a scalable accuracy nudge intervention	Pennycook	Gordon	2020.0	2020-03-17	10.31234/osf.io/uhbk9	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Misinformation can amplify humanity's greatest challenges. A salient recent example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has bred a multitude of falsehoods even as truth has increasingly become a matter of life-and-death. Here we investigate why people believe and spread false (and true) news content about COVID-19, and test an intervention intended to increase the truthfulness of the content people share on social media. Across two studies with over 1,600 participants (quota-matched to the American public on age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region), we find support for the idea that people share false claims about COVID-19 in part because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, participants who engaged in more analytic thinking and had greater science knowledge were more discerning in their belief and sharing. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study – i.e., asking people to judge the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline – more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants’ sharing intentions. In the control, participants were equally like to say they would share false versus true headlines at COVID-19 whereas, in the treatment, sharing of true headlines was significantly higher than false headlines. Our results – which mirror those found previously for political fake news – suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media. Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.

Chinese public’s knowledge, perceived severity, and perceived controllability of the COVID-19 and their associations with emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour: A national survey	Li	Jian Bin	2020.0	2020-02-28	10.31234/osf.io/5tmsh	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The outbreak of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused enormous stress among the public in China. Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to control the COVID-19, including the understanding of the public’s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., knowledge, perceived severity and perceived controllability of the COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17–90 years, Mage=23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in an online survey. The results showed that the public’s emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding the COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables. Theoretically, the findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the public’s emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern. Practically, the findings facilitate the government and practitioners to design and deliver targeted intervention programs to the public affected by the COVID-19.

COVID-19: Risk perception and Coping strategies.	Gerhold	Lars	2020.0	2020-03-25	10.31234/osf.io/xmpk4	na	Center for Open Science	covid	This paper presents preliminary results of a representative survey of the German population focusing on perceptions of risk and ways of coping with COVID-19. Results show that older people estimate the risk of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. People especially worry about being infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and shops or restaurants. Coping strategies are highly problem-focused and most respondents listen to experts’ advice and try to behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that measures to tackle COVID-19 will take time to be effective. Bulk buying and storing of food is mainly justified by a combination of convenience and a perceived need to be prepared for potential quarantine.

Functional fear predicts public health compliance in the COVID-19 pandemic	Harper	Craig A.	2020.0	2020-04-01	10.31234/osf.io/jkfu3	na	Center for Open Science	covid	In the current context of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), health professionals are working with social scientists to inform government policy on how to slow the spread of the virus. An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically-relevant variables. We discuss these data in relation to the potentially functional nature of fear in global health crises.

Framing COVID-19 as an Existential Threat Predicts Anxious Arousal and Prejudice towards Chinese People	Tabri	Nassim	2020.0	2020-03-31	10.31234/osf.io/mpbtr	na	Center for Open Science	covid	We tested the hypothesis that perceived existential threat of COVID-19 elicits anxious arousal, which can manifest in prejudice toward the perceived source of the threat (Chinese people). Americans (n = 474) were randomly assigned to an experimental condition in which COVID-19 was framed as an existential threat to the United States or a non-existential threat control condition. They then completed self-report measures of anxious arousal and blatant prejudice towards Chinese people. As expected, participants in the threat (vs. control) condition reported greater anxious arousal which, in turn, predicted greater blatant prejudice. Threat (vs. control) condition also indirectly predicted greater prejudice via greater anxious arousal. Results suggest that COVID-19 existential threat may diminish social capital, which would further degrade people’s health and well-being.

Psychological Correlates of News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors among US Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic	Oosterhoff	Benjamin	2020.0	2020-03-23	10.31234/osf.io/rpcy4	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Importance: As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, it is critical to understand the psychological factors that influence pandemic-related behaviors (i.e., news monitoring, social distancing, hygiene/disinfecting, hoarding). This may be especially important to study among youth, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus.Objective: To examine psychological correlates of adolescents’ behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Self-report survey conducted between March 20th and March 22nd, 2020. Setting: This is an online survey study of youth from the United States.Participants: A population-based sample of adolescents were recruited via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Youth were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were between the ages of 13 and 18. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors over the 7 days after the US declared a national emergency. The correlates measured were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, values related to social responsibility, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, along with greater social responsibility and social trust, would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding.Results: The final analytic sample included 770 adolescents (Mage = 16.34, 72% female). The majority of teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (70%), but were monitoring the news (75%) and engaging in at least one disinfecting behavior multiple times per day (88%). Some teens reported engaging in hoarding behavior (19%). Greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing, disinfecting, and news monitoring, but also more hoarding. Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting and news monitoring, and less hoarding. Participants who reported valuing their own self-interest over others reported less social distancing and more hoarding. Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding.Conclusions and Relevance: Emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following recommended preventative health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.

Self-control moderates the association between perceived severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mental health problems among the Chinese public	Li	Jian Bin	2020.0	2020-03-11	10.31234/osf.io/2xadq	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of death in China. Prior research suggests that individuals’ perceived severity of the COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioural reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this possibility. Participants were 4,607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage=23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for demographic variables, perceived severity of the COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the “perceived severity of the COVID-19 – mental health problems” association, with the said link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Could Attitudes Toward COVID-19 in Spain Render Men More Vulnerable Than Women?	De La Vega	Ricardo	2020.0	2020-04-02	10.31234/osf.io/dyxqn	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The COVID-1 pandemic affects the whole world. Spain is 3rd in the world and 2nd in Europe with largest number of diagnosed cases. Spanish citizens’ attitudes are important in controlling the pandemic. This research assessed key attitudes of the Spanish people toward COVID-19. One study (n =64) was conducted in a shopping center in Madrid and another (n= 640) online. The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a ‘more responsible’ attitude toward the COVID-19 than men. Young adults (18-25 years) appear to perceive less threatening the epidemic than older adults. Spanish people’s personal concern about COVID-19 is less than their perceived social alarm about it. Compliance is the strongest  predictor of the approval to stay at home, which is the highest rated preventive measure by the Spanish people. These results might help policy makers in targeting public attitudes which could play an important role in the exponentially rising cases of COVID-19.

Optimistic beliefs about the personal impact of COVID-19	Kuper-Smith	Benjamin James	2020.0	2020-03-19	10.31234/osf.io/epcyb	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Slowing the spread of COVID-19 requires people to actively change their lives and follow best practices for social distancing and hygiene. On 16.03.2020, we tested individuals’ beliefs about infection probabilities and abilities to practice social distancing in UK, USA and Germany. Given the rapidly evolving situation, we report here initial analyses in a preliminary brief manuscript. We found that individuals show an optimism bias: they estimate the probability of getting infected with the virus, and of infecting others if infected themselves as lower for themselves than for someone similar to them. We link this optimism to the estimated frequency of direct social contacts as well as to the necessity and ease of reducing these. Our ongoing studies will assess how these biases change over the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and how adaptive it is.

The Importance of Cultural Tightness and Government Efficiency For Understanding COVID-19 Growth and Death Rates	Gelfand	MIchele	2020.0	2020-04-01	10.31234/osf.io/m7f8a	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The spread of COVID-19 represents a global public health crisis, yet some nations were more effective than others at limiting the spread of the virus during the early stages of the pandemic. Here we show that institutional and cultural factors combine to partly explain these cross-cultural differences. Nations with tight cultures and efficient governments were the most effective at limiting COVID-19’s growth and mortality rates as of early April, and this interaction of cultural tightness and government efficiency is robust to controlling for underreporting of cases, economic development, inequality, median age, population density, climatological variation, and other dimensions of cross-cultural variation (collectivism, power distance, relational mobility). A formal evolutionary model explores the mechanism that may underlie our findings, suggesting that these cross-cultural trends may be associated with group variation in cooperation under conditions of high threat. These analyses shed light on why some nations contained COVID-19 more effectively than others.

When in Danger, Turn Right: Covid-19 Threat Promotes Social Conservatism and Right-Wing Presidential Candidates	Karwowski	Maciej	2020.0	2020-03-31	10.31234/osf.io/pjfhs	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forms an enormous challenge for the world's economy, governments, and societies. Drawing upon the Parasite Model of Democratization (Thornhill, R., Fincher, C. L., &amp;amp; Aran, D. (2009), parasites, democratization, and the liberalization of values across contemporary countries, Biological Reviews, 84(1), 113-131) across two large, preregistered experiments conducted in the USA and Poland (total N = 1,237), we examined the psychological and political consequences of this unprecedented pandemic. By manipulating saliency of COVID-19, we demonstrate that activating thinking about coronavirus elevates Americans' and Poles' anxiety and indirectly promotes their social conservatism as well as support for more conservative presidential candidates. The pattern obtained was consistent in both countries and it implies that the pandemic may result in a shift in political views. Both theoretical and practical consequences of the findings are discussed.

Flow in the Time of COVID-19: Findings from China	Sweeny	Kate	2020.0	2020-03-26	10.31234/osf.io/e3kcw	na	Center for Open Science	covid	In February 2020, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was raging in Wuhan, China and quickly spreading to the rest of the world. This period was fraught with uncertainty for those in the affected areas. The present investigation examined the role of two potential coping resources during this stressful period of uncertainty: flow and mindfulness. Participants in Wuhan and other major cities affected by COVID-19 (N = 5115) completed an online survey assessing experiences of flow, mindfulness, and well-being. Longer quarantine was associated with poorer well-being; flow and mindfulness predicted better well-being on some measures. However, flow—but not mindfulness—moderated the link between quarantine length and well-being, such that people who experienced high levels flow showed little or no association between quarantine length and poorer well-being. These findings suggest that engaging in flow-inducing activities may be a particularly effective way to protect against the deleterious effects of a period of quarantine.

Differences between health workers and general population in risk perception, behaviors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 spread in Italy.	Simione	Luca	2020.0	2020-04-03	10.31234/osf.io/84d2c	na	Center for Open Science	covid	In this study, we investigated the perception of risk and the worries about COVID-19 infection in both healthcare workers and general population in Italy. We studied the difference in risk perception in these two groups, and how this related to demographic variables and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e. medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each predictor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to general population. Also psychological state, gender, and living area were important predictors of these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as gender and alcohol consumption. We discussed these results in the light of risk factors for psychological distress and possible interventions to meet the psychological needs of healthcare workers.

We conducted a study in Wuhan, China between February 20th, 2020 and March 2nd, 2020. We randomly assigned participants to either a daily mindfulness practice or a daily mind-wandering practice. Mindfulness reduced daily anxiety. In addition, the sleep duration of participants in the mindfulness condition was less impacted by the increase of infections in the community compared with participants in the control condition.

Will consumption rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic? A structural equation modeling research based on the psychological arousal theory	Deng	Shichang	2020.0	2020-03-23	10.31234/osf.io/ch72a	na	Center for Open Science	covid	At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in Wuhan, which quickly became a major public health emergency with the fastest spread, the broadest range of infection, and the most difficult to control in the history of modern China. During the outbreak, 1.4 billion Chinese people suspended almost all social activities and stay at home. Although the prevention of the pandemic seems effective, China's consumer economy suffered a heavy blow in the first quarter of 2020. With the COVID-19 outbreak gradually controlled in China, many retail businesses are pinning their hopes on the rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic. This study discusses the psychological mechanism of the consumption rebound and the possible duration of this rebound with the theory of psychological arousal. Based on the results of structural equation modeling of 1464 Chinese people, this study found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the perceived severity of the pandemic caused an insufficient level of psychological arousal and lead to a higher tendency of sensation seeking, and this will increase people's willingness to spend after the end of the pandemic. The results revealed that it might lead to a rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic, but this rebound is concentrated and short-lived. This study suggests that retail businesses need to realize that the rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic is not due to a sudden increase in social spending power, but because consumers urgently need to restore the normal level of psychological arousal through the sensory stimulation brought by consumption. Therefore, retail businesses should not only pay attention to deal with the rapid rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic, but also prepare plans for the normalization of consumption after the rebound weakens.

Individual differences in accepting personal restrictions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a Danish adult sample	Zettler	Ingo	2020.0	2020-03-23	10.31234/osf.io/pkm2a	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Political authorities are working hard on fighting the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Corresponding interventions often address cooperative behavior, because they pose restrictions on the individual level (e.g., limiting one’s physical contacts) with the aim to serve the greater good (e.g., not overtaxing the health systems). In a sample of Danish adults (N = 799) randomly drawn from a representative sample, we link different personality characteristics to people’s willingness in accepting personal restrictions for fighting COVID-19. When simultaneously considering all characteristics including the basic traits from the HEXACO personality model, we find that, next to people’s age, Emotionality as well as the Dark Factor of Personality (D) explain who is more willing to accept restrictions. D further explains acceptance based on whether restrictions aim to protect oneself rather than others. The results show the importance of individual differences for following large-scale interventions that should serve the greater good.

They consistently shunned measures that have higher protective value for the public than for themselves, which indicates that public protective value comes second even for prosocially oriented individuals. Accordingly, health communication should focus on emphasizing a measure’s perceived self-protective value by explaining how it would foster public protection that in the long run will protect the individual and the individual’s close relations.

The emotional path to action: Empathy promotes physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic	Pfattheicher	Stefan	2020.0	2020-03-23	10.31234/osf.io/y2cg5	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The COVID-19 pandemic presents a major challenge to societies all over the globe. To curb the spread of the disease, one measure implemented in many countries is minimizing close contact between people (“physical distancing”). Engaging in physical distancing is a prosocial act in the sense that it helps protecting other individuals, especially those most vulnerable to the virus. Building on this notion, we tested the idea that physical distancing can be the result of a genuine prosocial motivation—empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus. In three pre-registered studies that include samples from the US, the UK, and Germany (total N = 2,192) collected at the beginning of the outbreak, we show that (i) empathy is indeed a basic motivation for physical distancing, and (ii) inducing empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to physical distancing. In sum, the present research provides a better understanding of the basic motivation underlying the willingness to follow one important measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. We further point to the potential for policymakers to use empathy to promote physical distancing – in this way to increase the chance of saving lives.

Measuring Realistic and Symbolic Threats of COVID-19 and their Unique Impacts on Wellbeing and Adherence to Public Health Behaviors	Kachanoff	Frank	2020.0	2020-04-02	10.31234/osf.io/5zr3w	na	Center for Open Science	covid	COVID-19 threatens lives, livelihoods, and civic institutions. Although restrictive public health behaviors such as social distancing help manage its impact, these behaviors can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N=1,195) validated a brief 10-item COVID-19 threat scale that assesses 1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety, and 2) symbolic threats to one’s sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threat predict higher distress and lower wellbeing, and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threat diverge in their relationship to restrictive public health behaviors: Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported adherence, whereas symbolic threat predicted less self-reported adherence to social-disconnection behaviors. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation. Our findings highlight how social psychological theory can be leveraged to understand and predict people’s behavior in pandemics.

When we are worried, what are we thinking?

In our study (N = 783), conducted shortly after the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in our country, we examined whether people with higher anxiety and lack of control concerning the pandemic adopt more conspiracy beliefs about the origin, spread and potential cure of the new coronavirus. We also tested whether the rise of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs is associated with the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect (i.e. paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific) beliefs as well. Our results show that higher perception of risk and lower trust in institutions concerning the COVID-19 pandemic were related to the feelings of anxiety and lack of control which in turn predicted an increase in coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Importantly, these beliefs were further related to the higher endorsement of generic paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific beliefs. The results show how threatening events, such as the current pandemic, lead to a rise in various epistemically suspect beliefs by increasing people’s feelings of anxiety and lack of control.

Information about pandemic increases negative attitudes toward foreign groups: a case of COVID-19 outbreak	Sorokowski	Piotr	2020.0	2020-03-31	10.31234/osf.io/j23vt	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Pathogen threat can translate into willingness to distance oneself from others also on a psychological level. Building on this notion, we predicted that the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus can affect attitudes toward foreign nationalities. We explored the inter-group consequences of the current epidemiological situation in two studies involving a total of 652 participants. In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the UK and in Poland and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. The Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about Coronavirus through the increase in anxiety. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice is sensitive to current epidemiological situation and our findings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most affected by the pandemic.

The effectiveness of moral messages on public health behavioral intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic	Everett	Jim Albert Charlton	2020.0	2020-03-20	10.31234/osf.io/9yqs8	na	Center for Open Science	covid	With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives, changing our behaviors to prevent the spread of the disease is a moral imperative. Here, we investigated the persuasiveness of messages inspired by three major moral traditions. A sample of US participants representative for age, sex and race/ethnicity (N=1032) viewed messages from either a leader or citizen containing deontological, virtue-based, utilitarian, or non-moral justifications for adopting social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the messages’ effects on participants’ self-reported intentions to wash hands, avoid social gatherings, self-isolate, and share health messages, as well as their beliefs about others’ intentions, impressions of the messenger’s morality and trustworthiness, and beliefs about personal control and responsibility for preventing the spread of disease. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, compared to non-moral control messages, deontological arguments had a modest effect on intentions to share the message. Message source (leader vs. citizen) did not moderate any of the observed effects of message type. A majority of participants predicted the utilitarian message would be most effective, but we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions or beliefs. We caution that our findings require confirmation in replication studies and are modest in size, likely due to ceiling effects on our measures of behavioral intentions and strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. Although we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions and beliefs, exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in one key dimension of utilitarianism—impartial concern for the greater good—were strongly and positively associated with public health intentions and beliefs. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens is a promising approach for future studies of interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the US. Ongoing work is investigating the reproducibility and generalizability of our findings across different populations, what aspects of deontological messages may drive their persuasive effects, and how such messages can be most effectively delivered across global populations.

However, it is unclear to what extent individuals are aware of the risks associated with the disease, how they are altering their behavior, factors which could influence the spread of the virus to vulnerable populations. We characterized risk perception and engagement in preventative measures in 1591 United States based individuals over the first week of the pandemic (March 11th-16th 2020) and examined the extent to which protective behaviors are predicted by individuals’ perception of risk. Over 5 days, subjects demonstrated growing awareness of the risk posed by the virus, and largely reported engaging in protective behaviors with increasing frequency. However, they underestimated their personal risk of infection relative to the average person in the country. We found that engagement in social distancing and handwashing was most strongly predicted by the perceived likelihood of personally being infected, rather than likelihood of transmission or severity of potential transmitted infections. However, substantial variability emerged among individuals, and using data-driven methods we found a subgroup of subjects who are largely disengaged, unaware, and not practicing protective behaviors. Our results have implications for our understanding of how risk perception and protective behaviors can facilitate early interventions during large-scale pandemics.

Who Hoards? Honesty-Humility and Behavioural Responses to the 2019/20 Coronavirus Pandemic	Columbus	Simon	2020.0	2020-03-24	10.31234/osf.io/8e62v	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic pose conflicts of interests between individual and societal welfare. One example is the run on many basic goods. However, conflicts of interests also afford the expression of personality traits associated with individual differences in prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility, in particular, is associated with prosocial behaviour at a personal cost. Across two studies (N = 601), Honesty-Humility was positively associated with refraining from stockpiling in the past and intentions to do so in the future. This was not due to differences in beliefs that others would refrain from stockpiling. Instead, results suggest that individuals high in Honesty-Humility may have been motivated to maximise societal outcomes, even at the cost of foregoing individual benefits.

Fear of the coronavirus (COVID-19): Predictors in an online study conducted in March 2020	Mertens	Gaëtan	2020.0	2020-04-02	10.31234/osf.io/2p57j	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Fear is an adaptive response in the presence of danger. However, when threat is uncertain and continuous, as in the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, fear can become chronic and burdensome. To better understand predictors of fear of the coronavirus, we conducted an online survey (N = 439) between March 14 and 17, 2020, which started three days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Fear of the coronavirus was assessed with eight questions pertaining to different dimensions of fear (e.g., subjective worry, avoidance, preferential attention) and an open-ended question. The predictors included measures of psychological vulnerability factors (i.e., intolerance of uncertainty, worry, health anxiety), media exposure, and personal relevance (i.e., personal health, risk for loved ones, and risk control). We found that respondents reported a wide range of concerns relating to the coronavirus outbreak, such as the health of their loved ones, collapse of health care systems, and economic consequences. Four predictors for fear of the coronavirus were retained after backward selection in a simultaneous regression analysis: health anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, media use, and risks for loved ones (R2 = .37). We discuss the relevance of our findings for managing people’s fear of the coronavirus.

Adaptive and Dark Personality Traits in the Covid-19 Pandemic: Predicting Health-behavior Endorsement and the Appeal of Public-health Messages	Blagov	Pavel S.	2020.0	2020-03-28	10.31234/osf.io/chgkn	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Who embraces directions to socially distance, boost hygiene, and protect others during a pandemic of contagious respiratory disease? Do differently phrased public-health messages appeal to different people? I based predictions on the five-factor, triarchic psychopathy, and Dark Triad models of normal-range and dark traits; the extended parallel process model (EPPM); and schema-congruence theory. In a survey of 502 online participants, normal-range traits (esp. agreeableness and conscientiousness) predicted endorsement of social distancing and hygiene, as well as the appeal of health messages in general. Consistent with the EPPM, conscientiousness and neuroticism had an interaction. Dark traits (esp. psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) predicted low endorsement of health behaviors and the intent to knowingly expose others to risk. Most participants preferred a message appealing to compassion (“Help protect the vulnerable...”), but dark traits predicted lower appeal of that message. Personality appears relevant to epidemiology and public-health communication in a contagious-disease context.

In this particular context, people have been accused of being excessively pessimistic regarding the future consequences of this emerging health threat.

Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Predicts Restrictive Policy Supports in Response to the 2019-nCoV Outbreak	Goh	Jin X.	2020.0	2020-02-10	10.31234/osf.io/52bw4	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Diseases threaten human survival. As such, humans engage in behavioral avoidance to prevent contact with potential carriers of pathogens, such as reduced sociability at the interpersonal level and endorsement of strict immigration policies at the intergroup level. This research examines chronic concerns about infectious diseases (using the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease questionnaire) and travel ban supports in response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak in January 2020. Two studies were conducted in the United States (Study 1; N = 241) and Singapore (Study 2; N = 138). For Americans who scored higher on the Perceived Infectability subscale, they were more likely to endorse travel bans on people coming from China and all of Asia. For Singaporeans who reported greater Germ Aversion, they were more supportive of travel bans on people from both China and their Malaysian neighbor.

Emerging infectious outbreak inhibits pain empathy mediated prosocial behaviour	Cao	Siqi	2020.0	2020-03-29	10.31234/osf.io/5p8kd	na	Center for Open Science	covid	In response to the coronavirus outbreak, people may experience anxiety, empathy, and prosocial willingness. However, the relationship between emotions, empathy, and prosocial behaviour is unknown. It is said that empathy is affected by moods and influences pro-sociality. Thus, how does an emergency change people’s empathy and prosocial willingness? We conducted a study with 1,190 participants before (N=520) and after (N=570) the coronavirus outbreak. We found that prosocial willingness decreased post-outbreak, maybe by the decreased empathy levels, in accordance with compassion fatigue theory. Trait empathy could affect prosocial willingness indirectly through the empathy level. News discriminability and distance from the outbreak epicentre played a role in the trait empathy change. Given how emergency health events influence emotion and the effects of personal traits on prosocial willingness, social media users and providers should understand the negative effects of information over-exposure on mental health during the outbreak.

Japanese citizens' behavioral changes and preparedness against COVID-19: How effective is Japan's approach of self-restraint?	Muto	Kaori	2020.0	2020-04-03	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048876	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	The Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking “people's behavioral changes,” in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence them.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Muto_covid_n8dl9	The  statistical  analysis | indicated  that  the  typical  characteristics  of  those  people  were  male,  younger  (under  30  years 39  old), unmarried,  from lower-income  households,  with  a drinking or  smoking  habit and a higher 40  extraversion score.

The impacts of diagnostic capability and prevention measures on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan	LIANG	Jingbo	2020.0	2020-04-06	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049387	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background:
Although the rapidly rising transmission trend of COVID-19 in Wuhan has been controlled in late February 2020, the outbreak still caused a global pandemic afterward. Understanding Wuhan COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effects of prevention approaches is of significant importance for containing virus global transmission. However, most of the recent studies focused on the early outbreaks without considering improvements in diagnostic capability and effects of prevention measures together, thus the estimated results may only reflect the facts in a given period of time.
Methods:
We constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, embedding with latent periods under different prevention measures and proportions of documented infections to characterize the Wuhan COVID-19 transmission cross different stages of the outbreak. The epidemiological parameters were estimated using a particle filtering approach.
Results:
Our model successfully reproduced the dynamics of the Wuhan local epidemic with two peaks on February 4 and February 12 separately. Prevention measures determined the time of reaching the first peak and caused an 87% drop in the R_t from 3.09 (95% CI, 2.10 to 3.63) to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.66). An improved diagnostic capability created the second peak and increased the number of documented infections. The proportion of documented infections changed from 23% (95% CI,  20% to 26%) to 37% (95% CI,  33% to 41%)  when the detection kits were released after January 26, and later up to 73% (95% CI,  64% to 80%) after the diagnostic criteria were improved."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Llang_covid_0qm1r	Prevention measures determined the time of reaching the first peak and caused an 87% drop in the Rt  from 3.09 (95% CI, 2.10 to  3.63)  to  0.41  (95%  CI,  0.18  to  0.66).

Widespread use of face masks in public may slow the spread of SARS CoV-2: an ecological study	Kenyon	Chris	2020.0	2020-04-06	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048652	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background
The reasons for the large differences between countries in the sizes of their SARS CoV2 epidemics is unknown. Individual level studies have found that the use of face masks was protective for the acquisition and transmission of a range of respiratory viruses including SARS CoV1. We hypothesized that population level usage of face masks may be negatively associated SARS CoV2 spread.  

Methods
At a country level, linear regression was used to assess the association between COVID19 diagnoses per inhabitant and the national promotion of face masks in public (coded as a binary variable), controlling for the age of the COVID19 epidemic and testing intensity.
 
Results
Eight of the 49 countries with available data advocated wearing face masks in public: China, Czechia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.  In multivariate analysis face mask use was negatively associated with number of COVID19 cases/inhabitant (coef. -326, 95% CI -601- -51, P=0.021). Testing intensity was positively associated with COVID-19 cases (coef. 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, P&lt;0.001).

Association of BCG vaccination policy and tuberculosis burden with incidence and mortality of COVID-19	Sala	Giovanni	2020.0	2020-04-06	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: Evidence suggests non-specific benefits of the tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) against non-related infections. Recent studies propose such protection may extend to the novel COVID-19 as well. This is a contested hypothesis. 
Methods: Our ecological study confronts this hypothesis. We examine the effects of BCG vaccination on countries′ COVID-19 (a) cases and deaths (per million) and (b) exponential growth factors over specific periods of the pandemic. Since the BCG vaccine was derived from Mycobacterium bovis, a bacterium causing tuberculosis in cattle, having suffered from tuberculosis also may exert a non-specific protection against the COVID-19 as well. Along with BCG vaccination, we test the effect of the prevalence of tuberculosis.
We employ multiple regression and principal component analysis (PCA) to control for potentially confounding variables (n = 16). 
Results: BCG vaccination policy and incidence of tuberculosis is associated with a reduction in both COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the effects of these two variables are additive (≈ 5% to 15% of total unique variance explained). The study of exponential growth factors in the initial stages of the pandemic further shows that BCG vaccination exerts a significant effect (up to 35% of unique variance explained). 
Conclusions: Overall, these findings corroborate the hypothesis that BCG vaccination and exposure to tuberculosis may induce a non-specific protection against the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after accounting for a large number of confounding influences. However, given the potential public-health benefits, our results indicate that the hypothesis deserves further attention and should not be hastily dismissed."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Sala_covid_3om44	By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country’s policy concerning BCG vaccine administration.

Governments the world over have instituted different measures to increase social distancing but information on their effectiveness in reducing mobility is lacking. We analyzed the mobility data from 41 cities to look at the effect of these interventions. The median mobility across cities on March 2, 2020 was 100% (IQR: 94%, 107%), which decreased to a median of 10% (IQR: 7%, 17%) on March 26, 2020.

TRENDS IN PERCEPTION OF COVID-19 IN POLISH INTERNET	Jarynowski	Andrzej	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20090993	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"INTRODUCTION: Due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, there is an urgent need to analyse COVID-19 epidemic perception in Poland. This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time.
METHODS: We study the perception of COVID-19 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet on platforms: Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry, from January 2020 to 29.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.20). We present trend analysis with a support of natural language processing techniques.
RESULTS: We identified seven temporal major clusters of interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Social distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield, 7) Restrictions releasing. There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease around 11/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term antiviral mask in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia SARS-CoV-2 as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Jarynowski_covid_yl7n8	Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19	Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19	1	2604	(x1: 438.86 y1: 641.77) (x2: 305.02 y2: 663.46)	increase in incidence can be linked with decrease of “Koronawirus” search	increase in incidence can be linked with decrease of “Koronawirus” search	7	1792	(x1: 341.11 y1: 689.29) (x2: 171.05 y2: 710.98)	We detected time lags between official SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk perception	time lags between official SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk perception (operationalized as searching for “Koronawirus” on Google search) were detected by calculating the autocorrelation factor per day across time.	7	1620	(x1: 71.06 y1: 672.01) (x2: 405.01 y2: 676.54)	Official COVID-19 incidence correlates only weakly positively or even negatively (Fig. 6) with measured interest value so risk perception in Poland is significantly unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring infections	Official COVID-19 incidence correlates negatively (Fig. 6) with measured interest value so risk perception in Poland is significantly unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring infections - from Figure 6, autocorrelation factor (ACF) for “google (search) coronavirus” on lag day 7 = ~-0.6. 	8	1075	(x1: 449.58 y1: 360.68) (x2: 437.80 y2: 399.77)	Andrzej Jarynowski	ajarynowski@gmail.com	1.0	yl7n8	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	na	False

Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission.
Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period).
Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals).

Is the spread of COVID-19 across countries influenced by environmental, economic and social factors?	Hossain	Mohammad Alamgir	2020.0	2020-04-11	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058164	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	The SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged from Wuhan, China is spreading all over the world in an unprecedented manner, causing millions of infections and thousands of deaths. However, the spread of the disease across countries and regions are not even. Why some countries and regions are more affected than some other countries and regions? We employ simple statistical methods to investigate any linkage between the severity of the disease and the environmental, economic, and social factors of countries. The estimation results indicate that the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection is higher in countries with lower yearly average temperatures, higher economic openness, and stronger political democracy. However, findings of this analysis should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind the fact that statistical relations do not necessarily imply causation.

Experience with Social Distancing Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Implications for Public Health Messaging	Moore	Ryan C	2020.0	2020-04-11	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057067	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Our goal is to inform ongoing public health policy on the design and communication of COVID-19 social distancing measures to maximize compliance. We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study.

In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response (≥30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values &lt; .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk.

We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas &gt; .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all &gt; 60%; all p values &lt; .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents.

Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Moore_covid_gy987	Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all ​p​ values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons).

Social distancing to slow the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic: an interrupted time-series analysis	Siedner	Mark J	2020.0	2020-04-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052373	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: Social distancing measures to address the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic may have significant health, social, and economic impacts. 
Objective: To estimate the mean change in state-level COVID-19 epidemic growth before versus after the implementation of statewide social distancing measures. 
Design: Interrupted time-series analysis. 
Setting: United States.
Measurements: Our primary exposure was time in relation to implementation of the first statewide social distancing measure. The pre-implementation period began 14 days prior to implementation and included up to 3 days after implementation to account for incubation. Post-implementation began 4 days after, up to and including March 30. Our primary outcome was the COVID-19 growth rate, calculated as the log of daily COVID-19 cases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day.
Results: All states applied some form of statewide social distancing between March 10-27. The mean daily COVID-19 growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by an additional 0.8% per day; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P=0.002). This reduction corresponds to an increase in doubling time of the epidemic from 3.3 days (before) to 5.0 days (at 14 days after implementation).
Limitations: Potential bias due to the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. 
Conclusion: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth.

This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals performance.
Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety.
Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%.

The Immediate Effect of COVID-19 Policies on Social Distancing Behavior in the United States	Abouk	Rahi	2020.0	2020-04-10	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057356	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	Anecdotal evidence points to the effectiveness of COVID-19 social distancing policies, however, their effectiveness vis-a-vis what is driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied. Policy variations across US states create a natural experiment to study the causal impact of each policy. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, location-based mobility, and daily state-level data on COVID-19 tests and confirmed cases, we rank policies based on their effectiveness. We show that statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest causal impact on reducing social interactions. In contrast, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies were already reaped from non-policy mechanisms. Moreover, stay-at-home policy results in a steady decline in confirmed cases, starting from ten days after implementation and reaching a 37% decrease after fifteen days, consistent with the testing practices and incubation period of the disease.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Abouk_covid_4qm7q	They show that while strong policies such asstatewide stay home mandate and non-essential business closure have strong causal impact on reducing socialinteractions, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies (such as large gathering ban and school closuremandates) are already reaped from non-policy mechanisms such as voluntary actions and public awareness.

Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts flattened curves for the spread of COVID-19	Berg	Martha K	2020.0	2020-04-07	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054163	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	BCG vaccination may reduce the risk of a range of infectious diseases, and, if so, could serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we compared countries that mandated BCG vaccination at least until 2000 with to countries that did not (139 countries in total). To minimize any systematic effects of reporting biases, we analyzed the rate of the day-by-day increase in both confirmed cases and deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Berg_covid_1jm68	Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks.

The Social and Economic Factors Underlying the Incidence of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in US Counties	Mukherji	Nivedita	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091041	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	This paper uncovers the socioeconomic and health/lifestyle factors that can explain the differential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on different parts of the United States. Using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for US counties over a 20-day period, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have a high incidence of both reported cases and deaths. The unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths. Counties with higher income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases. There is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports. Counties with high concentrations of non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrant populations have a higher incidence of both cases and deaths. The distributions of health risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes. The stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Mukerji_covid_rb9jn	The paper finds that counties withhigh per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths.

"Effects of home confinement on mental health and lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak: Insight from the ""ECLB-COVID19"" multi countries survey"	AMMAR	ACHRAF	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091017	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background:
Although recognised as effective measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and self-isolation, have been suggested to generate burden throughout the population. To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. 
Method:
Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period.
Results:
1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P &lt; 0.001; 0.43 ≤ d ≤ 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period. 
Conclusion:
These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL)."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Ammar_covid_bmjzb	The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 ≤ d ≤ 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing  psychosocial  and  emotional  disorders  (10%  to  16.5%)	The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 ≤ d ≤ 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing  psychosocial  and  emotional  disorders  (10%  to  16.5%).	3	1097	(x1: 210.41 y1: 531.74) (x2: 393.27 y2: 592.39)	social  distancing  would  negatively  affect  mental  and  emotional  wellbeing  via | decreased adherence to healthy diet.	social distancing will negatively affect mental and emotional wellbeing via decreased adherence to healthy diet.	7 | 7	285 | 451	(x1: 167.30 y1: 167.37) (x2: 545.80 y2: 172.82) | (x1: 434.83 y1: 194.97) (x2: 123.14 y2: 228.02)	Pearson product-moment correlation tests  were  used  to  assess  possible  relationships  between  the  “before-after”  Δ  of  the  assessed multidimension total scores.

COVID-19 is rapidly changing: Examining public perceptions and behaviors in response to this evolving pandemic	Seale	Holly	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091298	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late 2019, communities have been required to rapidly adopt community mitigation strategies rarely used before, or only in limited settings. This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors.

Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. 

Results: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high.  84.9% had performed ≥1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93.4% performed ≥1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI 3-9.0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0).

Interpretation: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Seale_covid_q1wqo	Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 5·5, 95% CI 3-9·0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4·3, 95% CI:  2·8-6·9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1·8, 95% CI 1·1-3·0).

Correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and risk and severity of COVID-19 at the national level in the European Union: an ecological study.	González-Marrón	Adrián	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083352	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the receptor for different coronaviruses, including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous studies suggested the hypothesis that nicotine could downregulate the expression of the ACE2. Due to the high level of nicotine intake, the objective of this preliminary study was to assess, at the ecological level, the correlation between tobacco smoking and the attack rate and severity of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU). We have found that there is a statistically significant negative correlation between the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the attack rate of COVID-19 in member states of the EU [Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.476 (95% confidence interval -0.117, -0.725) (p-value = 0.012)], meaning that in member states with a higher age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking the attack rate of COVID-19 has been so far lower.

Social distancing and movement constraint as the most likely factors for COVID-19 outbreak control in Brazil	Baumgartner	Matheus T	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088013	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	As thousands of new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, there is an increasing demand to understand the factors underlying the spread of this disease. Using country-level data, we modeled the early growth in the number of cases for over 480 cities in all Brazilian states. As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19. Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city- and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. Moreover, we reinforce that social distancing protocols are fundamental to avoid critical scenarios and the collapse of healthcare systems. We also predict that economic-induced decisions for relaxing social distancing might have catastrophic consequences, especially in large cities.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Baumgartner_covid_d6o9j	As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19.

Characteristics of patients presenting, and not presenting, to the emergency department during the early days of COVID-19	Westgard	Bjorn C	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20090795	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Objective: Societal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a substantial effect upon the number of patients seeking healthcare.  An initial step in estimating the impact of these changes is characterizing the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred.

Methods: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics and diagnoses for all patient visits to the ED of an urban Level-1 trauma center before and after the state declaration and compared them to visits from a similar period in 2019.  We estimated the ratios of the before and after periods using Poisson regression, calculated the percent change with respect to 2019 for total ED visits, patient characteristics, and diagnoses, and then evaluated the interactions between each factor and the overall change in ED visits. 

Results: There was a significant 35.2% drop in overall ED visits after the state declaration.  Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain.  Significantly disproportionate increases were seen in ED visits for potential symptoms of COVID-19, including URIs, shortness of breath, and chest pain.

Conclusions:  Patient concerns about health care settings and public health have significantly altered care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall and differential declines in ED visits for certain demographic groups and disease processes should prompt efforts to encourage care-seeking and research to monitor for the morbidity and mortality that is likely to result from delayed or deferred care."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Westgard_covid_q1wq7	Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain.

Effects of COVID-19 home confinement on physical activity and eating behaviour Preliminary results of the ECLB-COVID19 international online-survey	AMMAR	ACHRAF	2020.0	2020-05-08	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20072447	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Abstract
Background
Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have enforced numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.
Methods
Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions.
Results
1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly.
Conclusion
While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Ammar_covid_jr860	The  COVID-19  home  confinement  had  a  negative  effect  on  all intensities  of  PA  (vigorous,  moderate,  walking  and  overall).

Politicizing the COVID-19 Pandemic: Ideological Differences in Adherence to Social Distancing	Rothgerber	Hank	2020.0	2020-04-22	10.31234/osf.io/k23cv	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Data from two MTurk studies with U.S. respondents (total N =1,153) revealed an ideological divide in adherence to social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, political conservatism inversely predicted compliance with behaviors aimed at preventing the spread of the COVID-19. Differences in reported social distancing were mediated by divergent perceptions of the health risk posed by COVID-19 (Studies 1 and 2), which were explained by differences in self-reported knowledge of COVID-19 (Study 1) and perceived media accuracy in covering the pandemic (Studies 1 and 2). The politicization of COVID-19 may have prompted conservatives to discount mainstream media reports of the severity of the virus, leading them to downplay its health risks and consequently adherence less to social distancing protocols. These effects hold when controlling for key demographic characteristics as well as psychological variables, including belief in science and COVID-19-related anxiety. Thus, political ideology may uniquely explain COVID-19 behavior.

While crucial to limiting the spread of the virus, “social distancing” may lead to severe psychological consequences, especially in lonely individuals. We used cross-sectional (n=380) and longitudinal (n=74) designs to investigate the links between loneliness, mental health symptoms (MHS) and COVID-19 risk perception and affective response in young adults who implemented social distancing during the first two weeks of the state of epidemic threat in Poland. Loneliness was correlated with MHS and with affective response to COVID-19’s threat to health. However, increased worry about the social isolation and heightened risk perception for financial problems was observed in lonelier individuals. The cross-lagged influence of the initial affective response to COVID-19 on subsequent levels of loneliness was also found. Thus, the reciprocal connections between loneliness and COVID-19 response may be of crucial importance for MHS during COVID-19 crisis.

Funny but aversive: A large-scale survey on the emotional response to Covid-19 humor in the Italian population during the lockdown	Bischetti	Luca	2020.0	2020-05-04	10.31234/osf.io/efk93	na	Center for Open Science	covid	In tragic circumstances, it is not uncommon to see an upsurge in the generation of disaster jokes, which humorously depict the macabre aspects of ongoing crises. Many of such jokes appeared also at the time of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, often becoming viral. However, little is known about the emotional response to disaster jokes, let alone Covid-19 ones. With a large-scale survey completed during Italy’s nationwide lockdown, we studied the appreciation, i.e., funniness and aversiveness, of Covid-19 humor. Using a mixed models approach, we also analyzed the role of personality factors and psychological distance. Results showed that Covid-19 humor is associated with a mark of aversiveness, greater than for non-pandemic humor. Individuals more inclined to use humor to cope with uneasy circumstances perceived Covid-19 humor as funnier and less aversive. Furthermore, the perceived risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 amplified Covid-19 humor aversiveness, while greater spatial distance from the Italian epicenter of the contagion allowed to deeper enjoy humor both related and not-related to Covid-19. These findings should raise awareness on the emotional correlates to Covid-19 humor, of possible support in deciding whether and with whom to joke on the pandemic in social and political communication.

Modeling compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines: The critical role of trust in science	Plohl	Nejc	2020.0	2020-04-06	10.31234/osf.io/6a2cx	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The ongoing coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are deliberately disregarded or ignored by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 617 participants took part in the online survey and answered several questions related to socio-demographic variables, political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation, intellectual curiosity, trust in science, COVID-19 risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p &amp;lt; .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .032, SMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

Why are Conservatives Less Concerned about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) than Liberals? Testing Experiential Versus Political Explanations	Conway	Lucian Gideon	2020.0	2020-04-13	10.31234/osf.io/fgb84	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Given that much research suggests conservatives are more sensitive to disease threat, it is curious that conservatives in the U.S. seem less concerned than liberals with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  Across three studies totaling nearly 1,000 participants, we evaluated two different potential reasons why conservatives are less concerned: Experiential (conservatives are less directly affected by the outbreak than liberals) versus Political (conservatives hold COVID-specific political beliefs that make them motivated to reduce their concern).  All three studies consistently showed evidence that motivated political (and not experiential) reasons more strongly underlie conservatives’ lack of concern for COVID-19. Whereas experience with (e.g., knowing people with symptoms) and impacts of (e.g., financial hardships resulting from COVID-19) the disease did not consistently mediate the conservatism-COVID concern relationship, COVID-specific Political Beliefs (e.g., opposition to government restrictions) did consistently mediate the key relationship.  Pooled analyses further suggested that, while it did not strongly mediate the relationship, experience nonetheless provided a boundary condition for the conservatismperceived threat relationship: As experience/impacts with COVID-19 increased, ideology played less of a role in predicting perceived threat.  Taken together, this evidence suggests that (1) conservatives’ lack of concern with the pandemic is not based in direct experience but rather motivated by desired political outcomes.  However, it further suggests that (2) as experiences and impact of COVID-19 grow, the ideological effect on COVID-19 threat diminishes.  We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this set of findings.

Preliminary Investigation of the Association Between COVID-19 and Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the U.S.	Ammerman	Brooke A.	2020.0	2020-04-06	10.31234/osf.io/68djp	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Evidence suggests that the negative consequences of COVID-19 may extend far beyond its considerable death toll, having a significant impact on psychological well-being. Prior work has highlighted that previous epidemics are linked to elevated suicide rates, however, there is no research to date on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States. Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and attempts. Further, we found that a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for increased suicide risk screening and access to mental health services. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services in order to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.

Misbehaving in the Corona Crisis: The Role of Anxiety and Unfounded Beliefs	Erceg	Nikola	2020.0	2020-04-10	10.31234/osf.io/cgjw8	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The aim of our study was to explore psychological determinants of COVID-19 responsible behavior. We focused on trait anxiety and worry about the corona crisis, and knowledge/unfounded beliefs about coronavirus and thinking dispositions (cognitive reflection, actively open-minded thinking, faith in intuition and science curiosity) that should drive knowledge/beliefs. Additionally, we tested the effectiveness of a one-shot intervention based on the “consider-the-opposite” debiasing technique in changing COVID-19 unfounded beliefs. We used a convenience sample of 1439 participants who filled in the questionnaire on-line. Comparison of latent means showed that the “consider-the-opposite” intervention did not affect unfounded beliefs. Structural equation model, conducted on 880 participants with data on all variables, indicated that greater worry and weaker endorsement of COVID-19 unfounded beliefs lead to more responsible COVID-19 behavior. The relationship of trait anxiety and thinking dispositions with the criterion was mediated through the worry about COVID-19 and unfounded beliefs about COVID-19, respectively.

COVID-19 Increases Online Emotional and Health-Related Searches	Du	Hongfei	2020.0	2020-05-02	10.31234/osf.io/5gskw	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has powerfully shaped people’s lives. The current work investigated the emotional and behavioral reactions people experience in response to COVID-19 through their internet searches. We hypothesized that when the prevalence rates of COVID-19 increase, people would experience more fear, which in turn would predict greater rates of protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying. Methods: Prevalence rates of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, were used as predictors. Fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying were indicated by internet search volumes in Google Trends. Cross-temporal analyses were conducted.Results: We found that increased prevalence rates of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. This pattern was consistent across four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Fear-related emotions explained the associations between COVID-19 and the content of their information searches. Conclusion: Findings suggest that exposure to prevalence rates of COVID-19 and fear-related emotions may motivate people to search for relevant health-related information so as to protect themselves from the pandemic.

In the current preregistered research, we recruited 1,088 Turkish participants and investigated (a) individual differences associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; (2) whether such conspiracy beliefs are related to the level of preventive measures; and (3) other individual differences that might be related to the preventive measures. Higher faith in intuition, uncertainty avoidance, impulsivity, generic conspiracy beliefs, religiosity, and right-wing ideology, and a lower level of cognitive reflection were associated with a higher level of belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. There was no association between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and preventive measures while perceived risk was positively and impulsivity negatively correlated with preventive measures. We discuss the implications and directions for future research.

Adolescents’ Prosocial Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations with Mental Health and Community Attachments	Alvis	Lauren	2020.0	2020-05-07	10.31234/osf.io/2s73n	na	Center for Open Science	covid	This study examined adolescents’ prosocial experiences as both actors and recipients during COVID-19 and assessed whether these experiences were associated with their mental health and community attachments. Adolescents (N=437; 78% female) were recruited across the US using social media and reported on their COVID-19 prosocial experiences (giving, receiving help), mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, belongingness), and community attachments (social responsibility, social trust, self-interest). Greater engagement in COVID-19 prosocial behavior was associated with greater anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, and social responsibility. Receiving more COVID-19 help was associated with lower depressive symptoms and higher belongingness, social trust, and self-interest. Findings highlight the importance of furthering our understanding of these connections in adolescence to help inform post-pandemic recovery and relief efforts.

Neuroticism and Emotional Risk During the Covid-19 Pandemic	Kroencke	Lara	2020.0	2020-05-10	10.31234/osf.io/8c6nh	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Large-scale health crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, may evoke negative affective responses, which are closely linked to psychological maladjustment and psychopathology. Here, we shed light on the role of the personality trait neuroticism in predicting who is at risk and why. In a large-scale experience-sampling study based on a German convenience sample (N = 1,609; 38,120 momentary reports), individuals high in neuroticism experienced more negative affect in their daily lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The effects of neuroticism on negative affect were substantially stronger than those of sociodemographic factors and personally experienced health threats. Underlying mechanisms included (a) higher attention to Covid-19-related information and higher engagement in Covid-19-related worries (crisis preoccupation), and (b) stronger negative affect during this preoccupation (affective reactivity). These findings highlight that global pandemics put not only people’s physical health at stake but also their psychological well-being and offer concrete starting points for large-scale prevention efforts.

Predictors of attitudes and misperceptions about COVID-19 in Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.A.	Pennycook	Gordon	2020.0	2020-04-14	10.31234/osf.io/zhjkp	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to humanity. Yet there seems to be substantial variation across individuals in knowledge and concern about COVID-19, as well as in the willingness to change behaviors in the face of the pandemic. Here, we investigated the roles of political ideology and cognitive sophistication in explaining these differences across the U.S.A. (N = 689), the U.K. (N = 642), and Canada (N = 644) using preregistered surveys conducted in late March, 2020. We found evidence that political polarization around COVID-19 risk perceptions, behavior change intentions, and misperceptions was greater in the U.S. than in the U.K.. However, Canada and the U.S. did not strongly differ in their level of polarization. Furthermore, in all three countries, cognitive sophistication (indexed by analytic thinking, numeracy, basic science knowledge, and bullshit skepticism) was a negative predictor of COVID-19 misperceptions – and in fact was a stronger predictor of misperceptions than political ideology (despite being unrelated to risk perceptions or behavior change intentions). Finally, we found no evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization for any of our COVID-19 measures. Thus, although there is some evidence for political polarization of COVID-19 in the U.S. and Canada (but not the U.K.), accurate beliefs about COVID-19 (albeit not intentions to act) are broadly associated with the quality of one’s reasoning skill regardless of political ideology or background polarization.

Covid-19 by Race and Ethnicity: A National Cohort Study of 6 Million United States Veterans	Rentsch	Christopher T.	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099135	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: There is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-19.

Objective: To compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. 

Design: Retrospective cohort study.

Setting: United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Participants: 5,834,543 individuals in care, among whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and May 4, 2020.

Exposures: Self-reported race/ethnicity.

Main outcome measures: We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. 

Results: Among all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 12.5]). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (black vs white: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.12; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.96), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (black vs white: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87).

Conclusions: Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care.

Unequal impact of structural health determinants and comorbidity on COVID-19 severity and lethality in older Mexican adults: Looking beyond chronological aging	Bello-Chavolla	Omar Yaxmehen	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.20098699	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. The population of Mexico is younger, yet the impact of COVID-19 on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging.
METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for improving COVID-19 mortality risk prediction.
RESULTS: We analyzed 7,029 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged ≥60 years. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a comprehensive geriatric care approach."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Bello_Chavolla_covid_rb96l	High  social 35  lag  indexes  and  access  to  private  care  were  predictors  of  COVID-19  severity  and  mortality.

Is sleep apnoea a risk factor for Covid-19? Findings from a retrospective cohort study	Feuth	Thijs	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20098319	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: 
In the early phase of the coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic, Southwest Finland remained relatively spared. By the 3rd of May 2020, a total of 28 patients have been admitted to the Turku University Hospital. In this paper, we explore baseline characteristics in order to identify risk for severe Covid-19 disease and critical care admission.

Methods
For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson's chi-square test.

Results
Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p&lt;0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87% versus 93%, p=0.09). 

Discussion
OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19. Furthermore, we identified high CRP, PCT and possibly oxygen saturation as useful clinical measures to identify patients at risk for critical care."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Feuth_covid_bmjgj	C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p<0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047).

Is it Just About Physical Health? An Internet-Based Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on University Students in Jordan Using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale	Al-Tammemi	Ala'a B.	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20102343	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background 
Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at the local, national, and international levels were directed primarily to mitigate the spread of the disease. However, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health were not thoroughly investigated yet, and studies that report the mental health risks of COVID-19 are still scarce.

Objectives 
This study aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among university students in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated national measures.

Methods 
A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire, The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities , and (iv) the students most serious concern during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results 
A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n=199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD:9.4). However, the mean of total K10 distress scores had no significant association with gender (P=0.57). Age was negatively associated with total K10 distress scores (P=0.0013). Concerning severity, most of the respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n=265, 69.5%), and females were found to have a statistically significant higher percentage in mild and severe psychological distress (P= 0.035), (P=0.016); respectively. 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P&lt;0.0001). The most common coping strategy among students was Spending more time on social media (n=269, 70.6%). Besides, 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of medications to cope with COVID-19 related distress, and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning was their most serious concern.

Conclusion 
The COVID-19 control measures resulted in a severe disruption of various human life activities, and this could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. A nationwide psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordan response strategy in combating the COVID-19, considering students and other vulnerable groups in Jordan.

Mental wellbeing in the Bangladeshi healthy population during nationwide lockdown over COVID-19: an online cross-sectional survey	Hossain	Ahmed	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20102210	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: We aim to profile and contextualize the level of positive mental health among the healthy population during the beginning of nationwide lockdown over COVID-19 in Bangladesh.
Design and setting: An online sample of 1404 healthy individuals was collected through the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Bangladesh.  The survey was conducted between March 27, 2020, and April 7, 2020, following the Bangladesh government's lockdown announcement.
Method: A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and sociodemographic information was posted to an online survey.
Results: The mean wellbeing value was 38.4 (standard deviation, 11.2), indicating a lower mental health level exist in adults. Also, the mean wellbeing score for males was 39.0 (10.8) units compared to females with scores 37.0 (11.2), and the highest scores for government workers was 41.2 (11.8). Unemployment (35.6) or business employees (35.5) have a lower level of mental health. In the lockout days, the elderly population of age 50 years and above had high day-to-day variation of wellbeing scores. After confounding adjustment in multivariable linear regression models, there found a better wellbeing scores for males (estimate=1.79, 95% CI=0.5, 3.1), and government-workers (estimate=5.86, 95% CI=2.2, 9.5). Moreover, the never-married female had significantly higher well-being score compared to married women (estimate=3.31, 95% CI=1.0, 5.7).
Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with low mental wellbeing that indicates depression in our study. Suggestions for improvement will be implemented to promote the mental health to women, unemployed and business communities. Older people 50 years of age and over reported a greater day-to-day variation in their mental health. The married women with their decreased mental wellbeing should be given special consideration.

Decline in Emergent and Urgent Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic	Kazi	Dhruv S	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20096602	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	Due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there are concerns that patients may be avoiding care for emergent and urgent health conditions due to fear of contagion or as an unintentional consequence of government orders to postpone non-essential services.  We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patient encounters for select emergent or urgent diagnoses at a large tertiary-care academic medical center in Boston. Inpatient diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and outpatient but urgent diagnoses included new referrals for breast and hematologic malignancies. For each condition, we used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the proportional change in number of encounters during the pandemic (March-April 2020) compared with earlier in the same year (January-February 2020), using equivalent periods in 2019 as a control. After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI  (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P&lt;0.001) (Table). In the ambulatory setting, there was a reduction in referrals for breast cancer and hematologic cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance until the month after the onset of the pandemic. Our findings suggest an urgent need for public health messaging to ensure that patients continue to seek care for acute emergencies.  In addition, decisions by health systems regarding when to reinitiate non-emergent care should carefully factor in the harms of delayed diagnosis and treatment occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Kazi_covid_o1o8n	After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI  (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P<0.001)	After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P<0.001)	2	945	(x1: 507.88 y1: 339.37) (x2: 335.88 y2: 426.60)	marked decline in presentations for emergent cardiovascular conditions during the pandemic.

Evaluation of the US governors decision when to issue stay-at-home orders [Running title: When to shut down: the Weber-Fechner law describes the timing of U. S. governors decisions to issue stay-at-home orders]	Djulbegovic	Benjamin	2020.0	2020-05-18	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20093633	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Objectives To evaluate if the US governors decision to issue the stay-at-home orders reflects the classic Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics, the amount by which a stimulus (such as number of cases or deaths) must increase in order to be noticed-the just noticeable difference- as a fraction of the intensity of that stimulus.

Design A prospective observational study using data on the daily number of infected patients and deaths from the New York Times daily database. 

Setting 50 States and the District of Columbia

Participants  All individuals judged to be positive for the coronavirus or to have died from COVID19.
Main outcome measures Number of people diagnosed with or died from COVID19.

Results  We found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics.  Both the number of infections (p=&lt;0.0001; R2=0.79) and deaths  (p&lt;0.0001; R2=0.63) were highly statistically significantly associated with the decision to issue the stay-at-home orders. The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths within their state, an additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. We also observed a clear dose-response relationship in the Cox model: the larger the number of cases, or deaths, the higher the probability that the stay-at-home order will be made. When the number of deaths reached 256 or the number of infected people was greater than 16,384, the probability of issuing a stay-at-home order was close to 100%.

The Influence of Contextual Factors on the Initial Phases of the COVID-19 Outbreak across U.S. Counties	Messner	Wolfgang	2020.0	2020-05-16	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101030	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Objectives: To examine the influence of county- and state-level characteristics on the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak across U.S. counties up to April 14, 2020.
Methods: We used a statistical exponential growth model for the outbreak. Contextual factors at county- and state-level were simultaneously tested with a multilevel linear model. All data was publicly available.
Results: Collectivism was positively associated with the outbreak rate. The racial and ethnic composition of counties contributed to outbreak differences, affecting Black/African and Asian Americans most. Counties with a higher median age had a stronger outbreak, as did counties with more people below the age of 18. Higher income, education, and personal health were generally associated with a lower outbreak. Obesity was negatively related to the outbreak. Smoking was negatively related, but only directionally informative. Air pollution was another significant contributor to the outbreak, but population density did not give statistical significance.

Association of national Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination policy with COVID-19 epidemiology: an ecological study in 78 countries	Kuratani	Norifumi	2020.0	2020-05-16	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100156	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	A possible association between national Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower COVID-19 incidence has been suggested in some preprint papers. Using publicly accessible databases, I explored associations of national BCG vaccination policy with COVID-19 epidemiology in 78 countries. Data collection was conducted from April 25 to May 5, 2020. I compared countries that have a current universal BCG vaccination policy (BCG countries), with countries that currently lack such a policy (non-BCG countries). The mixed effect model revealed national BCG policy decreases in the country-specific risk of death by COVID-19, correspond to odds ratio of 0.446 (95% confidence intervals 0.323 - 0.614, P =1×10-5). In BCG countries, the case increase rate was attenuated marginally by 25.4% (95% CI 3.0 to 42.7, P=0.029) as compared with those of the non-BCG countries.

Number of International Arrivals Predicts Severity of the first Global Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic	Pana	Tiberiu A	2020.0	2020-05-16	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100677	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: Reported death rates from different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic vary. Lack of universal testing and death underreporting make between-country comparisons difficult. The country-level determinants of COVID-19 mortality are unknown.
Objective: Derive a measure of COVID-related death rates that is comparable across countries and identify its country-level predictors.
Methods: An ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting &gt;25 COVID-related deaths until May 1, 2020 were included. The outcome was the mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential predictors assessed were most recently published Demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita; environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-April)), co-morbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health systems parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population and international arrivals). Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data.
Results: Thirty-one countries were included. Of all country-level predictors included in the multivariable model, only total number of international arrivals was significantly associated with the mean death rate: Beta 0.3798 (95% Confidence Interval 0.2414, 0.5182), P &lt;0.001.

Understanding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures: an empirical model of stress.	Wissmath	Bartholomäus	2020.0	2020-05-16	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100313	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	Research suggests that epidemics and corresponding containment measures have negative consequences to the individual and cause stress. The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n=1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced even higher levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. We conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms during lockdown. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e. state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. To prevent stress, authorities should explain containment measures well, highlight positive aspects of the crisis, address worries, and facilitate support.	medRxiv	medRxiv	Wissmath_covid_0qm99	In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced even higher levels of stress.

Factors linked to changes in mental health outcomes among Brazilians in quarantine due to COVID-19	Filgueiras	Alberto	2020.0	2020-05-16	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099374	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis of global proportions with a significant impact on the country of Brazil. The aims of this investigation were to track changes and risk factors for mental health outcomes during state-mandated quarantine. Adults residing in Brazil (n = 360, 37.9 years of age, 68.9% female) were surveyed at the start of quarantine and 1 month later. Outcomes assessed included perceived stress, state anxiety and depression. Aside from demographics, behaviors and attitudes assessed included exercise, diet, use of tele-psychotherapy and number of COVID-19 related risk factors, such as perceived risk of COVID-19, information overload, and feeling imprisoned. Overall, all mental health outcomes worsened from Time 1 to time 2, although there was a significant gender x time interaction for stress. 9.7% of the sample reported stress above the clinical cut-off (2 SD above mean), while 8.0% and 9.4% were above this cutoff for depression and anxiety, respectively. In repeated measures analysis, female gender, worsening diet and excess of COVID-19 information was related to all mental health outcomes. Changes in diet for the worse were associated with increases in anxiety. Exercise frequency was clearly related to state anxiety (0 days/week &gt;	6 days/week). Those who did aerobic exercise did not have any increase in depression. Use of tele-psychotherapy predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety.

Behaviors and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from a cross-national Facebook survey	Perrotta	Daniela	2020.0	2020-05-15	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096388	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"In the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, the mitigation and containment of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic relies on behavioral changes. Timely data on attitudes and behaviors are thus necessary to develop optimal intervention strategies and to assess the consequences of the pandemic for different demographic groups. We developed a rapid response monitoring system via a continuously run online survey (the ""COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey"") across eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States). The survey was specifically designed to collect key information on people's health status, behaviors, close social contacts, and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an innovative approach to recruit participants via targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns in order to generate balanced samples for post-stratification. 
In this paper, we present results for the period from March 13-April 19, 2020. We estimate important differences by sex: women show a substantially higher perception of threat along with a lower level of confidence in the health system. This is paralleled by sex-specific behaviors, with women more likely to adopt a wide range of preventive behaviors. We thus expect behavior to serve as a protective factor for women. Our findings also show a higher level of awareness and concern among older respondents, in line with the evidence that the elderly are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19. While across all the samples respondents were less concerned for themselves than for their country or for the world, we also observed substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity in terms of confidence in institutions and responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Perrotta_covid_5jb5l	This is paralleled by sex-specific behaviors, with womenmore likely to adopt a wide range of preventive behaviors.

Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in France: a national assessment of at-risk populations	Chaix	Benjamin	2020.0	2020-05-15	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20093161	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Introduction
More than 2.5 billion people in the world are currently in lockdowns to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Psychological Distress (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of pandemics is not well known. The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown.

We recruited patients in 4 groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Index (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients characteristics in order to better identify the one who were the most at-risk.

Results
The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD=13,71), 7.96% (141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD=8,14). In total, 38.06% (674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI ≥15). An ANOVA analysis showed that sex (p=0.00132), unemployment (p=7.16x10-6) and depression (p=7.49x10-7) were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588). 

Conclusion
Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at increased risk to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Chaix_covid_6dlwo	Patients  using  their  smartphone  or  computer  more  than  one  hour  a  day  also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588)	Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588)	1	2235	(x1: 182.40 y1: 652.35) (x2: 229.99 y2: 672.42)	patients  using  their  smartphone  or  computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score	Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day will have a higher PDI (psychological distress index) score.	8	1954	(x1: 325.96 y1: 561.87) (x2: 311.43 y2: 591.78)	ANOVA  was  performed  to  detect  patients’  attributes  with  a  significant  effect  on  PDI.

Depression and anxiety during 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study	Alyami	Hamad S	2020.0	2020-05-15	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096677	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: COVID 19 outbreak in 2020 was associated with a high rate of depression and anxiety among individuals in the affected countries. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of the COVID 19 epidemic on the psychological distress of residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Methods: A cross sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27th of March and 27th of April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD 7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety.
Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-Saudi residents, aged 50 years and above, divorced, retired, university students, and those with income (2000 to 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married, unemployed, and those with high income (&gt; 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.
Conclusions: There is a wide range of the Saudi residents who are at higher risk of mental illness during COVID 19 pandemic. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences during this pandemic, and provide mental support."	medRxiv	medRxiv	Alyami_covid_yl789	Saudi  individuals,  married, unemployed, and those with high income (> 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.

Health literacy of inland population in the mitigation phase 3.2. of COVID-19's pandemic in Portugal - a descriptive cohort study	Gomes da Silva	Joana	2020.0	2020-05-14	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098061	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted through respiratory droplets with a high transmission rate. There's still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, thus, preventive measures are the main key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment.
Material and methods: A cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.
Results: Our cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131), undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions to this pattern.
Conclusions: We observe a well-informed population. However, being a pandemic situation, we intend to identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allows a perspective of the current state/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, this study makes aware of how relevant the specific communication approaches are. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.

Early estimation of the risk factors for hospitalisation and mortality by COVID-19 in Mexico	Carrillo-Vega	Maria Fernanda	2020.0	2020-05-14	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098145	na	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	covid	"Background. With its high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that in Mexico there is a high risk of fatal complications from COVID-19. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47 SD 15.62, were analysed.  Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and &gt;=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years (OR 2.05, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 23.84, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p&lt;0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR=1.53, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and ≥75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years (OR 1.96, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR=2.10; p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR=2.57; p&lt;0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19.

Present research explored the psychological implications associated with covid-19 during the outbreak in 2020 till date. Pakistani media has given particular attention to this outbreak in the region. Three hundred and forty-seven undergraduate university students from Pakistan completeda battery of questionnaires focusing fear of Covid -19, associated safety behaviors, factual knowledge of covid-19and other psychological pointers hypothesized to be as predictors of anxious responses to covid-19 threat. The sample appeared to be fearful of covid-19 and this fear was related to disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns, body vigilance, contamination cognitions and general distress. Results suggested that tendency of overestimating severity of contamination and anxiety sensitivity towards physical concerns are significant predictors of Covid-19 related fear and consequent safety behaviors.

Collective narcissism predicts the belief and dissemination of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic	Sternisko	Anni	2020.0	2020-05-21	10.31234/osf.io/4c6av	na	Center for Open Science	covid	While COVID-19 was quietly spreading across the globe, conspiracy theories were finding loud voices on the internet. What contributes to the spread of these theories? In two national surveys (NTotal = 950) conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom, we identified national narcissism – a belief in the greatness of one’s nation that others do not appreciate – as a risk factor for the spread of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that national narcissism was strongly associated with the proneness to believe and disseminate conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, accounting for up to 22% of the variance. Further, we found preliminary evidence that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and national narcissism was linked to health-related behaviors and attitudes towards public policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our study expands previous work by illustrating the importance of identity processes in the spread of conspiracy theories during pandemics.

Conspiracy beliefs, chloroquine, and the rejection of vaccination: A conceptual replication-extension in the COVID-19 pandemic context	Bertin	Paul	2020.0	2020-05-22	10.31234/osf.io/rz78k	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Many conspiracy theories appeared along with the COVID-19 pandemic. Since it is documented that conspiracy theories negatively affect vaccination intentions, these beliefs might become a crucial matter in the near future. We conducted two cross-sectional studies examining the relations between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, vaccine attitudes and intention to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available. In an exploratory study 1 (N = 409), two subdimensions of COVID- 19 conspiracy theories were robust predictors of negative attitude toward vaccine science. These results were replicated and extended in a pre-registered study 2 (N = 396). Moreover, we found that COVID- 19 conspiracy beliefs (among which, conspiracy beliefs about chloroquine), as well as a conspiracy mentality (i.e., predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories) negatively predicted participants’ intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the future. Interestingly, none of the conspiracy beliefs referred directly to the dangers of the vaccines. Last, we observed a strikingly high level of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Implications for the pandemic and potential responses are discussed based on existing literature.

Irrational beliefs differentially predict adherence to guidelines and pseudoscientific practices during the COVID-19 pandemic	Teovanovic	Predrag	2020.0	2020-05-20	10.31234/osf.io/gefhn	na	Center for Open Science	covid	In the coronavirus “infodemic”, people are exposed to both official recommendations and to potentially dangerous pseudoscientific advice claimed to protect against COVID-19. We examined whether irrational beliefs predict adherence to COVID-19 guidelines as well as susceptibility to such misinformation. Irrational beliefs were indexed by cognitive intuition, Type I error cognitive biases, COVID-19 knowledge overestimation, and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Participants (N=407) reported (a) how often they followed guidelines (e.g., handwashing), (b) how often they engaged in pseudoscientific practices (e.g., consuming garlic, colloidal silver), and (c) their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conspiratorial beliefs consistently predicted all three outcomes. Cognitive intuition and knowledge overestimation predicted lesser, while cognitive biases predicted greater adherence to guidelines. Cognitive intuition and cognitive biases predicted greater use of pseudoscientific practices.

Scientific reasoning as a predictor of health-related beliefs and behaviors in the time of COVID-19	Cavojova	Vladimira	2020.0	2020-04-15	10.31234/osf.io/tfy5q	na	Center for Open Science	covid	We examined whether scientific reasoning predicts health-related beliefs and behaviors over and above the general analytic thinking ability in general public (N = 783, aged between 18 – 84 years). Health-related beliefs included: the anti-vaccination attitudes, conspiracy beliefs related to the COVID-19 disease, and some generic epistemically suspect beliefs related to health. Scientific reasoning predicted generic pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs related to health and also conspiracy beliefs related specifically to COVID-19. Crucially, scientific reasoning was a stronger independent predictor of unfounded beliefs (including anti-vaccination attitudes) than general analytic thinking, however, its role in the health-related behaviors was more modest.

Stable psychological traits predict perceived stress related to the COVID-19 outbreak	Flesia	Luca	2020.0	2020-04-24	10.31234/osf.io/yb2h8	na	Center for Open Science	covid	The unexpected COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown impositions are having a significant impact on people’s day-to-day life, confronting Western countries with hitherto unknown contagion threats and restrictions on freedoms. Given the serious effects of stress on physical and mental health, the stressful impact of the COVID-19 emergency represents an important public health issue. The present study assessed the stressful impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, identifying possible mediators of perceived stress (sociodemographic variables and stable psychological traits). High levels of perceived stress were found in the Italian population. Being female, having low income and living with other people were associated with higher levels of stress. Higher rates of emotional stability, self-control, positive coping style and internal locus of control were protective factors against psychological distress. These results may provide indications for early and targeted prevention and intervention programs.

Students under lockdown: Assessing change in students’ social networks and mental health during the COVID-19 crisis	Elmer	Timon	2020.0	2020-05-06	10.31234/osf.io/ua6tq	na	Center for Open Science	covid	This study investigates change in students’ social networks and mental health at the time of the COVID-19 crisis in April 2020. We surveyed multiple dimensions of social networks (pleasant interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) before and during the crisis among Swiss undergraduate students (N=212). We find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students’ levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. The results offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Liberate!” – Republicans Are More Willing to Get Back to Social Life Because They Are Less Scared of COVID-19	Briki	Walid	2020.0	2020-05-29	10.31234/osf.io/thuwd	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Grounded in the COVID-19 pandemic context in the United States, the study aimed at examining whether types of political ideology and types of political belongingness of the state’s governor could influence perceived COVID-19 threat and perceived gathering acceptability, and whether perceived COVID-19 threat could serve as a covariate. Native Americans, being either Republican or Democrat, living in a state governed by either a Republican or a Democrat, read a scenario about a banned social gathering. Results revealed that: (a) perceived COVID-19 threat was lower in Republicans than in Democrats, while perceived gathering acceptability was higher in Republicans than in Democrats; and (b) perceived COVID-19 threat mostly accounted for the impact of Republican ideology on perceived gathering acceptability. This research provides evidence that, relative to Democrats, Republicans are more willing to get back to the normal social life because they are less scared of being contaminated by the COVID-19 virus.

Looking out for Myself: Exploring the Relationship Between Conspiracy Mentality, Perceived Personal Risk and COVID-19 Prevention Measures	Marinthe	Gaëlle	2020.0	2020-05-29	10.31234/osf.io/cm9st	na	Center for Open Science	covid	Objectives. This research examined how conspiracy mentality may affect compliance with preventive health measures necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and the underlying motivations to comply. Design and Method. We conducted two cross-sectional studies (Study 1 N = 762, Study 2 N = 229) on a French population, measuring conspiracy mentality, compliance with preventive health measures, and perceived risks related to COVID-19. We also measured motivations to comply with preventive measures in Study 2.Results. We show that people high in conspiracy mentality are likely to engage in non-normative prevention behaviours (Study 1), but are less willing to comply with extreme preventive behaviours that are government-driven (Study 2). However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non-normative prevention behaviours. Conclusions. Our studies showcase how people high in conspiracy theorizing may (dis)engage with prevention behaviours, but that perceived risk and motivation to protect oneself could increase these individuals’ compliance.

When Private Optimism meets Public Despair: Dissociable effects on behavior and well-being	Globig	Laura K.	2020.0	2020-05-29	10.31234/osf.io/gbdn8	na	Center for Open Science	covid	When faced with a threat, peoples’ estimate of risk guides their response. When danger is to the self as well as to others two estimates are generated: the risk to oneself and the risk to others. As these estimates likely differ, it is unclear how exactly they drive a response. To answer this question, we studied a large representative sample of Americans facing the COVID-19 pandemic at two time points (N1=1145, N2=683). We discover a paradoxical duality: a tendency to be optimistic about one’s own risk of infection (private optimism) while at the same time to be pessimistic about the risk to others (public pessimism). These two estimates were found to be differentially related to affect and choice. First, private optimism, but not public pessimism, was associated with people’s positive feelings. The association between private optimism and positive affect was mediated by people’s sense of agency over their future. However, negative affect was related to both private risk perception and public risk perception. Second, people predominantly engaged in protective behaviors based on their estimated risk to the population rather than to themselves. This suggests that people were predominantly engaging in protective behaviors for the benefit of others. The findings are important for understanding how people’s beliefs about their own future and that of others are related to protective behaviors and well-being.
