original empirical research non-local or local brands ?
a multi-level investigation into confidence in brand origin identification and its strategic implications lianxi zhou & zhiyong yang & michael k. hui received : 21 september 2007 /accepted : 12 june 2009 /published online : 16 july 2009 # academy of marketing science 2009 abstract this article addresses a growing dilemma sur- rounding the strategic value of perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) among consumers in emerging economies .
building on recent research evidence from the brand origin literature , we introduce the concept of confidence in brand origin identification ( cbo ) and theorize its moderating impact on the value of pbf in explaining and predicting brand evaluation .
using a multi-level modeling technique , this study provides evidence showing that cbo moderates the effect of pbf on consumer evaluations of brand value .
moreover , the moderating influence of cbo is found to be more profound for local than for foreign brands .
managerial implications for building both global and local brands in emerging markets are discussed .

emerging market introduction one central construct that has emerged recently from the country-of-origin literature is that of “ perceived brand nonlocalness or foreignness ” ( batra et al .
2000 ) .
according to batra et al .
( 2000 ) , perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) refers to a consumer ’ s perception that a brand is of foreign or non-local origin .
as the authors clearly stated , pbf is different from the traditional country-of-origin construct documented in the literature because the latter is associated with one specific country , as is often reflected by the made-in label .
instead , pbf represents more generalized perceptions of a brand as of foreign images or appeals ( as opposed to the traditional made-in affiliations ) .
ample evidence has shown that foreign brands , especially those from western or other developed countries , benefit from consumer perceptions of non-local brand image associations ( e.g. , ger et al .
1993 ; sklair 1994 ) .
it has been explained that foreign image appeals are generally associated with a glamour that local brands can not compete with , especially among consumers in developing countries ( alden et al .
1999 ; batra et al .
2000 ) .
however , foreign image associations are not a privilege that only foreign brands have ; they may also be attached to local brands .
for example , most chinese consumers may perceive lenovo ( a chinese brand that acquired the personal computer division of ibm in december 2004 ) to be high in brand foreignness due to its prominent appearance in the global market .
similarly , eckhardt ( 2005 ) revealed that a local pizza brand in india was strongly associated with “ something foreign ” due to local consumers ’ impressions of pizza as a foreign product category .
in fact , an increasing number of firms in developing markets have attempted to take advantage of the equity of foreign ( mostly western ) country images , and to build and enhance the appeal of their products by using j. of the acad .

today , more and more firms from emerging economies are using foreign image association strategies as important components of their branding and marketing communica- tion strategies .
these firms believe that foreign appeals bring about a higher quality perception and increase social status for their brands ( e.g. , eckhardt 2005 ; ger and belk 1996 ; zhou and belk 2004 ; sklair 1994 ) .
in china , for instance , a study of printed advertisements for local brands in 130 nationally distributed consumer magazines has shown that over 12 % of the advertising models portrayed were judged to be non-chinese ( zhou and meng 1998 ) .
another study reported that 36 % of newly registered brands were said to have a foreign-sounding name ( zhou and belk 2004 ) .
c ’ estbon is a noticeable example .
c ’ estbon is a chinese brand of bottled water that uses non-chinese characters and pronunciation to convey connotations of something foreign .
this phenomenon has been described as “ imagined cosmopolitanism ” ( schein 2001 ) .
as a reflection of this phenomenon , recent research indicates that foreign brands have experienced mixed fortunes in some of the fast-developing markets .
although foreign brands may still be associated with an inherent glamour that makes local brands envious , there is a growing skepticism about this automatic cachet because consumers have started to wonder which brand is of local or non-local origin ( balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) .
as a result , there seems to be a growing backlash against foreign brands in the world ’ s fastest-growing emerging markets such as china ( ewing et al .
2002 ; crocker and tay 2004 ) .
global branding or localization strategies pursued by international players seem to further deepen consumer confusion regarding the authenticity of foreign image appeals ( neff 1999 ; zhang and schmitt 2001 ) .
to make things worse , the proliferation of foreign- looking local rivals and their associated lower-than- expected quality performance may have further attenuated consumers ’ trust in perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) , thereby reducing brand value .
according to a recent report by the boston consulting group ( 2008 ) , some consumers find foreign brand images no longer distinguishable or diagnostic in both product evaluations and subsequent purchase decisions .
this is a potentially neglected outcome of local versus non-local brand confusion , an issue recently raised in the fast-changing marketplace of emerging economies .
thus far , there has been a lack of research addressing the mixed picture of pbf .
to fill this gap , we have designed this study to address the following questions : ( 1 ) to what extent is perceived foreignness of a brand relevant and diagnostic to consumer evaluations of the brand ?
( 2 ) would foreign or local brands benefit more from perceived brand foreignness ?
( 3 ) how could we enhance the value of the perceived foreignness of a brand ?
to address these questions , we introduce a construct referred to as confidence in brand origin identifi- cation ( cbo ) and conceptualize it as a moderator that affects the effects of pbf on consumer evaluation of brand value .
reflecting consumers ’ limited knowledge of actual brand origin ( balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) , cbo is defined as a consumer ’ s belief in his/her judgment or attribution of a brand ’ s country of origin .
in a marketplace filled with uncertainty about actual brand origins due to the imitation strategies of local rivals and/or the localization movement of international players , consumers ’ subjective attribution of brand origin is expected to enhance the value of pbf on brand evaluation .
this could explain how consumers interpret things related to perceived country association when the rise of global branding and various misleading signifiers of brand origin information are prevalent in the global marketplace ( aaker and joachimsthaler 1999 ; heslop and papadopoulos 1993 ; thakor and kohli 1996 ) .
specifically , drawing upon the brands as signals litera- ture ( erdem and swait 1998 ) and the accessibility- diagnosticity theory ( feldman and lynch 1988 ) , the present study proposes that the signaling function of pbf increases its diagnostic value for brand evaluations when consumers are more confident in their attributions of a brand ’ s origin .
in other words , we anticipate cbo to be a distinct construct that is likely to enhance the effects of pbf on brand value in a marketplace that is increasingly confused with various foreign image appeals .
to our knowledge , the research presented here represents the first effort to advance our understanding of the boundary conditions of the effects of pbf on brand evaluation .
beyond this , we also intend to contribute to the literature methodologically by employing a multi-level modeling technique to test the proposed effects of pbf and cbo .
previous research in this area has largely neglected the nested structure of the brand evaluation data .
a common practice used in most prior studies is having each respondent assess multiple brands and then researchers determine the brands ’ country-of-origin effects using aggregated measures of brand evaluations , attitudes , and/ or purchase intentions across all participants .
one of the problems with aggregation is that all individual-level information is lost and the statistical analysis loses power ( judge et al .
2006 ) .
according to rust et al .
( 2004b ) , the value of a brand is highly individualized .
assigning an aggregated value across consumers obscures the fact that brand value or equity is idiosyncratically perceived by the customer ; thus , it is hardly a useful marketing management tool ( rust et al .
2004a ) .
in the present study , we overcome this problem by separating the effects of consumer responses that are caused by individual differences from those that are caused by brand characteristics .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 203 the paper is organized as follows .
drawing upon the brands as signals literature and accessibility-diagnosticity theory , we develop a research framework that includes the effects of pbf and cbo on brand value at the individual level ( level 1 ) , and the effects of brand category ( foreign vs. local brands ) at the brand level ( level 2 ) .
then a two-stage analysis of empirical tests is reported .
at the first stage , a pre-test was performed to test the core of our research framework : the moderating role of cbo in the impact of pbf on brand evaluation .
at the second stage , we conducted a main study to test our hypotheses using a multi-level modeling technique .
finally , the implications of the findings are discussed .
conceptual foundation and hypotheses individual-level effects perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) alden et al .
( 1999 ) pointed out that foreign culture brand positioning is a viable marketing communication strategy to enhance brand value across different countries of cultures .
from a theoretical standpoint , pbf is a key antecedent to the value of brand equity , which involves a set of functional and imagery associations with non-local appeals of the product ( keller 2003 ; maheswaran 1994 ; papadopoulos 1993 ) .
marketers and advertisers have put tremendous effort into associating their brands with desirable international images , such as using a foreign or global brand positioning strategy through advertising ( alden et al .
1999 ) .
according to alden et al. , associating brands with foreign images is one of the general dimensions that are relevant to brand positioning strategies in international markets .
unlike that which was previously manipulated in the vast majority of the country-of-origin literature ( such as the made-in label ) , pbf is not confined to any particular country stereotypes ; rather , it represents more generalized perceptions of a brand being “ of foreign origin ” , “ made somewhere in europe ” , or “ not from here ” ( batra et al .
2000 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) .
in the study by leclerc et al .
( 1994 ) , pbf was conveyed through foreign- sounding brand names , whereas in batra et al. ’ s work ( 2000 ) , pbf was considered inherent to brand communi- cation strategies featuring a brand ’ s foreign appeals .
the research evidence from the existing literature indicates that pbf has a positive impact on brand beliefs and attitudes ( batra et al .
2000 ; eckhardt 2005 ; leclerc et al .
1994 ) .
thus , it should add to brand value as perceived by consumers ( shocker et al .
1994 ; pappu et al .
2007 ) .
in particular , this image-enhancing effect on consumer perceptions of brand superiority is considered more pervasive in developing or emerging countries ( batra et al .
2000 ) .
in line with the general predictions of previous studies , we expect that a brand can benefit from its foreign appeals among consumers in emerging economies .
thus , the following hypothesis is proposed : h1 a higher level of perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) leads to a higher level of consumer brand value perception .
confidence in brand origin identification ( cbo ) in addi- tion to pbf , we also anticipate that confidence in brand origin identification is positively related to brand evalua- tions .
in the country-of-origin research , brand origin is widely assumed to be a relatively transparent information cue that is potentially important in determining a brand ’ s country association .
especially in the age of global production and outsourcing , brand origin has been put forward as the only stable information about a product ’ s country association since products/brands have been increasingly produced by or sourced from multiple country locations ( pharr 2005 ; jin et al .
2006 ) .
these products are known as “ hybrids ” ( e.g. , chao 1993 ; han and terpstra 1988 ) .
given the rise of global branding and corporations ’ use of multiple countries for components and manufactur- ing and/or assembling products , the actual geographical origin of a brand serves as a “ protected designation of origin ” that is integral to a brand ’ s identity and can be used to ensure a product ’ s authenticity ( pharr 2005 ) .
in line with this reasoning , brand origin is defined as “ the country in which the headquarters of the brand ’ s parent firm are located , regardless of where the brand is manufactured ( e.g. , nike is a u.s. brand , though none of its products are actually produced in the united states ) ” ( balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 , p. 41 ) .
in fact , previous researchers have long pointed out the importance of using the headquar- ters of the brand ’ s parent firm as an indicator of brand origin , rather than the made-in locations ( e.g. , samiee 1994 ; thakor and kohli 1996 ; liefeld 2004 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) .
in reality , however , the origin information for most brands may not be readily accessible either because global marketers have the desire to mask the origins of their brands or the globalization of firms and the cross-border acquisition of brands complicate the nature of brand origin ( see aaker and joachimsthaler 1999 ; shimp et al .
2001 ) .
as a result , brand-origin knowledge tends to be vicariously acquired information ( samiee et al .
2005 ) which is largely derived by consumers themselves as a consequence of market- place experiences andword-of-mouth flows ( maheswaran 1994 ; lee and ganesh 1999 ; paswan and sharma 2004 ) .
consumers often have to be “ amateur detectives ” to identify the brand origin information of many products or must frequently use the brand name to infer the real origin of the product ( liefeld 2004 ; balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 ) .
given that many consumers are unable to identify brand origins correctly , researchers have pointed out that the true importance of brand origin information could be unreasonably 204 j. of the acad .
mark .
sci .
( 2010 ) 38:202–218 overestimated in the vast majority of prior country-of-origin studies ( samiee et al .
2005 ) .
for this reason , we believe that consumer confidence in a brand ’ s origin identification ( cbo ) , as opposed to the brand ’ s actual origin , plays an important role in their brand evaluations .
since brand origin may be merely perceived , either correctly or incorrectly ( balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) , brand-origin- related beliefs , such as cbo , held by consumers may have real influence in brand evaluations .
main effect of cbo as part of the consumer knowledge structure , cbo is relevant to brand evaluation because confidence in brand origin self-identification is likely to diminish evaluation difficulty , and therefore reduce perceived risk ( erdem and swait 2004 ; urbany et al .
1989 ) .
this is especially true in a marketplace where brand origin confusion is prevalent .
balabanis and diamantopoulos ( 2008 ) shed light on the possibility of such influence by reporting that consumers tend to have more positive views of a brand when they are able to associate the brand with a specific country of origin ( as compared with those that are in the “ don ’ t know ” category of brand origin identification ) .
thus , cbo is likely to be useful or diagnostic in brand evaluations ( feldman and lynch 1988 ) .
the diagnostic role of cbo may also be explained by brand credibility theory ( erdem and swait 1998 ) ; i.e. , cbo can be seen as a signal of brand credibility .
researchers have long regarded brand credibility as an important signaling factor related to consumer evaluations of brands ( erdem and swait 1998 ) .
it has been shown that the clarity and credibility of brands ( as signals of product positions ) increase perceived quality , decrease consumer perceived risks , and increase consumer views and commitment to the brands ( erdem and swait 1998 , 2004 ) .
such a signaling theory of brand effects suggests that the believability of product positioning information contained in a brand is related to consumer perceptions of brand value .
by saving the cost of searching for additional brand information and reducing the uncertainty of the perceived risks involved ( erdem and swait 2004 ; urbany et al .
1989 ) , cbo is expected to enhance positive associations ( or expected benefits ) with the brand , thereby leading to increased brand evaluations .
this signaling effect is likely to be more salient in emerging markets because of the higher levels of uncertainty and risk involved in most product positions .
consequently , we hypothesize that : h2 a higher level of confidence in brand origin identifica- tion ( cbo ) leads to a higher level of consumer brand value perception .
interaction between pbf and cbo besides its main effect , the diagnostic value of cbo is expected to moderate the pbf effects such that the pbf effects would be stronger as cbo increases .
consumer confidence is related to the strength of brand knowledge embedded in a consumer ’ s belief structure ( keller 2003 ; ostlund 1973 ) .
the more confident consumers feel in their judgment of the target brand , the more impact the judgment will have on their purchase of that brand ( ostlund 1973 ; bennett and harrell 1975 ; laroche et al .
1996 ) .
this phenomenon can be explained by the accessibility-diagnosticity framework proposed by feldman and lynch ( 1988 ) .
that is , if a belief is associated with a higher level of conviction , that belief is likely to be more accessible and diagnostic for consumer judgments .
in line with this reasoning , prior research has shown that a knowledge base with strong attitude certainty is highly accessible and diagnostic for brand evaluations ( berger 1992 ) , and can enhance the effect of a specific attitude regarding brand equity ( aaker 1991 ; keller 1993 ) .
further , evidence suggests that although foreign appeals may still be associated with inherent glamour in most developing countries , there is a growing skepticism about this automatic cachet partly due to the imitation strategy pursued by local brands ( zhan and murray 2001 ; zhou and hui 2003 ) .
additionally , the localization strategy used by multinationals seems to have further deepened consumer uncertainty or lack of clarity about a brand ’ s foreign culture positioning ( keller and moorthi 2003 ; quelch 1999 ; zhang and schmitt 2001 ; the boston consulting group 2008 ) .
as a result , some consumers may associate foreign images of a brand with less credible product quality .
seen as the believability of the product position information contained in a brand , cbo may be able to reinforce consumers ’ perceptions of firms ’ willingness and/or perceived ability to deliver brand promises , and therefore enhance the relevance of pbf to brand evaluations .
also , consistent with feldman and lynch ’ s ( 1988 ) accessibility-diagnosticity theory , product beliefs or knowledge held with certainty ( e.g. , cbo ) can drive consumers to perceive the diagnosticity of other brand- related information ( e.g. , pbf ) as relatively high .
we therefore hypothesize that : h3 the effects of perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) on consumer perceptions of brand value are greater when consumer confidence in brand origin identification ( cbo ) is high than low .
brand-level effects main effect as discussed earlier , the variance in brand evaluation can also be attributed to brand-specific charac- teristics , such as whether the brand is actually a foreign brand or a local one .
we would expect that in most developing countries , foreign brands are generally in an j. of the acad .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 205 advantageous position when competing with local brands for the creation of more positive brand perceptions .
the rationale underlying this expectation is that consumer perceptions of brand superiority can be driven by the distinction between global brands ( or those internationally recognized brand names ) and local brands ( or those largely recognized by domestic consumers ) ( steenkamp et al .
2003 ) .
the many roles that global brand names play in consumer perceptions of brand value are found to materialize through multiple mechanisms , such as perceived product quality , brand prestige , cultural capital , social responsibility , and a sense of belongingness to the global consumer segment ( özsomer and altaras 2008 ; steenkamp et al .
2003 ) .
although it has not been directly examined by previous researchers , we believe it reasonable to assume that in the major emerging market of china , consumer perceptions of brand value tend to favor foreign or global brands more than local ones .
this is in line with brand signaling theory ( “ brands as signals ” ) and its applications in global markets ( erdem et al .
2006 ) .
the competitive advantage of foreign brands lies in not only country image associations , but also other brand-related beliefs ( e.g. , product performance and attributes ) .
with a strong global brand , multinational corporations can penetrate many different countries and build on their superior brand images in the minds of local consumers ( holt et al .
2004 ) .
the distinctive images created by multinational corporations make foreign brands generally more desirable in developing countries ( ger and belk 1996 ; wang et al .
2004 ) .
based on this discussion , we hypothesize that : h4 foreign brands are generally perceived as having a higher level of brand value than local brands .
cross-level effect apart from the main effect , we also predict a cross-level interaction that involves the differential impact of pbf and cbo on brand evaluations ( the individual-level effects ) across foreign and local brand categories ( a brand-level variable ) .
specifically , we expect that the enhancing function of cbo on the pbf effect is less profound for foreign brands than for local ones .
as stated earlier , product beliefs or knowledge held with certainty ( e.g. , cbo ) can make consumers perceive the diagnosticity of other brand-related information ( e.g. , pbf ) as relatively high ( feldman and lynch 1988 ) .
for foreign brands , however , the enhancing function of cbo is less likely to be effective because there is a congruency between perceived brand image ( “ foreignness ” ) and country image ( “ non-local ” ) .
in this case , cbo does not provide much additional diagnostic power to the effect of pbf .
notably , this argument is in line with leclerc et al. ’ s ( 1994 ) finding that brand–country image congruence is often regarded as redundant , thus resulting in less significant enhancement in consumer perceptions of brand value .
conversely , for local brands , cbo is likely to augment the effect of pbf as the inconsistency between brand and country images makes brand evaluation harder and more uncertain .
cbo , in this case , adds credibility to those local brands that “ dress themselves as foreign ” while maintaining a strong footprint with local identity .
the rationale is analogous to the role of attribute strength in enhancing consumer responses to country-of-origin stereotypes documented by maheswaran ( 1994 ) .
we therefore hypothesize that : h5 the enhancing function of cbo in the effects of pbf on consumer perceptions of brand value will be less profound for foreign than for local brands .
hypotheses h1 through h5 are summarized by a two-level framework shown in fig .
1 .
the empirical tests consisted of two stages .
in the first stage , we conducted a pre-test to obtain baseline evidence about the core of our framework— the boundary condition of cbo on the effect of pbf with regard to brand evaluations .
building on the initial evidence from the pre-test , we then performed the second stage of analysis—a main study to test hypotheses h1 through h5 using a multi-level modeling approach .
pre-test empirical context : china china was selected as an appropriate place for the purpose of our investigation because in recent years there have been growing concerns about a potential backlash against foreign brands in the country ( ewing et al .
2002 ; crocker and tay 2004 ) .
undergraduate students from a major university in china were recruited to participate in the pretest .
the targeting of young people for their brand perceptions and evaluations has become both important and challenging for many international firms around the world ( o ’ cass and lim 2002 ) .
china is no exception , where young people have been described as part of china ’ s millions of “ newly rich , fashion-savvy , and globally-minded ” consuming gener- ation ( as opposed to the “ saving generation ” of their parents ) ( smith andwylie 2004 ; hung et al .
2007 ) .
from a theoretical standpoint , the relatively homogeneous nature of the respondents enabled us to control for the influence of other individual differences that are beyond our investigation .
selection of product categories and brands to begin with , we conducted two separate sessions of focus group interviews with 10 respondents in each session .
the task of the first session was to explore the product 206 j. of the acad .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 categories and brands that were relevant and familiar to the undergraduate student population .
to increase the validity of the research on product–country image effects , the categories needed to vary across the nondurable-durable continuum ( batra et al .
2000 ) .
each category also needed to consist of viable local ( chinese ) and non-local competing brands .
a list of brands was created through the first focus group interview ; this was followed by field observations in two nationally distributed supermarket stores to verify the availability of these brands .
the second focus group interview was used to validate and finalize the brands to be included in the pretest .
as a result of our focus group discussions and field observations , a total of 67 brands ( 45 foreign and 22 domestic ) across seven product categories ( toothpaste , shampoo , bottled water , beer , casual clothes , athletic shoes , and cell phones ) were selected .
among the selected brands , there were internationally recognized names such as nike , nokia , and motorola , as well as the popular domestic brands including li ning ( athletic shoes ) , wahaha ( bottled water ) , and tsingtao beer .
data collection following the results of our focus group study , we developed and administered a questionnaire survey to a convenience sample of 400 undergraduate students at the same university .
the survey was in chinese .
the back translation method , in which the survey was first translated from english to chinese and then back again to english , was applied to ensure the idiomatic equivalence of the chinese and english versions .
the respondents were approached by our two research assistants during early evening hours in their hostels on campus .
they were given a gift incentive for completing the questionnaire in which the 67 brands were listed and the respondents were asked to evaluate each brand using a series of single-item measures on brand quality , brand prestige , purchasing value , and product workmanship .
for instance , a respondent would be asked : “ on a scale of 1 to 7 , where 1 = very low and 7 = very high , how would you rate the quality of ____ ( brand name ) cell phone ? ” then , a composite score was created by averaging the ratings on these evaluative attributes to form the dependent variable , brand value .
in addition , respondents were asked to indicate their perceptions of each brand ’ s pbf by respond- ing to the question , “ what do you think is the culture association of this brand ? ” where 1 = domestic ( chinese ) brand ; 2 = international joint-venture brand ; and 3 = foreign ( non-local ) brand .
according to lim and o ’ cass ( 2001 ) , this question captures consumers ’ generalized perceptions of a brand as something foreign or with domestic ( chinese ) culture connections .
following that , respondents were asked to identify the brand ’ s country of origin and indicate the degree to which they were confident in their judgments using a 5-point scale ( from 1 = ‘ not certain at all ’ to 5 = ‘ absolutely certain ’ ) .
this measure was used as an indicator of cbo .
analysis and results the data were analyzed in two ways using the ols regression method .
following prior researchers ( e.g. , batra et al .
2000 ) , the first approach we used was to analyze the data at the aggregated level ( the brand level in this case ) .
we first developed brand-level scores by aggregating the h3 ( + ) h2 ( + ) control variables : - gender - brand familiarity - consumer ethnocentrism - consumer bias in favor of local brands h1 ( + ) h5 ( - ) h4 ( + ) perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) confidence in brand origin identification ( cbo ) brand value individual-level brand-level actual foreign vs. local brand origin control variable : - product conspicuousness note : dashed lines represent moderating effects .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 207 responses of the 400 survey participants for each brand .
perceived brand foreignness was derived using the percentage of respondents who considered a brand to be non-local ( as opposed to local ) .
likewise , confidence in brand origin identification , brand familiarity ( used as a control variable ) , and brand value were derived for each of the 67 brands using responses from the 400 participants .
according to batra et al .
( 2000 ) , this approach minimizes any extraneous effect that might have been caused by variations in the responses of individual respondents .
after the aggregated measures were derived ( n=67 ) , we regressed brand value on pbf , cbo , and the interaction term pbf * cbo .
results showed that the effect of pbf on brand value is in the hypothesized direction , but does not reach statistical significance ( b=.152 , t=.936 , p > .10 ) .
as expected , cbo was found to be positively related to brand value ( b=.594 , t=3.11 , p < .01 ) , as was the interaction term of pbf * cbo ( b=.720 , t=5.22 , p < .001 ) .
these variables jointly explain 57.9 % of the variance in brand value .
the second approach we used was to analyze the data at the disaggregated level ( the individual level in this case ) .
in this approach , the data contains 26,800 ( 67×400 ) observa- tions , 67 observations per study participant .
results of the regression analysis indicate that brand value is positively related to pbf ( b=.184 , t=10.16 , p < .001 ) , cbo ( b=.138 , t=12.32 , p < .001 ) , and the interaction term pbf * cbo ( b= .051 , t=5.27 , p < .001 ) .
these variables jointly explained 22.3 % of the variance in brand value , after the effect of brand familiarity was controlled .
taken together , the results of our pretest are largely consistent with our research framework , which indicates that pbf and cbo play important roles in predicting consumer evaluations of brand value and that the effect of pbf is moderated by cbo .
while the findings of the pre-test provided a rationale for applying our theoretical framework and testing the proposed hypotheses , several methodological issues were brought to our attention .
first , the key constructs , such as pbf and cbo , were assessed by single-item measures which did not allow us to test their reliability and validity .
second , there might be substantial response bias due to respondent fatigue ( it was a lengthy questionnaire with a set of 67 brands ) .
third , out of the 67 brands included in the questionnaire , 45 brands ( approximately 67 % ) were foreign and most of them were well-known internationally .
the dominance of foreign brands may influence the results due to the unbalanced design of the brand stimuli .
fourth , additional control variables would be needed for a more robust test of the research hypotheses .
finally , the difference in the results of the two separate levels of analysis ( brand-level vs. individual-level ) indicated the importance of using a multi-level analysis to disentangle the brand-level variance from the individual-level variance and to introduce explanatory variables in each level .
these issues were addressed in the main study described below .
main study selection of product categories and brands two new focus group interviews ( 12 undergraduate participants in each group ; one group for the selection of brand stimuli and the other group for verification purposes ) were conducted to ensure that our selection of the product categories and brands met the following five criteria : 1 ) the products are relevant to the target student population , 2 ) the products vary across the nondurable-durable continuum , 3 ) the products represent different levels of the conspicuous consumption experience , 4 ) the brands in each product category ( both foreign and local ) have a varying degree of familiarity and prestige , and 5 ) all brands were available in the chinese market at the time the research was conducted .
each focus group session lasted about 2 h. as a result of these focus group interviews , six product categories were used in the main survey , including cell phones , athletic shoes , usb flash drives , toothpaste , bottled water , and microwave ovens .
our focus group discussions indicated that conspicuous symbols of consumption were associated with cell phones , athletic shoes , and bottled water , whereas inconspicuous consumption was associated with the toothpaste , usb flash drives , and microwave ovens .
each category consisted of six brands , with three foreign and three local ( chinese ) brands ( see table 1 for details ) .
data collection our main study surveyed the views of a sample of undergraduate students at a major university located in one of the most developed regions of china .
geographically , the survey location is among the first-tier markets for interna- tional brands within the country .
we made an additional effort to make sure the translation of the established measurement items was free of linguistic confounds .
specifically , two judges who were not aware of the purpose of this research were recruited to compare the original english and back-translated english versions .
the judges agreed that 94 % of items conveyed the same meaning in the two versions .
based on suggestions from the two judges , we made minor modifications on the chinese version in the main study .
we used a balanced design that included 18 foreign brands and 18 local brands across six product categories ; each category consisted of three foreign and three local brands .
following the data collection approach used by previous researchers ( batra et al .
2000 ; steenkamp et al .
2003 ) , each respondent answered questions concerning a subset of brands , with three brands ( two foreign and one local or vice versa ) from each of the six product categories .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 thus , the total number of brands evaluated by each respondent was 18 , nine foreign and nine local .
in this way , respondent fatigue was largely reduced without sacrificing the amount of data needed for our investigation .
two versions of the questionnaire were developed : two foreign brands plus one local brand were used in version a , and one foreign brand plus two local brands were used in version b .
in each version , the three brands of each product category were rotated .
to test whether the two versions of survey would create variances in brand value , we treated survey type ( version a vs. b ) as a control variable in the level-1 model .
its main effect , as well as its interactions with pbf or cbo , was not found to affect brand value ( all ps > .10 ) .
therefore , this variable was dropped from the model and the data from both versions were pooled together in the further analysis .
the survey was conducted during regular class hours with the permission of the university administrator and the individual instructors .
a total of 210 respondents completed the surveys , with 99 people using version a and 111 using version b .
the results of the basic demographic information suggested that the sample was representative of the university student population in terms of gender ( 54.1 % females ) , and age ( an average age of 21.8 , ranging from 19 to 31 years old ) .
because in testing the level-1 model we were interested in the disaggregated responses to each brand , these responses became the unit of analysis and the sample size in level 1 was then 3,780 ( 18×210 ) observa- tions .
in testing the level-2 model , brands became the unit of analysis ; therefore , the sample size in level 2 was 36 brands .
measures dependent variable the dependent variable , brand value , was assessed through three dimensions , namely brand quality , brand leadership , and brand social signaling value .
multiple items were used to measure each of the three dimensions with a 7-point likert scale ( from 1 = ‘ strongly disagree ’ to 7 = ‘ strongly agree ’ ) .
the measures of brand quality and social signaling value were drawn from sweeney and soutar ( 2001 ) , and the brand leadership measures were taken from cheng et al .
( 2007 ) , who used a modified version of the original scale developed by aaker ( 1996 ) .
as evident in table 2 , the measures had adequate reliabilities and all cronbach ’ s alphas were above the 0.70 threshold .
independent variables pbf and cbo were the two individual-level independent variables .
pbf was measured through five items on a 7-point semantic differential scale .
these items were adapted from batra et al .
( 2000 ) and steenkamp et al .
( 2003 ) .
the original scales tap into consumer perceptions of a brand ’ s non-local or global image associations .
we adapted these items to measure the international outlook , foreign appeals , and cultural mean- ings associated with the target brand , not the brand ’ s country-of-origin , per se .
cbo was assessed through two items on a 7-point semantic differential scale : 1 ) i ’ m not certain at all about my identification of this brand ’ s country of origin /i ’ m very certain about my identification of this brand ’ s country of origin , and 2 ) i am of low level of confidence in my identification of this brand ’ s country of origin/i am of high level of confidence in my identification of this brand ’ s country of origin , following the question , “ what country do you think this brand originated from ? ” these items were developed based on similar measures used for attitude strength ( krosnick et al .
1993 ) .
in addition to these independent variables at the individual level , brand category ( foreign vs. local ) was used as a brand-level independent variable .
a dummy variable was used to capture brand category ( 0= ‘ local brands ’ and 1 = ‘ foreign brands ’ ) .
control variables to provide a more rigorous test of our hypotheses , several control variables were incorporated into our model .
at the individual level , we included consumer ethnocentrism , consumer bias in favor of local brands , brand familiarity , and gender .
consumer ethnocentrism was controlled for because of its prominence in the extant country-of-origin literature and its continued relevance to the global market environment ( balabanis and diamantopoulos 2004 ; batra et al .
2000 ; klein 2002 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) .
according to shimp and sharma ( 1987 ) , consumer ethno- centrism refers to the consumer belief that it is inappropriate , or even immoral , to purchase foreign products because of the product category brands foreign domestic usb flash drives kingston ; sandisk ; hp netac ; aigo ; newsmy cell phones nokia ; samsung ; sony-ericsson bird ; dopod ; amoi athletic shoes nike ; adidas ; converse li-ning ; anta ; xtep toothpaste colgate ; crest ; darlie zhonghua ; tianqi ; lsl bottled water danone ; evian ; nestle peasant ’ s springs ; robust ; c ’ estbon microwave ovens panasonic ; sanyo ; lg galanz ; midea ; gree table 1 product categories and brands in the main study j. of the acad .

the effect of consumer ethnocentrism has been widely documented in the extant country-of-origin literature .
the 4-item scale used in this study was adapted from batra et al .
( 2000 ) , who selected it from the original cetscale scale ( shimp and sharma 1987 ) .
this measure was reliable ( α=.97 ) and the mean score of consumer ethnocentrism was derived for each respondent .
a second control variable at the individual level was consumer bias in favor of local brands .
prior researchers ( e.g. , ger 1999 ; verlegh 2007 ) have suggested that there are localized cultural variants that are more in line with local quality needs .
thus , consumer bias in favor of local brands may influence the pbf effects .
while we controlled for consumer ethnocentrism specifically regarding ethnocentric views held by the target consumers towards products sourced from foreign countries ( netemeyer et al .
1991 ; shimp and sharma 1987 ) , consumer bias in favor of local brands focuses on the interest of the target consumers in the uniqueness of the brands from their own country ( ger 1999 ; steenkamp et al .
2003 ) .
as indicated in table 2 , this construct was measured by steenkamp et al. ’ s ( 2003 ) 5-item scale ; an average score was calculated for each respondent ( α=.82 ) .
furthermore , brand familiarity and gender were also included as control variables in our analyses .
brand familiarity has long been regarded as an important factor influencing product evaluations and preferences .
when testing brand origin effects , it is desirable to control for potential exogenous influences of brand familiarity ( batra et al .
2000 ) .
in this study , brand familiarity was assessed by a scale developed by steenkamp et al .
( 2003 ) .
a composite score was used for each respondent ( α=.91 ) .
gender was included because previous research suggests that relative to their male counterparts , female consumers tend to rate foreign products more favorably ( wall and heslop 1986 ) , have more positive views about foreign brand names ( thakor and pacheco 1997 ) , and exhibit higher levels of brand origin recognition accuracy ( samiee et al .
2005 ) .
at the brand level , product conspicuousness was included as a control variable because previous work has documented the variability of product–country image biases across publicly vs. privately consumed products ( see peterson and jolibert 1995 ; pappu et al .
2007 ) .
in emerging markets , consumer purchasing motives and product evaluations tend to vary significantly depending on the ( in ) conspicuous characteristics of a product type ( piron 2000 ) .
it has been found that the desire for foreign goods is generally higher for conspicuous ( or publicly consumed ) products than for inconspicuous ( or privately consumed ) products among consumers in developing countries ( wang et al .
2004 ) .
in our study , product conspicuousness was captured by a dummy variable , with 0 = ‘ inconspicuous products ’ ( toothpaste , usb flash drives , and microwave ovens ) and 1 = ‘ conspicuous products ’ ( cell phones , athletic shoes , and bottled water ) .
analytical strategy : multi-level modeling our hypotheses were tested through the mplus software ( l.k .
muthén and b.o .
muthén 2007 ) .
mplus is an advanced application of structural equation modeling ( sem ) used to analyze data that has a nested structure .
an advantage of using mplus is that latent constructs can be specified in the model ; therefore , the potential bias of the results caused by measurement errors are largely reduced ( bollen and curran 2006 ) .
in this study , we attended to variables at two levels of analysis : ( 1 ) the level-1 model that captures individual differences in brand evaluations , and ( 2 ) the level-2 model that differentiates one brand from another .
in level 1 , we addressed the question of whether pbf and cbo actually influence brand value for each brand across individual consumers .
the level-1 equation for brand value is : beij ¼ b0j þ b1j pbfij þ b2j cboij þ b3j pbfij*cboij þ bcontrolsfcontrolsij þ rij ð1þ where i denotes individuals ; j indicates brands ; beij denotes individual i ’ s evaluation of brand j ; pbfij represents individual i ’ s perceived foreignness of brand j ; cboij reflects individual i ’ s confidence in the origin identification of brand j ; fcontrols include individual-level controls such as consumer ethnocentrism , consumer bias in favor of local brands , brand familiarity , and gender .
β0j is the intercept , which is allowed to vary across j brands ; β1j ... β3j are the regression slopes for their respective predictor variables , which are also allowed to vary across brands ; and finally , rij captures the individual-level error term , with a mean of zero and variance σ2 .
to take advantage of the mplus software , be , pbf , and cbo are specified as latent factors in the model , whereas the responses of all control variables ( except for gender ) are averaged to ease the model estimation .
following raudenbush and bryk ’ s ( 2002 ) suggestion , all continuous measures in the level-1 model ( including the indicators of each latent factor ) were group-mean centered in order to ensure numerical stability and avoid model misspecification .
the variation in each of the β coefficients ( β0j ... β3j ) is predicted by the level-2 models which incorporate brand j. of the acad .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 211 category ( foreign vs. local brands ) as an explanatory variable .
therefore , level-2 models were specified as follows : b0j ¼ g00 þ g01 bcj þ u0j ð2aþ b1j ¼ g10 þ g11 bcj þ u1j ð2bþ b2j ¼ g20 þ g21 bcj þ u2j ð2cþ b3j ¼ g30 þ g31 bcj þ u3j ð2dþ where bcj denotes brand category ( 0 , local brands ; 1 , foreign brands ) ; uqj ( q = 0 , ... ,3 ) are errors normally distributed over respondents , each with an expected value of 0 , variance τqq , and covariance τqq ’ ( q , q ’ = 0 , ... , 3 ) .
substituting eqs .
2a-2d into eq .
1 yields the following combined model , which was estimated to test the hypo the s e s : beij ¼ g00 þ g01 bcj þ g10 pbfij þ g11 bcj ðpbfijþ þ g20 cboij þ g21 bcj cboij þ g30 pbfij*cboij þ g31 bcj pbfij*cboij þ gcontrolsfcontrolsij þ error analysis and results assessment of measures the descriptive statistics of the constructs are shown in table 3 .
we assessed the reliability of the individual items by inspecting the loadings of the items on their corresponding construct and their internal consistency values ( fornell and larcker 1981 ) .
the internal consistency values for all constructs were good , exceeding the 0.70 guideline .
we used the following four methods to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs in the level-1 model .
first , the square root of the average variance extracted ( ave ) of all constructs was much larger than all other cross-correlations .
second , all aves were well above 0.50 , which suggests that the constructs captured much higher construct-related variance than error variance .
third , the correlations among all constructs were all well below the .90 threshold , which indicates that all constructs were distinct from each other .
fourth , all items loaded highest on their intended constructs with all factor loadings greater than 0.70 ( all t-values are significant ) .
these findings suggest that the constructs had adequate convergent and discriminate validity .
it is theoretically sound to treat brand value as a second order factor in the model , as brand quality , brand leadership , and brand social signaling value are highly ta b le 3 d es cr ip tiv e st at is tic s , co rr el at io ns , an d av er ag e va ri an ce ex tr ac te d in th e m ai n st ud y c on st ru ct s m ea n ( s t d ) c ro nb ac h ’ s α 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 correlated .
in our data , the correlations among these three constructs ranged from .77 to .83 .
to provide a rigorous test of whether a second order factor structure fits with our data , we compared one model in which the three dimensions of brand value were specified as first order factors with the other in which the three first order factors were specified as reflective measures of a second order factor .
the results show that these two measurement models have identical goodness-of-fit indices , with χ2 ( 51 ) =64.3 , p < .05 , χ2/df= 1.26 , cfi=0.98 , and rmsea=.021 .
therefore , we used the second order structure of brand value in our further analysis .
the potential threat of common methods bias and multicollinearity among level-1 model factors ( pbf , cbo , and three dimensions of brand value ) was also evaluated .
harman ’ s one-factor test was performed to assess common methods variance ( podsakoff et al .
2003 ) .
the one-factor model of all constructs yielded a χ2 of 4837.1 , df=135 compared with χ2=211.7 , df=128 for the measurement model .
since the one-factor model was significantly worse than the measurement model ( δχ2=4625.4 , δdf=7 , p < .001 ) , common method bias is not a serious threat to this study .
following the work of belsley et al .
( 1980 ) , we assessed potential threats from multicollinearity .
the condition number was lower than 15 ( cn=7.95 ) , which suggests that multicollinearity is not a threat to the validity of the study 's findings .
partitioning of variance components before proceeding to test the proposed hypotheses with mplus , we investigat- ed whether systematic individual- and brand-level variances existed in the criterion variable by estimating a null model .
a null model contains no predictors .
this model decomposes the total variance of brand value into individual and brand components , and the intercept for the unconditional model represents the average level of brand value across individuals .
if no brand-level variance exists in the criterion variable , then a multi-level model is not appropriate because there is only the individual- level variance to explain ( i.e. , there is only one level of analysis ) .
as shown in table 4 , the variance partitioning results indicate that 27.2 % 0:326= 0:872þ 0:326ð þ½ of the total variance in brand value can be attributed to brand differ- ences , which is statistically significant [ τ =0.326 , t=5.408 , p < .001 ] .
this result suggests two important issues .
the first one is that the majority of variance could be observed at the individual level ( i.e. , one brand evaluated by multiple individuals ) , rather than at the brand level .
the second issue is that multi-level modeling of these data was appropriate and insightful for providing a better understanding of the true sources of the observed variances in the effects of pbf and cbo .
to test hypotheses h1 through h5 , we conducted a series of multi-level modeling analyses in which several clusters of predictors were entered in a stepwise manner .
this procedure involved testing four models : 1 ) the individual-level baseline model , which contains only individual-level control variables ; 2 ) the individual-level full model , which includes both individual-level control variables and variables of interest ( i.e. , pbf , cbo , the interaction term pbf * cbo ) ; 3 ) the brand-level baseline model , which consists of all individual-level variables in model 2 , as well as brand-level control variables ( i.e. , product conspicuousness and its cross-level interaction terms ) ; and 4 ) the brand-level full model , which comprises all model 3 variables and brand-level variables of interest ( i.e. , brand category and its cross-level interaction terms ) .
effects of control variables the individual-level baseline model contained only consumer ethnocentrism , consumer bias in favor of local brand , brand familiarity , and gender as control variables but no predictors of interest were added .
as shown in table 4 , all the individual-level control variables were found to be significantly associated with consumer evaluations of brand value ( consumer bias in favor of local brand : b=.063 , t=4.34 , p < .001 ; famil- iarity : b=.265 , t=12.32 , p < .001 ; gender : b=.098 , t=3.69 , p < .001 ) , except for consumer ethnocentrism ( p > .10 ) .
these variables jointly explained 23.5 % of the total variance in brand value perceptions at the individual level .
interestingly , although consumer ethnocentrism had no direct effect on the responses to brand value , it registered a significant interaction with pbf , which shows that the effect of pbf on brand value perceptions was more positive for individuals with lower levels of ethnocentric tendency ( b=−.026 , t=−1.99 , p < .05 ) .
similarly , there was also a two-way interaction between consumer bias in favor of local brands and pbf ( b=−.062 , t=−5.92 , p < .001 ) , which suggests that the effect of pbf was weaker for individuals who have higher levels of bias in favor of local brands .
these findings are consistent with a vast majority of the evidence documented in the literature ( e.g. , balabanis and diamantopoulos 2004 ; netemeyer et al .
1991 ; sharma et al .
1995 ) .
testing hypotheses at the individual level after having analyzed the baseline model , a block of individual-level predictors ( i.e. , pbf , cbo , and the interplay of pbf and cbo ) was added to the model to test the proposed hypotheses .
hypothesis 1 predicted that a higher level of pbf would lead to a higher level of brand value perception .
the variables entered as the third block ( see table 4 ) tested this hypothesis .
as shown in table 4 , pbf was found to be positively related to brand value ( b=.176 , t=12.32 , p < .001 ) , thus supporting h1 .
hypothesis 2 specified that a higher j. of the acad .
mark .
sci .
( 2010 ) 38:202–218 213 level of cbo would lead to a higher level of brand value perception .
consistent with this expectation , we found that cbo affected brand value positively ( b=.068 , t=2.43 , p < .01 ) .
in hypothesis 3 , we anticipated that the interplay of pbf and cbo would affect brand value such that the pbf effects would be higher when cbo is high than when it is low .
the results showed that the interaction between pbf and cbo was significant and positive ( b=.045 , t=2.02 , p < .05 ) , which indicates that the positive impact of pbf on brand value gets stronger as cbo increases .
therefore , h3 is substantiated by our data .
testing hypotheses at the brand level hypothesis 4 pre- dicted that foreign brands are of higher perceived value than local brands .
as expected , the main effect of brand category ( foreign vs. local ) was positive and significant ( b=.219 , t= 3.07 , p < .01 ) , which provides support for h4 .
hypothesis 5 predicted that the interplay between pbf and cbo would be weaker for foreign brands than for local ones .
as shown in table 4 , the 3-way cross-level interaction term foreign brand * pbf * cbo was negatively significant ( b=−.111 , t=−2.39 , p < .05 ) .
to understand the 3-way interaction effects better , we conducted multi-group analyses by dividing the sample into foreign and local brands .
the results indicated that the interaction term pbf * cbo was positive and significant only for local brands ( b=.072 , t=2.01 , p < .05 ) , but not for foreign brands ( p > .10 ) .
these results suggest that the moderating influence of cbo on the pbf effects was more profound for local brands than for foreign ones .
therefore , h5 was strongly supported .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 to privately-consumed products ) , foreign brands are per- ceived as having a much higher level of brand value than local brands .
general discussion while multinational companies are strategically positioned to move toward building global brands ( i.e. , those without any country associations ) , local firms are increasingly keen on imitating foreign ( mostly western ) appeals or symbols for their home-grown brands in emerging markets .
these market changes lead to consumer confusion over local vs. non-local brands .
such a market phenomenon reflects a recent concern about the diminishing value of perceived brand foreignness ( pbf ) documented in the literature ( crocker and tay 2004 ; ewing et al .
2002 ; keller and moorthi 2003 ; zhou and hui 2003 ) .
building on recent brand origin literature , we introduce the concept of confidence in brand origin identification ( cbo ) and theorize its moderating impact on perceived brand foreign- ness effects .
our theoretical framework posits that cbo serves as a signal of trust to enhance the positive effects of brand foreignness on consumer perceptions of brand value .
further , our research also reveals that the enhancement function of confidence in origin identification is more profound for local than for foreign brands .
theoretical implications our study is the first attempt to conceptualize the salience of pbf and cbo as two integral parts of consumer knowledge of brand country associations , which are conceptually different from consumer knowledge of brands ’ true origins .
the findings are deemed relevant to brand foreignness and origin association effects in an increasingly globalized marketplace .
our investigation extends previous work on the generalized preference for foreign appeals in developing countries by suggesting that the unique value perceived in a brand ’ s foreign appeals can be more profound for local ( chinese ) brands when consumers perceive the brand as having the credibility to deliver what it promises .
the study also adds value to the recent research on brand origin identification ( balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 ; samiee et al .
2005 ) .
we demonstrate that in fast-changing emerging market environments , brand origin association may be considered an integral part of brand equity because it is likely to build trust in the minds of confused consumers.while the general influence of traditional country-of-origin cues ( such as , made-in affiliations ) may be dissipating in today ’ s global production environment , brands that are associated with a “ protected designation of origin ” tend to be in a better position to insure a product ’ s credibility and authenticity ( pharr 2005 ) .
taking the extensive country-of-origin literature inside out , pharr ( 2005 ) concluded that little research to date has been done on brand origin associations as integral knowledge of a product ’ s identity and on understanding how such associa- tions may change consumers ’ product quality evaluations and perceptions of brand value .
our study has advanced the understanding of foreign images and brand origin identifi- cation in this growing field of research ( batra et al .
2000 ; balabanis and diamantopoulos 2008 ; samiee et al .
2005 ; pappu et al .
2007 ) .
from a methodological perspective , our research sheds light on the importance of using a multi-level approach to study brand origin association effects by disentangling the variance of brand value into the individual level ( i.e. , variability due to heterogeneity among individual consumers ) and brand level ( i.e. , variability due to heterogeneity among brands ) .
our approach reflects the theoretical position that the value of brands has become increasingly individualized ( rust et al .
2004b ) .
the results demonstrate that the enhancement function of cbo is more profound for local than for foreign brands .
as a result , this improved methodology has allowed us to provide useful insights that appear to have been overlooked in prior research .
managerial implications from a managerial standpoint , the results of this study suggest that in an era of global branding and outsourcing , international marketers should try to emphasize not only a foreign culture brand positioning strategy as noted in the literature ( alden et al .
1999 ) , but also consumer associa- tions with brand origin identification .
this seems to be particularly true in developing countries , including the fast emerging market of china .
instead of focusing on objective country-of-origin cues , as is prevalent in the vast majority of previous country-of-origin studies , our study suggests that international marketers can take advantage of consumer beliefs in brand origin associations to promote brand value .
they may find it more meaningful to create consumer association with the geographic origin where a brand was originally from .
in a subtle way , such sources of informa- tion as packaging and brand names may be used to foster the consumer ’ s sense of confidence with his/her own belief in a brand ’ s origin association ( schmitt and pan 1994 ) .
when a sense of brand origin association is successfully instilled in the minds of local consumers , brand perceptions are likely to improve as a result of reduced uncertainty and the enhanced effects of perceived brand foreignness .
however , there seem to be no simple solutions for international marketers in developing countries .
the stron- ger moderating role of cbo in the effects of pbf for local brands ( vs. foreign brands ) suggests that a brand ’ s j. of the acad .

( 2010 ) 38:202–218 215 foreignness appeal is no longer exclusively possessed by foreign products .
local brands appear to benefit more by “ dressing themselves as foreign ” while maintaining a strong footprint with local identity .
in china , this is actually happening with strong local brands such as li-ning sportswear , tsingtao beer , and lenovo notebook ; all have increasingly adopted foreign or international appeals through the global sourcing of product or package design features , the use of international celebrities , and sponsor- ship for international events .
the “ foreignness advantage of local brands ” may provide an explanation as to why the unique value of foreign brands is diminishing in some developing countries such as china ( zhou and hui 2003 ) .
while local positioning may remain an effective means of competing with international brands in developing countries ( ger 1999 ) , our results suggest that local brands can also pursue a foreign positioning strategy to compete successfully with foreign rivals in their home markets .
for foreign brands , such head-to-head competition seems more challenging than ever .
limitations and future research several limitations should be noted .
first , the results of our study should be interpreted with caution due to the use of student samples .
in particular , the findings may not be generalizeable to other consumer segments .
thus , it seems to be desirable to use a more representative sample of the target population to further validate the results reported here .
second , since a larger number of brands are needed for using the multi-level approach , each respondent was asked to rate more than one brand to reduce the difficulty in recruiting a credible number of respondents .
as a result , non- independence in our observations was not fully taken care of by our analytical approach .
future research may recruit more participants to verify our findings or use an experimental approach to test the theoretical insights highlighted in this article .
finally , although we controlled for several variables relating to individual differences and brand characteristics , the potential confounding of other origin-free brand images and brand attitudes can not be completely ruled out .
still , to a certain extent , our multi-group analyses separating foreign from local brands provide more insightful estimates of the true effects of pbf and cbo .
conclusion an important conclusion of this research is that the unique value perceived in a brand ’ s foreignness can be enhanced by the strength of brand origin associations held in the minds of consumers .
confidence in brand origin identification ( cbo ) establishes that consumers perceive the brand as having the credibility to deliver what it promised ; thus , it necessitates a credible source of leveraging association for the diagnostic value of pbf .
as seen in the earlier work by keller ( 2003 ) and the recent conceptualization of branding research ( keller and lehmann 2006 ) , understanding brand leveraging liability and how it improves brand equity from such associations is a promising direction for future research .
we hope that this study offers useful avenues for international brand- ing and brand origin association research .

the initial assignment effect : local employer practices and positive career outcomes for work-family program users forrest briscoea and katherine c. kelloggb abstract one of the great paradoxes of inequality in organizations is that even when organizations introduce new programs designed to help employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed , employees who use these programs often suffer negative career consequences .
this study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature by investigating how local employer practices can enable employees to successfully use the programs designed to benefit them .
using a research approach that controls for regulatory environment and program design , we analyze unique longitudinal personnel data from a large law firm to demonstrate that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes for individuals who later use a reduced-hours program .
additionally , we find that initial assign- ment to powerful supervisors is more important to positive career outcomes—that is , employee retention and performance-based pay—than are factors such as supervisor assign- ment at the time of program use .
initial assignment affects career outcomes for later program users through the mechanism of improved access to reputation-building work opportunities .
these findings have implications for research on work-family programs and other employee- rights programs and for the role of social capital in careers .
keywords organizations , equal opportunity , social capital , law , work-family , work hours across many professions , employers are modifying traditional career and promotion systems by implementing work-family pro- grams .
reduced hours with prorated pay are now widely available to employees who have family responsibilities .
virtually all ( 98 percent ) large and medium-sized u.s. law firms have adopted such programs ( national association of law placement 2007 ) .
reduced-hours programs are catching on in academia , too .
state systems ( notably california ) are moving toward longer tenure clocks and part-time status for faculty ( mason et al .
2005 ) .
introduction of these programs is driven by organizations ’ need for legitimacy ( kelly and dobbin 1999 ) and by their attempts to address the formidable challenges of attracting and retaining women athe pennsylvania state university bmassachusetts institute of technology corresponding author : forrest briscoe , smeal college of business , the pennsylvania state university , 450 business building , university park , pa 16802 e-mail : fbriscoe @ psu.edu american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) 291–319 american sociological association 2011 doi : 10.1177/0003122411401250 http : //asr.sagepub.com ( gorman 1999 ) .
however , employees often choose not to use work-family programs because they suspect such programs actually hinder rather than advance their careers ( bai- lyn [ 1993 ] 2006 ; blair-loy and wharton 2002 , 2004 ) .
at leading law firms , for instance , employees state that reduced-hours programs are perceived as ‘ ‘ mommy track ’ ’ options , and they are concerned their superiors will think them uncommitted or even incom- petent if they take advantage of the programs .
these employees are right to be concerned .
although programs designed to assist tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups do sometimes help vulnerable employees succeed ( kalev and dobbin 2006 ; kalev , dobbin , and kelly 2006 ) , across sectors , employees who use these programs are at risk of fewer promotions ( kalleberg and reskin 1995 ) , lower wages ( kalleberg 1996 ) , and lower wage growth ( glass 2004 ) than other employees .
to our knowledge , no prior studies have identified employer practices associated with positive career outcomes for work-family pro- gram users .
this is due , in part , to the diffi- culty of obtaining longitudinal data tracking how employees fare over time when they use the programs ( kelly et al .
2009 ) .
our unique , time-varying career data allow us to follow a sample of employees over a number of years to determine the impact of exposure to particular employer practices on the career outcomes of program users and non-users .
while the current literature on work- family programs gives us little sense of the levers that might be used to mitigate negative career outcomes for program users , two related bodies of research contribute to our understanding of this issue .
the first explains the conditions under which employees are likely to use work-family programs ( but not the conditions under which they can success- fully use them ) .
this research suggests that the support of proximate supervisors is criti- cal to employees ’ use of work-family pro- grams ( blair-loy and wharton 2002 ) .
the second body of research explains conditions that lead to effective implementation of such programs for the organization overall ( but not the conditions that mitigate negative career outcomes for individual program users ) .
this research suggests that a support- ive regulatory environment and particular program designs are critical to these programs ’ organization-level effectiveness ( kalev and dobbin 2006 ; kalev et al .
2006 ) .
both bodies of research point to the importance of protecting employees from negative evaluation at the time of program use .
in contrast , we propose that such protec- tion can begin much earlier .
without denying that conditions at the time of program use can protect career outcomes , we suggest that conditions at the time of employees ’ entry into an organization can be no less decisive and can exert an enduring influence on how their careers evolve ( sørensen 2004 ) .
in particular , we expect employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups who are assigned to powerful supervisors when they enter the organization—and who later become program users—will have better career outcomes than similar later users who are not initially assigned to powerful supervisors .
there are three possible reasons for this .
first , early exposure to powerful supervisors can provide later program users with better skill development and relevant knowledge ( cross and cummings 2004 ) .
second , such exposure can allow for dissem- ination of positive opinions about employees for use in performance evaluation ( lin 2001 ) .
third , such exposure can provide employees with access to subsequent reputation-building project assignments , because powerful supervisors may have con- nections to other powerful supervisors and influence others involved in the assignment process ( epstein 1981 ) .
in these three ways , initial assignment to powerful supervisors can protect future users of work-family pro- grams from supervisors ’ potential negative evaluations at the time of program use .
in this article , we analyze unique longitudi- nal data on associates from a large u.s. law firm to test whether assignment to powerful 292 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) supervisors upon entry has a positive effect on the career outcomes of later users of a work- family program that allows employees to work reduced hours for reduced pay while remaining on the track to partnership .
we also assess which of the three postulated mechanisms can best explain this effect .
we control for regulatory environment , program design , selection into program use , power of proximate supervisors at the time of program use , and co-worker relationships at time of program use .
we demonstrate that initial assignment to powerful supervisors predicts positive career outcomes among later program users , and we find that access to reputation- building projects underlies this effect .
our findings contribute to the work-family and social capital literatures and build on key ideas from the literature on inequality remedi- ation in organizations .
many organizations have adopted work-family programs and other equal opportunity initiatives such as disability , sexual harassment , diversity , and dispute reso- lution programs designed to promote equal treatment for women , minorities , and employ- ees with disabilities ( dobbin 2009 ; dobbin et al .
1988 ; dobbin and sutton 1998 ; edelman 1990 ; kalev et al .
2006 ) .
while such pro- grams are designed to help traditionally disad- vantaged employees , the employees whom these programs are intended to benefit often choose not to use them because they are con- cerned about potential negative career conse- quences .
we end the article by discussing the implications of the practice of initial assignment for enabling successful career out- comes for users of work-family and other employee-rights programs .
work-family program users overall negative career outcomes for work-family program users in response to changing labor force and fam- ily demographics , many organizations have adopted work-family programs to improve employee recruitment , commitment , and retention and to comply with coercive or nor- mative institutional pressure ( davis and kalleberg 2006 ; glass and fujimoto 1995 ; kelly and dobbin 1999 ; osterman 1995 ) .
employees , however , often choose not to use these programs because they fear retaliation ( bailyn [ 1993 ] 2006 ; blair-loy and wharton 2002 , 2004 ; eaton 2003 ; hochschild 1997 ; perlow 1997 ; williams 2000 ) .
in fact , research has found that using such programs is associ- ated with negative career outcomes .
users of reduced-hours programs , for example , suffer from fewer promotions ( dau-schmidt et al .
2009 ; kalleberg and reskin 1995 ) , lower wages ( kalleberg 1996 ) , and lower wage growth ( glass 2004 ) .
similarly , users of fam- ily and medical leave act ( fmla ) programs suffer from future lower wages ( jacobsen and levin 1995 ) , fewer promotions ( hagan and kay 1995 ; judiesch and lyness 1999 ) , and less retention ( lyness and judiesch 2001 ) .
the literature suggests that employees who use these programs are evaluated nega- tively .
indeed , these employees are doubly vulnerable .
even before they become pro- gram users , women , mothers , and male pri- mary caregivers are often rated as less com- petent ( biernat and kobrynowicz 1997 ) , seen as less capable of assuming positions of authority ( ridgeway 2001 ) , and awarded lower wages ( correll , benard , and paik 2007 ) than other employees .
this is true even after controlling for factors related to skill and productivity ( anderson , binder , and krause 2003 ; budig and england 2001 ) .
once these employees begin to use work-family programs , they may suffer even further ; by simply using the programs , they highlight their membership in tradition- ally disadvantaged groups .
this may invite supervisors to question the employees ’ commitment , abilities , and marketability ( albiston 2007 ; blair-loy 2003 ; epstein et al .
1999 ; ridgeway and correll 2004 ) .
despite documented negative outcomes , these kinds of programs do sometimes help briscoe and kellogg 293 individuals in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed ( kalev and dobbin 2006 ; kalev et al .
2006 ) .
this variation in career outcomes raises the question : under what conditions can employees in traditionally dis- advantaged groups successfully use the work-family programs that have been estab- lished for their benefit ?
traditional approach : conditions at the time of program use two bodies of research shed light on this issue .
the first explains the conditions under which employees are likely to use such pro- grams .
‘ ‘ good ’ ’ employees—no matter how that ‘ ‘ goodness ’ ’ is achieved—report having greater latitude when it comes to doing things outside the norm , like using reduced-hours programs ( kelly and kalev 2006 ; kelly and moen 2007 ) .
furthermore , proximate super- visors at the time of decisions about program use play an important role in whether employees use work-family programs ( briscoe 2006 ; hochschild 1997 ; kelly and kalev 2006 ; perlow 1998 ) .
employees are more likely to use these programs if they work with powerful proximate supervisors who may buffer them from possible negative career outcomes ( blair-loy and wharton 2002 ) .
the second body of research explains con- ditions that lead to effective organizational implementation of employee-rights programs that are designed to assist traditionally disad- vantaged groups .
a supportive regulatory environment is critical to the effectiveness of these programs because it creates disin- centives for organizations to discriminate ( kalev and dobbin 2006 ; skaggs 2008 ) .
in addition , particular program designs facili- tate programs ’ effectiveness in law firms by requiring relatively low billable hours ( gor- man 2006 ) or allowing longer partnership tracks ( chambliss 1997 ) .
in other kinds of organizations , program designs facilitate effectiveness by assigning accountability for diversity outcomes ( kalev et al .
2006 ) , increasing employees ’ schedule control ( kelly and moen 2007 ) , or combining the evaluation step of performance review with the payment step ( castilla 2008 ) .
program user vulnerability to negative evaluation both bodies of research suggest that career outcomes may be affected by the degree to which employees are protected from poten- tial negative evaluation at the time they use work-family programs .
indeed , research shows that employees who use these pro- grams are vulnerable to negative evaluation of their commitment , abilities , and market- ability to clients ( kellogg 2009 ) .
supervisors may question the commitment of employees using reduced-hours programs , for example , by penalizing them for not acting like ‘ ‘ ideal workers ’ ’ who are willing to work long hours because they have no responsibilities outside of work ( acker 1990 ; kanter 1977 ) .
research also shows that supervisors ques- tion the abilities of employees who choose to use similar kinds of employee-rights pro- grams ; some supervisors believe that women and minorities who use affirmative action and diversity programs achieved their posi- tions on the basis of reverse discrimination ( heilman , block , and stathatos 1997 ) or that employees who use disability programs are incompetent ( harlan and robert 1998 ) .
finally , supervisors may question whether such employees , especially those who use reduced-hours or fmla programs , are mar- ketable to clients or customers ; supervisors may worry that employees will not be avail- able when a client wants them ( epstein 1992 ; epstein et al .
1999 ) or that they will not develop productive , in-depth relationships with key clients ( thornton and bagust 2007 ) .
supervisors who question employees ’ commitment , abilities , and marketability can damage careers because they have the power to award wages and promotions , 294 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) provide access to workplace opportunities , fire at will , and invoke formal organizational programs to discriminate against particular groups ( bisom-rapp 1999 ; mong and roscigno 2009 ; roscigno 2007 ) .
finding factors that protect program users from nega- tive evaluation based on program use is therefore critical .
the initial assignment effect : conditions at the time of entry these traditional approaches highlight how conditions at the time of employee program use shape career outcomes , but we propose that the seeds of success may be planted much earlier .
evidence connects success later in one ’ s career with conditions in the early years of one ’ s organizational tenure ( diprete and eirich 2006 ; sørensen 2004 ) .
furthermore , research shows that individu- als ’ advancement and success in organiza- tions depend on their access to powerful supervisors or mentors ( thomas and kram 1988 ) who can provide positive social capital ( burt 2000 ) .
powerful initial supervisors could protect program users from negative evaluations in three ways : by training them in superior skills , by disseminating positive opinions about them for use in performance evaluations , and by giving others in the orga- nization reasons to extend reputation- building work opportunities to the employees ( i.e. , because the supervisors ’ own powerful resources are visibly associated with those employees ) .
regarding provision of superior skills , a primary route for employees to accumulate human capital is through on-the-job training ( doeringer and piore 1971 ) .
in our research setting , most employees arrive from law school without any relevant work experience ; hence , their first exposure to the practical aspects of work in their profession may be especially formative .
galanter and palay ( 1991 ) argue that associates advance in law firms based on the lawyering skills they gain as they work on projects assigned to them by supervisors .
in general , lawyers are more receptive to learning from supervisors early in their careers ( katz 1980 ) , and initial supervisors strongly influence career sociali- zation to work routines and practices ( burton and beckman 2007 ; van maanen and schein 1979 ) .
because employees with greater expo- sure to powerful supervisors may gain access to better learning opportunities , these employees may develop superior skills that can protect them from negative evaluation once they become program users .
regarding dissemination of positive opin- ions , supervisors who are positioned more centrally in the network structure of relation- ships at a workplace likely control more resources in the organization ( brass and burkhardt 1993 ) and therefore have greater influence and control over information ( burt 1992 ) .
in the social capital literature , the most commonly cited benefit of a rela- tionship is the transfer of more and better information ( lin 2001 ) .
powerful supervisors can effectively disseminate opinions and contribute to performance evaluations and promotion decisions for employees in whom they develop an interest .
this can counteract negative evaluations of employ- ees ’ commitment , abilities , or marketability once they become program users .
regarding the provision of access to reputation-building work opportunities , pow- erful supervisors who have ties to others who control valuable projects can generate oppor- tunities for their subordinates .
in social capi- tal terms , these supervisors can lend their social capital to subordinates to facilitate their access to reputation-building projects ( burt 2000 ) .
for associate lawyers , the port- folio of projects they build up over time becomes a visible track record by which they are evaluated as potential partners ( beckman and phillips 2005 ; epstein et al .
1999 ) .
the quality of projects is thus a crucial factor for employees as they accrue the repu- tation and relationships that make them attractive candidates for senior positions in briscoe and kellogg 295 an organization .
for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups in particular , research shows that projects that provide opportunities for exposure can reduce career disadvantage ( kalev 2009 ) .
while such career advantages may benefit all employees who are initially exposed to powerful supervisors , the process we theorize is not simply a case of the generalized rule that ‘ ‘ the rich get richer ’ ’ —that is , early experiences set the stage for later career advances for all employees .
instead , we argue , program use leads employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups to signal their membership in these groups and to become vulnerable to negative evaluation .
thus , we expect that although later program users and non-users will both benefit from early assignment to powerful supervisors ( the rich will get richer in all cases ) , employees who become program users will benefit more from this early assignment ( because they are at risk of negative evaluation ) than will those who do not become users .
provision of superior skills and dissemination of posi- tive opinions can help these employees coun- teract negative evaluations , and access to reputation-building projects can ensure that a wide range of powerful supervisors and cli- ents have had direct experience with their commitment , abilities , and marketability by the time they become program users .
finally , it is important to rule out a com- peting explanation for the relationship between initial assignment and career out- comes .
if initial assignment is not random , then powerful supervisors could select supe- rior protégés from the start .
this could explain positive career outcomes for program users who were initially assigned to powerful supervisors .
however , our data suggest that such sorting is not the mechanism by which initial assignment affects career outcomes at this firm .
we find that initial assignment is not correlated with observable characteristics in any way that could be consistent with sort- ing .
we will address this competing explana- tion below .
method research site and reduced-hours program our unique longitudinal data come from a full-service law firm with offices in several u.s. cities .
the firm has a long history and an established reputation with clients in a range of industries .
near the end of our study period , the firm employed approxi- mately 1,000 attorneys and reported several hundred million dollars in annual revenues.1 the firm generally recruits entry-level asso- ciates from top law schools nationally .
the associate career consists of an up-or-out path to partnership .
fewer than one in four associates achieve partnership .
on entry , associates are assigned to a range of projects , partners , and clients based largely on the ebb and flow of work demands .
as they gain experience in their first few years , assign- ments become more substantive and the pro- cess of matching employees to projects becomes more meaningful .
throughout the study period , the firm had a policy authorizing associates to participate in a reduced-hours program .
under normal circumstances , any associate could be eligi- ble for the program after at least two years of tenure .
associates in our dataset who par- ticipated in the reduced-hours program enrolled , on average , during the beginning of their fourth year of tenure in the firm ( mean = 4.12 , sd = 1.62 ) .
once associates enrolled in the program , they were assigned specific full-time equiv- alent ( fte ) statuses—for example , 80 per- cent fte status or 60 percent fte status .
according to the firm ’ s policy guidelines , work conducted by reduced-time associates was evaluated in accordance with the firm ’ s review process for full-time lawyers .
com- pensation was prorated , and the year-end bonus for reduced-hours associates was sub- ject to the same considerations as were applicable to associates working on a full- time basis .
once enrolled in the program , 296 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) associates could remain in it for a short or long period of time , with the expectation that if they exited the program to return to full-time associate status , they would remain on the track to partnership .
data the data encompass 958 associates who entered the firm between the years 1997 and 2005 .
for most analyses in this study , we focus on 71 program users during those years .
personnel data include associates ’ pre-hire characteristics used for recruitment and hiring purposes , as well as records of career events , life events , and pay throughout an associate ’ s tenure in the firm .
we com- piled information on working relationships among associates , partners , and clients using annual billing records through the end of 2007 .
data are complete , with the exception of compensation data , which are available only for the years 2001 to 2007 .
in addition to these quantitative data , we conducted 24 interviews with partners , staffing managers , and associates .
we also reviewed interview transcripts conducted by an internal task force assessing the reduced-hours program .
analytic strategy because program use involves a self- selection process among employees , we begin our analysis by examining which asso- ciates are more likely to use the program in the first place .
we then consider the possibil- ity that employees are selected upon entry , rather than randomly assigned to particular supervisors .
we find that workers assigned to powerful supervisors do not differ from other workers on a wide range of pre-hire individual characteristics .
next , we turn to our primary interest— modeling the success of program users .
our analytic strategy is to include independent variables reflecting the organizational con- text for employees at the time of program enrollment , as well as variables reflecting organizational context during their first year of tenure in the firm .
to model outcomes , we estimate a series of regressions predicting performance pay and attrition outcomes , adjusting for selection effects .
as the final step in our analysis , we report the results of a supplemental investigation of the possible mechanisms that lie behind the initial assign- ment effect .
to do this , we enter three differ- ent mechanism variables into the outcomes models and consider whether the results pro- vide evidence that the mechanism variables moderate the effect of initial assignment .
dependent variables we use two variables for successful career outcomes : ( 1 ) performance-based pay rela- tive to cohort and ( 2 ) associate retention along the path to partnership .
performance-based pay .
associate pay has two components , a base salary and a year-end bonus .
base salary is constant across associates from the same class year and increases in lock-step by year of tenure .
bonus is assigned according to individual performance and is evaluated by the practice group leader with input from the partners who work most closely with the associate .
reduced-hours associates are awarded a bonus percentage based on their full-fte ( full-time equivalent ) pay , and their entire pay is then prorated to their particular fte level .
this payment practice allows for com- parison across reduced-hours and full-time associates in terms of their relative perfor- mance and contributions .
because bonuses are assigned to reduced-hours associates prior to their total pay being prorated , in prin- ciple , a full-time associate who transitions to reduced hours and continues to perform at the same level should receive the same percentage bonus , and hence the same non- prorated total pay .
the variable we use in our analyses is each associate ’ s annual bonus , net of his class briscoe and kellogg 297 cohort average that year .
this variable directly reflects differences in the bonus assigned to an associate relative to what the firm considers to be his appropriate peers .
this approach damp- ens any variance related to yearly fluctuation in funds allocated for the associate bonus pool ; a significant amount was allocated in every year of the study period.2 retention on the path to partnership .
fewer than one in four associates become a partner .
during the study period , associates either exited after a certain number of fixed years or were awarded partnership .
toward the end of the study period , the firm devel- oped options for associates who wanted to stay in the firm without becoming partners .
only a few individuals in our analysis took advantage of this option , and we considered the moment of their transition to be equiva- lent to firm exit in terms of representing attri- tion from the path toward partnership .
we have precise data on each associate ’ s date of hire and exit ( if any ) , taken from the firm ’ s human resource databases .
in analyses conducted on all associates , individuals are allowed to be at risk of attrition during their entire tenure in the organization , from date of hire until they exit the firm ( or to the end of 2007 , whichever comes first ) .
in anal- yses of attrition among program users , indi- viduals are at risk from the day marking the onset of program use until they leave ( or to the end of 2007 , whichever comes first ) .3 independent variable : exposure to powerful supervisors our primary independent variable reflects an associate ’ s exposure to powerful supervisors ( partners ) at various points in her tenure at the firm .
we took three factors into account in constructing this variable : ( 1 ) defining powerful supervisors , ( 2 ) operationalizing exposure of associates to those supervisors , and ( 3 ) capturing that exposure at different times in an associate ’ s tenure in the firm .
defining powerful supervisors .
a law firm ’ s revenues are almost entirely a func- tion of hours billed to clients .
interviews suggest that the most powerful supervisors ( partners ) are those who have the highest client billings .
thus , we define a supervi- sor ’ s power as a function of the client billings for which she could claim responsi- bility in a given year , based on whether she was designated as the lawyer responsible for that client .
for each partner , we added up the number of annual billable hours billed by any of the firm ’ s lawyers to that partner ’ s clients .
this total number of billable hours became the partner ’ s supervisor-power value for that year .
partners vary widely in their power val- ues , and power changed over time .
to sim- plify matters for the next step , we define power supervisors in each year as those whose power-supervisor values exceed a threshold ( withheld to preserve anonymity ) .
different thresholds and a continuous weighting alternative yield only minor differences .
operationalizing exposure .
we assume that associates are exposed to partners pri- marily by being assigned to client projects for which those partners are responsible .
rather than focusing on specific associate– partner links , our variable captures an associ- ate ’ s total exposure through client projects to partners with particular attributes , such as being power supervisors .
to accomplish this , we calculate the portion of all billable hours an associate reported in a given year to projects led by power supervisors .
the resulting variable ranges from 0 to 1.0 and varies for each associate in each year .
timing of exposure .
we include expo- sure variables in our models in several differ- ent ways .
the first variable captures expo- sure during the year prior to an associate ’ s transition to program use .
the second vari- able captures exposure at the time of an asso- ciate ’ s entry into the firm .
298 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) other independent variables and controls factors at the time of program enroll- ment .
first , because prior research suggests that co-worker support may play an impor- tant role in the use of work-family programs ( blair-loy and wharton 2004 ) , we control for the strength of an associate ’ s working relationships with proximal co-workers at the time of enrollment .
to do so , we use a var- iable that measures the portion of co-workers from an associate ’ s projects in the year prior to enrollment that he had been working with to any degree two years earlier ( e.g. , 20 per- cent of co-workers worked with two years ear- lier ) .
second , because research suggests that employee tenure may shape program usage , we include a variable for an employee ’ s ten- ure in the firm at enrollment in the reduced- hours program .
finally , because larger proj- ects may make it easier for program users to share work with others ( briscoe 2007 ) , we control for project size at the time of enroll- ment with a variable reflecting exposure to large projects—that is , client projects on which at least 20 other lawyers reported at least 100 hours in that year .
other variables capturing exposure to large projects yield only minor differences in the results .
other control variables .
we control for sex , minority status , parental status ( time varying ) , human capital in the form of law school rank and undergraduate grade-point average , department ( base case is corporate ) , city locations , a dummy for hires entering via smaller law firm acquisition , and size of an associate ’ s incoming cohort ( for additional details , see part a in the online supplement [ http : //asr.sagepub.com/supplemental ] ) .
an additional control for varying full-time equivalent ( fte ) levels of program users had no discernable effect on outcomes and was omitted from the final models .
mechanism variables superior skills development .
on a four- point scale , we give each partner a point for each of the following : ( 1 ) uniformly positive upward feedback responses from subordinates ; ( 2 ) high marks ( at least 4 out of 5 ) for ‘ ‘ train- ing and development ’ ’ from subordinates ; ( 3 ) partner chosen by firm to interview prospec- tive associate hires ; and ( 4 ) all subordinates retained by the firm in the following year .
superior information provision .
a supervisor social capital variable consists of a partner ’ s eigenvector centrality score in a network among the firm ’ s partners with ties defined by billings from one partner to another ’ s clients .
superior access to future reputation- building quality projects .
we created a project-portfolio quality variable based on factors that interviewees perceived to be important for career success .
we characterize projects on four dimensions : ( 1 ) billings to the firm ’ s major clients ; ( 2 ) number of differ- ent partners with whom an associate was sub- stantially involved ; ( 3 ) number of different clients with whom an associate was substan- tially involved ; and ( 4 ) portion of an associ- ate ’ s billings to projects whose lead partners were located outside of the associate ’ s department or office .
we then assigned each associate a time varying project- portfolio quality index for each year of tenure in the firm ( for additional details , see part a in the online supplement ) .
results our findings support the importance of the initial assignment effect in the career out- comes of reduced-hours program users .
ini- tial assignment to powerful supervisors is associated with positive career outcomes for program users in the form of higher perfor- mance pay and lower attrition .
initial assign- ment appears to trump factors at the time of program use , including exposure to powerful proximate supervisors .
furthermore , initial assignment effect is magnified for program users relative to non-users ; as a result , upon program use , employees with high initial briscoe and kellogg 299 exposure do not suffer the decline in career outcomes experienced by other program users .
this finding is robust to a range of modeling choices .
we also find support for one particular mechanism underlying the ini- tial assignment effect : exposure to powerful initial supervisors helps employees gain access to reputation-building project oppor- tunities , which in turn allows them to build a significant track record with a wide range of supervisors and clients by the time they use the reduced-hours program .
demographics of program users we begin by examining program users and the initial assignment process before turning to our main focus , success among program users .
table 1 provides a summary of descrip- tive statistics for the variables used in our analyses .
table 2 presents results from a model predicting program use ; corresponding hazard ratios for each covariate are provided in the right-hand column .
female employees are three times more likely to become program users ( p \ .001 ) , and employees who become parents are more than four times as likely to become users ( p \ .001 ) .
the likelihood of program use also rises with organizational tenure ( p \ .001 ) .
associates from better- ranked law schools are more likely to partici- pate ( p \ .001 ) .

300 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) including all the covariates from our main analyses ( i.e. , from tables 4 and 5 ) does not produce any other significant coefficients .
because we find several significant factors in these models predicting program use , we infer that it is important to address selection into use in our main analyses of outcomes among program users .
a random initial assignment process our earlier arguments regarding initial assignment to powerful supervisors lead naturally to the question of what factors influence this initial assignment ( rivera 2008 ) .
qualitative and quantitative evidence indicate that the assignment process at this firm is random with respect to individual characteristics .
the firm ’ s staffing system matches partner requests for associates , based on general project requirements , to associate availability .
for associates in their first two years , work experience and prefer- ence are not part of the calculation ( for addi- tional details , see part b in the online supplement ) .
to investigate this issue further , we use pre-hire characteristics to compare employ- ees who varied in their assignment to power- ful supervisors on entry .
instead of regressing initial assignment on a panel of covariates ( which could obscure associations through collinearity ) , we present basic mean and fre- quency comparisons for a series of these pre- hire human capital and demographic varia- bles .
we compare pre-hire characteristics of employees who have no exposure to power- ful supervisors in their first year versus employees who have between 50 and 100 percent exposure in the first year ( based on their total billable hours ) .4 we include key variables from our main analyses , as well as some additional variables that are avail- able only for subsets of employees and there- fore are not included in the main analyses .
table 3 shows the results .
overall , there are few significant differences in pre-hire characteristics between employees with no exposure to powerful supervisors and employees with high exposure .
on two variables—ranking of an associate ’ s law school and whether an associate completed a court clerkship—employees who were assigned to powerful supervisors actually scored significantly lower than those not assigned to powerful supervisors .
associates with more exposure to powerful supervisors were also less likely to have any recorded work experience prior to starting at the firm .

briscoe and kellogg 301 whether an associate had been on the edito- rial board of a law review during law school ( a competitive process ) , summer associate experience at the firm , and demographic characteristics such as being female , being of a minority race or ethnicity , or being mar- ried at the time of hire are not significantly different between the two groups .
these results are consistent with the notion that associates ’ initial assignment to supervi- sors is not correlated with human capital or other observable factors that could conceiv- ably influence associate success .
of course , it is possible that associates ’ unobservable characteristics influence the initial assignment process .
however , the quantitative evidence we have on observable characteristics , and the qualitative evidence we have from interviews , do not point to a sorting process until after the first two years of tenure , once associates gain skills , reputations , and rela- tionships that distinguish them in ways mean- ingful for the workplace .
exposure to powerful supervisors upon entry and program users ’ career outcomes tables 4 and 5 present the results of analyses predicting our two main outcomes , performance pay and organizational attrition , respectively .
these analyses use person-year observations with robust errors clustered on individual employees .
the performance pay analyses use least-squares models , and the table 3 .

304 attrition analyses use probit models that include dummies for years of tenure , making them the functional equivalent of discrete- time event history analyses .
to aid in interpre- tation , the probit model results in table 5 include a column showing the change in prob- ability for a one-unit change in each indepen- dent variable .
the sequence of models is parallel in both tables .
we start each series with a basic multivariate model showing how program use affects outcomes ( model 1 ) .
then , we examine how our focal variable—the initial assignment effect—predicts outcomes among program users .
we do this without adjusting ( model 2 ) and then after adjusting ( model 3 ) for selection into the program .
the next model asks how the initial assignment effect differs for program users ( during years of program use ) relative to all other employees ( including all non-use person-years ) , also conducted while adjusting for selection ( model 4 ) .
finally , for the performance pay outcome , we estimate an individual fixed-effects model to see how the initial assignment effect differs during program use versus non-use ( model 5 , shown in table 4 only ) .
model 1 in both tables shows how pro- gram use itself affects outcomes .
changes in work assignments and relationships expe- rienced by employees after program use ( summarized in table 2 ) suggest that pro- gram use itself may influence outcomes .
model 1 indicates that after controls are included , program use has a negative effect on performance pay ( p \ .05 ) and that program use increases the probability of attri- tion , although this effect is of marginal sig- nificance ( p \ .10 ) .
hence , program use appears to have a generally negative direct effect on outcomes , at least before taking selection into account.5 model 2 of both tables includes the initial assignment effect , and model 3 adds the selection adjustment .
selection into program use ( the treatment group in rubin ’ s [ 1974 ] causal framework ) is salient in our context if individuals who choose to enroll in the program are also likely to have different career outcomes .
specifically , the selection adjustment in model 3 of table 4 consists of an ols model predicting performance pay with a simultaneous probit model for the probability of program use ( not shown in the table ) .
we include an exclusion restric- tion in this and all other selection and treat- ment models discussed below.6 model 3 in table 5 provides parallel results from a bivar- iate probit model predicting the probability of exit for each person-year of use , while simultaneously predicting the probability of program use across all person-years .
dum- mies for each year of tenure in the exit model absorb any variance related to changes in probability over time .
as a result , the attri- tion model is equivalent to a discrete-time event history analysis ( using probability rather than odds ; see allison [ 2004 ] for a dis- cussion , including the appropriateness of the probit functional form for this type of dis- crete-time model ) .
these models include additional controls for time-varying factors that could influence success among program users , derived from literature on work-family programs discussed earlier .
results indicate that exposure variables captured immediately at entry into the orga- nization are key predictors of success among program users , even though program use does not begin until several years later .
as anticipated , initial assignment is significantly associated with increased performance pay and lower probability of attrition ( p \ .05 ) .
in the case of performance pay ( see table 4 ) , the impact of the selection adjustment on the initial assignment effect is to strengthen its statistical significance .
in the case of attrition ( see table 5 ) , accounting for selection leads to an increase in the mag- nitude of the initial assignment effect while maintaining the same general level of significance.7 to assess the overall magnitude of these effects from initial entry , we can use the coefficients from model 3 in tables 4 and 5 to compare the difference between an briscoe and kellogg 305 t a b le 5 .

307 associate who spent all her time with power- ful supervisors at organizational entry ( 1.0 ) and an associate who spent no time with powerful supervisors at organizational entry ( .0 ) .
this difference translates into a $ 30,350 increase in performance-based pay relative to cohort ( 30.350 x 1,000 x 1.0 ) and an 18.1 percent reduction in the probability of attrition ( we calculate the latter figure for the hypothet- ical employee described in the table notes ) .8 fit improves when we add the exposure vari- ables to each model .
in model 4 , after finding evidence of the initial assignment effect for program users , we turn to the question of how this effect differs for program users relative to non- users—or , more precisely , whether there is a significant difference in the initial assign- ment effect for participant person-years rela- tive to non-participant person-years .
because selection into treatment could bias our esti- mates of interest , we investigate this ques- tion using a treatment-effects model with an interaction of the initial exposure effect with the treatment of program use .
results in model 4 ( tables 4 and 5 ) indicate a signif- icant increase in the initial assignment effect for program users .
the interaction term is significant , and its inclusion improves model fit for both outcomes .
for a given difference in initial exposure , the coefficients from model 4 indicate a sig- nificantly magnified effect on outcomes for program users .
whereas a 1.0 versus .0 dif- ference in exposure leads to a $ 6,164 increase in performance pay for non-users ( 6.16 – .0 ) , it leads to a $ 26,624 increase for program users ( [ 6.164 1 20.425 – 20.460 ] – [ –20.460 ] ) .
this more than offsets the reduction in performance pay associated with program use .
because only a few employees have either 100 or 0 percent expo- sure to powerful partners , we also calculate the effects resulting from a difference of two standard deviations ( 2 sd ) in initial exposure .
a 2 sd increase in initial exposure corresponds to gains in performance pay of $ 8,771 for participants compared with $ 2,030 for non-participants .
turning to attri- tion , we find that the beneficial effect of ini- tial assignment on the probability of attri- tion is again stronger for program users .
a 1.0 versus .0 difference in exposure leads to a 4.7 percent decline in probability of attrition for non-users ( again for the hypo- thetical employee described earlier ) , compared with a 27.2 percent decline prob- ability for program users .
a 2 sd gain in initial exposure corresponds to a 9.0 percent decline in the probability of attrition for par- ticipants versus 1.6 percent for non-partici- pants.9overall , these magnitudes for pro- gram users are broadly consistent with results from the selection adjusted models described earlier .
for performance pay , we are able to implement a fixed-effects model by interact- ing program use with initial exposure to pow- erful supervisors .
the advantage of the fixed- effects model is that it implicitly controls for any unobservable ( or observable ) variation across employees .
only variables that vary within persons are included in the model , except for initial exposure to powerful super- visors , which is entered in the interaction term .
the results , presented in model 5 of table 4 , are consistent with our other models predicting performance pay .
specifically , the effect of powerful supervisor exposure at organization entry is significantly greater during program use , relative to non-program use.10 we find similar and generally stronger results for the initial assignment effect if we omit the selection and treatment adjustments shown in tables 4 and 5 .
as a further sensi- tivity analysis , we implemented a modified propensity score match based on program use and re-ran the career outcomes models using fixed effects for each matched set of program users and non-users .
the results are consistent with those presented in tables 4 and 5 .
in the above analyses , some control varia- bles for the social context at time of 308 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) enrollment are significant .
in table 4 , having more project co-workers at the time of enroll- ment who were also project co-workers two years earlier increases performance-based pay ( for program users and all employees , but this effect loses significance for program users after adjusting for selection ) .
in table 5 , spending more time on projects with 20 or more co-workers at the time of enrollment increases pay and decreases attrition for all associates , but it is not significant for pro- gram users .
exposure to power supervisors at the time of enrollment is marginally significant in unadjusted models of both outcomes for program users , but this effect loses significance after adjusting for selec- tion and is not significant for all employees .
in additional analyses ( not shown here ) , we looked for effects from other time-of- enrollment variables suggested in the litera- ture , including average tenure of project workgroup members and gender composition of workgroups ; we found no significant effects.11 mechanism investigation : why is there an initial assignment effect ?
table 6 summarizes results from additional analyses in which we added separate varia- bles designed to assess the relative impor- tance in the initial assignment effect of three different possible mechanisms .
the models predict performance pay and attrition ; the modeling strategy and control variables are the same as those presented in model 3 of tables 4 and 5 .
in this table , coefficients ( and standard errors and significance levels ) are provided for each of the three variables when they are entered separately into a base- line model .
we also show the coefficients for power supervisor exposure at organiza- tion entry , and whether model fit improves after adding the mechanism variable .
we are looking for evidence consistent with mediation .
evidence would include a significant coefficient on the mechanism variable while the power supervisor expo- sure at organization entry coefficient is diminished in size .
the mechanisms we considered are super- visors ’ provision of skills , provision of posi- tive opinions , and provision of access to future reputation-building projects .
neither supervisor developmental quality ( our indi- cator for provision of skills ) nor supervisor centrality ( our indicator for provision of pos- itive opinions ) explains the effect of initial exposure to powerful supervisors .
we find no significant effects of supervisor develop- mental quality or supervisor social capital for program users on either outcome .
expo- sure to power supervisors continues to have a statistically significant and substantial influence on post-enrollment success even in the presence of these variables .
and there is not a statistically significant improvement in model fit .
the third mechanism we proposed is pro- vision of access to future reputation-building projects .
we noted that powerful early super- visors may provide employees with access to future reputation-building projects if these supervisors have more ties , or more ties to other supervisors who control more valuable projects , than do other supervisors .
one way to examine this mechanism is simply to com- pare the networks of powerful supervisors versus other supervisors in the organization .
powerful supervisors do , in fact , have links to a greater number of supervisors ( 13.20 versus 7.48 supervisors , t-test p \ .001 ) , and to supervisors who control more valu- able clients on the dimensions that contrib- ute to the project-quality index ( p \ .001 on all three other variables in addition to the supervisor count , both in absolute com- parisons and when the other variables are normalized by number of alter contacts per focal supervisor ) .
initial assignment to powerful supervisors might also lead employees to better subsequent projects if individuals staffing the projects simply prefer employees exposed to powerful briscoe and kellogg 309 t a b le 6 .

310 supervisors , independent of any network ties between supervisors .
results suggest that the project quality index does mediate the initial assignment effect .
when added to the models , project quality has a significant impact on performance-based pay ( p \ .05 ) and hazard of attrition ( p \ .05 ) .
inclusion of project quality curtails the magnitude and eliminates the statistical significance of the powerful supervisor variable , consistent with its play- ing a mediation role in the impact of power- ful supervisors on success among program users .
in addition , project-portfolio quality is itself predicted by the initial assignment effect .
results from analyses predicting proj- ect quality among program users ( see table 7 ) indicate that exposure to powerful supervi- sors at entry increases project-portfolio qual- ity measured prior to enrollment , as well as project quality in the year after enrollment .
taken together , these findings are consistent with the mechanism of access to reputation- building projects mediating the effect of initial exposure to powerful supervisors on program user career outcomes .
discussion the initial assignment effect we found that initial assignment to powerful supervisors facilitated positive career out- comes for later work-family program users , that initial assignment affected users more than non-users , and that it operated through the mechanism of improved access to reputation-building projects .
initial assign- ment to powerful supervisors upon entry , while random in this organization , was a key predictor of success among program users , even though program use did not begin until several years later .
conditions at the time of program use , such as assignment to a proximate powerful supervisor , were less important .
full initial exposure to powerful supervisors led to a $ 26,624 boost in annual performance pay and a 27.2 percent lower probability of exit .
we observed these effects in the presence of a range of controls as well as an adjustment for the simultaneous effects of selection into program use .
the initial assignment effect operated through the mechanism of providing employ- ees with access to a range of reputation- building projects over time .
by the time they enrolled in the reduced-hours program , employees who had been initially assigned to powerful supervisors had gained access to a greater range of reputation-building work opportunities than had other employees .
we posit that this exposure to reputation-building project opportunities was important because the very use of a work-family program signals employees ’ membership in traditionally disadvantaged groups ( i.e. , mothers and male primary caregivers ) and leads supervisors to negatively evaluate employees ’ abilities , com- mitment , and marketability to clients .
project opportunities that provide employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups with exposure to a wide range of supervisors and clients allow these employees to solidify their stand- ing as able , committed , and marketable pro- fessionals in the eyes of this large invisible college before becoming program users .
this large invisible college directly experiences vulnerable employees ’ abilities , commitment , and marketability prior to program use , and this experience helps protect vulnerable employees from negative evaluation at the point of later program use .
although all employees who were ini- tially exposed to powerful supervisors benefited from reputation-building projects , the initial assignment effect was greater for those who eventually used the reduced- hours program .
whereas program users with full initial exposure to supervisors saw a $ 26,624 boost in annual performance pay , non-users saw a $ 6,164 boost .
similarly , whereas program users saw a 27.2 percent lower probability of exit , non-users saw a 4.7 percent lower probability of exit .
pro- gram users and non-users both benefited from the exposure to reputation-building briscoe and kellogg 311 opportunities that early assignment affords ; why did program users benefit more than non-users from these opportunities ?
we posit that , because program users were vulnerable to negative evaluation due to their very use of the programs , they were more positively affected than non-users by having a large invisible college of supervisors and clients directly experience their abilities , commit- ment , and marketability .
high exposure to reputation-building projects buffered against the negative effects of program use on eval- uation , so that highly exposed users suffered minor or no declines in career outcomes .

312 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) low exposure did not buffer against negative effects , so poorly exposed users suffered average or worse declines in outcomes.12 contributions to our understanding of work-family programs and social capital although many organizations adopt work- family programs to attract and retain employ- ees or to comply with institutional pressure ( davis and kalleberg 2006 ; glass and fujimoto 1995 ; kelly and dobbin 1999 ; osterman 1995 ) , employees often choose not to use these programs because they are concerned about potential retaliation ( bailyn [ 1993 ] 2006 ; blair-loy and wharton 2002 , 2004 ; eaton 2003 ; hochschild 1997 ; perlow 1997 ; williams 2000 ) .
indeed , such pro- grams often have a negative effect on pro- gram users ’ career outcomes ( glass 2004 ; judiesch and lyness 1999 ) .
our findings contribute to this understanding of work-family programs in several ways .
first , prior studies highlight either the conditions under which employees are likely to use work-family programs ( e.g. , blair-loy and wharton 2002 , 2004 ) or the conditions that lead to effective implementation of employee- rights programs at the organizational level ( e.g. , kalev et al .
2006 ) .
by contrast , we iden- tify conditions that allow individual employees to successfully use work-family programs .
second , while prior studies have not spe- cifically investigated the conditions associated with positive career outcomes for program users , they do suggest that positive outcomes are likely facilitated by organizational condi- tions at the time of program use , such as the power of employees ’ proximate supervisors and the design of the program .
in contrast , we demonstrate that the seeds of success can actually be planted much earlier : initial assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes of later program users , even when organiza- tional conditions at the time of program use are held constant .
our findings provide only limited support for the notion that powerful proximate supervisors can protect employees from negative career outcomes ; instead , we find that once we include powerful initial supervisors in the analysis , the effect of pow- erful proximate supervisors loses significance .
third , we identify the key mechanism through which the initial assignment effect operates—initial assignment to powerful supervisors matters because it helps employ- ees gain access to reputation-building project opportunities over time .
this finding is consistent with kalev ’ s ( 2009 ) finding that collaborative work relations can weaken ster- eotypes and lead to promotion opportunities .
but our finding differs from kalev ’ s in a sub- stantive way : her study points to the levers of self-directed teams and cross-training , while ours points to the lever of initial assignment to powerful supervisors .
these findings also add to our understand- ing of how relationships matter for career success .
in many ways , our findings are con- sistent with the broad prediction of social capital theory—relationships are important to careers because they serve as valuable sources of information , influence , social credentials , and identity reinforcements ( blair-loy 2001 ; burt 1992 ; fernandez and fernandez-mateo 2006 ; ibarra 1993 ; lin 2001 ; podolny and baron 1997 ) .
for these reasons , mentors in organizations are impor- tant because they provide protégés with access to new opportunities ( kay and wal- lace 2009 ; thomas and kram 1988 ) .
we make two contributions to this research .
first , we help to unpack the mechanism through which initial access to social capital shapes subsequent outcomes .
we find that weak ties to powerful supervisors—ties that are formal , random , and relatively short- lived—can set off a virtuous spiral of repu- tation-building project opportunities .
second , past studies find that women in male-dominated organizations suffer social capital deficits ( kay and hagan 1998 ) , yet little research directly connects the effect of briscoe and kellogg 313 social capital with actors ’ vulnerability .
we demonstrate that the value from prior rela- tionships is heightened when employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups become doubly vulnerable through participation in a controversial workplace program .
implications for our understanding of inequality remediation in organizations to what extent are these findings generaliz- able to other kinds of employee-rights pro- grams designed to remediate inequality in organizations ?
to help employees in tradi- tionally disadvantaged groups succeed , organizations adopt not only work-family programs but also diversity , disability , dis- pute resolution , and sexual harassment pro- grams ( dobbin 2009 ; dobbin et al .
1988 ; dobbin and sutton 1998 ; edelman 1990 ; kalev et al .
2006 ) .
individuals eligible for employee-rights programs often suffer the same vulnerabilities as those who are eligible for work-family programs—women , minorities , and disabled employees are often perceived as less competent than other employees .
using these programs highlights employees ’ membership in traditionally dis- advantaged groups and thus may invite supervisors to question their commitment , abilities , and marketability ( albiston 2007 ; edelman , erlanger , and lande 1993 ; harlan and robert 1998 ; heimer and staffen 1998 ; morrill 1995 ; silbey , huising , and coslov- sky 2009 ) .
our findings suggest that initial assignment to a powerful supervisor would likely promote positive career outcomes for users of these other kinds of employee- rights programs as well .
however , the tim- ing of program use may be important .
vul- nerable employees need to solidify their standing as professionals in the eyes of supervisors and clients before becoming program users ; if they use disability or sex- ual harassment programs , for example , shortly after entering an organization , they may not benefit greatly from initial assignment to powerful supervisors for two reasons .
first , the initial powerful supervi- sors may negatively evaluate them if they are already program users and choose not to provide them with a stream of reputation-building projects .
second , even if initial supervisors do provide these employees with such projects , the employees will have exposure to supervisors and clients under circumstances in which their ability , commitment , and marketability is already in doubt because of their choice to use the pro- grams .
thus , the invisible college may nega- tively rather than positively evaluate them .
to what extent is the employer practice of initial assignment generalizable to other organizations ?
we expect this practice to be most important to program users in organiza- tions where powerful initial supervisors can provide employees with access to a stream of future project opportunities that would allow them to solidify their standing as able , committed , and marketable profession- als and where a large invisible college of prior supervisors or clients participates in the evaluation of employees at the time of later program use .
in short , we expect to find similar results in investment banks , con- sulting firms , and accounting firms , but not necessarily in traditional manufacturing firms , where employees work with fewer supervisors and supervisors are typically not involved in later evaluation of their prior employees .
future research can help deter- mine whether and how the initial assignment effect applies to other employee-rights pro- grams and other kinds of organizations .
practical implications for individuals , the practical implications of the findings presented here are clear , if not encouraging : individuals who did not happen to be assigned to a powerful supervisor at the outset probably should not choose to use a reduced-hours program .
for organizations , the practical implications are more compli- cated .
on the one hand , initial assignment 314 american sociological review 76 ( 2 ) of female employees to powerful supervisors may be a way for employers to help these vulnerable employees succeed .
on the other hand , if initial assignment became a program in its own right , it might develop the same stigmatizing effect associated with other employee-rights programs .
perhaps initial assignment was so powerful in this case pre- cisely because it was randomly assigned .
this suggests that organizations should pro- ceed with caution , piloting initial assignment in particular offices or departments to see if it is possible to implement the practice in a way that does not invite retaliation .
in summary , one of the great challenges associated with remediating inequality in organizations is that even when organizations introduce new programs designed to help employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed , employees who use the pro- grams often suffer negative career consequen- ces .
this study demonstrates that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry can improve career outcomes of later work-family program users by giving them improved access to reputation-building work opportunities .
this allows these employees to solidify their standing as able , committed , and marketable professionals in the eyes of a large invisible college of evaluators before becoming program users .
in a world where particular groups are discriminated against in the workplace and where employee-rights programs designed to remedy inequality are often avoided by the intended beneficiaries , identification of employer practices that improve career outcomes for vulnerable employees is critical .
initial assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry could be a way for employers to help level the playing field for traditionally disadvan- taged groups in the workplace .

we provide these numbers to give a sense of the cat- egory of firms to which our research site belongs .
here and elsewhere , we withhold precise details about our research site to maintain anonymity .
2 .
an additional advantage of this approach is that non-prorated pay nets out the effects of any irregu- lar ( partial ) pay years that may arise if employees take leaves of absence .
3 .
we also have data on partnering .
however , analyz- ing partnering reduces the usable sample size greatly because many associates started at the firm too recently to have become partners .
4 .
results are similar if we choose other cut-points in the distribution of initial exposure .
5 .
we find similar results using other model specifica- tions , including a simple hazard rate model for attri- tion .
results are also similar for female employees only , although the negative effect of program use on performance pay rises from –20.575 ( $ 20,575 , p \ .05 ) to –30.405 ( $ 30,405 , p \ .01 ) .
6 .
the selection and treatment models include as coef- ficients all variables that are significant from table 2 ( full models available in part c of the online sup- plement ) .
although these models can be identified without it , we include a weak exclusion restriction in the form of a dummy variable for the first two years of tenure .
this variable is correlated with the treatment but is not correlated with career out- comes across person-years .
few other options are available because many factors that select people into the program ( e.g. , sex or family status ) are also correlated with exiting the firm .
we patterned our approach after fernandez and sosa ( 2005 ) who modeled a two-stage hiring process in which many factors influencing first stage outcomes also influence second stage outcomes .
7 .
attrition analyses are also robust to an alternative specification omitting the small number of exits that were internally designated by the firm as ‘ ‘ unregretted attrition. ’ ’ 8 .
as an additional analysis , we re-ran this analysis on female employees only .
this produces similar briscoe and kellogg 315 results : a $ 28,980 increase in pay and a 21 percent reduction in the probability of attrition .

we generated these interaction magnitudes using the margins , predict ( ) dydx ( ) postestimation com- mand ( available in stata v.11 ) following the bipro- bit regression command .
we computed the mar- ginal estimates of initial exposure separately for program users and non-users .

a parallel fixed-effects approach to the retention outcome , using a conditional logit model estimated on discrete-time event history data as suggested by allison ( 2005 ) , did not converge .
11 .
future research could examine the durability over time of the beneficial initial assignment effect we identified , including after program un-enrollment ( i.e. , following a return to regular employment status ) .

highly exposed users had performance pay out- comes around the same level as highly exposed non-users .

w. justin dyer brigham young university randal d. day brigham young university∗ james m. harper brigham young university∗∗ wrestling proteus : assessing the varying nature of father involvement across contexts this study investigated the common assumption that measures of father involvement are invari- ant across child age , gender , and reporter .
mea- surement invariance was tested with 320 families who were interviewed at child ages 10 , 12 , and 14 .
criterion validity was also examined , using observational , survey , and physiologic measures with factor rotation type considered .
it was found that invariance did not hold across gender for child report but did hold for mother and father reports .
differing factors were found across time and reporter .
child report and orthogonally rotated solutions demonstrated the greatest cri- terion validity .
the findings suggest that typical father involvement assumptions may not hold and , when this is the case , involvement should be conceptualized in light of varying involve- ment domains .
implications for conceptualizing and analytically examining father involvement are considered .
research on how fathers influence their chil- dren ’ s development has rapidly increased over 2073 jfsb , brigham young university , provo , ut 84602 ( wjd @ byu.edu ) .

key words : autonomic nervous system , exploratory structural equation modeling , father – child relations , longitudinal analysis , measurement invariance .
the past three decades , with numerous linkages found between a father ’ s involvement ( fi ) and the well-being of his child ( flouri , 2005 ; lamb , 2000 , 2010 ; marsiglio , amato , day , & lamb , 2000 ) .
given the importance of fi , research has sought to understand factors that influence fi , including child age and gender ( e.g. , w. a. collins & russell , 1991 ; larson , richards , moneta , holmbeck , & duckett , 1996 ; paulson & sputa , 1996 ; sher-censor , parke , & coltrane , 2011 ; updegraff , delgado , & wheeler , 2009 ) , and to understand how fathers , mothers , and children differentially report involvement ( e.g. , gonzales , cauce , & mason , 1996 ; mounts , 2007 ; paulson & sputa ; sher-censor et al . ) .
although previous research has uncovered much on how child age , gender , and reporter matter when understanding fi , as of yet the assumption of measurement invariance across these contexts has not been tested .
that is , whereas previous research has focused on mean comparisons of fi across age , gender , and reporter , an issue that precedes this comparison is whether fi holds the same meaning across these ( i.e. , does fi have a protean nature ? ) .
indeed , even though the same fi measure may be administered across contexts , the measure may not display the same properties and therefore be noncomparable .
the rich literature on measurement invariance has emphasized this point well ( e.g. , meredith , 1993 ; widaman , fer- rer , & conger , 2010 ; widaman & reise , 1997 ) .
as vandenberg and lance ( 2000 ) succinctly stated , ‘ ‘ it makes no sense to conduct tests of journal of marriage and family 75 ( august 2013 ) : 837 – 857 837 doi:10.1111/jomf.12036 838 journal of marriage and family group differences when the constructs that are being measured differ across groups ’ ’ ( p. 37 ) .
assessing differences in fi measurement properties tests hypotheses of whether the nature ( or perceived nature ) of fi differs across con- texts .
it is important to note that these differences are in and of themselves a crucial phenomenon to study , perhaps more so than mean fi differences .
testing fi measurement invariance across contexts will provide more nuanced understanding and conceptualization of fi .
fi research often implicitly assumes invariant constructs across contexts .
for example , the implicit assumption in a recent examination of whether the effect of fi differs by child gender was that fi has the same meaning and measurement structure across gender ( day & padilla-walker , 2009 ) .
similarly , whereas barber and colleagues ( barber , stolz , olsen , collins , & burchinal , 2005 ) examined the stabil- ity of the effects of parenting over time , they did not examine whether parenting ’ s measurement properties also demonstrated such stability .
age , gender , and reporter likewise have received little consideration in examinations of the multidimensionality of fi .
for example , schoppe-sullivan , mcbride , and moon-ho ringo ( 2004 ) examined fi multidimensionality , but did not consider child age or gender .
not considering these factors may partially explain the mixed evidence regarding fi ’ s dimension- ality ( see pleck , 2010 , for a discussion of mixed findings ) .
measurement invariance has also often been overlooked in the creation of fi measures .
for example , hawkins and colleagues ( 2002 ) developed a 26-item fi scale ( the inventory of father involvement ; ifi ) , with 723 fathers surveyed .
exploratory factor analysis ( efa ) identified nine domains .
because all survey responses were included in the same efa , invariance across child age , gender , and any other contextual variable was assumed .
also , because only fathers were sampled , whether their findings can be generalized to reports of other family members is unclear .
indeed , there may be domains of fi to which children and mothers are more attuned than fathers , and vice versa .
fi measurement differences also have sub- stantial intervention implications .
for instance , it may be that mother report of the father ‘ ‘ giv- ing encouragement ’ ’ ( an ifi item ) is related to child well-being .
recommendations may then be made to increase father encouragement .
fathers , however , may interpret and enact ‘ ‘ encourage- ment ’ ’ differently from how mothers interpret it .
recommending that fathers give more encour- agement may be ineffectual if the behaviors fathers associate with encouragement are not related to child well-being .
failing to account for the equivalency of mother and father reports introduces ambiguity in how to best tailor interventions .
in this article , we outline how to examine these assumptions of mea- surement invariance and provide an empirical example .
we systematically examined measure- ment invariance across child age , child gender , and mother , father , and child reports .
father involvement across child age measurement issues were addressed across the critical period from early to mid-adolescence .
in 1997 , hosley and montemayor noted that ‘ ‘ there has not been much longitudinal research exploring continuity and change in the father – child and father – adolescent rela- tionship ’ ’ ( p. 176 ) .
lamb and lewis ( 2010 ) reit- erated this deficit , and brown and bakken ( 2011 ) noted of adolescent research that ‘ ‘ time itself represents another variable largely neglected by researchers ; few attend to the specific features of the age group they study ’ ’ ( p. 162 ) .
although some studies have investigated parent – child interactions across the adolescent period ( e.g. , larson et al. , 1996 ; noack & puschner , 1999 ; paulson & sputa , 1996 ) , attention has focused on mean-level differences , with the implicit assumption that observable behaviors are equally indicative of the under- lying factors across time ( i.e. , that the meaning of the observables does not change ) .
indeed , we found no study that examined the assumption of measurement invariance across time .
it is highly likely , however , that the meanings of fi items evolve as the child ages .
for example , one of the ifi items concerns ‘ ‘ taking care of the child. ’ ’ as the child matures this item likely takes on new meanings , because the behaviors associated with ‘ ‘ taking care ’ ’ change to meet the developmental needs of the child .
earlier in the child ’ s life , ‘ ‘ taking care ’ ’ of him or her likely involves more instrumental caregiving activities , whereas later ‘ ‘ taking care ’ ’ may involve the father helping the child navigate the work and educational spheres the child begins to enter .
thus , the current study plays an important role in examining this assumption because we varying nature of father involvement 839 investigated whether latent fi measurement properties change as the child ages .
father involvement and child gender some researchers have noted the uniqueness and similarities of various parent – adolescent dyads ( i.e. , father – son , father – daughter ) .
for example , hosley and montemayor ( 1997 ) reviewed studies showing that child gender mod- erates the time fathers spend with their children , the degree of closeness felt between father and child , and how much the father knows about the child .
in contrast , russell and saebel ( 1997 ) argued that differences between dyads were likely overstated ( for a brief review of this liter- ature , see steinberg & silk , 2002 ) .
given these differences , there have been recent calls for fur- ther clarification ( e.g. , brown & bakken , 2011 ) .
an integral part of this clarification is exam- ining whether fi scales have the same measure- ment properties across gender .
for example , the ifi contains an item about ‘ ‘ acting as a friend ’ ’ to the child .
it may be that ‘ ‘ acting as a friend ’ ’ evokes gender-stereotypic ideas and thus holds different meanings across child gender .
respondents may therefore recall substantively different behaviors when considering a father being a friend to a male versus a female child .
because gender similarities or differences may be moderated by the reporter , we examined measurement invariance across gender in the context of fi reporter .
for example , father reports may have differing underlying structures of involvement for male versus female children , whereas mother reports may not .
given the lack of previous research , however , we made no specific hypotheses regarding which reporters may have more similar underlying structures across child gender .
reporter of father involvement although research has increasingly obtained perspectives from multiple family members , multiple perspectives of family dynamics in general and of the father ’ s role in particular are lacking ( lamb & lewis , 2010 ) .
adolescents , fathers , and mothers may each view certain paternal behaviors as being more closely linked to each other ( i.e. , part of the same domain ) and may reflect differing representations of the father .
for example , lamb and lewis noted that ‘ ‘ maternal reports of high paternal involvement [ could ] reflect something else , like family harmony ’ ’ ( p. 129 ) .
as adolescents , fathers , and mothers answer questions about the father , each may access conceptually different information , making for differing underlying constructs .
we therefore examined whether the number of fi factors and their structures differ by reporter .
it is important to note that this investigation is distinct from an examination of who is a ‘ ‘ reliable ’ ’ fi reporter ( e.g. , wical & doherty , 2005 ) .
when discrepancies between reporters are found , questions regarding which reporter is ‘ ‘ most correct ’ ’ often arise , but discrepancies may be a function of differing underlying constructs rather than one reporter being more accurate than the other .
in the fi literature , this possibility is rarely formally tested .
criterion validity and factor overlap this exploration of invariance across age , gender , and reporter necessitated at least two other measurement questions .
the first concerns criterion validity .
although fi factors may differ significantly across reporter , they may be similar in their correlates and therefore display the same criterion validity .
it may also be that distinct underlying structures are differentially related to correlates .
we therefore examined how fi factors are associated with theoretically linked variables .
patterns of significant relationships across reporters will help identify how reporters may tap into varying aspects of fi .
coded observations of father – child interactions as well as reports of child well-being were used as correlates .
given previous research , we expected that greater fi would be associated with more positive father – child interactions and greater child well-being ( lamb & lewis , 2010 ) .
other correlates include indices of the child ’ s physiologic levels during and in response to interactions with the father .
vagal tone was used as an indicator of physiologic state , with high levels associated with a restful state with few , if any , perceived challenges ( see beauchaine , gatzke-kopp , & mead , 2007 ; porges , 2011 ) .
fathers who engage in activities that build affection and trust may have children with higher levels of vagal tone during their interactions ( i.e. , children in a more restful state ) .
also important is the degree of vagal withdrawal in reaction to the fathers ( indicating a change from higher to lower vagal tone ) .
fathers who engage in affection and trust building may also evoke less 840 journal of marriage and family vagal withdrawal when the child is interacting with the father .
the second measurement question concerned the choice of whether to allow fi factors to correlate .
although researchers have delineated conceptually distinct fi domains ( e.g. , hawkins et al. , 2002 ; palkovitz , 1997 ; see pleck , 2010 , for a discussion ) , when multiple factors are found the implications of allowing them to correlate have received little attention .
in an exploratory fashion , we therefore examined factor structures and criterion validity of fi under two conditions : ( a ) fi factors are correlated and ( b ) fi factors are uncorrelated .
in other words , we examined the conceptual , factor structure , and criterion validity implications of assuming independent or overlapping fi factors .
the current study taken together , the current study addressed several fi measurement issues encountered in a wide variety of research ; specifically , should researchers assume equivalency of fi measures across child age and gender , and mother , father , and child reports ?
how do reports of involvement differentially or similarly relate to important child and family variables ?
what are the implications of assuming overlapping ( i.e. , correlated ) fi domains versus independent ( i.e. , uncorrelated ) domains ?
it is important to note that this is only a single study , and a finding of invariance or noninvariance may not hold for alternate fi measures or across a differing age range .
nevertheless , this study provides the con- ceptual rationale , the methodological outline , and an empirical example for testing founda- tional measurement assumptions of fi research .
method sample participants for this study were taken from waves 1 through 5 of the flourishing families study , an ongoing , longitudinal study of families with adolescents ( see http : //flourishing families.byu.edu/ ) .
this is a community sample taken from a large urban center in the northwest .
families were interviewed in their homes , with each interview consisting of a 1-hour video and a 90-minute self-administered questionnaire .
the sample consists of 500 families ( 147 sin- gle parent , 348 two parent ) with a child between the ages of 10 and 14 ( m = 11 , sd = 0.96 ; 49.8 % male ) at wave 1 .
for this study , we focused on two-parent households .
eighty-five percent of the two-parent families had a biological focal child .
seventy-six percent of mothers and 86 % of fathers were european american , 13 % of mothers and 6 % of fathers were african ameri- can , 3 % of mothers and 2 % of fathers were asian american , 2 % of mothers and 1 % of fathers were hispanic , and 3 % of mothers and fathers indicated that they were ‘ ‘ mixed/biracial ’ ’ or of another ethnicity .
fourteen percent of families reported an income less than $ 25,000 per year , 16 % made between $ 25,000 and $ 50,000 a year , and 70 % made more than $ 50,000 per year .
sixty percent of mothers and 70 % of fathers had a bachelor ’ s degree or higher .
the subsample used here consisted of 320 married or cohabiting heterosexual couples who did not separate during the time when the child was 10 to 14 ( the time period used in this study ) .
recruiting and retention in 2007 , families were recruited using the infousa national database , which contained over 80 million households across the united states , with detailed information about each household .
families with a child between the ages of 10 and 14 were first identified from targeted census tracts that mirrored the socioeconomic and racial stratification of reports of local target school districts within the target community .
of the 744 eligible families contacted , 500 agreed to participate ( 67 % response rate ) .
the most frequent reasons families cited for not participating in the study were lack of time and concerns about privacy .
the retention rate from waves 1 to 5 was 93 % .
sequential cohort to reduce the heterogeneity of ages within waves of data ( originally , a 5-year time span within waves ) , data were reconfigured into a cohort sequential design by age of the child .
we isolated three ages for this study : 10 ( n = 222 , m = 10.62 , sd = 0.50 ) , 12 ( n = 320 , m = 12.65 , sd = 0.60 ) , and 14 ( n = 320 , m = 14.54 , sd = 0.61 ) .
there are approximately 100 fewer cases at age 10 because only wave 1 was used to create this cohort , whereas multiple waves were used to create the age 12 and age 14 cohorts .

time and talking together measures father involvement .
father involvement was measured using a reduced version of hawkins et al. ’ s ( 2002 ) ifi that included eight items .
responses regarding the frequency of activities related to the child ’ s life were made on a 5-point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ) .
items included giving encouragement , reading books , attending activities , taking care of the child , acting as a friend , helping with homework , making it easy for the child to talk to the father , and working hard to pay for the child ’ s needs ( see table 1 ) .
adolescents and mothers responded to these items regard- ing the father , and fathers responded about themselves .
the eight items were selected from the original 26 on the basis of their applicability to the early adolescent period and because they represented several fi domains as identified by hawkins et al .
( 2002 ; see table 1 for hawkins et al. ’ s domains of items ) .
it is important to note that hawkins et al. ’ s domains were derived via efa without consideration of child characteristics or other contexts .
the current examination is therefore important in that it provides evidence of whether these domains remain invariant .
given the reduced number of items , we did not fully replicate hawkins et al. ’ s analysis ; however , it was highly instructive to examine whether items loaded similarly .
because it is not unusual for large-scale surveys to use reduced-size scales ( in particular for applicability to age or other characteristics ) , the current study measurement invariance tests are highly relevant .
descriptive statistics of fi measures are in the appendix .
observational data .
an interaction between the father and adolescent was videotaped and coded by trained observers using the iowa family interaction rating scales ( melby et al. , 1998 ) .
for the current study , we used observed father and child prosocial and antisocial behaviors .
prosocial behaviors are demonstrations of help- fulness , sensitivity toward others , cooperation , sympathy , and respectfulness toward others in an age-appropriate manner .
this also reflects a level of maturity appropriate to one ’ s age .
anti- social behaviors demonstrate self-centeredness ; egocentricity ; acting out ; and out-of-control behaviors that show defiance , active resis- tance , insensitivity toward others , or a lack of restraint .
they also reflect immaturity and age-inappropriate behaviors .
participant report .
child school engagement .
the child ’ s level of behavioral functioning at school , including his or her ability to get homework done and behave appropriately , was measured with a self-report nine-item modified version of a school engage- ment scale ( fredricks , blumenfeld , & paris , 2004 ) .
respondents were asked the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with items such as ‘ ‘ i pay attention in class ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ i am interested in the work at school. ’ ’ responses ranged from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) .
higher scores reflect a greater ability to focus and engage in prosocial behavior and get homework done .
alphas across the years ranged from .79 to .85 .
child internalizing and externalizing behaviors .
internalizing and externalizing behavior prob- lems were measured using the delinquency and 842 journal of marriage and family depression/anxiety-related items from barber et al .
( 2005 ) .
these questions were originally adapted from the child behavior checklist youth self-report ( achenbach , 1991 ) .
we used child reports of internalizing behaviors .
items included ‘ ‘ i am unhappy , sad or depressed ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ i feel worthless or inferior. ’ ’ for externalizing behaviors , we used mother reports .
externaliz- ing items included ‘ ‘ my child lies or cheats ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ my child steals things from places other than home. ’ ’ responses ranged from 0 ( not true ) to 2 ( very true or often true ) , with higher scores representing higher levels of depression/anxiety symptoms .
there is extensive evidence of both reliability and validity of these measures , and there is evidence that this scale has cross-ethnic equivalence ( krishnakumar , buehler , & bar- ber , 2003 ) .
cronbach ’ s alphas for internalizing behaviors ranged from .84 to .86 , and those for externalizing behaviors ranged from .68 to .79 .
vagal tone .
vagal tone was captured at wave 5 ( when adolescents were 14 years old ) .
follow- ing standard guidelines ( berntson , cacioppo , & quigley , 1991 ) , vagal tone was indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( rsa ) using ecg electrodes .
given space constraints , details of rsa measurement equipment and settings are available on request .
rsa data were collected under a variety of conditions .
for the purposes of this study , we used rsa levels and reactivity during a 3-minute father – child task .
during this task , the father and child were asked to list activities they usually do together and talk about what they especially enjoy about each activity as well as things they would like to improve .
we used the average level of rsa during the activity ( labeled simply rsa ) as well as the reactivity of the rsa ( labeled rsa-r ) to the 3-minute baseline established just prior to the task .
during the 3-minute baseline the child was instructed to remain still and not speak .
controls in the partial correlations we controlled for family monthly income ( the natural log ) , child gender ( 1 = male , 0 = female ) , and race ( 1 = black/african american , 0 = white/ caucasian ) because they may confound the relationship between fi and the correlates .
analysis plan analyses proceeded in several steps .
in the first step , the number of fi factors was determined for mother , father , and child reporter at each time point .
for each reporter we then examined whether factorial invariance held across child ages .
following this , we determined whether , at each child age , factorial invariance held across reporters .
next we examined , by child age and reporter , whether factorial invariance held across child gender .
finally , we observed the relationship of fi factors across child age and reporter with the hypothesized correlates .
when examining factor loadings and extracting factors for testing criterion validity , we report both the orthogonal and oblique rotations .
determining the number of factors we conducted an initial efa to determine the number of factors across reporter ( adolescent , father , mother ) and across ages 10 , 12 , and 14 .
this led to a series of nine efas ( three reporters × three time periods ) .
we used the robust maximum likelihood estimator because it is robust to data nonnormality ( see muthén & muthén , 2010 , for additional details ) .
chi- square difference tests were conducted with the appropriate maximum likelihood estimator scaling correction factor ( satorra , 2000 ) .
we used the mplus default of oblique geomin ( ob ) rotation ( correlated factors ) because it was developed to allow for complex factors and provide an interpretable pattern matrix ( yates , 1987 ) and because it has been recommended when cross-loadings are likely ( browne , 2001 ) .
we then used an orthogonal geomin ( or ) rotation ( uncorrelated factors ) .
we used the standard 1.0 eigenvalue ( ev ) cutoff to determine the number of factors .
there were , however , some instances in which factor evs approached 1.0 ( > 0.95 ) .
to determine whether these factors should be retained , we used the chi-square difference test to examine whether the addition of that factor substantially improved model fit ; that is , we fit one efa model specifying the number of factors with evs > 1.0 and another model that adds the factor with an eigenvalue > .95 and compared model fit .
we also report the differences in the relative fit indices comparative fit index ( cfi ) and root-mean-square error of approximation ( rmsea ) .
among the many relative fit indices we chose these two because they varyingly emphasize aspects of model fit .
the generally accepted cutoff for a good model fit is a cfi of .95 or higher and an rmsea of .06 or lower ( see hu & bentler , 1999 ) .
varying nature of father involvement 843 testing factorial invariance to test whether latent factors are equivalent across age , gender , and reporter , we followed meredith ’ s ( 1993 ) outline of testing factorial invariance , which includes examining four types of invariance : ( a ) configural , ( b ) weak , ( c ) strong , and ( d ) strict ( see also widaman & reise , 1997 ) .
these comprise a taxonomy of models with increasing measurement constraints .
configural invariance , in which the same pattern of fixed and free factor loadings are specified , is the least restrictive .
weak invariance imposes constraints on factor loadings ; strong invariance imposes constraints on loadings and intercepts ; and , finally , strict invariance imposes constraints on loadings , intercepts , and residual variances .
each model is compared to the proceeding model ( i.e. , weak compared to configural , strong compared to weak , and strict compared to strong ) .
in all models we correlated errors across reporters on parallel items to account for systematic item-based error .
substantively , when loadings are equal over time or across groups , items have the same validity , indicating that the items capture the underlying construct equally well .
testing invariance of the intercept has been considered a test for systematic response bias .
by testing equality of residual variances , one can examine whether the reliability of the items is the same over time ( see bollen , 1989 ; raines-eudy , 2000 ; and vandenberg & lance , 2000 , for additonal discussion of substantive meanings ) .
in order for it to be said that latent variables measure the same underlying construct , at least strong invariance must hold .
as widaman and reise ( 1997 ) summarized , ‘ ‘ thus , for most substantive research questions , constraints on the [ loadings and intercepts ] —embodying strong factorial invariance—would usually be considered crucial ’ ’ ( p. 296 ) .
we used chi-square difference tests to deter- mine whether imposing constraints decreased model fit .
decreases in fit are evidence that factors are not invariant at that level .
although the chi-square test is essential in examining invariance , because of its sensitivity to sample size it has been suggested that practical fit indices also be examined ( widaman et al. , 2010 ; widaman & reise , 1997 ) .
we therefore also report the cfi and rmsea .
after identifying the number of factors across time and reporter , we investigated whether factor structures were invariant across time for each reporter .
because there may be a differing number of factors at each time point , we used the number of factors at age 10 as a baseline .
although the number of factors may differ , it may still be that imposing the 10-year number of factors and testing invariance does not significantly decrease model fit .
we then examined measurement invariance for boys and girls by fitting multiple-group models ( asparouhov & muthén , 2009 ) and testing weak , strong , and strict invariance .
after this , we examined invariance across reporter by comparing each reporter against the other two reporters who have the same number of factors within time .
given that there is no clear baseline number of factors for reporters ( i.e. , there is no clear progression as there is for child age ) , we did not compare reporters with differing numbers of factors .
using mplus 6.12 ( muthén & muthén , 2010 ) , we employed the relatively recent method of exploratory structural equation modeling ( esem ) to test factorial invariance ( asparouhov & muthén , 2009 ) .
in essence , this method dif- fers from the more common confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) in that it has the flexibility of efa ( including rotated solutions ) along with the ability to impose model constraints to test hypotheses regarding factorial invariance .
in contrast to cfa , each item is allowed to load on each factor , providing substantial flexibility .
this is particularly important in the current anal- yses because items likely are indicators of more than a single factor .
because the purpose of this investigation was to identify how factor struc- tures may vary by time , reporter , and gender , imposing zero loadings may result in statistically significant factorial differences that may not be significant if zero loadings were not imposed .
for example , in typical cfa some loadings for fi would be constrained to zero for one factor while allowed to be estimated in the other factor ( i.e. , no cross-loading ) .
whether the loading is constrained to zero often depends on whether it is greater than a particular threshold value ( e.g. , .30 or .40 ) .
it may be , for example , that the father report does not meet this threshold but the child report does .
if the father report factor is constrained to zero and the child report is free to vary , comparisons of child and father loadings are much more likely to reject the null hypothesis of invariant loadings .
constraining loadings to zero has other impli- cations .
asparouhov and muthén ( 2009 ) note 844 journal of marriage and family that ‘ ‘ misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations ’ ’ ( p. 397 ) .
allowing for nonzero loadings also may allow for better identification of substantively different and less correlated factors ( marsh et al. , 2010 ; see also marsh et al. , 2009 ) .
although restricting items to load on a single factor may simplify factors , sass and schmitt ( 2010 ) pointed out that ‘ ‘ allowing for solutions that are more complex provides a more realistic depiction of the domains of interest ’ ’ ( p. 76 ) .
hypothesized correlates we used a two-step approach to determine how fi factors covary with hypothesized correlates .
in the first step , we examined partial correlations between each factor of fi and hypothesized correlates within each time period , controlling for family income , race , and child gender .
in the second step , we investigated whether significant correlations between factors and hypothesized correlates could be explained by the other factor ( s ) within reporter .
we therefore added the other factor ( s ) within reporter to the partial correlation as a control .
for example , in step 1 it may be found that two fi factors of child report significantly covary with a child ’ s externalizing behaviors .
the second step then includes both factors in the partial correlation to control for each other .
if both factors remain significantly correlated with externalizing behaviors , then each factor explains unique variance in externalizing behaviors ; however , if one is no longer significant , it can be concluded that one of the factors is correlated with externalizing behaviors because of its covariance with the other factor .
missing data we handled missing data using full information maximum likelihood although , as mentioned earlier , nonresponse missing data were minimal .
when comparing 10-year fi to 12 and 14-year fi , the smaller 10-year cohort was missing data for approximately 100 cases .
given the cohort sequential design , these data are missing completely at random because older adolescents were no more likely to be in the sample than younger adolescents .
results number of factors for all three reporters at 10 years , two factors had evs above 1.00 .
the ev for a third factor of adolescent report approached 1.00 ( 0.96 ) , although no items significantly loaded on the additional factor and we found a nonsignificant improvement in model fit from the two-factor solution to the three-factor solution , favoring the simpler two-factor model .
for adolescent report at age 12 , only one factor had an ev above 1.00 ( ev = 3.62 ) , with none approaching 1.00 ( the next closest was .85 ) .
thus , the one-factor solution was selected .
mother report had one factor with an ev above 1 and a second with an ev of 0.98 .
we examined the model fit and found substantial improvement from one to two factors , χ2 ( 7 ) = 48.55 , p < .001 ( cfi of .90 vs. .97 and rmsea of .10 vs. .06 ) .
we therefore chose the two-factor solution .
for father report , two factors had evs above 1 ( factor 1 ev = 2.87 , factor 2 ev = 1.11 ) , with none close to 1.00 .
at age 14 , two factors of adolescent report had evs above 1 ( factor 1 ev = 3.27 , factor 2 ev = 1.05 ) , as did mother report ( factor 1 ev = 3.27 , factor 2 ev = 1.01 ) .
father report had two factors above 1.00 ( factor 1 ev = 2.72 , factor 2 ev = 1.15 ) , with the third factor having an ev of exactly 1.00 .
the three-factor solution fit substantially better than the two-factor model , χ2 ( 6 ) = 33.58 , p < .001 ( cfi of .89 vs. .99 and rmsea of .10 vs. .06 ) , and three factors were retained .
table 2 contains ob factor loadings , and table 3 provides or loadings .
although there were loadings for each of the eight items on all factors ( as per esem ) , for ease of visualization we omitted those less than .30 .
on the basis of subsequent analyses ( see below ) , loadings for mother and father reported in table 2 were constrained at ages 10 and 12 , as were loadings for mother and adolescent report at age 14 .
it is important to note that , despite the unstandard- ized loadings being constrained , standardized loadings may differ to some degree .
invariance across time table 4 contains details on invariance tests across time for each reporter .
to examine invariance across time , we took the 10-year number of factors as a baseline for comparisons varying nature of father involvement 845 table 2 .

( i.e. , two factors across adolescent , mother , and father report ) .
even though father report of involvement at 14 years had three factors and adolescent report at 12 years had only one factor , we imposed a two-factor solution for comparisons .
in each comparison of father report weak invariance held , although strong invariance did not hold at any point .
for adolescent report , there were serious estimation errors when we attempted to fit a two- factor model at 12 years to make comparisons with the 10- or 14-year factors .
this is likely due to attempting to extract too many factors at age 12 ( again , efa indicated that a single factor was optimal ) .
we were therefore unable to examine invariance across time for adolescent report at age 12 .
in the 10-to-14 comparison there was a minor decrement to model fit from configural to weak invariance , χ2 ( 10 ) = 25.62 , p < .05 ( cfi of .94 vs. .92 and rmsea of .05 vs. .05 ) ; however , there were substantial decreases in model fit from weak to strong invariance , χ2 ( 8 ) = 160.97 , p < .001 ( cfi of .92 vs. .67 and rmsea of .05 vs. .09 ) .
in sum , there was no indication that fi domains were invariant across time for any reporter .
this indicates that examining mean growth in fi would not be justified .

invariance by reporter we next examined invariance across reporter .
at age 10 , two factors were identified for each reporter .
we first compared mother and adolescent reports , finding that weak invariance did not hold , χ2 ( 12 ) = 23.87 , p < .
05 ( configural cfi = .95 , rmsea = .04 ; weak invariance cfi = .92 , rmsea = .05 ) ; neither did weak invariance hold for father and adolescent reports , χ2 ( 12 ) = 24.38 , p < .
05 ( configural cfi = .96 , rmsea = .04 ; weak invariance cfi = .94 , rmsea = .04 ) .
weak invariance held for mother and father reports , χ2 ( 12 ) = 14.02 , p > .
05 ( configural cfi = .98 , rmsea = .03 ; weak invariance cfi = .98 , rmsea = .03 ) , but not at strong invariance ( i.e. , intercepts con- strained ) , χ2 ( 8 ) = 24.00 , p < .01 ( weak cfi = .98 , rmsea = .03 ; strong cfi = .96 , rmsea = .04 ) .
at 12 years , both mother and father reports had two factors and could therefore be compared .
with only one factor , adolescent report was not compared to mother or father report .
although there was a significant decrease in the chi- square from configural to weak invariance , χ2 ( 12 ) = 26.42 , p < .
01 , there was only a .01-point change in the cfi and no change in the rmsea ( configural cfi = .95 , rmsea = .05 ; varying nature of father involvement 847 table 4 .

athere were serious estimation errors when attempting to fit a two-factor model at 12 years along with the 10- or 14-year data .
this is likely due to attempting to extract too many factors at age 12 ( the model fit indicated one factor was optimal ) .
we were therefore unable to examine invariance across time for child report with 12-year reports .

that is , unlike previous analyses , a substantial drop in relative fit did not accompany the drop in absolute fit .
from this we concluded that weak invariance holds .
strong invariance , however , did not hold , χ2 ( 8 ) = 45.69 , p < .001 ( weak cfi = .94 , rmsea = .05 ; strong cfi = .91 , rmsea = .06 ) .
at 14 years , mother and adolescent reports both had two factors , whereas father report had three .
imposing weak invariance for mother and adolescent reports had a nonsignificant change in chi-square and an improved relative model fit , χ2 ( 12 ) = 6.185 , p > .05 ( configural cfi = .96 , rmsea = .04 ; weak invariance cfi = .98 , rmsea = .03 ) .
strong constraints significantly decreased model fit , however : χ2 ( 8 ) = 45.95 , p < .

in sum , weak invariance held for mother and father reports at 10 and 12 years as well as for adolescent and mother reports at 14 years .
in none of the comparisons did strong invariance hold , indicating that at no 848 journal of marriage and family time point are factor means comparable across reporters .
invariance by gender relative model fit for mother report of fi increased as constraints were added , giving no indication that factor structures vary by gender .
this was also the case for father report , except when strict invariance was imposed at age 14 , χ2 ( 8 ) = 23.75 , p < .01 ( strong cfi = .97 , rmsea = .05 ; strict cfi = .91 , rmsea = .07 ) .
for adolescent reports at 10 years there was some indication of variant factor structures with a decrease in relative fit from configural to weak , despite the nonsignificant chi-square difference ( configural cfi = .98 , rmsea = .05 ; weak cfi = .95 , rmsea = .06 ) , although there was a significant chi-square decrease and from weak to strong accompanied by decreases in relative fit , χ2 ( 8 ) = 17.88 , p < .

we therefore concluded that strong invariance does not hold at age 10 across gender .
little evidence of variance at age 12 was found , though at age 14 model fit was substantially worse from weak to strong invariance , χ2 ( 8 ) = 20.26 , p < .

thus , for parent reports , fi factor means are likely comparable across gender , whereas child reports are likely not .
hypothesized correlates factor scores for adolescent , father , and mother report of fi were saved using the mplus save- data command and exported to stata 12 to conduct partial correlations .
partial correlations ( controlling for race/ethnicity , income , and ado- lescent gender ) were conducted for ob and or versions of each factor of tables 2 and 3 and each of the predicted correlates .
two sets of partial correlation analyses were conducted , the first not controlling for the other factor ( s ) within reporter and the other controlling for them .
the results of the second analysis are displayed in table 5 .
partial correlations significant at p < .05 are displayed .
consistency across reporters and time are particularly important to observe .
in the first analysis ( not controlling for the other factor [ s ] ) , there were 58 significant correlations for the ob rotation and 47 significant for the or .
when controlling for the other factor , however , there were 33 significant correlations for ob factors and 43 significant or factors .
this includes several correlations that became significant when controlling for the other factor that were not significant when not controlling for it ( this primarily occurred in physiologic correlations ) .
for example , the or factor 1 was not significantly related to rsa-r for adolescent or mother report ; however , when the other factor was controlled for these became significant .
furthermore , for ob factors there was no significant relationship between rsa and adolescent report factors , but when controlling for each other , both factors were significant .
as hypothesized , greater involvement was related to more positive and less negative father – adolescent interactions and greater adolescent well-being .
although not always in the hypothesized direction ( as we discuss below ) , the direction of the relationship between physiologic measures and fi was consistent across reporters .
adolescent report table 5 shows that or factor 2 of adolescent report was associated with observed behaviors in every instance except for father and adolescent antisocial at age 12 , where there was only one factor .
only ob factor 2 did not predict adolescent and father antisocial at age 14 .
or adolescent report factor 2 was also related to all survey reports across years .
at age 14 , both ob factors were related to rsa and rsa-r .
both or factors were related to rsa and rsa-r except for factor 2 and rsa .
mother report mother reports were inconsistently related to observed father – adolescent interactions .
at 10 years , mother report was not related to observations , although at 12 years ob factor 1 was related to father prosocial behaviors , as were both or factors 1 and 2 .
or factor 2 was also related to adolescent prosocial behaviors .
at 14 years , both the or and ob factor 2 were associated with father prosocial behaviors .
for participant reports , three partial cor- relations were significant : or factor 2 and internalizing , or factor 1 and externalizing , and ob factor 2 and externalizing .
or factor 2 at 10 years was also associated with internalizing and externalizing .
both the ob and or factor 2 were related to all participant report data , varying nature of father involvement 849 table 5 .

at 12 years , both or and ob factor 1 were related to internalizing , and ob factor 2 was related to externalizing .
both ob and or factor 2 were related to vagal tone .
discussion the most striking element from this exploration of fi measurement invariance is the difficulty in achieving invariance that indicates comparable constructs ( i.e. , strong invariance ) .
indeed , although fi latent constructs were invariant across gender within mother and father reports , in no other instance was such invariance evident .
in addition to the lack of strong invariance , the number of factors varied across time and reporter .
furthermore , the original hawkins et al .
( 2002 ) domains did not consistently ( or even regularly ) align with current findings .
indeed , although items 3 and 5 ( see table 1 ) were in the same domain as hawkins et al .
there were several instances where items from other domains loaded highly with them .
items 2 and 7 ( part of the same hawkins et al .
domain ) were paired substantially in the same domain only for father and mother reports at age 12 and father report at age 14 .
these were not substantially paired for child responses .
taken together , these results suggest that domains of fi are more contextually based than research has previously conceptualized or operationalized .
domains at one point may not hold together at a later time , even when measures are taken only a few years apart .
models often used by fi scholars are likely not well equipped to conceptualize the kinds of fi differences found in the current study .
for example , lamb et al. ’ s conceptualization ( lamb , pleck , charnov , & levine , 1985 , 1987 ) and belsky ’ s model of the determinants of parenting ( belsky , 1984 ; two frameworks commonly drawn on in fi research ) do not explicitly consider the structural aspects of involvement domains , focusing primarily on levels of involvement .
indeed , pleck ’ s foundational reviews ( pleck , 1997 ; pleck & masciadrelli , 2004 ) treat fi ’ s ‘ ‘ levels , sources , and consequences , ’ ’ to which ‘ ‘ structures ’ ’ could be added .
the current study suggests that theories that deal more directly with time ( i.e. , life course and other developmental theories ) would add substantial value to fi theory building .
in addition , theories based on symbolic varying nature of father involvement 851 interactionism may be particularly useful in accounting for multiple perspectives ( or realities ) within a family .
although larson and colleagues ( larson & richards , 1995 ; larson , richards , & perry-jenkins , 1994 ) have exam- ined ‘ ‘ divergent realities ’ ’ of family members , they focused on mean differences rather than differences in how involvement domains are conceptualized .
in the next section , we discuss each component of the analysis and how attending to these elements moves theory building , data collection , and application efforts forward .
father involvement over time the findings of this study strongly caution against theoretical and data collection assump- tions that fi factors are invariant over time .
these findings have considerable implications for how fi dimensions are conceptualized and suggest a compelling line of research examin- ing how fi evolves over time and across family members ’ perspectives .
for instance , for the 10- year child report , ‘ ‘ act as friend ’ ’ loads on factor 2 at .92 ( ob ) , and ‘ ‘ make it easy for child to talk ’ ’ loads at 0.61 .
at 12 years , they load at 0.75 and 0.78 , respectively , and at age 14 they load at 0.68 and 0.87 , respectively ( an almost total reversal ) .
for this domain , the gradual decrease in ‘ ‘ acting as a friend ’ ’ and gradual increase in ‘ ‘ make it easy for child to talk ’ ’ speak of a parent – child relationship domain that is evolv- ing from playmate to confidant .
thus , from a conceptual standpoint , it makes little sense to measure whether the domain of ‘ ‘ playmate ’ ’ is increasing over time , because the meaning of the domain may be transforming .
indeed , the gen- eral theoretical notion of evolving fi domains has received very little attention .
when assess- ing fi across time , the typical consideration is whether items apply at various child ages ( i.e. , whether behaviors are manifest at different child ages ) and not whether the domain underlying the items has changed .
thus , our findings suggest that comparing mean differences across time , including mod- eling growth , should be handled with caution .
one should first examine whether invariance holds over time or even whether there are the same number of factors over time .
if factors are different , autoregressive models may be of use ( finkel , 1995 ) .
in these models , though , it must be acknowledged that the identical fi construct is not being controlled for from one time point to the next .
thus , it may not be possible to measure true change .
although elements of fi domains in this study were variant across time , it is important to note that the 10-year domains likely form the basis for levels of the 14-year domains ; that is , earlier domains likely form the foundations of levels in later domains .
although this is an untested hypothesis , it may be analogous to the foundation of a building .
the foundation is not the same thing as what is built on top of it , yet to a large extent the foundation defines the properties of what is built on top .
latent transition analysis ( l. m. collins , hyatt , & graham , 2000 ) may be helpful in handling such models , in which profiles of fi can be identified at multiple time points with an examination of how membership in profiles at one time point may lead to membership in profiles at a later time point .
father involvement and child gender our results also suggest that when parents respond to fi measures the domains are consistent across boy and girl children .
this was not found for adolescent report , perhaps because of differential identification with the father , boys and girls in our sample appeared to view the domains of fi differently .
this may help explain the mixed findings in research on differential fi for male and female children .
researchers should be aware that when children report fi , means across the genders may be incomparable , leading to erroneous conclusions about gender differences .
father involvement across reporter in like manner , variations found in factor struc- tures across reporters may indicate that the same behaviors are interpreted differently by children and parents .
for adolescents , ‘ ‘ encouragement ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ attending activities ’ ’ are highly indicative of factor 1 at ages 10 and 14 ( seemingly to make their own unique factor ) .
this indicates that encouragement , for adolescents , is associ- ated with parents supporting their activities .
in contrast , encouragement and attending activities are not as strongly paired for parent reports ( in particular within ob rotation ) .
factors also have important substantive differences across reporters .
for example , 852 journal of marriage and family factor 1 of child report at age 10 primarily deals with the father attending activities , whereas the parent factor 1 is primarily about ‘ ‘ taking care of the child ’ ’ ( most clearly seen in ob rotation ) .
thus , the children in our sample perceived a domain of father support rather than a domain of instrumental help .
this reverses by age 14 , however , when adolescents may begin to note instrumental care fathers provide and thus ‘ ‘ tak- ing care ’ ’ begins to form part of a fi domain .
it is interesting to note , though , that for father report at age 14 the unique domain of caregiving no longer appears .
this suggests that researchers should take great care in combining multiple fi reports .
summing or averaging items across reporters may merge statistically and conceptually distinct variables .
combining reports via second-order factor analysis ( bollen , 1989 ) or a bifactor model ( see yung , thissen , & mcleod , 1999 ) may be appropriate .
in these models what is shared across reporters is modeled while also accounting for unique aspects of each reporter .
if , however , only what is shared among reporters is used , the unique perspectives of each reporter is lost .
furthermore , when interpreting the influence of fi from any one reporter , the factor structure should be noted , and care should be taken when generalizing results beyond the reporter .
oblique versus orthogonal rotation as was expected , the or solution resulted in more cross-loadings than the ob solution ( loadings > 0.30 ) , although , again , in esem all loadings were estimated .
there were no instances of cross-loadings in the ob rotation , whereas there were 22 instances in the or rotation .
ob factors are therefore more clearly distinguished by factor loadings .
it appears that most factors retain their substantive meaning across rotations ( i.e. , similar loading patterns ) .
notable exceptions include factor 1 of father and mother reports at age 10 .
partial correlations are of conceptual and methodological import regarding or and ob rotations .
the considerable number of signifi- cant correlations with ob factors that dropped out when controlling for the other factor ( s ) leads to a substantial concern with overlap .
fur- thermore , there were several instances when neither factor of the ob rotation was signif- icant when both were entered in the model , whereas one or both were significant when not controlling for the other , likely indicating multicollinearity .
thus , although allowing for correlations provides clearer factor interpretation , in doing so , the overlap may be so substantial that they essentially become the same measure .
attempting to analytically treat various parts of fi as separate thus becomes highly problematic with ob .
or was better able to separate distinct fi dimensions and may be preferable despite the potential loss of factor structure clarity .
another important point concerns the 30 instances in which both the ob and or factors are significantly related to a correlate .
in all but three of these instances the or partial correlation is equal to—or , in most cases , greater than—the ob partial correlation .
furthermore , there were eight instances when the or factor was significantly related to a correlate when its ob counterpart was not .
there were only three instances of the reverse case .
this pattern is evidence for greater criterion validity of or factors .
conceptually , when fi factors are not allowed to correlate , the factor analysis identifies domains of behavior that function independently of each other ; that is , the level of fi in one domain provides no indication of the level in another domain .
this also means there is no global variable related to them both ( as was assumed in the original hawkins et al. , 2002 , study of the ifi ) .
whether to allow correlations is a substantive question , but it can become , as was seen here , a statistical one as well .
that is , when factor analysis produces highly correlated fac- tors , despite conceptual differences there is little practical difference .
again , although not allow- ing factors to correlate may obscure some of the distinct conceptual differences , this may be optimal when identifying how various domains differentially relate to antecedents or outcomes .
criterion validity and reporter regarding reporters , partial correlations reveal a clear pattern of greater criterion validity for adolescent report with 23 significant partial correlations compared to 15 and 10 significant partial correlations for mother and father reports , respectively .
the greater portion of this disparity comes from the observation correlates : mother report was not related to any observational measures at years 10 or varying nature of father involvement 853 12 , and father report was related to far fewer observational measures than adolescent report .
it may be that , compared to parents , adolescent responses reflect the global father – adolescent relationship .
adolescents may respond to items more favorably if the overall father – adolescent relationship is good than if it is poor , reflecting a sentiment override in their responses .
the findings also suggest that new measures of fi should capture domains salient to and even defined by the adolescent .
the creation of fi domains thus far has been largely father centric in that the father ’ s perspective has been the focus in defining their involvement .
it is important to note that factor 2 was associated with far more observational and participant report correlates than factor 1 , with factor 2 marked by the items ‘ ‘ make it easy for child to talk to you ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ act as a friend. ’ ’ factor 1 was typically marked by attendance at activities , helping with homework , and/or taking care of the child and was rarely related to observational and participant reports .
factor 1 may be considered as comprising more instrumental fi activities that do not deal as directly with the father – adolescent affective relationship .
it may be that the father ’ s antisocial and prosocial behaviors is an observed indicator of factor 2 .
if so , child reports may indeed be considered to have greater criterion validity .
one reason for far fewer significant correlates with factor 1 may also be the lower validity of the items for this factor .
indeed , in the or rotation for father report at age 10 only one item loaded above .30 .
in some instances , the items may be a good measure of factor 2 but a poorer measure of factor 1 .
this again stresses the critical importance of examining measurement invariance assumptions since how well domains are captured by items may vary .
physiologic data the relationship between physiologic data and fi was consistent across reporters .
adolescent and mother report demonstrated the most validity , with both factors 1 and 2 being significantly related with rsa and rsa-r. father-report factor 2 was associated with both as well , although neither factor 1 nor 3 was significantly related to vagal tone .
the positive association between factor 1 and rsa and rsa-r was consistent across mother and child reports , with greater fi associated with a more relaxed state .
this factor is associated with attending activities and ‘ ‘ taking care ’ ’ of the adolescent .
involvement in these more indirect activities may make the child feel more comfortable in the presence of the father .
conversely , and contrary to initial con- jecture , higher levels of factor 2 ( ease of father – adolescent communication ) were associated with lower rsa and greater rsa withdrawal ( lower rsa-r ) , indicating a less relaxed state of the child .
thus , when fathers make it easy for children to talk to them the adolescent may orient more toward the father and prepare to engage in an active exchange ( i.e. , vagal withdrawal ) .
it is important to note that moderate decreases in rsa are hypothesized as adaptive when engaging in certain social tasks ( porges , 2011 ) .
it may also be that these fathers engage in more intimate topics and the adolescent is responding to the possibility of topics that may be more personal .
although much future research needs to be done in this area , it is clear that extracted factors demonstrate criterion validity with objective , physiologic activity , and did so more for adolescent and mother reports than father report .
limitations one key limitation of the current analyses is the limited number of fi items available .
with more items , additional involvement factors would likely have been identified .
still , the findings are of substantial import regarding items that were measured .
indeed , larger scale studies often use reduced-size measures , and it is significant to note that , in the reduced-size scale used in the current study , measurement invariance was found to be of critical concern .
a second limitation is that we did not examine invariance by race/ethnicity .
this will be particularly important to consider when investigating substantive questions regarding such differences .
this also speaks to the relative lack of diversity in the current sample , in which only african americans and caucasians were represented .
measurement invariance also needs to be explored in other age groups and with other fi measures .
full versus partial invariance an area we did not explore is that of partial measurement invariance .
some researchers have 854 journal of marriage and family argued that there are occasions when not all loadings or intercepts need to be constrained in order to make cross-group or over-time comparisons ; however , there are few guidelines concerning partial invariance , and it is generally used in an ‘ ‘ exploratory , iterative , post hoc practice , and so it is subject to capitalization on chance ’ ’ ( vandenberg & lance , 2000 , p. 37 ) .
indeed , the order in which one tests invariance of individual loadings or intercepts may alter which loadings or intercepts make for a worse model fit .
if partial invariance is used , the question remains whether the means are conceptually comparable rather than simply statistically comparable ( i.e. , there are sufficient degrees of freedom to estimate the model ) .
this question can be answered only on a case-by-case basis with close examination of model fit and conceptual considerations .
even if partial invariance is assumed , it is important to acknowledge the potentially important finding that fi may have a somewhat different nature across contexts .
model trimming in the current analyses we also did not attempt to ‘ ‘ trim the model. ’ ’ when measures are not invariant , it may be possible to eliminate certain items that vary substantially over time or across reporters ; that is , the scale would be reduced to those items that do display invariance .
although in many instances this may be an acceptable alternative , it is important to note that this process eliminates fi information and therefore provides a less holistic view of the underlying construct .
indeed , the need to trim items to achieve measurement invariance likely means the same construct does not exist across contexts , although , given certain theoretical or conceptual reasoning , this may be justified .
conclusion the overall purpose of the current study was to provide the rationale for and an empirical example of the role of measurement invariance in conceptualizing fi .
child age , gender , and reporter are simply examples of numerous factors that may influence the nature ( or perceived nature ) of fi .
taken as a whole , the results of the empirical example suggest that much greater attention should be paid to how fi may differ over time and across reporters .
this study provides a window into a hitherto unexplored area of fatherhood theory and research .
it steers the study of fi away from a time-invariant and father-centric focus to a view of how perceptions of father involvement evolve over time for each family member and how those perceptions matter to family and child well-being .

the sick pay trap elisabeth fevang , ragnar frisch centre for economic research simen markussen , ragnar frisch centre for economic research knut røed , ragnar frisch centre for economic research in most countries , employers are financially responsible for sick pay during an initial period of a worker ’ s absence spell , after which the public insurance system covers the bill .
based on an empirical evaluation of a quasi-natural experiment in norway , where pay lia- bility was removed for pregnancy-related absences , we show that the system of short-term pay liability creates a sick pay trap : firms are discouraged from letting long-term sick workers back into work since they then face the financial risk associated with subsequent relapses .
we present evidence indicating that this disincentive effect is both statistically and economically significant .

0734-306x/2014/3202-0004 $ 10.00 305 pirical evidence regarding the responsiveness of absenteeism with re- spect to worker incentives ðhenreksson and persson 2004 ; johansson and palme 2005 ; ziebarth 2009 ; ziebarth and karlsson 2009 ; d ’ amuri 2011þ , there is little evidence regarding the impact of firm incentives .
oecd ð2010 , 133þ notes that countries where employers are responsible for a large share of their employees ’ sick pay costs tend to have much lower absence rates than countries where employers can pass the costs on to the public purse and also that absenteeism has dropped significantly in the netherlands and the united kingdom after a shift of financial responsi- bility toward employers .
yet , to our knowledge , scientific evidence estab- lishing a causal relationship between firm incentives and worker absentee- ism is nonexistent .
the design of firm incentives with respect to sick leave prevention also involves a potential trade-off between sick leave and labor- market exclusion : while more extensive pay liability ðor experience ratingþ improves incentives for absence prevention , it may at the same time under- mine incentives for employing persons perceived to have a high risk of ab- sence in the first place .
although the extent of employer co-payment differs sharply across dif- ferent countries , the incentive structure faced by employers in most indus- trialized economies typically implies that the firm is responsible for sick pay expenditures during an initial stage of a workers ’ sick leave but that the national insurance scheme ðor another insurerþ covers the costs accruing after some duration threshold ðoecd 2010 , table 5.1þ.1 this means that firms do have strong financial incentives to prevent short-term absences .
however , in cases where absence spells stretch beyond the co-payment period , employers may ðrightlyþ think that it is not in their interest to fa- cilitate a quick return to work , since the return to work also entails the risk of new short-term absences for which the employers are again financially responsible .
hence , current incentive structures may have the unintended side effect of discouraging employers from exerting appropriate effort to curb long-term absenteeism .
in the present article , we examine empirically the impacts of employers ’ pay liability by exploiting a reform in the norwegian sick leave insurance scheme , whereby pay liability for pregnant workers ’ short-term sick leaves was removed for absences caused by pregnancy-related illnesses ðin the 1 while most european countries have public insurance programs for short-term sick leave , typically with replacement rates ranging from 50 % to 100 % and maxi- mum durations exceeding 1 year ðpetterson-lidbom and thoursie 2013þ , there are no federal legal requirements for paid sick leave in the united states .
for compa- nies subject to the family and medical leave act ðfmlaþ , i.e. , firms with at least 50 employees , the act does require unpaid sick leave , however .
and many us em- ployers offer sick leave pay on a voluntary basis .
also , some states , including cal- ifornia , new jersey , and new york , have public programs that partially protect workers against the loss of income due to nonoccupational disability .

period prior to transition to maternity leave benefitsþ .
the motivation for this reform was that it was feared that the elevated risk of sickness ab- sence associated with pregnancies made employers reluctant toward hiring young women .
markussen et al .
ð2011þ show that the increased risk of absenteeism associated with pregnancies is indeed substantial ; the hazard rate of entering into a sick leave spell with a diagnosis predicting full ex- ploitation of the employer ’ s pay liability—often related to back pain , nau- sea , or anxiety—is raised by a factor of 5 at the onset of a pregnancy and further to a factor of 15 during the last 2–3 months before delivery .
the reform thus clearly removed a potentially important disincentive with re- spect to hiring young female labor , but at the same time it also changed employers ’ incentives to prevent sick leave among pregnant workers , for example , by reducing productivity expectations/requirements , modifying regular duties , encouraging colleagues to help out with physically demand- ing tasks , allowing more flexible and less strenuous hours , or investing in technical ðstrain-reducingþ equipment .
on the one hand , the reform made short-term absence—absence spells with durations up to 16 days—less costly for the firms .
on the other hand , it also made it less risky to let long-term absent pregnant workers return to work , since the firms no longer were responsible for the sick pay costs associated with subsequent relapses .
hence , the reform offers a neat set- ting for identifying the impacts of firm incentives .
based on a combination of regression discontinuity ðrdþ and difference-in-difference ðdidþmeth- odologies , we show that the reform had significant impacts on the affected employees ’ absence behavior .
using a bivariate hazard rate model ðwith nonparametric modeling of unobserved heterogeneityþ , we find that short- term absenteeism originally covered by firms ’ pay liability rose signifi- cantly , while the duration of noncovered long-term spells declined .
for example , we estimate that the reform led to a 10 % rise in the entry rate into absenteeism but also in a 12 % rise in the rate of work resumption at durations exceeding 16 days .
extrapolating our findings to the economy as a whole , we estimate that the 16-day pay liability system reduces the over- all number of covered absence days by 11 % , while actually raising the number of noncovered days ðdays exceeding 16 days durationþ by 1.6 % , compared to a system with no pay liability at all .
our results are exactly as one would expect on the basis of simple economic theory , provided that firms do have some influence on their employees ’ sick leave behavior .
our findings thus indicate that policy makers indeed may have good rea- sons to focus on improving employer incentives in their efforts to curb absenteeism .
we also find some evidence indicating that the removal of pay liability for pregnant workers made the school-to-work transition easier for young women .
according to our estimates , the reform raised the employment propensity 1 year after graduation by around 1.5 percentage points for the sick pay trap 307 young women in general and by 3.0 percentage points for those who were pregnant at the time of graduation .
this suggests that policy makers may have to trade off incentives for sick leave prevention against incentives for employing workers with high expected absenteeism .
ii .
related literature when an insurance scheme is troubled by moral hazard problems , ef- ficiency considerations suggest that coverage should decrease with dura- tion .
this is studied extensively in relation to the design of optimal un- employment insurance , starting from the seminal paper by shavell and weiss ð1979þ .
the argument is simple .
in the presence of moral hazard , there is an inevitable trade-off between insurance and incentives .
by re- shuffling the benefit schedule to provide lower payments tomorrow and higher payments today , such that expected utility remains constant , agents are given stronger incentives to search for jobs .
many countries have adopted declining benefit schedules for the unem- ployed , most often in the form of a single drop after some time in addition to an overall duration limitation ðcahuc and zylberberg 2004 , 143þ .
max- imum duration limitations are also typically in place for sickness insurance payments .
however , there are also historical examples of sickness benefits that increase with duration .
johansson and palme ð2005þ study a reform in sweden , where a time-constant replacement rate of 90 % was replaced by a time-increasing payment schedule with 65 % replacement rate the first 3 days , 80 % the next 77 days , and then 90 % from day 80 .
johansson and palme ð2005þ found that the reform changed workers ’ behavior exactly as the altered incentives would imply .
as the cost of short-term absence in- creased , short-term absenteeism dropped .
for long-term absences , how- ever , the return-to-work hazard declined as the risk of relapse raised the expected cost of returning to work .
this example illustrates a potential benefit trap : having reached the highest level of replacement , it is not par- ticularly tempting to risk a return to the bottom of the replacement ladder .
in the present article , we focus on the employers ’ incentives rather than those of the employees .
but , provided that employers influence their em- ployees ’ sick leave behavior , the story is basically the same .
if the employer is financially responsible for short-term absence only , the firm obviously has incentives to prefer a single long absence spell over many short ones .
and when employees have been on sick leave long enough to have ex- hausted the firms ’ pay liability , the financial risk associated with possible relapses may convince the employer not to accommodate a quick return to work .
while it has long been recognized in the literature that incomplete ex- perience rating in unemployment insurance systems incites firms to lay off too many workers ðe.g. , topel 1983þ , we have not been able to find any 308 fevang et al .
empirical evidence regarding the causal relationship between firms ’ sick leave insurance costs and their workers ’ absenteeism .
one of the closest pieces of evidence we have found is burkhauser , schmeiser , and weath- ers ð2012þ , which shows that disabled workers in the united states whose work limitations were caused by an accident on the job , and who were , hence , more likely to be covered by the experience-rated workers ’ com- pensation program than workers whose injuries were not work related , also were more likely to be offered accommodation by their employer .
our article also relates to a literature on the labor-demand effects of mandated employer provision of employee benefits in general ðsee burk- hauser and daly ½2011 for a recent discussionþ .
a contribution to this lit- erature with particular resemblance to our own is gruber ð1994þ , which found that mandates that raised the costs of insuring female employees of childbearing age in the united states ðby including childbirth in health insurance plansþ did not adversely affect young women ’ s employment rates , as wages adjusted to compensate for the value of the mandated ben- efits .
it is conceivable , however , that this finding could be reversed in la- bor markets with less individual wage flexibility—like the norwegian one .
iii .
institutions and mechanisms all norwegian workers are fully insured against sickness absence for up to 1 year , with a 100 % replacement ratio.2 norway also has a high level of absenteeism .
on a typical working day , around 7 % of all workers are ab- sent due to sickness .
this places norway among the countries with the world ’ s highest sickness absence rates ðsee , e.g. , bonato and lusinyan 2007 ; edwards and greasley 2010þ .
standard regulations imply that absence spells exceeding 3 days ðincluding weekends , holidays , etc.þ need to be cer- tified by a physician .
certification is not formally required until the ninth day for employees in firms participating in a tripartite “ inclusive workplace agreement ” ðiwaþ between employers , employees , and the state , although it is common to adhere to the 3-day rule even in these firms.3 approxi- mately half of the employees are covered by iwa .
in total , around 90 % of all absence days in norway are certified by a physician .
the sick pay costs are shared between the employer and the tax payers .
the general rule is that 2 there is a ceiling on annual earnings ðin 2012þ ofnok 500,000 ð ≈us $ 85,000þ .
eligibility requires that the employee have been at work for 4 weeks .
3 based on an in-depth study of a large norwegian iwa-company , bergsvik , markussen , and raaum ð2010þ show that more than 90 % of all self-reported ab- sence spells are 1–3 days long ðless than 1 % are longer than 5 daysþ , despite the possibility of self-reporting up to 8 days .
statistics reported by the norwegian welfare administration also indicate that the level of physician-certified absence is higher in iwa-firms than in non-iwa-firms .
the sick pay trap 309 the first 16 days of each absence spell is paid for directly by the employer , whereas the social security administration pays for the remaining days and also for subsequent rehabilitation or disability benefits.4 if a new absence spell starts within 16 days after a previous spell was completed , it is counted as a continuation of the previous spell .
this implies that a new pay liability period for the firm is not triggered until the worker has been present for at least 16 days .
the social security costs are covered through uniform pay- roll taxes ; hence , there is no experience rating .
on average , the pay liability system implies that firms ’ cover around 34 % of the overall sick pay costs for norwegian workers ðsee bjerkedal and thune 2003þ .
in addition , they bear the administrative costs associated with finding replacements and/or reorganizing the work .
although norwegian firms are not allowed to cut wages in direct response to an employee ’ s absence behavior , existing em- pirical evidence indicates that some of the costs are passed on to the em- ployees through an impact on subsequent wage growth ðsee markussen 2012þ .
in april 2002 , a reform was implemented implying that firms were en- titled to exemption from the 16-days pay liability for pregnancy-related absences .
common symptoms associated with pregnancy-related dis- eases are nausea , bleeding , anxiety , infections , reduced functional level ðe.g. , due to back painþ , and various psychological reactions .
the term “ preg- nancy related ” obviously entails an element of subjective judgment , since pregnant workers also may develop illnesses that have little or nothing to do with their pregnancies .
based on the observed differences in absenteeism be- tween pregnant workers and a comparison group of female nonpregnant col- leagues that we present in the next section of this article , we estimate that approximately 73 % of the absence among pregnant workers is pregnancy re- lated .
we do not observe whether a particular pregnant worker ’ s absence spell is really pregnancy related or not .
during periods of sickness absence , norwegian workers enjoy a special protection against dismissals , implying that they can not be dismissed on grounds that are related to their sickness.5 after the 1-year absence period , however , the firm is allowed to lay off the absent worker with direct reference to the sickness .
hence , if an employer for some reason wishes to lay off a worker—but is prevented from doing so due to the general employment protection regulations—the incentives for facilitating that worker ’ s return to work from a long-term absence spell are particularly weak .
4 workers who have exhausted their sick pay entitlements but who are still not able to take up work due to sickness are eligible for rehabilitation or disability benefits , depending on the prospects for future recovery/rehabilitation .
the re- placement ratio for these benefits is around 66 % .
5 the burden of proof lies with the firm .
in practice , this implies that absent workers can only be laid off as part of a mass displacement .
310 fevang et al .
although absence decisions are formally taken by workers and/or phy- sicians , the employer can affect absenteeism in several ways , for example , by ðiþmonitoring employees ðto prevent shirkingþ , ðiiþ investing in healthy work environments and equipment that can prevent afflictions caused by strain , ðiiiþ offering sick workers modified tasks or changes in the require- ments of their jobs , and ðivþ allowing the workers more flexible hours and less shift work .
these activities obviously involve costs ; hence , we may ex- pect employer efforts to depend on the extent to which they bear the di- rect costs of absenteeism in the first place .
norway has a generous public program for parental leave benefits .
in the period covered by our analysis , there was a paid leave period for 42 weeks with 100 % replacement ratio ðor 52 weeks with 80 % replacementþ , which has later been raised to 47 weeks ð57 weeks with 80 % replacementþ.6 the leave starts no later than 3 weeks before expected delivery , removing the pregnant workers from the risk of sick leave at this point .
it is possible to start the leave period as early as 12 weeks before expected delivery , but this is rarely done in practice .

data and empirical analysis the data we use in the present article comprise complete longitudinal administrative records on employment and absence for the period 2001–6 , merged with information on firms and workers on the basis of encrypted identification numbers.7 all absence spells are recorded insofar as they are certified by a physician ðregardless of recorded symptoms/diagnosisþ , typi- cally when they exceed 3 days .
this implies that the occurrence of very short absence spells is underreported in our data .
there is little that we can do about that .
to the extent that the removal of pay liability for short-term absenteeism increased the frequency of short absence spells among preg- nant workers , we therefore run the risk of underestimating this effect .
we return to this issue below .
as explained in the previous section , there is also a possibility of self-certifying absence spells as long as 8 days in firms par- ticipating in the iwa .
although this option is rarely used in practice ðbergsvik et al .
2010þ , we deal with the potential difference in certification patterns by always comparing workers who are subject to the same self- certification regulations .
our empirical analysis consists of two parts .
we first examine the extent towhich the removal of firms ’ pay liability for pregnant workers ’ sick leaves affected these workers absence behavior .
we then investigate whether the reform affected young women ’ s employment opportunities .
given that some of the reform effects we seek to evaluate presuppose employers with 6 these replacement ratios apply for annual earnings up to a ceiling of around 500,000 nok ðin 2012 value , approximately us $ 85,000þ .
7 individual-level absence data before 2001 are not available .
the sick pay trap 311 a forward-looking behavior , an appropriate structural model would con- tain elements of dynamic programming .
our empirical approach is con- fined to a more reduced-form setting , however , reflecting the more modest aim of evaluating the empirical relevance of direct ðmyopicþ and indirect ðforward-lookingþ responses to changes in firm incentives .
a .
absence behavior during pregnancies to examine the impact of employer incentives on absenteeism we con- struct the following data set .
we start out with all employees who became pregnant between may 2001 and may 2005 and did not make a transition to unemployment , rehabilitation benefits , or disability during the preg- nancy .
we then follow each pregnant employee for 37 weeks through work presence and sickness absence , that is , until she takes maternity leave and thus is no longer at risk of being absent due to sickness.8 these records constitute our potential treatment group .
given the rather subtle and po- tentially conflicting ways in which employer incentives were affected by the removal of pay liability , with likely effects on the incidence as well as the duration of absence spells , we set up a bivariate hazard rate model for transitions between the states of presence and absence to identify the re- form effects .
but before we turn to that model , we take a closer look at what happened at the exact time of the reform implementation by means of a rd analysis .
in both these analyses , we also incorporate a control group of nonpregnant workers ; that is , for each pregnancy spell , we pick a female nonpregnant worker from exactly the same workplace , at exactly the same point in time , of approximately the same age , and with a similar earnings level ðbased on a one-to-one nearest neighbor matching proce- dureþ.9 in the bivariate hazard rate model , the control group plays the es- sential role of representing the counterfactual trend in absence behavior within a did modeling framework .
in the rd analysis , we primarily use the control group to perform a placebo analysis .
1 .
descriptive statistics table 1 and figures 1 and 2 first offer some descriptive statistics .
there are 90,898 pregnancy spells included in our data set and an equally large 8 we assume that the pregnancy started 37 weeks before an observed transition to maternity leave .
transition to maternity leave almost always occurs 3 weeks prior to expected delivery .
only in 1.6 % of the cases does the actual delivery take place more than 6 weeks after transition to maternity leave , and these few cases have been deleted from our sample .
9 we select the coworker with the closest income level , provided that the age difference is less than 3 years .
if we can not find a female coworker with fewer than 3 years of age difference , the pair is not included in our analysis .
312 fevang et al .
number of controls.10 while our matching procedure is aimed at making the control group as similar as possible to the treatment group , it is evident that some small compositional differences remain .
in particular , the preg- nant women tend to earn slightly more than their nonpregnant colleagues .
this difference can either be attributed to positive selection into pregnan- cies or to the strong earnings incentives that pregnant workers face , given that their subsequent maternity leave benefits are calculated on the basis of their earnings in the 10-month period just prior to expected delivery .
the “ pregnancy wage premium ” is almost the same before and after the reform , however , approximately 3.5 % .
figure 1 illustrates that the rate of sickness absence has been fairly stable throughout our observation window for both pregnant and nonpregnant female workers , except for seasonal fluctuations .
the timing of the reform is marked in the figure as a vertical line .
based on a visual inspection of the figure , it is not easy to spot any reform effect .
a closer comparison of ab- sence rates by pregnancy duration before and after the reform is provided in figure 2 .
panel a clearly illustrates the sharp rise in absence rates that typically occur as the pregnancy progresses , with absence rates as high as 40 % –70 % the last few months before transition to maternity leave .
panel b reports the changes in absence rates from before to after the re- form at different stages of the pregnancy for the members of the treatment group minus the corresponding changes for the members of the control group .
according to these descriptive did estimators , the reform appar- ently raised absenteeism somewhat , with a possible exception for the later stages of the pregnancy .
the overall absence rate for pregnant women rose 10 in total , there were 120,089 pregnancies among employed workers in our data period .
we lose 29,191 spells ð24.3 % þ due to lack of appropriate controls .

315 from 32.9 % before the reform to 33.8 % after the reform , while it dropped from 7.5 % to 7.3 % for the members of the control group .
a simple de- scriptive did estimate for the overall reform effect measured by this outcome is thus a modest increase of 1.1 percentage points , or 3.4 % ð100 1.1/32.9þ .
2 .
regression discontinuity analysis figure 3 illustrates the basic idea of a rd analysis .
panel a shows how the daily sick leave entry rates among pregnant workers evolved from 90 days before to 90 days after the reform.11 due to the seasonal pattern in absence behavior ðrecall that the reform was implemented on april 1þ , there is a declining time trend in this period .
imposing a linear calendar time function to control for this development yields a reform effect cor- responding to the small upward shift illustrated in the graph .
panel c shows how the size of this estimated reform effect varies as we change the bandwidth ðthe number of days before/after the reform included in the analysisþ .
the shorter the time window , the larger the estimated ef- fects , suggesting ðperhapsþ that there was a scope for firms/employees to “ postpone ” the starting date a few days just around the implementation of the reform .
the effect is statistically significant , however , regardless of bandwidth .
if we rely on the more conservative estimates , that is , those based on the longest time windows , we conclude ðfrom the size of the jump in panel aþ that the reform raised the daily entry rate to sick leave among pregnant workers by 0.21 percentage points .
since the expected daily entry rate was estimated to be 1.12 % just prior to the jump , this corresponds to an increase of 18.8 % .
as a sort of “ placebo test , ” we ex- amine in panel e how the effect estimate changes if we assume alternative false implementation dates .
the graph shows that the effect estimates be- come smaller the further we move away from the true implementation date .
additional placebo tests can be obtained by repeating the whole es- timation procedure on the control group .
the results are illustrated in panels b , d , and f. the message coming out of these graphs is clear : there is no reform effect whatsoever in the control group .
a natural objection to the regression discontinuity results presented so far is that they may depend heavily on the linearity assumption for cal- endar time effects .
table 2 shows , however , that the finding of a positive reform effect is highly robust with respect to the specification of the underlying time function .
the table presents results for models with from one to four degree polynomials in a time function assumed to be the same before and after the reform and also with from one to four degree poly- nomials in time functions estimated separately before and after the reform 11 daily entry rates are adjusted for weekdays , public holidays , and the first day after holidays .

estimated impact on absence inci- dence of removing firms ’ pay liability ðwith 95 % confidence intervalsþ .
bandwidth in panels e and f is 180 days around the true timing of the reform .
reform effects are estimated using a simple linear trend and a reform dummy .
ðin the latter case the reported reform effect is the shift that occurred at the time of reform implementationþ .
all the results are presented for three alternative bandwidths and for both treatments and controls .
we interpret the results as convincing evidence that the reform indeed raised the fre- quency of absence spells among pregnant women .
all the 24 alternative specifications produce significant positive reform effects for the treatment group .
none of them produce significant results for the control group of nonpregnant colleagues .
taken at face value , the rd analysis indicates that pregnant workers ’ entry rate to sick leave was raised 18.8 % as a direct result of the reform .
if this was the only effect of the reform , the overall level of absenteeism would also increase by 18.8 % .
this is a huge effect compared to the 3.4 % increase suggested by the descriptive did calculations referred to above .
one possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that a higher entry rate was not the only effect but that the reform also triggered sig- nificant changes in the duration distribution and recurrence pattern of absence spells and consequently also in the composition of present and absent workers .
this is what we examine in the next subsections .

tions to and from sick leave .
this simultaneity may be empirically im- portant , since we suspect that the reform affected both transitions , po- tentially changing the composition of the two risk groups of present and absent workers .
based on economic theory , we hypothesize that four dif- ferent reform effects may have been at work , all operating through firm incentives : 1 .
a positive direct effect on absence incidence for workers who had not completed a long-term absence recently ðfewer than 16 days agoþ .
this follows directly from the fact that the removal of pay liability made new absence spells less costly for the firm .
2 .
a negative indirect effect on absence incidence for workers who had completed a long-term absence recently .
the reason for this is that the prereform pay liability system entailed a firm incentive to advance any expected ðor potentialþ relapses such that they occurred before a new pay liability period was triggered .
the removal of pay liability thus eliminated the incentive to push workers at high risk of relapse into sick leave within 16 days .
3 .
a negative direct effect on work resumption ðpositive effect on ab- senteeismþ for absent workers who had been sick-listed fewer than 16 days .
this follows directly from the fact that the removal pay liability made absence continuation less costly for the firm within this period .
4 .
a positive indirect effect on work resumption ðnegative effect on absenteeismþ for absent workers who had been sick-listed more than 16 days .
the reason for this is that since the reform removed the pay liability associated with subsequent relapses , it also removed an essential part of the firm ’ s economic risk associated with early work resumption .
an important point to note here is that the indirect effects are not necessarily smaller or less important than the direct effects .
we use the term “ indirect ” to emphasize that the effects in question require an ele- ment of forward-looking behavior , not that they are of second order .
to the contrary , we expect the indirect work resumption effect ðitem 4 aboveþ to be particularly significant , as the costs associated with frequent relapses could be very large prior to the reform .
whether the direct or the indirect effects dominate the actual reform responses is an empirical question to which our hazard rate model is designed to provide an answer .
note that the second and third effects listed above are likely to be of minor quanti- tative importance for overall absenteeism , since they are at work only the first 16 days after or during absence spells , respectively .
they are never- theless of scientific interest , since they convey information about employ- ers ’ ability to affect the pattern of the employees ’ absenteeism .
the sick pay trap 319 in this exercise , we exploit a much larger time window ð2001.5–2005.5þ and base our inference on differences in the differences between the treat- ment and the control groups before and after the reform .
hence , it is the interaction of being pregnant and being in the postreform period that iden- tifies the causal effects of the reform .
however , since we are interested in both the direct and indirect effects , the pregnancy-reform interaction needs to be further interacted with variables indicating whether pay liability ap- plied or not in the prereform period , which again depended on the dura- tion of ongoing and past ðrecentþ spells .
since the duration of ongoing and past spells obviously may have autonomous effects on absence behavior in ways that differ between pregnant and nonpregnant workers , we need a full set of controls for these factors to identify the reform effects .
let p be an indicator variable denoting potential treatment ðpregnancyþ , let r be an indicator denoting that the reform has been implemented ðafter april 1 , 2002þ , let d be an indicator denoting that the current state ðpresence or absenceþ has lasted fewer than 16 days , and let i be an indicator denoting that the last absence spell ðif anyþ also lasted fewer than 16 days.12 fur- thermore , let pj , j5 9 , 8 , .
.
.
, 1 be indicator variables denoting the number of months until expected delivery for those who are pregnant .
we write the hazard rate of moving from presence to absence as v1it 5 exp½xitb1k 1 v1i 1 j1t 1 d1jpj 1 f11d1 f12d r1 f13d p 1 f14d i1 f15d r i1 f16d p i 1 a11p r ð12d1d iþ 1 a12p r ðd2d iþ ; ð1þ where ð12d1d iþ is for “ pay liability did apply ” and ðd2d iþ is for “ pay liability did not apply. ” the hazard rate of moving back to presence ðwork resumptionþ is v2it 5 exp½xitb2k 1 v2i 1 j2t 1 d2jpj 1 f21d1 f22d r1 f23d p 1 a21p r d1 a22p r ð12dþ ; ð2þ where d is for “ pay liability did apply ” and ð12dþ is for “ pay liability did not apply. ” in equations ð1þ and ð2þ , xit is a vector of observed time- 12 the duration of absence spells is measured inclusive of days belonging to previous absence spells that were terminated fewer than 16 days prior to the start of a current spell .
320 fevang et al .
variant covariates and ðv1i , v2iþ are unobserved person-specific , time- invariant covariates subject to a joint , but unknown , distribution.13 the coefficients of interest appear in the last rows of these expressions ða11 ; a12 ; a22 ; a21þ .
if employer incentives do affect employees ’ absence behavior , we expect that a11 > 0 ðeffect 1 listed aboveþ , a12 < 0 ðeffect 2þ , a21 < 0 ðef- fect 3þ , and a22 > 0 ðeffect 4þ .
the first rows of equations ð1þ and ð2þ con- tain controls for observed and unobserved heterogeneity , for pregnan- cies ðtreatmentþ , and for calendar time .
note that calendar time effects ðj1t ; j2tþ are estimated separately for eachmonth , implying that any general differences between the prereform and postreform periods are absorbed by these effects .
the second and third of rows of equation ð1þ and the second row of equation ð2þ contain controls for the factors that deter- mined initial pay liability , and to ensure that it is the interaction of treat- ment and reform ðp rþ that identifies the causal effects , these determi- nants are interacted with p and r separately .
this implies that we allow the effects of spell duration ðfewer than/more than 16 daysþ and the ef- fects of recent absenteeism ðfewer than/more than 16 daysþ to vary between the treatment and the control groups and between the prereform and post- reform periods .
to avoid setting up a model for the initial state , we condition on work- ers having been present for at least 32 days to start with.14 to derive the likelihood function for observed data , we split each individual ’ s event history into parts characterized by constant explanatory variables and unchanged state .
let ski , k 5 1 , 2 , be the set of observed spell parts under risk of event k ðsickness , work-resumptionþ for individual i .
let lkis de- note the observed length of each of the spell parts , and let the indicator variables ykis denote whether a spell part at risk of transition k actually ended in such a transition or was right-censored .
conditional on unob- served heterogeneity , the likelihood function for individual i can then be written as lðv1i ; v2iþ5ps∈s1i v1itðv1iþ½ y1isexpf2l1is½v1itðv1iþg ps∈s2i v2itðv2iþ½ y2isexpf2l2is½v2itðv2iþg : ð3þ 13 note that if a person is observed with multiple pregnancies during our ob- servation window , she is treated as multiple persons ðwith a separate unobserved heterogeneity vector for each pregnancyþ .
the same practice applies if a control person is matched to more than one pregnant colleague .
the vector of observed co- variates includes age ð27 dummy variables , corresponding to ages 19–45þ , calendar month ð56 dummy variablesþ , county ð19 dummy variablesþ , income ð15 dummy variablesþ , education/industry ð15 dummy variablesþ , and the local unemployment rate .
14 this restriction implies that we drop 2,245 treatment-control pairs ð2.5 % þ .
the sick pay trap 321 since the likelihood contribution in equation ð3þ contains unobserved variables , it can not be used directly for estimation purposes .
this problem may be solved by formulating a model for the distribution of unobserved variables and then replacing equation ð3þ with its expectation .
in the pres- ent context , it is probable that the unobserved characteristic affecting ab- sence incidence is correlated to that affecting work resumption , implying that manipulation of the inflow is also likely to change the distribution of unobserved work-resumption propensities in the stock of absentees ðand vice versaþ .
we thus model unobserved heterogeneity nonparametrically .
under mild technical assumptions , results in lindsay ð1983 , theorem 3.1þ and heckman and singer ð1984 , theorem 3.5þ ensure that for the purpose of maximizing the likelihood , unobserved heterogeneity may be approxi- mated by a discrete distribution with a finite number of support points .
since only a subset of the analysis population actually experiences an ab- sence spell within our observation window , there is potentially a selection problem involved in estimating the work-resumption hazard .
this is sim- ilar to the problem arising in the timing-of-events evaluation literature when treatment effects are heterogeneous and only a selected subset of po- tential participants actually receives treatment .
based on a set of regularity conditions , abbring and van den berg ð2003 , proposition 4þ prove non- parametric identification of the multivariate mixed proportional hazard rate model in this context .
to ensure identification in our case , we have performed a monte carlo analysis based on artificial data of similar sample sizes and with similar selection challenges that we have in the actual appli- cation , that is , data where only a selected portion of the sample comes un- der the risk of one of the hazard rates during the observation window and with a significant correlation between the two unobserved covariates .
the exercise is documented in the appendix , available online .
it demonstrates that the sequential hazard rate model we use is indeed identified and that it can be accurately estimated with the algorithm used in this article ðwith correct standard errorsþ .
in our actual application , the foundation for iden- tification is further strengthened by the presence of time-varying covari- ates as reflected in independent calendar time variation ðsee mccall 1994 ; brinch 2007 ; gaure , røed , and zhang 2007þ .
the causal effects of the reform are identified by the shift in pregnant workers ’ absence behavior from before the reform to after the reform , relative to that of the control group members .
an important assumption underlying this identification strategy is that the calendar time effects are the same for the treatment and the control groups .
if pregnant workers have been subject to different time trends than nonpregnant workers for reasons that are not related to the reform , the estimated reform effects may be biased .
since we have selected control workers from the pregnant work- ers ’ own workplaces , the reform effects may also be biased if colleagues affect each other ’ s absenteeism .
existing evidence indicates that peer ef- 322 fevang et al .
fects in absenteeism are empirically relevant ðsee , e.g. , ichino and maggi 2000 ; bradley , green , and leeves 2007 ; hesselius , nilsson , and johansson 2009þ.15 we return to a number of robustness exercises below , with respect to the composition of the control group , with respect to the assumption of a common trend , and with respect to the modeling of unobserved het- erogeneity .
let q be the ða priori unknownþ number of support points in the unobserved heterogeneity distribution and let fðv1l , v2lþ , plg , l 5 1 , 2 , .

q , be the associated location vectors and probabilities .
in terms of ob- served variables , we write the likelihood function as l5pni51evi ½liðv1i ; v2iþ5pni51oql51plliðv1l ; v2lþ ; oql51pl 5 1 ; ð4þ where liðv1i , v2iþ is given in equation ð3þ .
our estimation procedure is to maximize the likelihood function ð4þ with respect to all model and het- erogeneity parameters repeatedly for alternative values of q .
the nonpa- rametric maximum likelihood estimators ðnpmleþ are obtained by start- ing out withq5 1 and then expanding the model with new support points until the model is “ saturated ” in the sense that we are no longer able to in- crease the likelihood function by adding more points .
the preferred model is then selected on the basis of the akaike information criterion ðaicþ .
monte carlo evidence presented in gaure et al .
ð2007þ indicates that pa- rameter estimates obtained this way are consistent and approximately nor- mally distributed .
they also indicate that the standard errors conditional on the optimal number of support points are valid for the unconditional model as well and hence can be used for standard inference purposes.16 table 3 presents the estimated reform effects and the effects of the key control variables.17 the two direct effects of the reform contributed to higher absenteeism : the rate of entry into sick leave spells that used to be subject to pay liability rose by around 10 % ða11þ , while the work- resumption rate during the first 16 days of the spells dropped by around 6 % ða21þ : the two indirect effects pulled in the other direction , however : the rate of entry into sick leave spells that were exempted from pay liabil- ity already before the reform dropped by as much as 19 % ða12þ , whereas 15 it is also possible that there are peer effects in fertility decisions ðsee hensvik and nilsson 2010þ .
note , however , that we have removed from the control group all women who themselves become pregnant during the treatment group ’ s preg- nancies .
16 note that the standard errors do not take any within-group correlation in absenteeism into account , which may be present due to our sampling of control persons within firms .
we perform a robustness exercise below , where we have sampled control persons from other firms instead .

long-term absentees back into work and becamemore willing to let “ risky ” presence spells exceed the limit of 16 days , knowing that they no longer were responsible for the sick pay costs associated with relapses .
in order to examine the quantitative importance of short-term pay lia- bility , we have performed a simulation exercise based on the estimated model ; that is , we have simulated a large number of spells for typical pregnant workers with and without the direct and indirect effects re- ported in table 3 “ turned on. ” 19 when we only allow the two direct effects ða11 ; a21þ to enter the model ði.e. , disregard the indirect effectsþ , it predicts that pay liability reduces the overall expected number of absence days during pregnancies from 85.5 to 79.3 , or by 7.3 % .
however , when we also allow the two indirect effects ða12 ; a22þ to enter the model , the predicted number of absence days again rise to 82.8 , reducing the overall effect of pay liability to a 3.2 % reduction .
it is instructive to decompose the pre- dicted effects of short-term pay liability into absence days subject to and absence days exempted from pay liability .
based on our simulations , we find that while pay liability for short-term absences reduces the number of absence days directly covered by pay liability by around 6.8 % , it re- duces the number of noncovered days by 3.5 % only .
if we extrapolate our findings to nonpregnant workers , we find that pay liability on short-term absenteeism reduces short-term absenteeism by as much as 11.1 % , while it actually increases long-term absenteeism by around 1.6 % .
the reason why we predict that the effects of pay liability are relatively more impor- tant for nonpregnant than for pregnant workers is that a disproportion- ally large fraction of pregnant workers are “ stuck ” in long-term absen- teeism anyway , with return-to-work rates return so low that the negative proportional shift caused by pay liability ða22þ is of moderate quantitative importance .
consequently , they also become removed from the risk of incidence .
it is important to bear in mind that all the effect estimates reported here are likely to underestimate the true causal effect of pay liability for the reason that the reform did not really affect all absences among pregnant workers—only those that were “ pregnancy related. ” in section iv.a.3 above , we estimated that only 73 % of pregnant workers ’ absence spells are pregnancy related , implying that our coefficients are estimated with a significant attenuation bias .

robustness as discussed above , the results in table 3 are based on the assumption that young , nonpregnant , female colleagues constitute an appropriate con- 19 simulations were made for an agent starting a pregnancy with “ representa- tive ” entry and exit rates , based on the point estimates reported in table 3 .
we made 177,176 simulations for each set of assumptions regarding the reform effects ðcorresponding to the actual number of observationsþ .
the sick pay trap 325 trol group for pregnant workers , in the sense that they were subject to the same time variation in absence behavior apart from the reform and also were not affected by the reform through peer effects .
yet , while it is con- ceivable that violations of these assumptions could disturb attempts to identify overall reform effects , it is hard to see why they should yield the particular twist in the work-resumption profiles captured by our estimates .
we interpret the finding that the work-resumption rate declined during the first 16 days of absence ðfor which there used to be a pay liability periodþ while at the same time it rose at longer durations as convincing evidence of a reform effect .
table 4 reports the results from a number of robustness exercises .
we first examine sensitivity with respect to the common trend assumption .
column 2 reports the estimated reform effects when the time window is reduced to include 22 months only ðdropping the last 42 monthsþ , while columns 3 and 4 report the results when instead a separate linear or qua- dratic time trend for pregnant workers is included in the model , respec- tively .
while these modifications do change the estimated effects some- what—in the direction of weaker direct effects and ðin some casesþ stronger indirect effects—they do not alter any of the main conclusions .
the sensi- tivity of the point estimates with respect to the common trend assumption may suggest , however , that there was an increasing trend in pregnancy- related absences for reasons not related to the reform .
alternatively , it may have been the case that the full reform effects materialized gradually , as it took some time before employers learned about the new rules .
second , we assess the potential problem that the absence behavior in the control group is causally affected by the absence behavior in the treatment group .
since our control persons are chosen from the same workplaces as the treatment population ðto ensure maximum similarity in terms of shocks to the work environmentþ , such a causal relationship could arise due to peer effects or changes in work pressure resulting from colleagues ’ absence .
column 5 reports the results from a model where we have drawn the con- trol group members from other workplaces instead ; that is , for each treat- ment , we have selected a control person from a different firm within the same industry and with the same iwa status but have otherwise followed the same one-to-one nearest neighbor matching strategy as described above.20 it is clear that the estimated direct incidence effect as well as the indirect effect on work resumption then become larger .
this pattern is consistent with the existence of a significant peer effect , in line with exist- ing empirical evidence .
again , the main conclusions go through , however .
in our baseline model , we have imposed rather restrictive assumptions regarding duration dependence in the return-to-work hazard by allowing 20 industries are categorized on the basis of the international standard industrial classification ðisicþ at a three-digit level .

to assess whether this may have influenced our results , we report in column 6 estimates based on a much more flexible nine-step function ðallowing a shift every thirtieth dayþ .
again , we find that the results are robust , al- though we estimate a somewhat stronger reform response during the first 16 days and correspondingly weaker response afterward .
finally , we examine robustness with respect to the modeling of unobserved hetero- geneity .
column 7 reports the results from a model without unobserved heterogeneity , while column 8 reports the results from a model where the unobserved heterogeneity vector is allowed to change each time a person has returned to work from a completed absence spell ðand been at work for at least 16 daysþ .
the latter specification is included to allow distinct work-absence cycles to be associated with different unobserved transition propensities , generated , for example , by different diseases .
the results change only marginally , indicating that the exact way in which unobserved heterogeneity is modeled is empirically unimportant in this case .
5 .
comparison with rd findings and descriptive statistics while the purely descriptive did estimate for the overall reform effect was a 3.4 % rise in absenteeism ðsee sec .
iv.a.1þ , the simulation exercise based on the hazard rate model indicates a rise around 3.2 % .
these two very different empirical approaches thus yield more or less the same con- clusion regarding the overall effects of the reform .
the rd analysis , on the other hand , indicated a shift of the incidence rate alone of 18.8 % .
this is not necessarily in conflict with the results from the did and the hazard rate approaches , since the latter also incorporate effects on spell duration .
but even for the incidence effect , the hazard rate model and the rd analy- sis seem to come up with different results .
while the rd analysis indicated a shift in the incidence rate 18.8 % , the hazard rate model indicates a shift around 10 % .
this difference can be explained , however , by endogenous sort- ing into the risk set of present workers , which is appropriately accounted for in the bivariate hazard rate model but not in the rd analysis .
to show this , we reestimated the hazard rate model without including controls for pregnancy-month ðand other individual characteristicsþ in the model , mak- ing it more directly comparable to the rd analysis ðnot shown in tablesþ .
we then obtained an entry effect ða11þ of 0.18 ðse5 .01þ , which is basically in line with the rd estimates with the longest bandwidths .
hence , what apparently happened was that the reform caused entry rates to rise for two very different reasons : ðiþ because transition to absenteeism for each pres- ent worker became less costly for the firm and ðiiþ because the composition of the population of present workers changed toward individuals with higher absence risks ðas long-term absentees to a larger extent returned to 328 fevang et al .
workþ .
while the bivariate hazard rate model is designed to disentangle these two effects , the rd analysis lumps them together .
this illustrates a potential limitation associated with using rd in settings were the source of the discontinuity affects behavior such that the composition of the agents under study also changes ; the method may be a reliable and robust strategy for ascertaining that behavior really has changed yet be a poor strategy for quantifying these effects at the level of agents .
b .
employment opportunities for young females the firms ’ pay liability for pregnant workers ’ absences was removed for the purpose of making individuals conceived to have a high risk of becom- ing pregnant more employable .
in this subsection , we evaluate whether the reform had this intended effect or not .
employers ’ scope for discriminat- ing against pregnant or pregnancy-prone workers is limited insofar as work- ers already are employed .
hence , to the extent that the higher expected ab- sence costs associated with pregnancies affect employment opportunities at all , they are likely to do so primarily through the hiring decision .
we therefore start out with the population of labor-market entrants , that is , personswhocompleted their educational career ðupper secondaryorhigherþ in the period from 2000 to 2004 , and we investigate transitions to a first job.21 it is not obvious how a treatment group should be defined in this case , and it is even less obvious how an appropriate control group can be established .
loosely speaking , the treatment group consists of women at risk of becoming pregnant , which from the employers ’ point of view ba- sically includes all young women .
in a more narrow sense , it consists of already-pregnant job seekers .
as our primary strategy , we thus define all young , female labor-market entrants ðaged 19–34þ to be in the treatment group , whereas we use men in the same age group as controls .
in addition , we examine in particular the employment prospects of pregnant graduates .
we first show some descriptive statistics illustrating the school-to-work transitions for males and females prior to and after the reform .
we then set up a multivariate regression model accounting for the transition to the first job and investigate whether the reform coincided with a relative improvement in employment chances for female labor-market entrants in general and for pregnant entrants in particular .
1 .
descriptive statistics descriptive statistics for the treatment and control groups are provided in figure 4 and in table 5 .
we focus on groups who either completed their 21 a person is considered to have completed education in a particular quarter if he or she studied in that quarter but was not registered in any formal education the subsequent two quarters .

looking first at the cumulative employment propensities by time since graduation in figure 4 , we note that both women and men experienced a significant drop in employment from the former to the latter period but that the drop was largest for men , implying a relative improvement for women ðsee panels a and bþ.22 moreover , women who were pregnant at the time of graduation did not experience a drop in em- ployment propensity at all , thus experiencing a quite substantial relative improvement .
the descriptive did estimator for the reform ’ s effect on young women ’ s overall probability of having found some form of em- ployment within 6 or 12 months after graduation is 2.4 and 3.2 percentage points , respectively ðsee the numbers reported at the bottom of table 5þ .
table 5 also reveals that men and women tend to chose very different educations , as reflected in the much higher level of college and university education for women than for men .
in addition , it reveals that a much larger fraction of men than of women has obtained employment well be- fore the time of graduation .
an important reason for this is that many secondary educations involve the possibility of a final apprentice year , which implies employment .
2 .
a probability model for subsequent employment given the large differences in men ’ s and women ’ s educational choices , it is also probable that their school-to-work transitions have been subject to correspondingly different cyclical and seasonal fluctuations around the time of the reform .
to avoid this from biasing our results , we set up a 22 employment is defined on the basis of the norwegian employer-employee register .
a person is defined to have been employed in a particular month if he or she had a registered job paying amonthly salary of at least nok20,500 ð2012 valueþ .

multivariate regressionmodel for the school-to-work transition , where we control for all possible combinations of education types and graduation times ; that is , we define 49 different education categories and interact them with dummy variables for the before/after reform period.23 we focus on the two discrete outcomes of having obtained some form of employment within 6 or 12 months after graduation .

the pregnancy dummy p is equal to one if a woman was preg- nant at the time of graduation or within the first 3 months after gradua- tion .
the covariate vector xi includes the month of graduation ð17 dummy variablesþ , age ð16 dummy variablesþ , and the local ðmunicipalityþ rate of youth unemployment ðaged 19–34þ at the time of graduation .

for the 12-month outcome , we find a small positive reform effect on young women ’ s employment propensity equal to 1.6 percentage points .
the effect is statistically different from zero at the 5 % level .
for women who were pregnant at the time of graduation , we find an additional effect of 2.9 percentage points , significant at the 10 % level .
the effects are im- precisely estimated , however .
when we focus on a 6-month period rather than a 12-month period , the estimated effect for women as a whole de- clines ðand become statistically insignificantþ , whereas the additional ef- fect for pregnant women becomes stronger .
as shown in table 5 , many students—particularly men—have obtained some employment long before graduation .
since it is difficult to interpret the school-to-work transition for these graduates , we have also estimated the model without including those who had a job as long as 6 months before graduation .
the results from this exercise are displayed in columns 3 and 4 of table 6 .
while the reform effects for women as a whole are virtually unaffected by this sample restriction , the estimated effects for pregnant women become somewhat smaller .

effect of making young women more employable .
our best guess is that it raised the probability of having experienced some form of employment 1 year after graduation by 1–2 percentage points for women in general and by 4–6 percentage points for pregnant graduates .
to put these estimates into perspective , it may be of interest to examine the sizes of the expected sick pay costs that were effectively removed by the reform .
based on the simulation exercise described in the previous subsection , we compute that being pregnant implies approximately 12 extra sick pay days directly covered by pay liability .
the reform ’ s removal of this cost corresponds to a 5 % reduction of the total wage bill during a typical pregnancy .
on average , female graduates aged 23–27 experienced 0.4 pregnancies during the first 3-year period after graduation .
hence , the reform did have a small , but noticeable , effect on expected wage costs for new female em- ployees .
v. conclusion the findings reported in this article show that employees ’ sick leave behavior is responsive toward the employer ’ s wage costs during their ab- sence .
if a significant part of the costs can be passed on to a public insurer , employees tend to be absent more than if the costs are paid for by their own employer .
in most countries , the employer is responsible for the costs associated with short-term absence , while the public insurer covers the direct sick pay costs arising from long-term absence .
we have shown that an insurance system with these properties reduces the incidence of absence spells and also raises the probability of quick work resumption .
at the same time , however , it also reduces the work-resumption rate at du- rations exceeding the pay liability period .
we conclude that responsibil- ity for short-term sick pay only undermines the firms ’ incentives to prevent long-term absenteeism , not only because they have too little pecuniary in- centive to avoid long-term absence per se but also because a long-term ab- sent worker ’ s return to work entails the risk of costly short-term relapses ðfor which the employer is again financially responsibleþ .
as a result , em- ployers may exert too little effort to prevent long-term absence .
although we must be careful generalizing the quantitative results obtained for preg- nant workers to workers at large , we see no reason why the phenomenon discovered in this article should be restricted to pregnant employees .
the evidence presented in this article then indicates that the unintended side effect of restricting pay liability to short-term absence spells only—in terms of raising longer-term absenteeism—may be sufficiently large to almost nullify the favorable impacts of a 16-day pay liability period for short-term absenteeism .
extrapolating our findings to the work force at large , we es- timate that by making the employers responsible for around one-third of overall sick pay costs in norway , policy makers achieve a mere 2.7 % re- duction in overall absence and even a slight increase in long-term absence .
the sick pay trap 333 given that long-term absence is the typical gateway to permanent disability benefits ðwhich are fully covered by taxpayersþ , insufficient employer in- centives to prevent long-term absenteeism may be very costly from a social point of view .
why , then , have so many countries designed their sickness insurance systems such that employers do not face the direct sick pay costs associ- ated with long-term absenteeism ?
we see two possible explanations .
the first is that absence behavior has typically been considered to be deter- mined by the worker—not the firm .
hence , the focus has been placed on worker incentives rather than firm incentives .
the results presented in this article show that this argument is not valid ; firms do influence their em- ployees ’ absence behavior , and they respond to economic incentives .
sec- ond , there may be significant administrative costs associated with reim- bursing firms for the large number of short-term absences , implying that even a modest pay liability for longer absence spells is difficult to imple- ment without at the same time raising the overall sick leave costs for firms .
while this may be a desirable outcome from the perspective of absence prevention , it has been argued that it also undermines employment pros- pects for job seekers with high expected absence propensity .
our findings indicate that , to some extent , this argument is valid ; firms do respond to sick pay liability by being less willing to employ workers expected to be absent a lot .
hence , by raising pay liability for long-term absences without at the same time reducing it for shorter spells , policy makers may under- mine incentives to employ marginal workers .
a possible solution to this dilemma may be to restructure firms ’ pay liability so that firms cover a smaller fraction of the short-term absence costs and a larger fraction of the long-term absence costs .
this solution requires , however , that the admin- istrative challenges associated with high numbers of reimbursement trans- actions can be overcome .
we conclude this article with a caveat .
since our data include physician- certified absences only , we obviously can not evaluate the impacts of pay liability on self-reported absenteeism .
while we see no particular reason to expect significant differences in the responses of self-certified and physician- certified sick leave to changes in firm incentives , we can not rule out that such differences exist .

evidence from the work , family , and health network phyllis moen , a erin l. kelly , b wen fan , c shi-rong lee , a david almeida , d ellen ernst kossek , e and orfeu m. buxtond abstract this study tests a central theoretical assumption of stress process and job strain models , namely that increases in employees ’ control and support at work should promote well-being .
to do so , we use a group-randomized field trial with longitudinal data from 867 information technology ( it ) workers to investigate the well-being effects of star , an organizational intervention designed to promote greater employee control over work time and greater supervisor support for workers ’ personal lives .
we also offer a unique analysis of an unexpected field effect— a company merger—among workers surveyed earlier versus later in the study period , before or after the merger announcement .
we find few star effects for the latter group , but over 12 months , star reduced burnout , perceived stress , and psychological distress , and increased job satisfaction , for the early survey group .
star effects are partially mediated by increases in schedule control and declines in family-to-work conflict and burnout ( an outcome and mediator ) by six months .
moderating effects show that star benefits women in reducing psychological distress and perceived stress , and increases non-supervisory employees ’ job satisfaction .
this study demonstrates , with a rigorous design , that organizational-level initiatives can promote employee well-being .

this work emphasizes the embeddedness of individuals in particular social structures , with corresponding risks , rules , claims ( or needs/demands ) , and resources that shape their subjective well-being ( keyes 1998 ; kohn and schooler 1982 ; mirowsky and ross 2003a , 2003b ; ross and mirowsky 1992 , 2003 ; ryff and keyes 1995 ) .
the social determinants of health perspec- tive proposes that changing the social context should , therefore , promote or reduce health outcomes .
this is the thesis underpinning our study , in which we sought to implement a change in the pivotal social environment of paid work .
specifically , we draw on a group- randomized field trial of an organizational intervention designed to promote control over work time and supervisor support for employ- ees ’ personal and family life .
we collected longitudinal data from 867 information tech- nology ( it ) workers in a fortune 500 corpo- ration to assess whether such changes do , in fact , improve four measures of subjective well-being : burnout , job satisfaction , per- ceived stress , and psychological distress .
studying the well-being effects of increasing work-time control and support also informs scholarship on work-family conflict , gender , and work-time mismatches ( angrave and charlwood 2015 ; reynolds and aletraris 2006 ; schieman , milkie , and glavin 2009 ) .
theoretical underpinnings four theoretical threads guide much of the research on the social determinants of health .
sociologists have drawn on stress process theory , which contends that structural condi- tions produce stress that affects subjective well-being ( pearlin 1999 ; pearlin et al .
1981 ) .
a second thread is the considerable interdisci- plinary scholarship on the job strain theoreti- cal model , where high strain is the result of high demands combined with low control and low support ( johnson and hall 1988 ; karasek 1979 ; karasek and theorell 1990 , 2000 ) .
third , fundamental cause theory is used to explain the ongoing relationship between socioeconomic status ( ses ) and health/well- being outcomes over time ( link and phelan 1995 ; link et al .
2008 ; phelan et al .
2004 ; phelan , link , and tehranifar 2010 ) .
people with higher ses more often possess and have access to resources—such as economic , cul- tural , and social capital—that protect them from multiple deleterious health outcomes .
the fourth thread emphasizes the social gra- dient , arguing that occupational status pre- dicts health , well-being , and mortality ( marmot et al .
1997 ; marmot et al .
1991 ) .
because we are testing whether a deliber- ate change in the work environment promotes subjective well-being , and not examining the reproduction of advantages/disadvantages among people with different status locations , we draw on stress process and job strain theo- ries .
we control for location in the status hier- archy by sampling workers in one industry ( information technology ) and one organiza- tion ( a fortune 500 firm ) .
this professional sample was a deliberate choice because we were seeking employees in a demanding work environment but without a raft of other stress- ors associated with low income that might override any work initiative we could design .
in other words , this sample allows us to inves- tigate the effects of changes in the work envi- ronment among workers who face high work demands , but who are unlikely to face addi- tional neighborhood and family stressors tied to poverty and financial struggles that would not be addressed by this intervention .
theorizing change : the stress process approach stress has been defined as the mismatch between claims and resources , or the misfit between a person and her environment ( kaplan 1983 ) .
a long tradition of theory and research on family stress ( e.g. , hill 1949 ; hochschild 1989 ) , life course processes ( elder , george , and shanahan 1996 ; moen and roehling 2005 ) , and stress more generally ( e.g. , lazarus and folkman 1984 ; mirowsky and ross 2003a , 136 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) 2003b ; pearlin et al .
1981 ; pearlin et al .
2005 ; turner et al .
1995 ) depicts stress as occurring when a gap between resources and claims ( i.e. , the demands , needs , and expectations that indi- viduals face ) reduces people ’ s sense of control .
scholars underscore that shifts in both resources and claims alter the social environ- ment over the life course ( e.g. , elder 1998 ; pearlin et al .
1981 ; pearlin et al .
2005 ) .
pearlin ( 1989:241 ) points out the importance of observing “ how deeply well-being is affected by the structured arrangements of people ’ s lives and by the repeated experiences that stem from these arrangements. ” the structural arrangements of paid work are fundamental to well-being , given that work is pivotal to identity , meaning , routine , and status , as well as income , and occupies many waking hours of adults in the work- force .
for contemporary workers , role strain is often implicitly or explicitly about time ( e.g. , gaps between the time needed for occu- pational and family demands , and how to schedule and arrange work and family tasks so multiple responsibilities can be met ) ( see also clawson and gerstel 2014 ; fenwick and tausig 2007 ; jacobs and gerson 2004 ; moen 2003 ; schieman , whitestone , and van gundy 2006 ) .
this was the rationale for the develop- ment of our intervention aimed at providing workers with more control over their time and training supervisors to recognize the conflict- ing work and home pressures workers face .
note that we are examining workers ’ control over their work time , not reductions in work time such as part-time hours .
research shows that people with more ability to manage their time and more support from their supervisors report greater well-being .
the challenge is to devise and test whether an organizational change giving workers greater control over their time and more supervisor support improves their well-being .
theorizing stressful work conditions : the job strain model the job strain model proposes that people with the greatest strain—workers in highly demanding jobs with low job control and low support—are the most at risk of occupational hazards tied to poor health .
karasek ( 1979:290 ) describes job control as an employee ’ s “ potential control over his tasks and his conduct during the working day , ” operationalizing job control as “ decision authority ” and “ intellectual [ or skill ] discre- tion. ” job control has been empirically linked , in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies , to exhaustion and depressive symptoms ( mausner-dorsch and eaton 2000 ) , psycho- physiological stress responses , alcohol use , high blood pressure , heart disease ( e.g. , bosma , stansfeld , and marmot 1998 ) , mental and physical health ( d ’ souza et al .
2003 ; stansfeld and candy 2006 ) , and work-family conflict and strain ( thomas and ganster 1995 ) .
ample evidence thus links job control with subjective well-being as well as physical health ( see also de lange et al .
2004 ; van der doef and maes 1999 ) .
research using the job strain model typi- cally compares workers with considerable resources ( like high levels of control and sup- port ) to other workers whose job conditions offer few such resources ( little control or sup- port ) .
these research designs raise issues of selection , because different types of workers choose or are allocated to particular job envi- ronments that provide more or less control and more or less support .
in other words , it is difficult to disentangle the well-being effects of stress-reducing organizational resources ( such as control and support ) from the well- being effects of other , unmeasured variables that may lead workers to jobs with different resources .
combining these approaches and key contributions what is missing in the job strain literature are the health and well-being effects of employ- ees ’ control over work time and supervisors ’ support of family and personal lives .
the job strain model focuses on employees ’ control over how they perform their work , but many employees are stressed because they do not moen et al .
137 have control over their work time ( see kelly , moen , and tranby 2011 ; lyness et al .
2012 ; moen , kelly , and hill 2011 ; moen , kelly , and lam 2013 ; moen , kelly , tranby , and huang 2011 ) .
similarly , the job strain model ties support at work to health but does not attend specifically to workplace support for non- work domains .
what is missing in the stress process litera- ture is recognition of the importance of delib- erately changing conditions and the importance of the meso-level work context , that is , the ways shifting policies and practices of a spe- cific work organization affect individual workers ’ ( micro-level ) mental health .
the stress process approach recognizes that changing resources and claims or needs enhance or reduce people ’ s sense of control over their lives and affect their well-being ( gotlib and wheaton 1997 ; pearlin et al .
2005 ) .
for example , becoming unemployed ( pearlin 1989 ) or taking on caregiving of an aging parent ( aneshensel et al .
1995 ) increases stress and reduces feelings of well- being .
longitudinal studies capturing chang- ing environments are thus key to capturing the stress process .
however , researchers can- not randomly assign respondents to unem- ployment or caregiving , for instance , and various selection effects or corollary stressors affecting the odds of those changes may also affect well-being .
this study thus extends the stress process literature to investigate whether and how deliberate randomized organiza- tional changes may promote well-being .
the importance of our study to both stress process and job strain theories is that we move beyond comparisons of different types of workers ( status differences ) or those in dif- ferent environments ( e.g. , high versus low control jobs ) to study organizational changes that may reduce workers ’ stress and promote their well-being .
we are thus testing the stress process approach and a variant of the job strain model ( looking at time control rather than job control ) in a deliberate experiment , not simply comparing people in different cir- cumstances .
specifically , we investigate within-person change in well-being over time in light of changes in their work-related resources .
we do so through a rigorous field trial design , randomizing work teams to “ star ” ( treatment ) and “ usual practice ” ( con- trol ) groups .
this permits an assessment of whether a deliberate shift in the social environ- ment produces corresponding shifts in well- being outcomes .
this is arguably one of the strongest tests of stress process theory to date .
a substantial literature explores the rela- tionship between work conditions and subjec- tive well-being ( e.g. , karasek 1979 ; marklund , bolin , and von essen 2008 ; mausner-dorsch and eaton 2000 ; thomas and ganster 1995 ) , but relatively few longitudinal studies exam- ine changes in these relationships over time ( but see kleiner and pavalko 2010 ; scott- marshall 2010 ) .
occupational health scholars have long emphasized workplace health pro- motion through individual behavioral change ( e.g. , reducing smoking [ see cahill and lan- caster 2014 ; kristensen 2000 ] ) .
these schol- ars are increasingly investigating deliberate interventions to change work conditions more broadly to improve employees ’ well-being , but this literature is largely divorced from sociologists ’ analysis of the social determi- nants of health and well-being .
for example , a review of ( non-experimental ) organizational intervention studies “ found some evidence of health benefits ( especially beneficial effects on mental health , including reduction in anxi- ety and depression ) when employee control improved or ( less consistently ) demands decreased or support increased ” ( egan et al .
2007:945 ) .
but even in this field , randomized controlled trials are rare .
none were included in systematic reviews of the health effects of organizational interventions ( egan et al .
2007 ) , flexible work interventions and health ( joyce et al .
2012 ) , or schedule control and health ( nijp et al .
2012 ) .1 yet randomized field studies of the effects of organizational interventions on changes in subjective well- being over time are key to establishing causal relationships ( morgan and winship 2007 ; see also bianchi and milkie 2010 ) .

) , was developed by the interdisciplinary work fam- ily and health network ( wfhn ) , a national consortium of researchers working with orga- nizational development experts to create and implement an evidence-based intervention to improve the work-family interface and health ( king et al .
2012 ) .
both stress process and job strain theories emphasize the importance of work resources , and the implicit assumption in both is that increasing those resources should promote well-being .
we fashioned the star inter- vention based on stress process and job strain theories , together with insights garnered from previous pilot studies ( hammer et al .
2011 ; kelly et al .
2011 ; kossek et al .
2011 ; moen , kelly , and hill 2011 ; moen et al .
2013 ; moen , kelly , tranby , and huang 2011 ) .
details on the star intervention and its rollout are provided below , but we address the underlying logic here .
schedule control appears to be related to but distinct from tra- ditional measures of job control ( moen , kelly , and huang 2008 ; moen et al .
2013 ; schieman et al .
2009 ) .
similarly , having a supervisor supportive of family and personal life has been shown to promote well-being ( hammer et al .
2011 ; kossek et al .
2011 ) .
star aims to ( 1 ) increase employees ’ con- trol over their work hours and schedules and ( 2 ) increase employee perceptions of super- visor support for employees ’ work and fam- ily/personal lives .
star ’ s third goal , tied to research on the organizational rewards asso- ciated with “ face time ” and long hours , is to reorient the work culture toward results , rather than hours at the workplace ( kossek et al .
2014 ) .
we address the question : does providing workers real flexibility in the form of greater control over their working time and more supportive supervisors improve their subjective well-being ?
previous analyses show that employees randomized to star subsequently report more schedules they describe as “ variable ” rather than a set shift , work more at home , feel more control over their work time , and see their supervisors as more supportive of their personal and family commitments , com- pared to employees in the control group ( kelly et al .
2014 ) .
we analyze star ’ s impact on subjective well-being outcomes to begin investigating whether and how these workplace changes affect employees ’ health .
specifically , we identify the effects of star on changes in four measures of well-being over a 12-month period : burnout , job satisfac- tion , perceived stress , and psychological dis- tress .
such subjective well-being measures are important in terms of intrinsic life quality , but they are also related to other health out- comes and have the potential to decrease stress-related symptoms and illnesses over a longer period of time ( melamed et al .
2006 ; stansfeld et al .
2002 ) .
we focus on this set of well-being outcomes to assess whether out- comes proximal to work ( burnout and job satisfaction ) may be more sensitive to star effects than more global measures ( perceived stress and psychological distress ) .
we also consider how the timing of an unexpected stressful organizational event—a merger—may have moderated any star effects .
because a merger was announced dur- ing the course of data collection , we are able to investigate whether the deliberate changes tied to the star intervention , including increased support and control over work time , had different effects depending on whether they were experienced prior to the shock of the merger announcement or after the stress of the impending merger was introduced .
hypotheses taken together , the job strain and stress pro- cess approaches lead us to theorize that delib- erate organizational changes targeting employees ’ control over their work time and the support they receive should produce cor- responding changes in employees ’ subjective moen et al .
139 well-being .
unlike worksite health promotion interventions that target stress or well-being directly as a private individual trouble ( e.g. , yoga classes or mindfulness training [ see hartfiel et al .
2011 ; kabat-zinn 2003 ] ) , star aims to change the rules of the game at work ( including the policies , practices , interac- tions , and expectations that structure employ- ees ’ lives on the job ) and affect how work and personal life can be managed effectively and with less strain .
star facilitates new prac- tices , such as increased options to work at home and flexibility to shift one ’ s schedule , but also emphasizes that employees have con- trol over when , where , and how they do their work and that managers and co-workers sup- port their efforts to address family and per- sonal responsibilities ( kelly et al .
2014 ) .
stress process theory suggests that this work redesign intervention may increase energy resources and decrease exposure to stresses by giving employees control to “ fit ” the pieces of their lives together more easily and feel supported in those efforts , thereby improving subjective well-being .
similarly , the job strain model suggests that increasing employees ’ control over where and when they do their work and providing greater support for family and personal life will enhance well-being .
hypothesis 1 : employees randomized to the star initiative will experience positive changes in indicators of well-being ( an in- crease in job satisfaction and decreases in burnout , perceived stress , and psychologi- cal distress ) compared to employees work- ing under usual practices ( control group ) .
we also investigate possible mediators of the relationship between star and subjec- tive well-being to help identify mechanisms through which workplace interventions may benefit employees .
we theorize a mediated model in that we anticipate star will have direct effects in enhancing workers ’ subjec- tive well-being , but will also operate in part through five theorized mechanisms : increas- ing workers ’ sense of schedule control , increasing workers ’ sense that their supervi- sors are supportive , reducing workers ’ work- family conflict , encouraging workers to shift their schedules and work more at home , and reducing workers ’ feelings of burnout .
we treat burnout—specifically emotional exhaus- tion—as an outcome , because it is an impor- tant measure of psychological health , but we also investigate whether changes in burnout by six months mediate the effects of star on the other well-being outcomes .
increasing workers ’ schedule control and sense of having a supportive supervisor are key goals of the star intervention and have been shown to change in the expected direc- tions by the six-month follow-up ( kelly et al .
2014 ) .
given that these two resources are strongly correlated with subjective well-being outcomes ( grzywacz , carlson , and shulkin 2008 ; moen , kelly , tranby , and huang 2011 ) , we expect changes in them to mediate the salutary well-being effects of star .
work- family conflicts ( from family to work as well as from work to family ) are a common form of stress in the lives of contemporary workers ( bianchi , casper , and king 2005 ; bianchi and milkie 2010 ; major , klein , and ehrhart 2002 ) , as is burnout ( halbesleben and buckley 2004 ; maslach , schaufeli , and leiter 2001 ; schaufeli and bakker 2004 ) .
we test whether the star intervention promotes subjective well-being through the reduced work-to-family and family-to-work conflict observed previ- ously ( kelly et al .
2014 ) .
shifting work schedules and working at home may also enable workers to adjust their work arrange- ments to better fit their individual and family needs , thereby improving well-being .
hypothesis 2 : changes in workers ’ percep- tions of schedule control , family support- ive supervisors , work-family conflict , and burnout , along with increases in working at home and shifts in schedules , will mediate star effects on subjective well-being .
the stress process approach emphasizes potential differences in well-being outcomes based on status locations ( pearlin 1999 ; 140 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) pearlin et al .
1981 ) .
this theory underscores the inequality in stress and well-being based on mostly invariant status locations like gen- der , race , and social class .
additionally , role strain , or “ the felt difficulty in fulfilling role obligations ” ( goode 1960:483 ) , is a chronic stressor found more often among people in different status locations .
accordingly , we examine variations in star effects for par- ticular subgroups , theorizing that workers in this professional sample most at risk of chronic stress at home and on the job , and facing the greatest work-family strains , will benefit most from star .
( naturally , star may be too small a change to address the many multifaceted stressors—including eco- nomic insecurity—confronting less privi- leged workers ; hence our focus on professionals . )
hypothesis 3 : workers with more family-care obligations ( i.e. , women generally , or women or men with children at home ) or fewer job- related resources ( employees compared to managers ) will benefit more from star .
we also investigate age-cohort differences in the effects of star , given the different family- care obligations and different expectations regarding work and family across age-cohorts ( galinsky , aumann , and bond 2009 ) .
organizational changes : star and an unexpected merger the star intervention was delivered as a pilot initiative in the information technology ( it ) division of a fortune 500 company and was announced by senior executives .
star was not presented as part of the larger study investigating how work affects health and personal life broadly , but instead as a com- pany pilot that might well be implemented throughout the it division eventually .
although star was developed jointly by wfhn researchers and outside consultants , the training was delivered by consultants .
this pilot process was not seen as unusual ; the it division commonly piloted new initia- tives developed in-house or brought in by consultants .
star involved eight hours of participatory training sessions that encouraged teams and managers to identify new work practices and processes that would increase employees ’ con- trol over their work time and focus on key results ( rather than simply face time at work ) .
for example , there were extensive discussions concerning communicating by instant messen- ger , coordinating more efficiently with off- shore staff , and better anticipating and handling periods of high demands , such as around soft- ware releases .
additionally , training activities proposed that being “ always on ” —quickly responsive via e-mail , instant messenger , or in person—did not necessarily mean workers were productive or efficient in accomplishing the most important tasks .
teams varied in the changes they implemented regarding work processes and coordination , but all workers randomized to the star initiative experienced considerable flexibility as to where and when they worked , including the ability to work at home without requiring a supervisor ’ s permis- sion .
previously , work at home was sometimes allowed with managerial approval , but such a case-by-case “ accommodation ” does not shift control to employees ( kelly et al .
2014 ; moen , kelly , tranby , and huang 2011 ) .
the star intervention also involved supervisor training to encourage supervisor support for family/personal life and profes- sional development ; this involved four hours of additional training sessions as well as cus- tomized computer-based training for managers that included a video message from a senior executive endorsing star .
given their cen- trality to star ( and the theories that informed the intervention ) , we analyze changes in work- ers ’ sense of control over work time and loca- tion , and their supervisor being supportive of family and personal life , as likely mechanisms linking the star initiative with improvements in workers ’ well-being .
for more information on star , its development , and its customiza- tion for this organizational culture , see kelly and colleagues ( 2014 ) , kossek and colleagues moen et al .
141 ( 2014 ) , and star materials at http : //www .workfamilyhealthnetwork.org .
randomized field trials offer the strongest causal evidence for the effects of interventions ( hannan 2006 ; oakes and kaufman 2006 ) .
yet , any field study is vulnerable to real-world events .
in this case , a merger was announced during our data collection , while star train- ing was occurring for some groups randomized to the intervention .
this unexpected event , portending significant organizational changes , directly affected the study , because the survey and star were rolled out to different units of this it workforce over an extended period of about 12 months.2 such external shocks can not simply be ignored in research ( although they often are ) .
moreover , this surprise event offered the opportunity to further capture the stress process ( pearlin 1989 ; pearlin et al .
1981 ; pearlin et al .
2005 ) : suddenly learning one ’ s employer is to be taken over by another corporation generates a pervasive sense of uncertainty about the future ( lam et al .
2015 ) .
everyone in the study was exposed to the merger announcement and process , but the timing vis-à-vis our data collection suggested different outcomes by survey timing .
the early survey group was interviewed first and , for those randomized to the experimental con- dition , began the star intervention prior to the merger announcement.3 the late survey group was exposed to the merger announce- ment before the baseline survey and before star .
because of this difference in timing , we consider these two groups separately .
as we will describe , we propose that star will have stronger effects on well-being outcomes for respondents in the early survey group , who had completed or initiated star prior to the merger announcement .
in effect , the merger provided an opportu- nity to assess the influence of an unexpected organizational stressor at about the same time an intervention to improve well-being was introduced .
mergers and restructuring are part and parcel of corporate life , but few studies examine organizational interventions in the context of other ongoing organizational changes that may involve new roles , relocation , or job loss .
the limited research , though , suggests that organizational interventions aimed at increasing employees ’ control have no positive effects in the context of downsizing ( egan et al .
2007 ) .
we are able to use this conjunction of the planned and unplanned organizational changes to suggest scope conditions for the benefits of initiatives like star .
the timing of the baseline survey and the introduction of the star intervention in relation to the exog- enous shock of the merger announcement adds complexity to the study , but it also ena- bles us to assess whether an increase in resources ( supervisor support and schedule control ) prior to an exogenous stressor ( merger announcement ) operates differently than introduction of an intervention following such an exogenous shock .
we expect the early survey group ( who experienced star before learning about the merger ) may have been more open to this work redesign and thus better positioned to benefit from it .
this group is the focus of our analysis .
although implementation of star was identical for the early and late survey groups , the ways employees interpreted the interven- tion may not be the same .
workers undergoing the baseline survey and star training after the merger announcement ( late survey group ) may not have taken the star intervention seriously , given the uncertainties and disloca- tions fueled by this announcement .
indeed , observations of star training sessions occur- ring after the merger announcement revealed that employees routinely and explicitly ques- tioned whether star would “ survive ” the merger and whether it fit with the emerging culture of the combined firm .
moreover , the late survey group ’ s baseline responses already reflect the effects of knowing about the merger , leading to some differences from the baseline responses of the early survey group ( see lam et al .
2015 ) .
differences between the two groups may arise from different perspec- tives because the late survey group knew of the upcoming takeover .
accordingly , we pre- sent the results separately for these two groups and focus on the early survey group .
142 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) methods randomization the randomization process began by group- ing employees and managers in the it divi- sion into 56 study groups .
some groups consisted of large teams reporting to the same manager ; other study groups included combi- nations of several smaller teams who either reported to the same senior leadership or worked closely together on the same applica- tion .
we developed a randomization design that would ensure balance on job function , division ( reporting to a particular vp ) , and size of study group , modifying a biased-coin randomization technique for use with group randomization ( bray et al .
2013 ; frane 1998 ) .
all eligible work units within the it division participated in and were randomized to star or to usual practice .
study recruitment and data collection we use data collected at three time points— baseline , six months , and 12 months—from employees and managers in two cities who were part of the information technology ( it ) division of this major u.s. firm.4 recruitment materials emphasized the value of a study investigating the connections between employees ’ work , family , and health for the employees ( who received some personalized health information ) , the employing organiza- tion , and scientific knowledge more broadly ; there was no reference to star .
recruitment materials also emphasized the independence of the research team from tomo and the confidentiality of individual data .
computer- assisted personal interviews lasting approxi- mately 60 minutes were conducted at the workplace on company time .
sample the sample combines responses from employ- ees and managers ; they answered the same survey questions , except managers were not asked about perceived stress ( saving time for other questions ) .
at baseline , 70 percent of eligible employees participated ( n = 823 ) ; 87 percent ( n = 717 ) and 85 percent ( n = 701 ) of baseline employee participants were retained in the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups , respectively .
the response rate at baseline among managers was 86 percent ( n = 221 ) , with 89 percent ( n = 196 ) and 85 percent ( n = 188 ) of baseline managers completing the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups .
we conducted analyses among respondents who completed all three survey waves.5 study groups began the study on a rolling basis over a year to accommodate limited staff and space for the in-person interviews .
when the late survey group went through star training , they already knew about the impending takeover by another organization .
in contrast , the early survey group rand- omized to star went through the initiative early in the roll-out , before learning of the looming merger .
the early survey group analytic sample consisted of 455 respondents nested in 32 study groups .
the late survey group ’ s answers at baseline reflect the fact that they already knew about the upcoming merger .
however , for comparison , we show results for both survey groups in tables 1 and 2 .
results for the pooled sample ( 867 respond- ents in 56 study groups ) are shown in table s2 of the online supplement ( http : //asr.sagepub .com/supplemental ) ; these models include a variable merger announcement timing distin- guishing the early survey group ( = 1 ) from the late survey group ( = 0 ) .
measures our principal explanatory variable is expo- sure to the star intervention , with respon- dents randomized to the intervention ( star ) coded 1 and the controls ( usual practice ) coded 0 .
this specification reflects an intent- to-treat analysis , in which all respondents randomized to the intervention are assumed to be “ exposed ” to the treatment of star .
in this analytic sample , mean attendance rate was 76 percent of sessions .
among this group , 9 percent ( n = 20 ) attended fewer than moen et al .
143 half of the star sessions , and only 3 percent ( n = 7 ) of those randomized to star attended none of the sessions .
intent-to-treat is the more conservative approach for evaluating effects of interventions , preserving the identi- fication strategy of the experimental design ( begg et al .
1996 ; friedman , furberg , and demets 2010 ) .
details of measures , including items and alphas , are available in table s1 in the online supplement .
emotional exhaustion ( burnout ) consists of a three-item subscale of the maslach burnout inventory ( maslach and jackson 1986 ) .
job satisfaction is measured by a three-item scale developed by cammann and colleagues ( 1983 ) on global job satisfac- tion .
perceived stress is evaluated with a four- item scale validated by cohen , kamarck , and mermelstein ( 1983 ) that has been found to be predictive of physical and mental health out- comes.6 this measure was only on the employee survey ; managers are therefore not included in the analysis of perceived stress .
psychological distress is captured by the k6 , a six-item scale validated by kessler and col- leagues ( 2003 ) that is widely used in the united states as an assessment of nonspecific psychological distress .
to preserve temporal order , we constructed mediators as six-month changes , subtracting wave 1 from wave 2 , in the following varia- bles .
schedule control reflects the degree to which respondents felt they had control over their work time , with eight items adapted from thomas and ganster ( 1995 ) .
family supportive supervisor behaviors ( fssb ) assesses employee perceptions of supervi- sors ’ behavioral support for integrating work and family ( hammer et al .
2013 ) .
family-to- work conflict reflects the degree to which role responsibilities from family or personal life are incompatible with participation in the work role ; we use a five-item subscale devel- oped by netemeyer , boles , and mcmurrian ( 1996 ) .
we also tested the effects of changes in work-to-family conflict ( netemeyer et al .
1996 ) as a potential mediator .
for the early survey group , however , star does not sig- nificantly predict changes in work-to-family conflict , suggesting it is not , in fact , a media- tor .
variable schedule distinguishes work schedules that may change from a set day- time , evening , or night schedule .
we con- structed hours working at home based on the question , “ about how many hours/week do you work or take calls from home on this job ? ” we analyze burnout as a measure of subjective well-being ( when we assess change by 12 months ) and a potential intervening mechanism ( change by six months in burnout may mediate other 12-month outcomes ) .
subgroup analyses investigate whether respondents with greater vulnerability or resources relevant to the work-family inter- face benefit more from the star interven- tion .
we defined three key subgroups on the basis of gender ( women coded as 1 ) , age- cohort ( respondents born before 1955 coded as leading-edge boomers , respondents born between 1955 and 1964 coded as trailing- edge boomers , and respondents born in 1965 and later coded as genxers ) , and managerial status ( official supervisors coded as 1 ) .
see table 1 for descriptive statistics on these moderators .
we also investigate four sub- groups that combine gender and the presence of a child under age 18 at home : women with children at home , women with no children at home , men with children at home , and men with no children at home .
analysis to examine the effects of star on subjective well-being , we estimate mixed-effects models with respondents nested within study groups , the unit randomized to star ( treatment ) or usual practice ( control ) .
well-being outcomes were measured at wave 3 , 12 months after baseline .
we regressed these outcomes on their lagged measures at baseline and condi- tion ( star or control ) .
we additionally con- trol for gender , age-cohort , and manager status to improve precision of estimates , but the pattern of findings does not change when these are omitted .
coefficients for star cap- ture effects of the intervention on outcomes ( hypothesis 1 ) .
results for the early survey 144 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) group are our main models , presented in table 2 and compared side-by-side with the late survey group .
to test mediation ( hypothesis 2 ) , we exam- ine the effects of changes in potential media- tors over a six-month period on subsequent changes ( by 12 months ) in subjective well- being measures .
we adopt two approaches to test mediation .
one is the classic baron and kenny ( 1986 ) approach , which requires satis- faction of three conditions : ( 1 ) the key inde- pendent variable ( i.e. , star ) is a significant predictor of the dependent variable ( i.e. , well- being outcomes ) ; ( 2 ) the key independent vari- able is a significant predictor of the mediator ; and ( 3 ) the coefficient for the key independent variable is greatly reduced when adding the potential mediator .
condition 1 is established in table 2 , and condition 2 is established in table 1 ( based on t-tests , but results remain even with mixed-effects models adjusting for covariates ) .
in table 3 ( section 1 for each panel ) , we assess condition 3 by evaluating the extent to which the star coefficients are weakened after mediators are added .
a second approach for mediation analysis builds on sobel ’ s test ( sobel 1982 ) and addresses concerns that baron and kenny ’ s approach does not directly estimate and quan- tify the magnitude and significance of the mediation effect ( i.e. , to what extent the mediator mediates the predictor ’ s effect on the outcome ) .
the canonic sobel ’ s test was developed for single-level models and suffers low statistical power ( mackinnon , warsi , and dwyer 1995 ) , which is problematic given our multilevel data structure and relatively small sample of groups .
we therefore use a method developed by krull and mackinnon ( 2001 ) for multilevel models that combines the sobel ’ s test with bootstrapping to obtain the sampling distribution of the mediation effect non-parametrically .
we conducted this set of analyses using the ml_mediation program in stata ; the mediation effects were obtained by bootstrapping the ml_mediation command with 1,000 replications with a seed value of 1 .
corresponding results are shown in section 2 for each panel in table 3 .
we present moderation results ( hypothesis 3 ) with figures , showing star effects for dif- ferent subgroups .
we conducted the media- tion and moderation analyses using the early survey group , who took the baseline survey and experienced star before learning about the merger .
results descriptive statistics table 1 shows descriptive statistics by experi- mental condition for the early survey group ( panel a ) and late survey group ( panel b ) .
for our focal early survey group sample , subjective well-being and demographic vari- ables at baseline are balanced by experimen- tal condition , as would be expected due to randomization .
the only exception is age- cohort membership ( by chance ) .
we find no differences in baseline well- being outcomes among respondents in the early survey group ( panel a ) ; but as hypoth- esized , by wave 3 the early survey respond- ents in star had significantly lower levels of burnout ( p < .001 ) , perceived stress ( p < .05 ) , and psychological distress ( p < .05 ) , as well as noticeably higher job satisfaction ( p < .01 ) .
this provides initial support for hypothesis 1 .
by contrast , the late survey group ( panel b ) showed no difference in well-being outcomes at wave 3 by star condition .
we calculated changes in perceptions of schedule control and family supportive supervi- sor behavior , reductions in family-to-work con- flict and burnout , and increased adoption of variable schedules and working from home as the first step in testing potential mediators between star and changes in well-being out- comes by 12 months .
previous research demon- strates that over a six-month period , star improved employees ’ sense of schedule control and family supportive supervisor behaviors , while reducing family-to-work conflict ( kelly et al .
2014 ) , findings replicated in table 1 for the early survey group ( panel a ) .
over six months among the early survey group sample , schedule control increased by .31 for star respondents , whereas the increase was merely 145 ta bl e 1 .

146 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) .04 for the control group ( p < .001 ) .
a similar pattern occurred for family supportive supervi- sor behaviors ( .16 for star and .02 for control , p < .05 ) .
family-to-work conflict decreased by .04 for respondents randomized to star , whereas it increased by .07 for the control group ( p < .05 ) .
about one in four star respondents reported their schedules changed from “ not var- iable ” to “ variable , ” compared with 12 percent in the control group ( p < .001 ) .
over the six months , star respondents increased their time working at home by 7.6 hours a week , signifi- cantly higher than the two-hour increase among control respondents ( p < .001 ) .
finally , we observe a reduction in burnout over six months for star respondents but not for the control group ( –.26 versus .08 , p < .01 ) .
these findings lay the groundwork for testing their effects as mediators between star and changes in well- being .
also note that , except for perceived and actual schedule flexibility , respondents in the late survey group did not experience the desir- able changes brought about by the star inter- vention ( panel b ) .
effects of star on subjective well-being table 2 shows the effects of star on burnout , job satisfaction , perceived stress , and psycho- logical distress at 12 months for early ( panel a ) and late ( panel b ) survey groups .
we present the outcomes in this order because the first two are distinctively job-related , whereas the latter capture general states of subjective well-being .
results from the multilevel analy- sis show that by wave 3 , star respondents in the early survey group ( not exposed to merger announcement when randomized to star ) experienced significantly reduced emotional exhaustion/burnout ( –.534 , p < .001 ) and increased job satisfaction ( .208 , p < .01 ) , as well as lower perceived stress ( –.478 , p < .05 ) and psychological distress ( –.570 , p < .05 ) than similarly situated respondents in the control group .
we further calculated effect sizes by dividing star coefficients ( from table 2 ) by the standard deviation of the out- come at baseline .
star effects are mostly small ( .2 ) to moderate ( .5 ) as judged by cohen ’ s ( 1988 ) rule of thumb , but in general are higher for burnout ( .36 ) and job satisfac- tion ( .27 ) than for perceived stress ( .18 ) and psychological distress ( .18 ) .
by contrast , for respondents in the late survey group ( taking baseline survey after merger announcement ) , star had no well-being effects .
this sug- gests star benefited the subjective well- being of workers who were not worried about the merger at the time they began or received the star training .
given the null star effects for the late survey group , we con- ducted all subsequent analyses on the early survey group .
as a sensitivity check , we also conducted analyses for the full sample ( see table s2 in the online supplement ) .
for this combined sample , we find that star significantly decreased burnout ( –.289 , p < .01 ) and increased job satisfaction ( .160 , p < .01 ) by wave 3 .
these effects are maintained even after controlling for the effect of being in the early or late survey group .
given that the late survey group ’ s baseline responses are confounded by their prior exposure to the stress of the merger , results from the early survey group represent the most valid tests of star ’ s effects on well-being .
mediation analysis of star on subjective well-being to more precisely assess how star improves subjective well-being in the early survey group , we examine specific mechanisms theorized to account for the relationship between the organizational intervention and well-being : increasing schedule control and family supportive supervisor behaviors ( fssb ) , decreasing family-to-work conflict and burnout , and increasing schedule flexibil- ity and working at home .
we use two methods to test mediation , baron and kenny ’ s approach ( sections 1 of table 3 ) and a modified sobel ’ s test , tailored for multilevel models with bootstrapped stand- ard errors ( sections 2 of table 3 ) .
these two methods do not always coalesce ; our discus- sion focuses on similar patterns found in both approaches .

153 most of its star effects mediated ( panel d ) .
baron and kenny ’ s approach suggests a full mediation by three mediators ( schedule con- trol , family-to-work conflict , and burnout ) .
similarly , the modified sobel ’ s tests show that these three indirect paths are all statistically significant , each accounting for over 20 per- cent of the total star effect on psychological distress .
second , perceived stress is the only outcome with little mediation ( panel c ) , sug- gesting star has a direct , rather than indirect , effect on employees ’ stress .
third , changes in schedule control ( from baseline to six months ) are a strong mediator , accounting for 17 per- cent of the star effect in increasing job satis- faction , 23 percent of the star effect in decreasing psychological distress , and 19 per- cent of the star effect in decreasing burnout between baseline and wave 3 .
changes in family-to-work conflict also mediate the rela- tionship , but not as strongly ; 8 percent and 24 percent of the star effects on decreased burnout and decreased psychological distress , respectively , are mediated by reductions in family-to-work conflict .
we also considered burnout itself as a possible mediator , finding that changes in burnout account for 13 percent of the star effect on increased job satisfac- tion and 23 percent of the star effect on decreased psychological distress .
fourth , of the six mediators , fssb and the two flexibility practice measures ( schedule changes and working at home ) seem to be the weakest ; none of the mediation effects are defined as statistically significant according to the modified sobel test .
taken as a whole , hypothesis 2 is partially supported in that some ( but not all ) of the star effects on well- being outcomes occur through star ’ s effects in increasing workers ’ schedule control and reducing their levels of family-to-work con- flict and burnout .
moderation analysis of star effects on subjective well-being the stress process theoretical model empha- sizes the importance of status locations as potential moderators of relationships between the social environment and well-being ( pearlin 1999 ) .
accordingly , we examine whether star effects differ among various subgroups of respondents , again focusing on the early survey group .
to do so , we analyze the inter- action of star and four potential moderators : gender , gendered parental status , age-cohort , and managerial status .
we find no statistically significant difference between star and the usual practice groups in subjective well-being outcomes by age-cohort , suggesting that star promoted well-being across various age groups of workers .
however , we find that star reduced psy- chological distress more for women than for men .
to facilitate understanding of this moder- ating effect , we present a figure showing models with significant interaction terms .
in figure 1a , women randomized to star have significantly lower levels of psychological distress by wave 3 than women in the control group .
no such dif- ference is found for men ( gender interaction , p < .05 ) .
we also see a gender interaction for perceived stress , although it is only marginally significant ( p < .06 , see figure 1b ) .
note that both men and women benefit from star in the two well-being measures most closely tied to work , with similar declines in burnout and increases in job satisfaction regardless of gen- der .
the gender component of hypothesis 3 is thus only partially supported .
figure 2a further examines gender differ- ences by presenting predicted psychological distress at wave 3 for four subgroups : women with children at home , women without children at home , men with children at home , and men without children at home .
we do not find sup- port for our hypothesis that workers engaged in active parenting ( especially mothers ) will ben- efit most from star ; the star effect seems to be largest among women without children at home ( p < .05 ) .
figure 2b shows means of psychological distress at wave 1 and wave 3 for women with and without children at home and by star .
we see that mothers and women without children at home randomized to star reported comparable declines in psychological distress over 12 months ( the two solid lines ) .
women without children in the control group , 154 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) by contrast , experienced increased psychologi- cal distress over this period ( black dashed line ) , which appears to be the main reason why we find a particularly large star effect for women without children at home .
in further analysis , we find women without children at home were older ( average age of 50 versus 44 to 48 for the other groups ) , much more likely to be single ( 41 percent versus 3 to 23 percent ) , and more apt to have adult care responsibilities ( 31 per- cent versus 20 to 25 percent ) .
we speculate that the increased distress of women in the control group may reflect the challenges and vulnera- bilities of older women in highly demanding jobs with less control over their time , but this is the case for only one well-being measure ; analyses of the three other outcomes found no differences in effects of star by gender/active parenting status .
we hypothesized that managers would benefit less than employees in terms of improved subjective well-being , which is par- tially supported for job satisfaction .
figure 3 shows that employees ( but not managers ) randomized to star had higher levels of job satisfaction than their peers in the usual prac- tice groups ( p < .05 ) .
discussion and conclusions this study contributes to the growing body of theory and research on the social determi- nants of health and well-being ( berkman figure 1a .
predicted psychological distress at wave 3 with 95 % cis by star and gender , early survey group figure 1b .

155 et al .
2014 ; house 2002 ; tausig and fenwick 2011 ) and specifically to stress process and job strain theories .
its primary contribution is in putting these approaches in motion , exam- ining the implications of changing the social environment of work for corresponding changes in well-being .
some social structures consequential for health are seemingly intrac- table , such as one ’ s gender , race , age , and parents ’ socioeconomic status ( berkman et al .
2014 ; tilly 1998 ) .
others are institutional- ized , taken-for-granted regimes—including temporal regimes of policies , practices , rules , and routines regarding work time—that can be changed through deliberate efforts like the star organizational intervention .
we advance stress process and job strain theoretical models by moving beyond examin- ing workers in different occupations or circum- stances to demonstrate that changes in work conditions enhance subjective well-being .
although the potential for change in social environments is an explicit component of stress process and job strain theories , most research involves cross-sectional correlational studies or , to a lesser extent , longitudinal studies of events , such as job loss or caregiving , to exam- ine potential declines in well-being .
we dem- onstrate , with a rigorous randomized field trial , that changes in work conditions arising from an organizational intervention ( providing workers with greater control over the time and timing of figure 2a .
predicted psychological distress at wave 3 by star , gender , and family caregiving context , early survey group figure 2b .
means of psychological distress at wave 1 and wave 3 among women , by star and parental status , early survey group 156 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) their work , and encouraging supervisor support for family and personal life ) produce corre- sponding salutary changes over a 12-month period in four components of subjective well- being : burnout , job satisfaction , perceived stress , and psychological distress .
bronfenbrenner ( 2005 ) makes the claim that to really understand something , one should try to change it—and yet few scholars have studied deliberate efforts to improve subjective well-being by modifying the social environments of work .
by contrast , major strides have been made in removing or pro- tecting workers against toxic physical envi- ronments , even though too many disadvantaged workers still face hazards today .
there has been a real lag in recogniz- ing the toxicity of social environments , including the ways work is constrained by rigid work-time rules and unsupportive supervisors .
some employers offer individual- level stress reduction techniques , suggesting methods to cope with difficulties rather than promoting well-being by improving the work environment .
this is understandable , given the time and financial costs of developing and testing a theoretically grounded interven- tion that is acceptable to organizational stakeholders while simultaneously substan- tial enough to make a difference in workers ’ lives .
our study does just that .
it also confirms there are inevitable complexities with even “ clean ” research designs such as field experi- ments .
one major complexity of our study was the sudden announcement of a corporate merger in the midst of data collection .
this event allowed us to examine how work condi- tions are affected by both deliberate organiza- tional initiatives and the challenging , changing social context .
in retrospect , we now see the it world as a turbulent environ- ment full of mergers , acquisitions , and con- stant change .
fortunately , given the study timeline , we were able to parse out interven- tion effects on the early survey group ( who were not exposed to the merger shock before exposure to star ) from the late survey group .
we found pronounced salutary effects of the intervention only for the early survey group .
one important implication of our findings is that workers ( like those in the late survey group ) already faced with major organizational dislocations ( e.g. , mergers , acquisitions , or dramatic rounds of downsiz- ing ) are unlikely to buy into and benefit from more positive organizational interventions .
other research has also found that workplace interventions have null effects ( and , in some cases , negative impacts ) on health and well- being when organizational restructuring and downsizing are also occurring ( egan et al .
2007 ) .
there was no significant downsizing in the study period we report on here , but we nevertheless find no star effects on figure 3 .
predicted job satisfaction at wave 3 with 95 % cis by star and managerial status , early survey group moen et al .
157 well-being among the late survey group .
the uncertainty of the upcoming merger off- set—and perhaps overwhelmed—any poten- tial benefits of star for workers facing the impending organizational changes .
the positive effects of this organizational intervention on the early survey group raise additional questions relevant to stress process and job strain theoretical models .
in particular , how does star influence subjective well- being ?
we find evidence of three partial medi- ators for different components of well-being : increases in respondents ’ sense of schedule control , reductions in their family-to-work conflict , and reductions in burnout .
but much of star ’ s effects remain unexplained by these mediators , suggesting the need for greater attention to the “ how ” of organiza- tional innovations like star and , indeed , for continued attention to the mechanisms under- lying inequality in health and well-being , as well as in other resources ( reskin 2003 ) .
another important question raised by both stress process and job strain models is whether this type of workplace intervention benefits particular sets of workers more than others .
we theorized that workers potentially vulner- able to stress at work , at home , and due to the juxtaposition of the two would be most apt to see improvements in subjective well-being .
we find no moderators of burnout ; in other words , star reduced workers ’ burnout regardless of their gender , their parenting circumstances , their age-cohort , or whether they were managers or non-supervisory employees .
similarly , star improved the job satisfaction of all these subgroups with only one exception : employees were more apt than managers randomized to star to expe- rience an increase in job satisfaction .
the broad effects of star across subgroups likely reflect that these outcomes are more explicitly tied to work than the more global measures of perceived stress and psychologi- cal distress .
our findings that star reduced psycho- logical distress and perceived stress more for women is consistent with our expectation that more vulnerable workers would benefit more from these changes .
women ’ s well-being is clearly affected by work roles and resources as well as normative family caregiving responsibilities ( simon 2014 ) , and the link between work-family strains and well-being is clearer for mothers than for fathers ( noma- guchi , milkie , and bianchi 2005 ) .
however , the increase in psychological distress among women without children in the control group suggests that vulnerability extends beyond simply caring for young children .
future research needs to consider the stresses of employed older women who are more apt to be single and caring for parents or other adults , in particular .
our findings suggest that women without children at home may be dis- tressed due to their high workloads ( including paid work and caregiving ) and lower likeli- hood of having a spouse to share home tasks , caregiving , and breadwinning , and that organizational changes , like star , can improve their well-being .
mothers benefit from these organizational changes too .
mothers in star reported sig- nificantly more time adequacy with their fam- ily ( kelly et al .
2014 ) , and mothers in star increased their time with adolescent children over a one-year period , whereas mothers in the control group decreased their time with children ( davis et al .
2015 ) .
there is also evidence that star “ crossed over ” from par- ents ’ experiences to positively affect adoles- cents ’ well-being , as measured in greater positive affect and less negative reactivity to daily stressors for children who had a parent in star , compared to children whose parent was in the usual practice group ( lawson et al .
forthcoming ) .
adolescents with a parent in star also reported less variation in sleep duration from night to night , less time to fall asleep , and better sleep quality , although no difference was found in sleep duration ( mchale et al .
2015 ) .
while research on mothers , fathers , and children is certainly important , it should be balanced by research on the growing number of older women workers to fully understand the nexus of work , family , and health .
what are the implications for studying workers ’ mental health and for devising organizational policies and practices to reduce 158 american sociological review 81 ( 1 ) risk factors ?
first , drawing on stress process and job strain approaches , we provide clear evidence that specific conditions matter for well-being and can be changed .
this neces- sitates more than “ helping ” workers muddle through their stressful lives by teaching them individual coping strategies .
instead , this study demonstrates the value of an organiza- tional initiative promoting greater flexibility and control for workers as well as greater supervisor support .
moreover , organizational changes that lower workers ’ burnout , per- ceived stress , and psychological distress bring benefits to employers as well , because such outcomes are apt to reduce productivity and increase absenteeism , presenteeism ( i.e. , showing up , but not being engaged at work ) , turnover , health problems , and poor life qual- ity at work and at home .
second , we show that organizational inter- ventions can promote facets of subjective well-being partly because they increase con- trol and reduce family-to-work conflict and burnout , but there are also other unidentified mechanisms that need to be investigated .
moreover , different mechanisms may operate for people in working-class or other nonpro- fessional or less technical jobs .
for example , employees represented by unions may appre- ciate this type of intervention ( if pursued with the union ’ s support ) because it increases their voice outside of the formal bargaining con- text and legitimates addressing work-life con- cerns as well as wages and benefits in negotiations and on the job ( berg et al .
2014 ) .
third , interventions targeting all workers , not just those most at risk , seem to have broad impacts and reach beyond the most vulnera- ble subgroups of workers .
but it workers are all less “ at risk ” than workers with less educa- tion , skills , and professional status ; future studies need to test similar interventions and specify mechanisms in different workforce populations .
a real limitation , though a delib- erate one , of this study is the focus on it workers who have demanding , stressful jobs but who are not simultaneously income- strapped .
researchers seeking to develop and test interventions advancing subjective well-being should move beyond it workers to consider the service sector , blue-collar jobs , and other white-collar work environ- ments and how economic hardship may mod- erate any intervention effects .
fourth , issues of sustainability are impor- tant .
we were unable to test for sustainability given subsequent dislocations in the merging organization after the 12-month survey .
this is a key topic for future research .
finally , this study demonstrates the value of real-world , randomized field trial research designs for teasing out causal relationships and processes , despite the costs and com- plexities they invariably engender .
if rand- omized field trials are not feasible , natural experimental designs studying the effects of policy , economic , or other changes happening “ on the ground ” but not deliberately imple- mented by researchers are another way of capturing and studying change .
social scientists are now equipped with the methodological tools , and more often able to collect the necessary longitudinal data , to bet- ter inform both theory and policy decision- making related to the social determinants of physical and mental health as well as other resources .
scholars should begin to recognize and strive to improve the quality of interven- tion and organizational research to showcase the structural forces and changes that can impede or promote workers ’ well-being .

notes 1 .
we found one study in which nursing units were randomly assigned to self-managed scheduling or the control condition ( pryce , albertsen , and nielsen 2006 ) ; this design is closest to our group-random- ized trial .
pryce and colleagues ( 2006 ) found no significant effects of self-scheduling on nurses ’ health and well-being , although the intervention improved work-life balance and job satisfaction .
2 .
a corporate merger is always highly confidential because it significantly affects a firm ’ s stock price .
our contacts in tomo had a sense the company was not doing well , but neither hr managers , man- agers , nor employees had specific clues about a forthcoming merger announcement .
3 .
within the early survey group , 76 percent of the star sample had completed the star training before the merger was announced .
the remainder of the early survey group randomized to star had completed the baseline survey and had begun the star training sessions , or their upper manage- ment had introduced star , before the merger was announced .
in supplemental analyses , we found that this latter group—who learned of the merger during the star training period , rather than after it was completed—did not differ significantly from others in the early survey group in age , cohort member- ship , gender , managerial status , baseline well-being outcomes , or baseline job demands ( psychological job demands and work hours ) .
given these similari- ties and given our rationale in distinguishing early versus late respondents ( i.e. , whether their baseline well-being measures were contaminated by the merger announcement ) , we report the simpler com- parison of early compared to later respondents .
4 .
workers were eligible to participate in the study if they were employees ( not contractors ) or manag- ers located in the two cities where data collection occurred .
one study group , whose employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements , was excluded because of concerns that the inter- vention might conflict with some contractual work rules ; union leadership was consulted on the deci- sion and suggested that course of action .
5 .
we excluded 15 employees who were randomized to the star intervention but were not invited to participate in star because of a staff error .
we also excluded eight employees initially randomized to the control group , because they were shifted to new teams already going through star .
6 .
if a respondent skipped a specific item but com- pleted at least 75 percent of the scale ( e.g. , 3 out of 4 items for perceived stress ) , we assigned the mean from that respondent ’ s responses to other questions in that scale .
if respondents did not complete at least 75 percent of the scale , they were omitted from that model .

do organizations spend wisely on employees ?
effects of training and development investments on learning and innovation in organizations sun young sung1 and jin nam choi2* 1school of business , nanjing university , nanjing china 2college of business administration , seoul national university , seoul , korea summary the present study examines the effects of training and development on organizational innovation.we specifically suggest that the training and development investments of an organization affect its innovative performance by promoting various learning practices .
we empirically tested our hypothesis by using time-lagged , multi-source data collected from 260 korean companies that represent diverse industries .
our analysis showed that corporate expenditure for internal training predicts interpersonal and organizational learning practices , which , in turn , increase innovative performance .
the data also revealed that the positive relationship between interpersonal and organizational learning practices and innovative performance is stronger within organizations that have stronger innovative climates .
by contrast , investment in employee development through financial support for education outside an organization poses a significant negative effect on its innovative performance and no significant effect on learning practices .
the present study provides a plausible explanation for a mechanism through which the investment of an organization in employees enhances its innovative performance .

journal of organizational behavior published by john wiley & sons , ltd. keywords : training and development investments ; learning practices ; innovative climate ; innovative performance introduction increasing endorsements on the strategic value of developing human capital in organizations encouraged scholars to investigate the relationship between training practices and various performance measures ( tharenou , saks , & moore , 2007 ) .
empirical studies in this domain focused on the effects of training on productivity ( barrett & o ’ connell , 2001 ) , financial performance ( glaveli & karassavidou , 2011 ) , and employee motivation ( castellanos & martín , 2011 ) .
unfortunately , the link between training practices and organizational innovative performance has been largely ignored ( nguyen , truong , & buyens , 2010 ) .
except for a few recent studies that treat training as a component of effective hr systems ( chen & huang , 2009 ; shipton , west , dawson , birdi , & patterson , 2006 ) , the independent effect of training on organizational innovation has yet to be investigated ( tharenou et al. , 2007 ) .
this is rather surprising , given the prevailing emphasis of a firm ’ s innovative capability in achieving competitive advantage and sustainable growth ( kang , morris , & snell , 2007 ; lau & ngo , 2004 ) .
to address this gap , the present study investigates the effects and underlying mechanisms of the investment in developing human resources on organizational innovation .
innovation often results from the ability to utilize existing knowledge and information to generate different combinations and reconfigurations ( cantner , kristin , & schmidt , 2008 ) .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) published online 9 september 2013 in wiley online library ( wileyonlinelibrary.com ) doi : 10.1002/job.1897 r esearch a rticle of an organization create a climate for constant learning that facilitates the exchange of knowledge and ideas among employees , thereby promoting the generation of new knowledge and innovation ( lau & ngo , 2004 ) .
hence , previous studies have often presumed that learning processes are the underlying mechanisms that account for the effects of training on innovative performance ( chen & huang 2009 ; laursen & foss , 2003 ) .
for instance , scholars have argued that training practices enhance innovation through promoting a learning climate ( gómez , lorente , & cabrera , 2004 ; shipton , fay , west , patterson , & birdi , 2005 ) and exploratory learning ( beugelsdijk , 2008 ; shipton et al. , 2006 ) .
theoretical elaboration and empirical evidence remain lacking despite the prevalent presumption regarding the potential intervening role of learning in the train- ing–innovation link .
the current study elaborates the role of learning practices as potential mediating mechanisms , which can explain why organizational efforts to develop human capital affect innovative performance .
considering that learning is a dynamic process that involves multiple organizational levels ( bontis , crossan , & hulland , 2002 ; noe , tews , & dachner , 2010 ) , we examine three types of learning in organizations , namely individual , interpersonal , and organi- zational learning .
in addition , we identify the innovative climate of an organization as a moderating contingency that may change the strength of the association between the three types of learning practices and organizational innova- tion to contextualize our model with a boundary condition .
we specifically propose that the link between learning and innovation is strengthened under an organizational climate that supports and promotes innovation ( choi , 2007 ; west & richter , 2008 ) .
in summary , we adopt the input-throughput-output framework employed in recent studies ( e.g. , huerta , audet , & peregort , 2006 ; katou , 2009 ) to propose various learning practices as potential mediators between the training investment and innovative performance of an organization .
in addition , we identify the innovative climate of an organization as a moderator that may change the strength of the association between learning practices and organizational innovation ( bowen & ostroff , 2004 ) .
in empirically validating our theoretical propositions , we address several limitations of recent studies on training and development , such as the reliance on managers as the single source of data and use of cross-sectional research design or post-predictive design , which render ambiguous causal directions ( tharenou et al. , 2007 ) .
to overcome these limitations , we collected time-lagged , multi-source data over a period of 2 years from a sample of 260 korean organizations in diverse industries .
conceptual framework with the increasing emphasis on human capital in relation to innovation ( chen & huang , 2009 ; lau & ngo , 2004 ; laursen & foss , 2003 ) , existing studies have shown that various hr practices are positively associated with orga- nizational innovation , such as the proportion of new products in total sales ( beugelsdijk , 2008 ) and product innova- tions in manufacturing firms ( shipton et al. , 2006 ) .
however , a detailed explanation on why these hr practices affect organizational innovation has not yet been clearly established .
in the present study , we explore the issue by focusing on organizational training and development investments as a key hr practice .
scholars and practitioners identified individuals as ultimate sources of creativity and innovation ( amabile , 1996 ; choi , 2007 ) .
thus , successful development of capable and highly motivated employees is a neces- sary condition for organizational innovation ( collins & smith , 2006 ) .
investing in the training and development of employees is an effective method to develop a competitive human resource pool ( jacobs & washington , 2003 ) .
focusing on the input function of training practices , scholars have attended to input-oriented factors such as the availability of training programs ( beugelsdijk , 2008 ; chen & huang , 2009 ) and extent to which an organization provides opportunities for training ( e.g. , hours of training or the ratio of employees trained ; aragón-sánchez , barba-aragón , & sanz-valle , 2003 ; glaveli & karassavidou , 2011 ) .
among these input factors incurred by the company , financial investment is the most straightforward indicator of organizational commitment and resource expenditure related to training ( huerta et al. , 2006 ) .
researchers who adopt a resource-based approach argue that 394 s. y .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job intensive and well-organized corporate trainings are resource dependent and must be supported by appropriate resource input , such as a sufficient budget ( gómez et al. , 2004 ) .
along with this stream , the monetary investment of firms in training has been recently highlighted as the most basic requirement to ensure both opportunities and quality of training for employees ( e.g. , gross payroll expenditure in training , huerta et al. , 2006 ; percentage of labor costs related to training , sels , 2002 ; budget assigned to training , shipton et al. , 2006 ) .
consistent with these studies that employ a resource-based approach , the present study focuses on financial investment in training and development .
this study also examines learning practices as critical intervening processes that account for the link between training and development investments and innovation ( figure 1 ) .
organizational efforts for training and develop- ment nurture knowledge and expertise among employees and generate their commitment to learning ( lópez , peón , & ordás , 2006 ; noe et al. , 2010 ) .
organizational learning is a central process for innovation , which promotes the absorption and utilization of external knowledge and integrates internal knowledge by allowing effective transfer and application of knowledge among organizational members ( chen & huang , 2009 ; subramony , krause , norton , & burns , 2008 ) .
similar to a recent study conducted by di milia and birdi ( 2010 ) , we are particularly attuned to learning that takes place at three levels in organizations : individual , interpersonal , and organizational learning .
training investment may invigorate learning at multiple levels , thereby leading to organizational innovation ( bontis et al. , 2002 ) .
in addition , the current model suggests that the link between learning and innovation may be more pro- nounced in organizations with more innovative climates .
by investigating the role of climate at the organizational level , the current study expands the literature on climate , which has mostly focused on the role of climate as a promotional context for group performance ( gonzález-romá , fortes-ferreira , & peiró , 2009 ) .
each relationship proposed in the research framework is explained later in detail .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job positive effects of training and development investments on organizational innovation innovation scholars highlighted the role of active learning and pursuing new knowledge in various stages of inno- vation , including problem identification , idea generation , idea promotion , and implementation ( nonaka & takeuchi , 1995 ; shalley , zhou , & oldham , 2004 ) .
such learning and knowledge management processes can be facilitated through corporate training and development by exposing employees to broad perspectives , skills , expertise , and ad- ditional insights through which they can expand their reservoir of new and useful ideas for innovation ( castellanos & martín , 2011 ; nguyen et al. , 2010 ) .
addressing the need to clarify the different modes of organization-provided training ( popescu , popescu , & iancu , 2010 ) and considering the different developmental focus , we identify the following two forms of training investment : corporate training expenditure and financial support for education .
the former is the preferred investment for firm-specific , intensive internal training for immediate performance gain , whereas the latter is geared toward external education to enhance the general competence of employees from a long- term perspective ( jacobs , skillings , & yu , 2000 ) .
although these two forms of training investment may play similar functions in generating learning and ultimately innovation , a separate examination is still important because both forms represent different resource allocation patterns across organizations and different ways through which human resource development efforts enhance organizational innovation .
corporate training expenditure corporate training expenditure is the investment for firm-specific , internal training that aims to achieve immediate skill building and performance gain , which directly address the current and impending training needs of an organization ( lópez et al. , 2006 ) .
organizations allocate resources to initiate training programs that are mostly developed and delivered in-house to provide organization-specific and task-relevant instructions , thus reinforcing firm-specific human capital in a short period ( hatch & dyer , 2004 ) .
this method is designed and delivered to employees in various formats ( e.g. , lectures , workshops , site visits , and case analyses ) and media ( e.g. , collective face-to-face training and personalized online training ; noe et al. , 2010 ) .
in addition to supplying new knowl- edge and information , corporate training promotes fast and effective learning and adaptation to new tasks and situations encountered by employees , thereby increasing employees ’ openness to innovative ideas and their ability to make constructive proposals for changes that may not be gained from their daily routine ( aragón- sánchez et al. , 2003 ; chen & huang , 2009 ) .
given that intensive and well-organized corporate trainings are resource dependent andmust be supported by appropriate investment ( gómez et al. , 2004 ) , financial investment in train- ing is critical in ensuring both opportunities and quality training for employees , which should enhance organizational innovation .
hypothesis 1 : corporate training expenditure is positively related to innovative performance .
financial support for education another common form of training investment is financial support for the education and professional development of employees ( benson , finegold , & mohrman , 2004 ; jacobs et al. , 2000 ) .
unlike corporate training , which is designed to directly improve task skills and competencies customized for a job and an organization , financial support for education is often directed toward the self-development efforts of employees to address their own needs and self- identified goals to improve their overall task-related competence ( bassi & mcmurrer , 1998 ; jacobs & washington , 2003 ) .
by encouraging and supporting employees who attend external educational and degree programs , organiza- tions can diversify intellectual assets and perspectives that facilitate creativity and innovation ( bassett-jones , 2005 ) .
as employees receive encouragement and generous financial aid for their education , they may also be motivated to engage in proactive initiatives and voluntary contributions toward organizational goals , which are crucial sources of organizational innovation ( rhoades & eisenberger , 2002 ) .
hypothesis 2 : financial support for education is positively related to innovative performance .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job learning practices as mediator between training investment and innovative performance although investment in training and development is a meaningful predictor of innovative performance , the training investment itself may not guarantee such performance .
considering that effective transfer , integration , and utilization of knowledge are core processes required for innovation ( chen & huang , 2009 ; gómez et al. , 2004 ) , training investment can result in increased innovation , but only when it actually instigates greater sharing and utilization of knowledge among employees ( bontis et al. , 2002 ; kang et al. , 2007 ) .
innovation is regarded as a path-dependent outcome of continuous knowledge assimilation and reconfiguration ( cantner et al. , 2008 ) .
thus , scholars recognized learning as an integral process for generating innovation ( laursen & foss , 2003 ; nonaka & takeuchi , 1995 ) .
in the present study , learning practice is defined as a set of complementary processes that promote the creation , exchange , and utilization of information and knowledge , all of which must be performed to enhance organizational innovation ( hatch & dyer , 2004 ) .
organizational learning is a complex and dynamic process that unfolds at multiple organizational levels ( birdi , patterson , & wood , 2007 ; noe et al. , 2010 ) .
thus , adopting the multilevel learning framework ( crossan , lane , & white , 1999 ; di milia & birdi , 2010 ) , we propose the following sub-processes of learning in organizations : individ- ual , interpersonal , and organizational .
individual learning practices involve learning activities based on individual projects and self-learning .
individual learning is often carried out through books or manuals and facilitated by train- ing programs to promote individual knowledge .
meanwhile , interpersonal learning practices are based on knowl- edge exchange and cross-training among employees .
interpersonal learning often occurs at dyad and small group levels through mutual learning , coaching , and task rotations .
finally , organizational learning practices involve orga- nization-wide systems that encourage knowledge transfer and generation among members .
organizational learning practices include knowledge-sharing systems , suggestion programs , and quality circles .
in the following section , we elaborate that each of the three learning practices has a significant bearing on organizational innovation , thus medi- ating the relationship between training investment and innovation .
individual learning practices training and development investments nurture organizations ’ overall learning culture ( gómez et al. , 2004 ; noe et al. , 2010 ) , which increases the willingness of employees to advance their capabilities and engage in various self-learning activities .
participation in corporate training and external education programs stimulates employees to become more learning oriented as well as urges them to actively pursue diverse information and knowledge needed to better perform their tasks ( chen & huang , 2009 ; shipton et al. , 2006 ) .
individual learning practices , such as self-learning through work performance or engaging in individual task-related projects , may enhance organiza- tional innovation by expanding the depth and breadth of employee knowledge ( sung & choi , 2012 ) .
these practices also promote the personal development and proactive involvement of employees at work , which enhances their capacity to troubleshoot work-related problems , develop creative solutions , and apply these solutions in practical situations .
an organization that consists of proactive learners who continually expand their knowledge base produces greater innovative outcomes than others ( birdi et al. , 2007 ) .
hypothesis 3 : individual learning practices mediate the relationship between training investment and innovative performance .
interpersonal learning practices financial investment in training and development conveys a clear message of strong willingness to develop em- ployees , which may generate an overall institutional context that signals the legitimacy of learning ( gómez et al. , 2004 ; sels , 2002 ) .
collective trainings that offer opportunities for communication among employees from different departments and from the same department stimulate employees to share ideas and experiences ( lópez et al. , 2006 ) .
similarly , participation in external education programs should encourage the participants to introduce new trends training and development investment and innovation 397 copyright © 2013 the authors .

under such situations , employees are likely to engage in collaborative interactions , which in turn promote interpersonal learning in the form of active involvement in mutual learning , coaching , and cross-training of each other ’ s task element ( noe et al. , 2010 ) .
these interpersonal learning incidents at the dyad or small group level may have bottom-up ripple effects for enhancing the overall learning and innovation of an organization ( bollinger & smith , 2001 ) .
such knowledge-sharing processes instigate employees to create novel combinations of existing knowledge by bringing together knowledge that was not readily connected in the past .
unconstrained interpersonal flow of information and knowledge should also improve the sensitivity and responsiveness of an organization to changes in the market and technology , which are often the major reasons for new product development ( npd ) and turnover of existing lines of products and services ( cantner et al. , 2008 ) .
therefore , interpersonal learning practices continuously reorganize the knowledge base of an organization and in- crease its sensitivity to environmental events , thereby enhancing its innovative performance .
hypothesis 4 : interpersonal learning practices mediate the relationship between training investment and innova- tive performance .
organizational learning practices by shaping an overarching environment that supports and promotes learning , training and development investments provide a foundation for readiness and activation of learning and knowledge management within organizations ( huerta et al. , 2006 ; noe et al. , 2010 ) .
such an organizational context encourages employees to engage in various organization-wide learning practices , such as knowledge-sharing systems , suggestion programs , and cross-func- tional task forces , to resolve urgent organizational problems .
these organizational practices are broader in their scope compared with interpersonal learning on the dyad or small group level , thus facilitating knowledge sharing across functions and hierarchical levels within an organization ( noe et al. , 2010 ) .
such knowledge sharing effec- tively enhances the capability of employees to access and absorb relevant knowledge distributed throughout varied segments of an organization , which should enhance organizational innovation ( di milia & birdi , 2010 ; sung & choi , 2012 ) .
in addition , organizational learning practices encourage employees to participate in the innovation pro- cess by inspiring them to recognize learning and knowledge generation as part of their work responsibilities as well as to improve the status quo rather than passively accept it ( shipton et al. , 2005 ) .
hypothesis 5 : organizational learning practices mediate the relationship between training investment and innova- tive performance .
innovative climate as a moderator although we expect a positive association between various learning practices and organizational innovation in most circumstances , this association may be more pronounced in organizations with a strong climate for innovation .
an innovative climate can be defined as employees ’ perceptions of the enduring features of the organization that accept and support new ideas and change as well as supply resources for innovative initiatives ( west & richter , 2008 ) .
aside from their potential benefits , innovations and creative ideas often challenge the status quo and disrupt the interpersonal relations and work process endorsed by others… for this reason , employees may need to feel protected or even encouraged by the entire organization when they take risks in suggesting improved work procedures and policies that may create tension with others .
( choi , 2007 , p. 472 ) an innovative climate offers a safety net against such risks and tension with others , which can be effectively addressed by encouragement from themanagement and trusting relationships with other members ( patterson et al. , 2005 ) .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job relationships and the accompanying psychological safety in particular are critical indicators of an innovative climate that allows employees to explore new approaches , express different ideas without the fear of being blamed , and mutually accept others ’ risky ideas ( west & richter , 2008 ) .
thus , under a high level of innovative climate , employees understand that new ideas are routinely accepted and rewarded rather than rejected and punished ( bowen & ostroff , 2004 ) .
given the role of an innovative climate in supporting organizational innovation , the relationship between learning practices and innovative performance may attenuate—and even disappear—when the climate is unfavorable toward achieving innovation .
under a low level of innovative climate , the motivation of employees for innovation is stifled .
various learning practices may strengthen existing routines that have already been developed and validated , which results in increased coordination and reliable operation within the status quo ( noe et al. , 2010 ) .
meanwhile , the value of various learning practices , especially with regard to innovative performance , is likely unleashed when employees collectively adhere to the organizational image in which innovative attempts are appreciated and even half-baked ideas do not prompt unfavorable reactions in their workplace .
hypothesis 6 : innovative climate moderates the relationship between learning practices and innovative perfor- mance in such a way that the relationship is stronger in organizations with a higher level of innovative climate .
method sample and data collection procedure the hypotheses were tested by using the human capital corporate panel data archived by the korea research in- stitute for vocational education and training ( krivet ) .
a stratified and random sample was drawn from private business organizations listed in the database of korea investors service .
krivet created a 3 × 4 × 2 matrix on the basis of the industry ( i.e. , manufacturing , banking , and service ) , organization size ( i.e. , 100–299 , 300–999 , 1000–1999 , and more than 2000 ) , and ownership type ( publicly vs. privately owned ) .
the initial sample of 1851 organizations was classified into each cell depending on the aforementioned organization characteristics .
approxi- mately 25 percent of the organizations were randomly selected from each cell of the matrix to avoid the potential problems of over- or under-sampling of specific cells .
the corporate survey data were collected at two time points in 2004 ( t1 , n= 454 ) and 2006 ( t2 , n= 464 ) .
the senior executives or directors of strategy and directors of human resource management ( hrm ) of these companies were contacted to obtain information within their managerial sphere .
given that the present study aimed to examine the effects of training investment and learning practices on organizational innovative performance , we also matched the 2004 corporate survey data with patent registration data in 2006 and 2007 .
from the initial sample of 364 orga- nizations , we excluded the organizations that reported the current set of learning practice items as inapplicable to them .
this screening procedure was used to empirically test the hypotheses ; these practices should be made avail- able to employees so that the employees can utilize them in response to the training and development efforts of the organization .
this screening procedure yielded a final sample of 260 companies that participated in both waves of data collection and provided sufficient data for the analysis .
our final analysis sample of 260 companies represents three industry categories from 16 specific businesses : manufacturing ( n= 180 , 10 industries , e.g. , electronics , computer , chemical , machinery , and plastic ) , banking ( n= 16 , one industry , banking/insurance ) , and non-banking service ( n= 64 , 5 industries , e.g. , telecommunication , software/system/online db , and entertainment ) .
the organization characteristics , including industry , size , and own- ership type of the analysis sample , were not different from those of the initial sample .
the t1 sample was composed of hrm directors and strategy directors of each company as well as 7996 employees who represent various functions , such as engineering , purchasing , production , and marketing .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job [ standard deviation ( sd ) = 18.65 ] people per company participated in the survey , composed of 81.3 percent men with a mean age of 43.2 years ( sd=8.39 ) and an average tenure of 10.9 years ( sd=5.01 ) .
for the t2 data , 1558 department managers , with an average of 6.02 ( sd=2.35 ) managers per company , participated in the survey .
the t2manager sam- ple was 96.1 percent men with an average age of 46.3 years ( sd=5.67 ) and an average tenure of 16.4 years ( sd=6.87 ) .
measures data were collected from multiple sources .
hrm directors rated the scales related to the investment in training and development , and learning practices of the company .
employees reported on the innovative climate .
strategy direc- tors rated control variables related to the business environment of the organization .
department managers reported on the innovative performance .
we also obtained the number of patents registered by each company , as archived by the korean intellectual property office ( kipo ) .
all variables were rated on a 5-point likert-type scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) .
corporate training expenditure ( hrm director , t1 ) unlike prior studies that relied on the subjective judgment of managers on the intensity of corporate training ( e.g. , lau & ngo , 2004 ) , we employed the resource-based approach and assessed the actual amount of monetary invest- ment in corporate training ( huerta et al. , 2006 ; sels , 2002 ) .
to this end , hrm directors reported the total cost of employee training on the basis of the financial data of the company .
corporate training expenditure included the direct costs of training , such as instructor fees , instructional materials , and lodging and meals during training but excluded salary for their own training department staff .
the total amount of training-related expenses was divided by the size of the organization to obtain per capita spending on employee training .
financial support for education ( hrm director , t1 ) the extent to which the company provided financial support for external education was measured by the total amount of college or graduate school tuition reimbursed to the employees on the basis of financial data of the company ( jacobs et al. , 2000 ) .
similar to corporate training expenditure , the total amount reimbursed was divided by the organization size to compute per capita financial support for education .
learning practices ( hrm director , t1 ) despite substantial research on organizational learning , researchers agree that operationally defining and measuring organizational learning in empirical research are excruciatingly difficult tasks ( arthur & aiman-smith , 2002 ; di milia & birdi , 2010 ) .
for this reason , the development of the measures of learning as a multilevel phenomenon is generally lacking .
given the lack of existing measures , we thoroughly reviewed extant studies on organizational learning and identified 20 potential items that assess organizational learning .
then , we employed the q-sort proce- dure , which offers a powerful quantitative tool for examining opinions and assessments .
this procedure is widely used in various behavioral science fields ( brown , 1986 ) .
to this end , 10 experts , including five professors and five doctoral students from a department of organizational behavior and strategy , participated in q-sort using those 20 items .
on the basis of our theoretical account regarding the three types of learning practices suggested in this study , the experts classified the 20 items into three categories of learning practices .
of the 20 items , only 10 achieved unanimity from all members of the expert group ( three items for individual learning , three items for interpersonal learning , and four items for organizational learning ) .
the other 10 items that failed to achieve unanimity were excluded from the present analysis .
individual learning practices were assessed by three items ( α = .68 ) drawn from prior studies ( birdi et al. , 2007 ; di milia & birdi , 2010 ) , which included “ employees in our company actively engage in the following activities : ( a ) individual projects related to one ’ s task , ( b ) self-initiated learning , and ( c ) individual problem solving. ” interper- sonal learning practices were assessed by using three items ( α= .64 ) grounded in prior studies ( bollinger & smith , 400 s. y .

the three items were “ employees in our company actively engage in the following activities : ( a ) mutual learning among employees , ( b ) mentoring/coaching each other , and ( c ) task rotation among employees. ” organizational learning practices were measured by four items ( α= .92 ) on the basis of organizational learning practices described in existing studies ( di milia & birdi , 2010 ; laursen & foss , 2003 ) : “ employees in our company actively participate in the following activities : ( a ) intranet-based knowledge sharing system , ( b ) quality circles , ( c ) suggestion program , and ( d ) six sigma. ” innovative climate ( employees , t1 ) taking items used in prior studies ( choi , 2007 ; patterson et al. , 2005 ) , innovative climate was assessed with three items ( α= .62 ) : ( i ) “ executives in our company tend to be authoritarian and do not accept others ’ ideas ” ( reverse-coded ) , ( ii ) “ in our company , all employees have opportunities to express their ideas and opinions , ” and ( iii ) “ in our company , employees have trusting working relationships. ” employee ratings of innovative climate were aggregated to the orga- nization level because the unit of analysis for this study was the organization .
this scale exhibited acceptable inter-rater agreement ( rwg ( 3 ) = .82 ) , which suggests that employees of the same organization possess shared perceptions of innova- tive climate .
in addition , this scale produced acceptable intraclass correlations [ icc ( 1 ) = .09 , icc ( 2 ) = .75 , f= 3.96 , p < .001 ] , which indicates substantial between-organization variation and organization-level reliability ( chen , mathieu , & bliese , 2004 ) .
innovative performance ( department managers and kipo , t2 ) departing from prior studies that solely rely on either a subjective measure of innovative performance or an objec- tive one , the present study assessed multiple dimensions of innovative performance such as npd , product and service differentiation , and patent registration .
department managers reported on the innovative performance of their respective companies by responding to the following two items ( α= .60 , icc ( 1 ) = .27 , icc ( 2 ) = .69 , f= 3.20 , p < .001 , rwg ( 2 ) = .75 ) : “ our company has competitive advantage over other companies in ( a ) developing and intro- ducing new products , and ( b ) introducing differentiation in the products and/or services offered ” ( 1 = not at all , 5 = a great deal ; beugelsdijk , 2008 ; lau & ngo , 2004 ; shipton et al. , 2006 ) .
department managers ’ ratings on the two items were averaged to create a subjective measure of innovative performance .
considering the significance of pat- ents that provide strong protection for proprietary knowledge for firms and its direct relatedness to inventiveness and technological novelty ( ahuja , 2000 ; cohen , goto , nagta , nelson , & walsh , 2002 ) , we also employed the number of patents registered by the company over a 2-year period following the t1 survey , as archived by kipo , as an objec- tive measure of innovative performance .
to clearly establish the predictive relationship and causal directions , we set a 2-year time lag between predictors and innovative performance measures ( hagedoorn & cloodt , 2003 ) .
each company ’ s score for innovative performance was computed by averaging the subjective measure ( npd , product and service differentiation ) and objective measure ( number of patents ) .
given the different metrics of these indica- tors of innovative performance , we transformed them into z-scores to obtain the mean of 0 and sd of 1 before averaging them .
the subjective and objective measures were substantially correlated ( r = .44 , p < .01 ) , supporting our aggregation of the two measures to form a single index of innovative performance .
control variables ( strategy director and hrm director , t1 ) upon examining the literature , we identified a number of factors that may bear significance for organizational inno- vation .
in our analysis , we controlled the effects of the following factors : ( i ) organization size , ( ii ) industry type , ( iii ) competitive environment , ( iv ) market change , ( v ) technology change , ( vi ) intensive selection , ( vii ) incentive compensation , and ( viii ) performance appraisal .
organization size is acknowledged as a critical firm-specific factor that affects innovative performance ( shipton et al. , 2005 ) .
firm size indicating the number of employees was log- transformed ( shipton et al. , 2006 ) .
organizations in the present sample were drawn from diverse industries that likely face different market and technological dynamics .
to control the effects of industry type , we created two dummies for the following three industry categories : ( i ) manufacturing , ( ii ) banking , and ( iii ) non-banking service industries .
innovation literature also emphasizes the role of external factors in driving organizational efforts training and development investment and innovation 401 copyright © 2013 the authors .

in this study , we included the extent of competition ( stelzer , 2002 ) , market change ( langerak , hultink , & robben , 2007 ) , and technology change ( benamati & lederer , 2001 ) to control the effects of environment- specific factors .
the extent of competition was measured by the item “ how many domestic competitors do you have ? ” [ 1 ( none ) , 2 ( 1–2 ) , 3 ( 3–4 ) , 4 ( 5–9 ) , and 5 ( more than 10 ) ] .
market change was measured by the item “ in our business , it is very hard to predict change in market and consumer demand ” [ 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) ] .
technology change was assessed with the item “ to what extent did your company experience technological changes in the last three years ? ” [ 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( a great deal ) ] .
strategy directors rated these scales .
in addition , we controlled the effects of other relevant hr practices by including the extent to which organizations deployed a system of intensive selection ( katou , 2009 ) , performance appraisal ( shipton et al. , 2006 ) , and incentive compensation ( beugelsdijk , 2008 ) .
intensive selection was measured by using 12 items and by asking hrm direc- tors to mark which of the following procedures their company administers prior to hiring : ( i ) personality test , ( ii ) aptitude test , ( iii ) personality interview , ( iv ) oral competence test , ( v ) writing competence test , ( vi ) iq test , ( vii ) group discussion , ( viii ) camp/outdoor observation , ( ix ) internship , ( x ) performance test , ( xi ) recommendation , and ( xii ) letter of self-introduction .
performance appraisal was measured by asking hrm directors to mark which of the following systems their company utilizes for employee performance appraisal : ( i ) balanced scorecard , ( ii ) management by objectives , ( iii ) competence appraisal , and ( iv ) leadership appraisal .
incentive compensation was assessed by simply asking hrm directors whether their company offers performance-based incentives [ 0 ( no ) and 1 ( yes ) ] .
results although the three learning practices and innovative climate were reported by different sources , the data were col- lected at the same time .
a confirmatory factor analysis of the 13 items that comprise the three learning practices and innovative climate measures was conducted to test their empirical distinctiveness .
the four-factor model exhibited good fit with the data [ χ2 ( df = 59 ) = 87.19 , p = .01 ; cfi = 0.95 ; rmsea = 0.043 ] and performed better than any of the alternative three- and two-factor models ( all p < .001 ) .
the confirmatory factor analysis pattern supports the empir- ical distinctiveness of the three learning practices and innovative climate .
descriptive statistics and correlations among study variables are reported in table 1 .
to test the hypotheses , we employed structural path analysis .
when the sample size is not enough compared with the number of parameters , reducing the number of indicators was recommended ( bandalos & finney , 2001 ) .
our model included 18 indicators of seven study variables in addition to nine control variables , thus resulting in 351 parameters that must be estimated [ 27 ( 27 1 ) /2 = 351 ] .
with this level of complexity , we were forced to employ a structural path analysis .
that is , we ran the model by using scale means of each construct in the model instead of incorporating item-level observed variables to create latent factors .
hypothesized model and plausible alternative models we fit the hypothesized model that incorporated all paths suggested in hypotheses 1–6 as depicted in figure 1 along with the covariances between the two training investments and among the three learning practice variables .
all three learning practice variables and innovative climate were mean-centered to reduce the problem of multicollinearity ( katrichis , 1993 ) .
the main effect of innovative climate on innovative performance was also included .
this hypothesized model exhibited a good fit with the observed pattern [ χ2 ( df= 92 ) = 142.55 , p = .001 ; cfi = 0.96 ; rmsea = 0.046 ; akaike information criterion ( aic ) = 338.55 ; hu & bentler , 1999 ] .
following the common struc- tural equations modeling ( sem ) practice , we tested the possibility that theoretically plausible alternative models offer better explanations of the current data .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job hypothesized , learning practices may only partially mediate the relationship between training investment and innovative performance .
this possibility was tested by adding two direct paths from training investment factors to innovative performance .
this model produced a model fit [ χ2 ( df = 90 ) = 134.18 , p = .002 ; cfi = 0.97 ; rmsea = 0.044 ; aic= 334.18 ] , which is significantly better compared with the hypothesized model [ δχ2 ( δdf=2 ) = 8.37 , p < .05 ] .
in the second alternative model , we tested the possibility that training investment and learning practices have parallel or independent effects on innovative performance instead of having a mediated relationship .
this model produced a worse model fit compared with the hypothesized model [ χ2 ( df=96 ) = 153.44 , p= .000 ; cfi=0.95 ; rmsea=0.048 ; aic=341.44 ] .
hence , the partial mediation model that provided the best fitting , theoretically plausible explanation of the data was preferred .
hypothesis testing the sem results of the partial mediation model are presented in figure 2 with standardized path coefficients .
among the control variables , only firm size was a significant predictor of innovative performance ( β = .18 , p < .01 ) .
after controlling their indirect effects through learning practices , both corporate training expenditure and financial support for education remained significant predictors of innovative performance .
corporate training expenditure showed a strong positive effect on innovative performance ( β = .20 , p < .01 ) .
surprisingly , the direct effect of finan- cial support for education on innovative performance was negative ( β =.11 , p < .05 ) .
the sem results also showed that corporate training expenditure was a positive predictor of interpersonal and organizational learning practices ( β = .14 and .18 , respectively , both p < .01 ) .
financial support for education was not a meaningful predictor of these learning practices .
of the three learning practices , interpersonal and organiza- tional learning practices increased innovative performance significantly ( β = .18 , p < .10 , and β = .13 , p < .05 , respectively ) .
however , the effect of individual learning practices on innovative performance was nonsignificant , disconfirming hypothesis 3 .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job these patterns indicated that among the three types of learning , interpersonal and organizational learning practices mediated the effects of corporate training expenditure on innovative performance .
following recent recommenda- tions ( mackinnon , krull , & lockwood , 2000 ) , we validated our mediation hypothesis by employing the product- of-coefficient approach .
we tested the statistical significance of the indirect effects of training investment on innovative performance by using the sobel test .
the sobel test found that the indirect effects of corporate training expenditure through interpersonal and organizational learning practices were significant ( both p < .05 ) .
we tested these indirect effects through the bootstrapping procedure to validate them in a robust manner ( mackinnon , fair- child , & fritz 2007 ) .
the bootstrapping empirically supported the indirect effects of corporate training expenditure through interpersonal and organizational learning practices ( point estimate = 0.02 , p < .05 , confidence interval of 0.01 and 0.02 ; point estimate = 0.01 , p < .10 , confidence interval of 0.00 and 0.01 ) , which partially supports hypotheses 4 and 5 .
finally , we examined the moderating role of innovative climate in the present model .
in addition to its significant direct effect on innovative performance ( β = .12 , p < .05 ) , an innovative climate significantly moderated the effects of interpersonal and organizational learning practices on the outcome ( β = .19 , p < .05 and β = .15 , p < .01 , respec- tively ) .
to examine the specific forms of these significant interactions , we conducted simple slope analysis ( aiken & west , 1991 ) .
both plots displayed in figure 3 revealed that the positive effects of interpersonal and organizational learning practices on innovative performance were stronger when employees ’ collective perception of innovative climate was high ( β = .51 , p < .05 and β = .72 , p < .01 , respectively ) than when it was low ( β = .30 , ns , and β = .45 , p < .10 , respectively ) , thus supporting hypothesis 6 .
robustness of the empirical findings to check the robustness of our findings , we performed two sets of post-hoc analysis .
first , the current analysis sam- ple of 260 organizations was formed by applying a relatively strict screening procedure in which we dropped a sub- stantial portion of the sample because of the high number of missing responses to the learning practice items .
given the possibility that even though employees are willing to engage in various learning activities , if the organization does not offer such an opportunity from the beginning , assessing the extent to which they engage in such learning practices can be misleading .
to ensure that organizations offered employees the opportunities to engage in learning interpersonal learning practices innovative performance high innovative climate low innovative climate low high organizational learning practices high innovative climate low innovative climate -1.0 0 0.5 1 -0.5 -1.5 innovative performance low high -1.0 0 0.5 1 -0.5 -1.5 figure 3 .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job practices , we excluded the organizations that responded to the learning practice items as “ not applicable to our organization ” in more than a third of the cases ( thus , four or more items out of 10 items were “ not applicable ” ) .
as a result , our final analysis sample included 260 organizations that had provided employees with seven or more practices out of the 10 measured .
if we had not applied this screening procedure , the analysis sample could have been much larger and composed of 364 organizations .
when performing the same sem with the two samples , re- sults based on our final analysis sample and those based on the larger sample of 364 organizations were almost iden- tical , except the direct effects of corporate training expenditure and financial support for education on innovative performance became somewhat stronger in the latter sample ( β = .40 and .27 , respectively , both p < .001 ) .
all other hypothesis testing results were exactly the same across the two samples , which indicates the robustness of the current empirical patterns .
second , the present research design introduced a potential source of systematic bias because a number of present study variables exhibited non-normal distribution .
in accordance with previous works , observed variables in social sciences are almost never normally distributed ( shimizu & kano , 2008 ) .
in addition , structural equation models with continuous variables do not have substantial problems with non-normality ( hancock & nevitt , 1999 ) .
nevertheless , we tested the hypotheses by employing bootstrapping to validate the current findings further .
this procedure has gained increasing acceptance as an analytic tool to handle the non-normality problem ( ekström & sjöstedt-de luna , 2004 ; hancock & nevitt , 1999 ) .
although the results became slightly less significant , the pattern of the results based on the bootstrapping procedure was almost identical to the current findings based on sem , which further confirm the robustness of the results .
discussion departing from existing studies that are principally focused on operational outcomes , such as productivity and financial performance ( tharenou et al. , 2007 ) , the present study introduces theoretical propositions that explain the mechanism through which training and development investments affect organizational innovative performance .
we further clarified the mediating process that involves multilevel learning practices that account for the training– innovation relationship , which is assumed but has yet to be examined .
in addition to conceptual advancement , the current study provides the first empirical investigation on the effect of training and development investments on learning and innovation at the organizational level based on multi-source , time-lagged data .
later , we highlight the implications of the current findings , limitations , and directions for future research .
implications of training and development investments for learning and innovation consistent with prior studies ( collins & smith , 2006 ; huerta et al. , 2006 ) , the present study offers an empirical dem- onstration regarding the prevailing belief on the value of corporate training for innovation at the organizational level .
this study also partially supports the often-presumed mediating role of learning in the relationship between corpo- rate training and innovation ( laursen & foss , 2003 ; shipton et al. , 2005 , 2006 ) .
surprisingly , in contrast to prevail- ing beliefs ( bassi & mcmurrer , 1998 ) , our analysis shows that financial support for education has a direct negative effect on innovation without any significant effect on learning processes that improve innovative performance .
given that the zero-order correlation between financial support for education and innovative performance is nonsig- nificant ( r =.01 , ns ) , the significant direct negative effect of financial support for education might be due to the classic situation of statistical suppression ( mackinnon et al. , 2000 ) .
these negative or neutral implications of finan- cial support for education with regard to learning and innovation are inconsistent with previous findings .
existing research indicates that tuition reimbursement or other forms of financial aid for education is an attractive incentive for employees , which results in positive organizational attitudes ( e.g. , perceived organizational support , job 406 s. y .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job satisfaction , and commitment ) and decreased turnover intention ( noe , wilk , mullen , & wanek , 1997 ; rhoades & eisenberger , 2002 ) .
the literature has somewhat neglected organization-wide implications of financial support for education , which may be because of the previous focus on individual-level outcomes .
considering that such support is offered only to a small fraction of employees , the positive outcomes reported by employees who experienced the benefits of or- ganization-sponsored external education could engender perceptions of relative deprivation and unfairness among those excluded from these special benefits .
in addition to the potential dependence on the level of analysis , employee participation in external education may distract them from their tasks at hand , which hampers the effective transfer of external knowledge ( benson et al. , 2004 ; jacobs et al. , 2000 ) .
however , at the current juncture marked by limited empirical evidence , these interpretations are speculative , presenting a need for further systematic research .
implications of learning practices for organizational innovation our analysis shows that learning practices offer a meaningful intervening process between corporate training expen- diture and organizational innovation .
while individual learning practices are not significantly associated with inno- vation , interpersonal and organizational learning practices have significant and positive effects on the outcome .
individual insight or knowledge may not contribute to innovation unless shared and integrated within the organiza- tional context ( gómez et al. , 2004 ; sung & choi , 2012 ) .
the present findings provide empirical support for the argument in knowledge management literature , that is , the importance of knowledge lies in the connections among people instead of within a person ( cf .
situated knowledge web ; nidumolu , subramani , & aldrich , 2001 ) .
in gener- ating organizationally meaningful innovations , collective processes based on communities of practice , distributed expertise , and processes that link individuals and groups/communities seem to play a more critical role compared with knowledge embedded in individual employees ( shipton et al. , 2006 ; sung & choi , 2012 ) .
our analysis also indicates that even collective organizational learning processes may be ineffective in generating innovation when the organizational context does not support innovation .
the present study further extends hr and innovation literature by demonstrating that learning practices promote innovation only when an organization cultivates a work climate that encourages innovation ( bowen & ostroff , 2004 ) .
thus , the co-presence of collective learning processes and innovative climate seems necessary in achieving innovative performance at the organiza- tional level .
practical implications the present findings offer several implications for practitioners .
our analysis demonstrates that financial investment in corporate training significantly increases organizational innovation over the succeeding 2 years .
by contrast , em- ployee development through external education exhibits a neutral or even negative effect on learning and innovative performance .
nevertheless , the professional development of employees plays a positive role in maintaining the long- term innovative potential of an organization and is also deemed necessary in retaining a high-profile workforce in several professional domains such as medicine , law , and engineering .
to maximize the value of financial support for education and minimize unintended negative performance impli- cations , organizations should implement such programs with caution .
first , highly unbalanced financial aid for ed- ucation across employees may cause a sense of deprivation among the majority of employees excluded from such privilege , as described earlier .
thus , organizations should ensure fairness in selecting beneficiaries of such financial support .
moreover , organizations must utilize the support as an effective motivational tool for employees without causing resentment among those who were excluded .
second , studies based on human capital theory suggest that employees who participate in organization-sponsored education programs are more likely to leave their companies because of their increased marketability and credentials ( pattie , benson , & baruch , 2006 ) .

35 , 393–412 ( 2014 ) doi : 10.1002/job employees , organizations should recognize the turnover risk and implement policies that require employees to stay for a certain period or repay the education cost ( benson et al. , 2004 ) .
finally , studies show that task relevance of the education program decreases the turnover intention of employees ( pattie et al. , 2006 ) .
by providing highly task- relevant external education , organizations can increase congruence between newly acquired knowledge and task re- quirements at the individual level as well as further promote organization-wide knowledge transfer , which increases organizational capability and performance .
the current data also show that interpersonal and organizational learning practices significantly increase organi- zational innovative performance over a 2-year period .
as shown in our analysis , organizations can promote these collective learning activities by offering more corporate training to their employees .
collective learning practices , such as making suggestions , using the knowledge management system , mentoring , and adopting six sigma activi- ties , are often initiated and directed by supervisors .
however , the active and committed participation of employees determines the effectiveness of such learning events even when they are forced to engage in collective learning processes ( noe et al. , 2010 ) .
to this end , managers should cultivate an innovative climate and obtain employees ’ buy-in with regard to the implementation of various learning practices and programs ( choi , 2007 ) .
study limitations and future research directions the present results should be interpreted with caution , considering the several limitations of the study .
first , our study employed multi-source research design by using data from multiple constituents ( i.e. , hrm directors , strategy directors , department managers , employees , and kipo data ) .
in addition , training investment was measured by actual monetary cost archived by the company .
nevertheless , all predictors were reported by the hrm director .
to ensure the accuracy and validity of information , future studies should further utilize independent sources of data for training investment and learning practices .
second , although the innovative performance data were collected over a 2-year period after the survey , certain efforts for developing employees and learning processes may take more than 2 years to make an impact on innova- tive performance .
for instance , birdi et al .
( 2008 ) reported that certain hr processes ( e.g. , teamwork ) may take more than 6 years to affect organizational performance .
similarly , the effort exerted in building human capital through financial support for education and individual learning practices may bear fruit in the long run despite the short-term cost ( rhoades & eisenberger , 2002 ) .
third , employing the resource-based view and input function of hr practices , we focused on the corporate monetary expenditure on training and development .
to examine the validity of the current measure of training in- vestment , we compared the current variable with two other training-related variables often used in extant studies , namely the number of training hours provided to employees and effectiveness of training as perceived by employees .
both variables were significantly correlated with our measure of corporate training expenditure ( r = .15 , p < .05 , and r = .27 , p < .01 , respectively ) .
we conducted the same sem analysis by using both variables as alternative measures of training investment .
interestingly , of the two variables , the results based on perceived effectiveness of training were almost identical to the current results based on financial investment .
apparently , the efforts of an organization to provide high-quality hr practices in the form of financial investment ( input side ) are highly linked to employee positive perceptions toward training ( output side ) .
nonetheless , given the potentially signifi- cant role of other characteristics of training efforts , such as specific contents or instructional design of training for employee learning and innovation ( noe et al. , 2010 ) , further research based on alternative measures of training should be conducted .
fourth , although perceptual measures of learning practices and learning capabilities rated by hr managers and executives have been widely used ( gómez et al. , 2004 ; laursen & foss , 2003 ) , managerial assessment may overestimate the effects of training and development on performance .
in this respect , having objective indicators of learning at various levels assessed over time would be ideal in measuring the actual amount of changes in response to training investment .
for instance , organizational learning practices could be assessed by the change in 408 s. y .

future studies could employ objective indexes of learning or external expert ratings in measuring diverse learning practices in organizations .
finally , data were collected from korean organizations commonly characterized by distinct organizational culture and managerial practices ( quick & kim , 2009 ) .
often , the effects of hr practices on employee behavior are differ- ent in emerging market countries compared with those observed in western organizations ( du & choi , 2010 ) .
con- trary to our findings , which indicate that financial support for education negatively affects innovative performance , bassi and mcmurrer ( 1998 ) reported that tuition assistance programs contribute to organizational performance , such as market value , annual net sales , and gross profit , in 38 american trade firms .
at this point , we can not fully com- prehend these different findings .
however , we speculate that american employees gain more benefits from individualized personal development programs , whereas korean employees gain more from collective corporate training .
further cross-cultural and cross-national empirical research is needed .
despite these shortcomings , this study employed a rigorous empirical design and explained the training–innovation link that has only recently started to receive research attention .
further conceptual efforts may be directed to develop a matrix of relationships between different learning practices and distinct forms of innovations .
for instance , learning practices that are beneficial for incremental innovations in work processes may differ from those considered beneficial for radical innovations in products and services .
in addition , future theoretical and empirical endeavors are needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the intermediate processes between training and innovation beyond learning practices at three levels of analysis .
for example , employee outcomes such as job satisfaction , employee commitment , organizational citizenship behavior , and turnover could be promising mechanisms that underlie the effects of training and development on organizational innovation , particularly at the individual level of analysis .
although stating that people are the most important assets of an organization is axiomatic , most organizations typically react to crises by downsizing their personnel .
moreover , the first budget cut is typically targeted at training expenses ( mellahi & wilkinson , 2008 ) .
however , the present results indicate that if an organization reduces its training expenditure ( particularly for internal training ) as a reaction to a crisis , its capability for innovation can be degraded in the coming years despite the increasing importance of persistent innovation to overcome the crisis and create turnarounds ( laursen & mahnke , 2001 ) .
therefore , the present study recapitulates the significance of investment on human capital for continuous organizational innovation , particularly when an organization encounters threatening situations .
such investments can ensure the long-term survival and growth of an organization .

minorities and the clandestine collective action dilemma : the secret protection of jews during the holocaust1robert braun university of california , berkeley1 i wou neveld daniel provid altino marni griffio © 201 0002-9 all usethis article argues that local minority groups are better able to initiate and sustain underground movements because members form isolated hubs of commitment that are able to overcome the clandestine collec- tive action dilemma , that is , the dual challenge of secrecy and mobili- zation .
the author substantiates this claim with a case study of resis- tance against the holocaust .
he combines a unique and underutilized collection of postwar testimonies gathered in light of an honorary pen- sion program with postwar trials of pro-nazi collaborators and liter- ature on nonrescuers , to trace both successful and failed rescue at- tempts .
in line with the theory , the analysis reveals that catholic rescue groupsweremore successful in protestant regions andvice versa because their minority position facilitated mobilization while reducing exposure .
statistical analyses of postwar testimonies and arrest records confirm this picture , demonstrating that it is the distinctive local posi- tion of groups that enables the production of undergroundmovements.introduction clandestine movements have played a crucial role in the instigation of rev- olutions ( lenin 1970 ; gould 1995 ) , resistance movements ( finkel 2015 ) , ld like to thank marnix croes , peter tammes , herman van rens , the late jan son- , thedutch social insurancebank , jean-emileveth , docdirect , aike van der ploeg , blocq , and thedutchmuseum for jewishhistory for sharing data .

american journal of sociology allguerrilla groups ( viterna 2006 ) , terrorism ( sageman 2011 ; shapiro 2013 ) , rescue operations for victims of mass persecution ( foner 2015 ) , and trans- formative collective actionmore broadly ( smelser 1962 ) .when talking about revolutions , lenin , one of themore influential movement organizers inworld history , identified secrecy as the most important condition for success ( lenin [ 1902 ] 1970 ; erickson1981 ) .despitetheimportanceofclandestinecollectiveac- tion , we lack a complete understanding of why some communities are able to produce and sustain underground operations while others are not .
in addi- tion to obvious data collection problems , this is—at least according to some— due to a scholarly focus on public claim making in the collective action liter- ature ( zwerman , steinhoff , and della porta 2000 ) .
existing explanations of clandestine collective action focus on how na- tional factors , such as levels of repression , leadership , and the nature of pro- test waves ( fein 1979 ; zwerman et al .
2000 ; della porta 2013 ) , or individual attributes , such as adventurousness , moral outrage , ideology , values , and biographical availability , push and pull nascent rebels into clandestine op- erations ( london 1970 ; viterna 2006 ) .
recognizing that these approaches fail to account for differential mobilization within countries , more recent re- search has tried to explore interactions between individual motives and na- tional forces ( viterna 2006 ; della porta 2013 ) .
inspired by scholarship of other types of high-risk collective action , this mesolevel approach has shown how recruitment through dense networks connects individuals to broadermacro- environments , enabling undergroundmobilization from the ground up ( mor- ris 1981 ; mcadam 1986 ; gould 1995 ; della porta 2013 ) .
although this focus on network density has significantly enhanced our understanding of secre- tive movements , it fails to explain why some communities are able to pro- duce social relationships that allow for careful clandestine recruitment while others are not .
this article sheds light on the local challenges of clandestine collective ac- tion , to explain where clandestine recruitment is more successful .
in partic- ular , i draw on the sociology of secrecy ( simmel 1906 ; erickson 1981 ; herdt 1990 ; fine and holyfield 1996 ) and covert social networks ( raab and mil- ward 2003 ; morselli , giguère , and petit 2007 ; sageman 2011 ; crossley et al .
2012 ) , to show that clandestine mobilization is a distinctive form of high- risk collective action ( mcadam 1986 ; loveman 1998 ) that , in addition totammes , herman van rens , sadia saeed , charles seguin , wout ultee , marthawilfahrt , sidneytarrow , chrisway , alexkuo , kevinmorrison , participants innorthwestern ’ s so- cialmovement/enterpriseworkshop , and theajs reviewers provided excellent comments on earlier versions of this project .

minorities and collective actionthemore commonly studied high-risk collective action problem , involves an extra trade-off because the network density , coordination , and communica- tion required for mobilization automatically reduce secrecy on a local level ( goffman 1970 ; baker and faulkner 1993 ; shapiro 2013 ) .
the central hypothesis of this article is that local minority communities are better able to solve the clandestine collective action dilemma because minority isolation simultaneously increases ( a ) group commitment ( cole- man 1988 ) and ( b ) decreases the flow of information to undedicated outsid- ers in the immediate environment ( granovetter 1995 ; portes 1995 ) , produc- ing hubs of commitment that exploit the advantages of dense networks while reducing exposure by embedding them in isolated structures .
as a re- sult , clandestine collective action often remains rare and confined to limited sets of local communities .
clandestinity poses enormous obstacles for empirical investigation.gain- ing direct access to contemporary clandestine cells is next to impossible ex- actly because these cells need to reduce exposure in order to survive .
archi- val work on historical cases can alleviate this challenge because it allows us to study groups that are no longer under immediate threat , reducing the ur- gency of secrecy ( crossley et al .
2012 ) .
moreover , when political structures open and regimes change , former clandestine networks sometimes go public in order to gain recognition for their activities against past foes .
this often opens up a wide array of archives and testimonies .
instead of focusing on contemporary cases , this study therefore focuses on a historical episode of clandestine collective action : the secret protection of jews during the holo- caust .
i zero in on twente , an economically and socially integrated region in the netherlands located across the catholic-protestant fault line that divides western europe .
as a result , important economic and social factors , includ- ing top-down enforcement by elites , national norms , levels of threat , scrutiny , repression and ideology , can be kept constant when comparing protestant and catholic groups in minority and majority contexts .
the extraordinary availability of unused archival sources presented by theholocaust intwente enables me to study clandestine collective action in a detailed fashion .
i de- ploy two unique and underutilized collections of postwar testimonies .
the first collection consists of research done in light of anhonors pension program and contains information about peoplewho either protected jews themselves or lost familymemberswhodid so.the secondbody of documents is collected in light of postwar trials against collaborators and provides information about the detection of jews inhiding .
in combinationwith existingwork on themen- tality of nonrescuers ( hilbrink 1989 ; van der boom 2012 ; demant 2015 ) , these sources provide an unusual opportunity to trace the evolution of suc- cessful and unsuccessful clandestine rescue operations ( i.e. , networks that were detected and dismantled by security forces ) .265 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology allin support of the minority thesis , the data reveal that ( a ) minority leaders were able to exploit the mobilizing capacity of committed members , ( b ) ma- jority rescue operations were more likely to get denounced early on , ( c ) reli- giousmixing undermined theminority advantage by undercutting isolation , and , as a result , ( d ) insulated pockets of protestants were more successful in protecting jews in catholic regions while the same was true for catholic en- claves in protestant areas .
a quantitative analysis of commemoration books and postwar testimonies of rescuers throughout the netherlands backs up these findings fromtwente .
in addition , the case study helps me link deeply structural factors to actual outcomes , by suggesting three feedback mecha- nisms that translate the ( somewhat ) abstractminority advantage into actual higher levels of clandestine mobilization : group isolation assures organizers that mobilization is possible ( elster 1989 ) , it helps organizers to recruit the right operatives ( marwell andoliver 1993 ) , and it improves the selective re- tention of resistance by reducing infiltration from outsiders ( aldrich 1999 ) .
this article extends my earlier research on the religious rescue of jews in the netherlands , which used a statistical analysis of geocoded evasion data , to show that jews living in the vicinity of minority church buildings were more likely to survive the war ( braun 2016 ) .
this earlier research assumes , but never proves , that this was the case because minority congregations were both more motivated and better able to protect .
here , i zero in on the ability to protect and identify several mechanisms underlying the statistical patterns in braun ( 2016 ) , using detailed case studies of rescue operations .
taken together the two articles use different methods to illuminate different steps in the causal chain that link minority status to resistance against geno- cide.2 in addition , this article makes six distinct but interrelated contributions to scholarship on collective action , political violence , social movements , and humanitarian protection .
first and foremost , this article suggests that we should study the interaction between individual factors , mesolevel net- works , and national-level processes if we really want to understand where andwhy clandestine resistance against genocide emerges ( hagan andrymond- richmond 2008 ) .
the potential of this multilevel framework is detailed in the conclusion .
second , this article sheds light on the root causes of clandestine mobiliza- tion .
existing work has shown that dense and spatially clustered networks embedded in formal organizations provide the relational base for secret mo- bilization ( gould 1995 ) .
yet , strong organizational networks and personal ties abound , while clandestine mobilization is rare .
this article shows that2 for now , i shy away from assessing the relative importance of ability andmotivation , as the two often reinforce each other ( joas 1993 ) .
i further explore this issue in my book ( braun , in press ) .

minorities and collective actiondense networks need to be structured in a particular way to facilitate under- ground collective action , qualifying the relationship between networks and coordinated opposition .
third , i contribute to debates on the secrecy-efficiency trade-off in the study of covert networks .
advocates of this trade-off argue that clandestine networks need to be sparse and decentralized to remain covert and are , as a consequence , inefficient in solving complex collective action problems ( raab andmilward 2003 ; enders and su 2007 ) .
opponents have suggested that efficiency and secrecy actually reinforce each other because density and centralization improve secrecy by facilitating coordination , careful recruit- ment , and internal solidarity ( simmel 1906 ; erickson 1981 ) .
the current analysis suggests that insights from both camps should be combined , as iso- lated hubs of commitment conducive to secretmobilization are locally dense but globally sparse ( sageman 2011 ; crossley et al .
2012 ) , specifying a non- linear relationship between network structure andmobilization ( gould 1993 ) .
in so doing , this finding contradicts theories suggesting that covert opera- tions are aided bya group ’ sweak ties , which can improve access to resources , enhance cohesion through the collection of information about threatening outsiders ( della porta 2013 ) , and facilitate the diffusion of resistance ( gould 1995 ) .
fourth , this article strengthens links between the literatures on social movements and political violence by investigating how outcomes of mass killing are contingent on localized forms of clandestine mobilization by by- standers .
scholars of political violence traditionally depict civilians as pow- erless pawns in the hands of warring parties who either support rebels or are coerced to provide local intelligence ( kalyvas 2006 ) .
more recently , scholars of social movements have looked at the mobilization of killers ( su 2011 ) and victims ( einwohner and maher 2011 ) .
this article demonstrates how and where empathetic or adventurous bystanders can mobilize in secret to con- dition the local impact of political violence .
fifth , this article reveals the reformation ’ s lasting impact on clandestine resistance to political violence centuries later .
as such , i join a small body of work that reveals howprotectivemobilization not only affects victimization directly but is itself shaped by historical legacies of long-gone political movements .
these legacies of contention introduce a new set of historical variables understudied by social movement scholars and highlight the im- portance of embedding the study of both political violence and collective ac- tion in the broader historical context of contentious politics ( clemens 2007 ) .
sixth , although the article focuses on minorities in general it also sheds light on the role of religion and collective action .
traditionally , european social theorists have portrayed religious hierarchies as agents of passivity that hamper mobilization , while scholars on the other side of the ocean de- picted them as actors that inspired transformativewaves of collective action267 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology all ( morris 1981 ) .
this article suggests that whether church communities pro- duce resistance is dependent on how they are embedded in the local commu- nity .
in the following section , i introduce the clandestine collective action di- lemma , explaining how and why minorities are better able to produce and sustain secretive mobilization in defense of threatened neighbors .
i then in- troduce the region of twente and describe the developments that led to its religious split .
the following section describes the archival materials that allow me to interrogate the roots of clandestine protection .
the qualitative analysis is presented in the subsequent section .
i then use a subset of com- memoration books and postwar testimonies to assess whether the minority hypothesis travels beyond its borders .
in the conclusion , i explore the scope conditions of my theory and provide building blocks for a multilevel theory of clandestine collective action that combines national context , individual motivation , and community capacity.theory the clandestine collective action dilemma underground mobilization poses two interrelated challenges that together constitute what i call the clandestine collective action dilemma .
first , one needs to mobilize .
this involves the well-studied high-risk collective action problem .
a secret organization requires the establishment of communica- tion lines , safe houses , forged documents , and the collection of sufficient food for its members ( finkel 2015 ) .
this is too much work for one person or family alone , necessitating cooperation beyond the household .
individu- als are reluctant to take part in these activities because both the costs and risks of participation are extremely high.however , numerous scholars have shown that dense or centralized interpersonal networks ( mcadam 1986 ; marwell and oliver 1993 ) , often embedded in associations ( morris 1981 ; gould 1995 ) , allow movements to overcome high-risk collective action prob- lems by enabling recruitment and coordination ( mcadam 1986 ; sageman 2011 ; della porta 2013 ) , as well as producing solidarity through social sanc- tioning ( coleman 1988 ) .
second , in addition to solving the high-risk collective action problem , re- sistance networks need to be sustained .
this requires secrecy becausemove- ment organizers can not exclude oppressors from the areas in which they op- erate ( shapiro 2013 ) .
becoming known to the persecuting power not only leads to operational failure but also results in compounding security threats as perpetrators try to arrest associates of captured individuals ( sullivan 2016 ) .
the secrecy challenge is related to the high-risk collective action prob- lem because heightened secrecy reduces the odds of getting caught , making268 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
minorities and collective actionparticipation more attractive for forward-looking actors .
however , under- ground mobilization faces a unique trade-off that distinguishes it from other forms of high-risk collective action : mobilization requires dense and central- ized networks for recruitment , sanctioning , coordination , and communica- tion , all ofwhich increase the chances of detection and a group being compro- mised ( goffman 1970 ; raab and milward 2003 ; enders and su 2007 ) .
hence , the tools needed to increase the collective capacity of a group are the very tools that put these groups at risk ( shapiro 2013 ) , a dilemma that network analysts commonly refer to as the secrecy-efficiency trade-off ( morselli et al .
2007 ; crossley et al .
2012 ) .
advocates of this trade-off assume that covert networks necessarily sacrifice collective capacity for secrecy and consequently are characterized by low density , the exact reverse of a net- work structure conducive to high-risk mobilization ( raab and milward 2003 ; enders and su 2007 ; crossley et al .
2012 ) .
studies of criminal net- works have challenged this assumption , revealing that underground orga- nizations do sometimes rely on dense networks for complex tasks because denser networks increase solidarity and facilitate careful recruitment and coordination , thereby reducing the risk of exposure by enhancing the qual- ity of mobilization ( baker and faulkner 1993 ; morselli et al .
2007 ; crossley et al .
2012 ) .
the sociology of secrecy suggests that dense networks need to be struc- tured in a distinct way in order to facilitate clandestinity .
more specifically , covert networks need to be both dense and isolated.on the one hand , secrecy— just like high-risk mobilization—requires strong group commitment , cohe- sion , and dense internal networks ( fine and holyfield 1996 ) .
on the other hand , underground groups need to exclude uncommitted outsiders ( herdt 1990 ) in order to create barriers that prevent the leakage of secrets to the outside world ( gibson 2014 ) .
whereas the classic collective action problem requires creating a core of committed followers who are willing to mobilize , the secrecy challenge necessitates that information actually stays within this core and does not spread to undedicated outsiders who could potentially re- veal clandestine activities ( herdt 1990 ) .
overcoming both challenges at once requires isolated hubs of commit- ment withoutweak ties that could potentially transmit secrets to the uncom- mitted ( herdt 1990 ) .
the same process that makes weak ties strong when looking for jobs ( i.e. , the flow of new information ) turns them into a liabil- ity for clandestine collective action ( granovetter 1995 ) and explains why co- vert organizations often emergewithin segregated groups of like-minded in- dividuals ( raab and milward 2003 ) .
this notion combines insights from scholars arguing both in favor of and against the secrecy-efficiency trade- off , as isolated hubs of commitment are locally dense clusters located in a broader network that is sparse ( crossley et al .
2012 ) , revealing a nonlinear relationship between network density and clandestine collective action in269 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology allgeneral ( gould 1993 ) .
isolated hubs of commitment evoke the structure of many 21st-century terrorist organizations that consist of small and “ leader- less ” cells ( raab andmilward 2003 ) operating largely independently in pur- suit of a common cause ( sageman 2011 ) .the minority advantage the high premium on commitment and secrecy restricts recruitment .
be- cause it is easier to generate group commitment between similar actors al- ready engaged in frequent interactions , recruitment into illicit collective action often proceeds through existing bonds of trust , typically resting on kinship ties or other strong relationships .
as a result , clandestine collective action in times of upheaval often inherits group structures present in un- eventful times ( erickson 1981 ) ; put otherwise , preexisting group relation- ships create the confines within which clandestine mobilization emerges in times of crisis .
given the distinct challenges of clandestine mobilization , some groups are better equipped for its challenges than others because of the way in which they are locally embedded .
the main hypothesis of this article is that minority groups have a natural advantage in producing and sustaining clandestine networks because they are anchored in isolated hubs of commit- ment that provide relatively safe places for illicit mobilization .
at least four reinforcing processes increase isolation and commitment of minorities : distinctive identification , exclusionary pressures , social closure , and , in some cases , membership screening .
according to the distinctiveness postulate , people rely on perceptual selectivity to make sense of who they are and what groups they are willing to commit to .
individuals tend to com- mit most to characteristics that are relatively rare in their social environ- ments because rare traits provide the most information about who you are .
in line with the distinctiveness postulate , social psychologists studying collec- tive action have demonstrated that minority groups , those organized around relatively rare traits , display strong group identification andaremore likely to invest in within-group networks .
these network choices and levels of identi- fication in turn increase internal cohesion , compliance with group norms , overall loyalty , and voluntary self-sacrifice among members , as well as social isolation ( brewer and silver 2000 ) .
needless to say , isolation is not always driven by the behavior of the mi- nority itself .
dominant groups see the practices and beliefs of minorities as strange and deviant , producing perceptions of threat and prejudicial atti- tudes , which in turn results in avoidance .
exclusion by the majority rein- forces isolation from mainstream society , while at the same time increasing the importance of cohesion and internal networks ( coser 1956 ) .270 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
minorities and collective actionin cases inwhichmembership is voluntary , exclusion also creates isolated hubs of commitment and trust by changing the membership profile of mi- nority groups .
whenever social life is segregated by group membership , a minority position acts as a natural screening device because it imposes un- productive costs on members by inhibiting participation in dominant polit- ical , economic , and social networks .
if one is not allowed to interact with out-group members in a region where everyone belongs to one ’ s commu- nity , membership costs aremarginal .
however , if on a local level one ’ s group decreases in size relative to another community , prohibitions start to matter , and the costs of limited interaction become enormous for minority members .
at the same time , these costs subsequently screen out potential free riders and increase the importance of the collectivity for everyone ( iannaccone 1994 ; berman 2011 ) .
finally , the combination of strong internal networks and exclusion also enhances social closure , providing opportunities to sanction members who decide to betray their fellows ( coleman 1988 ) .
taken together , distinctive identification , exclusion , membership screening , and social closure turn mi- norities into dense networks of committed individuals ( coleman 1988 ) that are insulated from undedicated outsiders ( granovetter 1995 ; portes 1995 ) .
these isolated hubs of commitment in turn create an opportunity to over- come the dual challenge of high-risk collective action and secrecy.from isolated commitment to clandestine mobilization as outcomes can not be explained by their consequences , the minority ad- vantage in clandestine capacity does not manifest itself automatically ( els- ter 1989 ) .
reliable and committed volunteers who happen to be embedded in isolated networks can not simply walk to a recruiting office , nor do all or- ganizers automatically possess the cognitive skills and information to seize the opportunity provided by social enclaves .
this study exposes three feed- backmechanisms that translate the abstract minority advantage into higher levels of clandestine mobilization among minority enclaves : selective reten- tion , organizer ’ s assurance , and organizer ’ s selectivity .
first , selective retention refers to the process through which entities with favorable traits perpetuate themselves because they are more likely to sur- vive their environmental conditions ( aldrich 1999 ) .
selective pressures for resistance groups are severe , as repressive authorities have consistent strat- egies to detect , infiltrate , and uproot clandestine networks ( sullivan 2016 ) .
these strategies depend on intelligence about where illicit activities take place .
given their isolated nature , minority groups are less likely to reveal this information thanmajority groups and are consequently less likely to see their mission interrupted by intelligence agents .
selective retention also am- plifies the overall segregation of clandestine organizations .
expansion of re-271 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology allcruitment outside the confines of an existing group is appealing to some be- cause it can enlarge an organization ’ s impact and scope , but networks that scale outward often create internal differences in ideology , strategy , or style in the process , triggering innate strife and increasing the demand for coor- dination.consequently , expansion reduces the likelihood that a rescue orga- nization can keep intelligence out of the hands of its much stronger opponent .
second , the importance of a minority position for clandestine collective action reveals itself to forward-looking organizers and recruits via an as- surance mechanism .
as followers embedded in minority groups are more willing to take on risks for group and leadership , rescuers recognize that clandestine coordination is possible within the confines of their enclave , something that is reinforced by the segregated structures that were already in place before thewar .
themere assurance that fellowswould cooperate in this way increases the overall motivation among group members to set up and engage in clandestine missions ( elster 1989 ) .
third , selectivity denotes the organizers ’ ability to distinguish individu- als who are valuable for complex collective action from those who are not ( marwell andoliver 1993 ) .
it is easier forminority organizers to acquire this internal intelligence .
in part , this ability derives from deep inside knowl- edge of the community .
because of the isolated nature of enclaves , minority organizers have larger networks that allow them to better tap into informa- tion flows , increasing the number of available signals with which they can recognize the preferences , trustworthiness , and capacities of fellow group members .
networks in which close primary relationships are provided in this way not only assure organizers about the feasibility of mobilization , they also produce an inventory of the different skills and resources available within the group , all of which could be accessed without having to leave the enclave of trust .
the network closure of minorities , as a result , cuts across individuals with different skill sets , allowing for coordinated action among trustworthy actors .
leadership plays a central role in two of the three mechanisms because it is centralized organizers who are ensured that mobilization is possible and identify the best recruits .
this does not imply , however , that the mecha- nisms are conditional on the existence of strong authority structures or for- mal hierarchies .
all that is necessary for these mechanisms to operate is the presence of one or two individualswho arewilling to take the first step in the mobilization process .
a large body of scholarship suggests that such orga- nizers exist even in the most egalitarian and antiauthoritarian communities ( swidler 1979 ) .
i return to this question in the conclusion , where i discuss several examples that indicate that the minority mechanisms also operate in organizations without authority .
this point is further reinforced by the following case studies that reveal how nonformal authorities often were the first movers in mobilizing communities.272 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
minorities and collective actiontwente twente was established as a unified political entity when the netherlands became part of the holy roman empire in 804.with an eye to existing tribal boundaries , charles the great turned the region into a separate shire that much later became part of the episcopal principality of utrecht .
under the rule of the bishop , the region became completely catholic , staying this way after the burgundian andhapsburg emperors took over .
this changedwhen a coalition of dutch merchants and calvinists staged a revolt against the catholic king of spain in 1555 .
the local elite in twente reluctantly joined the dutch revolt in order to maintain local privileges .
although , the whole of twente became part of thedutch republic in 1597 , a newwave of violence in 1605 split the region , which hadbeen unified formore than 600 years .
for a little more than 20 years , twente ’ s northwest remained dutch , while the re- gion ’ s southeast fell under spanish rule , until fieldmarshal casimir rejoined both parts within the dutch republic ( klokhuis 1982 ) .
this brief 20-year political split had a resounding and long-term impact on the religious composition of twente , amplified by the ongoing reforma- tion and counter-reformation .
while the northwest came to be dominated by protestants , the southeast remained acatholic stronghold ( fig .

american journal of sociology allthe divide : in the catholic south , protestants were able to penetrate with help from the federal government , while in the protestant north , catholic enclaves survived with help from coreligionists living in nearby germany .
under the influence of religious developments in nearby germany , the re- gion also became a hotbed of orthodox protestant movements , attracting followers dissatisfied with modernism in the mainstream protestant church throughout the 19th and 20th centuries ( demant 2015 ) .
the consequences of this religious history were still visible at the onset of the holocaust .
figure 2 shows the distribution of catholicism , protestant- ism , and orthodoxy in twente in 1942.3 as one can see , catholics were still dominant in the southeast , protestants dominated the northwest , and mi- nority enclaves of protestants and catholics existed on either side of the re- ligious fault line .
figure 2b reveals that both catholic and protestant parts of twente were home to numerous smaller orthodox protestant commu- nities .
figure 2c shows that in 1942 , right before the deportations began , al- most 3,000 jews were living across twente .
because jews resided in both catholic and protestant parts of twente , it is possible to compare rescue in both parts of the region.4 twente is unique for a second reason : with the exception of the 20 years of the counter-reformation , it has always been a unified administrative terri- tory .
religious differences notwithstanding , the region integrated econom- ically and politically under dutch rule .
because it was relatively isolated from the rest of the country , it independently developed a textile industry by relying on extensive cottage industry .
in 1830 , the dutch government des- ignated twente as the country ’ s textile center , reinforcing unity even more ( klokhuis 1982 ) .
the major religious divergence aside , this level of economic integration guaranteed that the region ’ s economic and political homogeneity was sus- tained .
this enables me to keep other factors that could potentially explain minority mobilization constant .
figure 3 compares newly digitalized census data for different religious groups living in the protestant and catholic parts oftwente in 1947 ( the year closest toworldwar ii forwhich subgroup-level data are available ) and jewish census data from early 1942 , right before the deportations started.thefigurepresentsdifference-in-means tests and accom- panying p-values for jews , protestants , orthodox protestants , and catho- lics living in catholic and protestant counties for a range of socioeconomic variables .

minorities and collective actionestants , or catholics residing in the northwest oftwentewere indeed roughly comparable to their counterparts in the southeast in terms of age , economic activity , and levels of integration .
statistical analysis elsewhere has revealed that jews and minorities were not more likely to live in proximity of each other , nor were they better integrated ( braun 2016 ) .5 the subnational focus ontwente has a third advantage in that it controls for potentially macrolevel confounding variables .
crucially , top-down en- forcement of mobilization between congregations is largely kept constant as protestant and catholic leaders in the netherlands protested anti-semitic legislation collaboratively , repeatedly , and consistently at the national level , providing allchristians , regardless of congregation or social position ( minority/ majority ) , with the same moral message of how german persecutions went against the tenets of their faiths ( croes and tammes 2004 ) .
in addition , mi- nority andmajority congregations inprotestant andcatholic parts oftwente were exposed to the same occupation regime and as a result faced similar lev- els of threat and repression.6qualitative analysis data although studying clandestine behavior is hard , twente offers a rich body of archival material with which to compare between ( 1 ) clandestine collec- tive action and nonmobilization and ( 2 ) successful and failed clandestine networks .
this allows us to assess overall differences in the mobilization ca- pacity of minority and majority groups .
hilbrink ( 1989 ) provides a comprehensive list of all recognized resistance fighters in the region .
using this list , it is possible to access a unique and un- derutilized collection of postwar testimonies that sheds light on successful resistance against genocide .
the collection consists of research done byfoun- dation 40/45 in light of an honorary pension program .
after the war , dutch citizens could request an additional state stipend if they could prove that they or a deceased immediate family member had extra expenses or suffered in- jury because of resistance activities .
sheltering jews was one of the activities that qualified as costly resistance .
after someone had filed a request , foun- dation 40/45 would start an investigation .
interviews with neighbors , relia- ble policemen , mayors , surviving jews , and other members of the resistance were conducted to assess the trustworthiness of the claimant ( cammaert 1994 ) .5 given the low number of observations , thep-values should be takenwith a grain of salt .
6 nazi reports also reveal that minority andmajority groups were not scrutinized more or less by security agencies ( braun , in press ) .

minorities and collective actiontestimonies from other resistance fighters prove particularly useful in re- constructing the social structure of clandestine organization , as almost all interviews started with a brief description of how the testifier and the claim- ant had come into contact with each other .
the files are stored by the social insurance bank and can be consulted in winschoten , a city in the north of the netherlands .
in total , i consulted 207 files that provided information on 53 rescue networks active in 21 of all 26 counties .
in total , eight of these 21 counties were catholic .

minorities and collective actionwere active in twente .
denouncing and arresting innocent jews is , of course , unconstitutional and was heavily persecuted after the war .
these were also crimes that were relatively easy to prove , as the nazis kept records of how they deployed dutch collaborators .
as a result , trials often provide informa- tion on jews that were arrested in hiding , enabling us to get information on failed resistance .
the trial documents also provide information on how the nazis tried to detect associates of captured individuals , granting some insight into how and why some networks failed .
these trial documents are stored in the national archives in the hague .
in order to compare successful mobilizationwith nonmobilization , i com- plement the two bodies of testimonies with diaries and existing interviews of people who decided not to save jews ( hilbrink 1989 ; van der boom 2012 ; demant 2015 ) .
these accounts shed light on obstacles to mobilization , which minority groups , according to the central hypothesis of this article , are better positioned to overcome .
the next section discusses the qualitative analysis .
i first detail the dilemma that clandestine organization posed for gentiles who sympathized with jews .
i then give a bird ’ s-eye view of all religious rescue operations intwente before providing more detailed cases of successful and unsuccessful mobilization for both protestant and catholic parts of twente .
these sections are organized around the three mechanisms of selective retention , organizer ’ s assurance , and organizer ’ s selectivity .
finally , the last subsection highlights the impor- tance of religious segregation for minority organizers and points out how reli- gious mixing undermined the minority advantage by reducing isolation.the clandestine collective action dilemma the wehrmacht invaded the low countries in 1940 .
during its first two years , the occupation regime slowly marginalized jews , before begin- ning deportations to the infamous extermination camps in eastern europe ( croes and tammes 2004 ) .
how did individual christians respond to the jewish persecutions ?
if nascent resistance fighters were indeed facing a clan- destine collective action dilemma , wewould expect that a lot of peoplewilling to rescue refrained from doing so out of fear .
indeed , diaries paint such a pic- ture .
partly under the influence of religious leaders who repeatedly protested thenazis , the overall attitude ofchristians intwentewas pro-jewish and anti- german .
sjouke wynia from denekamp remembered his father being furi- ous when their jewish neighbors had to leave their house ( demant 2015 , p. 139 ) .willemdingelheim , also fromdenekamp , wrote in his diary that “ ev- eryone was heartbroken ” because of the “ undefinable suffering of the jews. ” several high school headmasters in the twente area were seen crying when explaining to their pupils that their jewish classmates and teacher were no279 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology alllonger allowed to attend their institution .
the diary of the head of the jewish council ofenschede confirms that the general population resented the depor- tations ( demant 2015 , p. 139 ) .
postwar interviews with both jews and gentiles in twente indicate that sympathy had translated into small-scale help for jews before the roundups started.when jewswere no longer allowed to buy groceries in regular stores , a shop owner in haaksbergen provided food to former jewish customers for free under the counter .
in enschede , gentiles secretly bought groceries for jews living in their street ( demant 2015 , p. 134 ) .
other neighbors helped to soften financial strain by lending money or providing employment ( geritz- koster 1999 ) .
it has been argued that in enschede jews and gentiles grew closer to each other than ever before during the early years of the war ( de- mant 2015 ) .
on occasion , gentiles even displayed public support for their persecuted neighbors .
in both almelo as enschede , groups of gentiles ac- tively protested the introduction of the jewish star by wearing one them- selves .
this open form of resistance was short-lived , however , and ended when the police started arresting participants ( demant 2015 ) .
these relatively low-risk activities notwithstanding , large-scale clandes- tine protection of jews was rare .
risk perceptions formed an important im- pediment to this form of resistance .
after observing jewish mothers asking gentiles to save their children , a bystander wrote in her diary : “ who has the courage to do that ?
it is not allowed .
you will undergo the same fate. ” the clandestine nature of the operation was deemed particularly challenging : “ how on earth could you hide five grown-ups , three children , ” a woman wrote after hearing about the arrest of a jewish family that had gone into hiding to avoid deportation ( van der boom 2012 , p. 244 ) .
gentiles , al- though outraged by what happened to the jews , also recognized that protect- ing jews was difficult and risky .
when responding to the question whether he ever considered sheltering jews , benno van delden from enschede said : “ no never .
.
.
.
the ss , the camps , firing squads , torture and all that misery .
you had to be very strong to shelter someone ” ( demant 2015 , p. 141 ) .
fear and uncertainty resulted in an overall feeling of helplessness .
one diary , for instance , characterized the first roundups as “ systematic elimina- tion against which we could not do anything. ” trying to capture the overall mental state of bystanders , a female witness to an early roundup wrote : “ everyone was deeply moved .
outraged out of pure powerlessness ” ( van der boom 2012 , p. 244 ) .
that the risks involved made it hard for people to imagine any form of organized solidarity with jews is revealed in the fol- lowing statement by a nonrescuer : “ i am willing to go to jail for my convic- tions .
it would have an enormous impact if everyone was willing to do this , but this is not the case .
.
.
.
it is hard to know what to do ” ( p. 244 ) .
another diary similarly shows that the prospect of punishment created passivity among dutch citizens : “ we poor christians could not do anything but fol-280 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
minorities and collective actionlow lukas 22:53 .
follow from afar that is our fate and cross .
let ’ s hope our sympathy can revitalize jews ” ( p. 244 ) .
it is of course possible that gentiles were trying to find easy excuses to le- gitimate their passive behavior .
however , testimonies from twente ’ s jew- ish population suggest that the feelings of powerlessness were justifiable .
in interviews conducted by social scientist demant during the early 2000s , sev- eral survivors asked themselves what they would they have done as gen- tiles and concluded that passivity was a normal response in times of hard- ship and threat ( 2015 , p. 183 ) .
after studying testimonies of successful protection networks , it is not hard to understand where feelings of powerlessness among gentiles came from .
successful rescue organizations had to supply jews with fake identi- fications papers , rationing cards , produce , clothes , information about up- coming roundups , medical care , funeral services , marriage counseling , psy- chological treatment , safe houses , ability to travel , communication lines , and , most important , numerous hiding places , as few rescuerswere able to provide shelter for a long period of time.8 even thoughmost christianswere outraged by anti-jewish legislation , they recognized that they could not simply engage in clandestine collective action because it was too dangerous .
yet , as i will show in the next section , being embedded in a minority congregation in- creased the impact an outraged citizen could have on evasion by reducing both the actual and perceived danger.the minority advantage the central hypothesis of this article is thatminority groups are better able to overcome the clandestine collective action dilemma outlined in the previous section .
to assess this systematically , i have coded all rescue groups active in twente that could be found in the files of foundation 40/45 .
i marked all groups that sheltered at least one jew who survived world war ii as suc- cessful and groups that mobilized but were not able to successfully shelter a single jew as unsuccessful and dismantled.9 i code a network as religious if it was set up by a religious leader such as a reverend , priest , chaplain , re-8 on funeral services andmarriage counseling , respectively , see sociale verzekeringsbank ( svb ) file 23 and svb file 8 , docdirect , winschoten ; psychological treatment , yad vashem file l. gerritsen in michman et al .
( 2004 ) ; and communication lines , dagboek douwes , netherlands institute for war documentation ( niod ) 244 1065 , amsterdam .
9 this is a crude operationalization strategy that does not allowme to capture partial dis- mantling of networks .
as i have no exact information on the number of sheltered jews who survived and got arrested per network , more fine-grained measurement is impossi- ble .
however , the following case studies and quantitative analysis suggest that minority status affects infiltration and dismantling more broadly .

american journal of sociology allligious schoolteacher , or politician active in a religious party .
using the de- nomination of the religious leaders active in the organization , i determined the denominational color of the organization .
if theminority hypothesis holds , we would expect protestant networks to be most successful in the catholic southeast , catholic networks to be most successful in the protestant north- west , and orthodox protestant groups to be successful throughout twente .
successful networks are depicted in figure 4 and are largely in linewith the minority hypothesis .
all but two of the eight protestant rescue organizations were active in areas dominated by catholics .
when we look at catholic net- works , we see a similar picture with only two of the 15 successful movements operating in catholic territory.10 orthodox protestant protection of jews emerged in both catholic and mainstream protestant areas .
this is in line with our theory , as the orthodox formed minority communities everywhere .
figure 4c displays the five unsuccessful networks that could be found in the files .
as we can see , all of these networks are connected to majority con- gregations.11 overall , this spatial pattern suggests that minority networks were better able to produce and sustain successful rescue operations , while attempts of majority groups were more likely to fail.assurance why were minorities better at producing clandestine collective action ?
in a postwar interview , catholic chaplain visser , who was active in the pre- dominantly protestant town of wierden , explicitly talks about the impor- tance of minority isolation in assuring him that mobilization was possible .
acting out of sympathy for those in need , he knew he could always rely on specific local catholic farmers to help with providing food and shelter .
in turn , farmers blindly trusted their catholic front man and were suspicious of everyone outside of their religious enclave .
religious segregationswere so strong that catholics even went to the chaplain and local catholic head- master for medical advice because they refused to listen to the local doctor , who happened to be protestant .
exploiting the commitment of his followers , visser purposively created an isolated organization to reduce exposure .
he built his rescue network around people he could trust and ignored contacts outside of his own congregation : “ i always wanted to stay independent .
no-10 these four majority networks emerged in tiny villages or were inspired by interregional movement entrepreneurs , suggesting that geographical isolation and external efforts can compensate for a lack of minority secrecy ( gould 1995 ) .
11 because of the lenient criterion for success ( one jewish survivor ) , only five networks failed according to my coding .
relaxing this criterion is hard to do with the current data .
however , the case studies below reveal that selective retention played an important role in producing resistance within isolated hubs of commitment .

minorities and collective actionbody outside my parish knew what i was doing .
.
.
.
my own people knew but they kept quiet ” ( hilbrink 1989 , p. 323 ) .
in protestant enschede , chaplain van der brink told a similar story of how minority isolation enabled clandestine mobilization by assuring both secrecy and commitment .
already before the war , van der brink ’ s church had successfully summoned catholics to leave the dutch nazi party.when the deportations started , he convinced catholic police officers to refuse co- operation with anti-semitic legislation .
inspired by his brother , who pro- vided himwith illegal newspapers , fake identity papers , and food vouchers , he set up an underground network with the help of parish members and po- lice officers .
hewas able to find several shelters for jews amongmembers of his community after temporarily hiding them in presbyteries .
catholic boy scouts were used as couriers , while funding for his organization was ob- tained from businessmen in the parish .
in advance of roundups , a local po- lice officer would post a warning note on the doors of the catholic church ( bekkenkamp 2000 ) .
all contacts ran via the presbyteries to maintain the exclusively catholic character of the operation .
similar to what we saw in wierden , the chaplain of enschede never forayed outside his parish in order to reduce exposure , noting “ within your own parish you knew whom to ap- proach for help .
those people will not let you down. ” 12selective retention compared to their counterparts in minority enclaves , majority leaders were less successful in creating and sustaining clandestine organizations .
their attempts to set up coordinated resistance along lines of trust often got dis- rupted because of early denunciations by uncommitted parish members .
as a result , retention of their rescue organizations was less likely ( aldrich 1999 ) .
this reinforced the minority advantage in clandestine collective action .
to illustrate , it is instructive to compare the trajectory of enschede rev- erends leendert overduin and nanne zwiep .
until 1926 their careers fol- lowed a similar path .
both men received their religious education at elite universities and aimed to become ministers in the mainstream dutch re- formed church .
but whereas zwiep had led dutch reformed congrega- tions in northern parts of the country before coming to enschede , overduin had decided to switch to theminuscule andmore orthodoxreformedchurch in restored dependency that was founded in 1926 after an intense scriptural debate about whether adam was able to hear the snake in the garden of eden talk .
their doctrinal differences notwithstanding , the two men came together with other religious leaders in september 1941 to file a complaint against early12 interview , kapelaan van der brink , niod .

minorities and collective actiondeportations of jews with the local authorities .
on multiple occasions zwiep and overduin gave anti-nazi sermons in which they denounced anti-jewish legislation and tried to convince people to resist ( bekkenkamp 2000 ) .
but de- spite these similar actions , their fates diverged dramatically on april 20 , 1941 .
whereas zwiep was arrested and died in dachau , overduin became the or- ganizer of one of the most successful rescue networks in the country .
what explains this difference ?
overduin ’ s congregation consisted of fewer than 50 souls , all of whom he knew personally .
his sermons were only heard by loyal people he could trust .
zwiep , however , lectured in themain church of enschede and sometimes drew crowds of around 500 people , some of whom hadnever seen each other .
zwiepwas cautioned numerous times and asked to tone it down : “ reverend watch out , they are watching you !
your enemies do not sleep .
they will be in the church this very morning ” ( dewolf 1947 , p .7 ) .
his sacristan told him he had seen the organist , whose son was a nazi , take notes while zwiep was preaching ( bekkenkamp 2000 ) .
while an undedicated member of his congregation denounced zwiep , overduin was able to exploit the dense networks of his community to save over 700 jews .
his organization could grow rapidly , as his followers “ always said yes ” and he knew exactly whom to trust .
much like zwiep , his followersfig .
4.—rescue networks in twente : a , roman catholic and protestant networks ; b , orthodox protestant networks ; c , failed networks.285 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology allwere often driven by “ the desire to help those in danger ” and the command- ment to love thy neighbor.13 dressed up as a baker or chimney sweeper , he traveled between different members of his organization hiding secret doc- uments in his umbrella ( weustink 1985 ) .
the core of this organization con- sisted of 20 operatives , most of whomwere recruited from the tiny reformed church in restored dependency.14 fromwithin his parish , overduinwas able to recruit helperswith diverse skill sets .
one of his main assistants , the head of the church ’ s council of al- dermen , was employed in a wood factory and could therefore provide both the resources and skills to build secret hideouts and storage rooms in homes .
other members of his parish were painters who helped to camouflage shel- ters , typographers who delivered paperwork , and a graphic specialist who forged documents.15 contrary to overduin and in a similar vein as mainstream protestant zwiep , thedutchmajorityreverendsvangelder fromsteenwijk , vanstaaij from wierden , le roy from almelo , and de geus from almelo were all ar- rested early on while mobilizing their congregations because their activities became exposed by disloyal adherents ( hovingh 2015 ) .
degeus illustrates the dangers a religious leader faced whenmoving from aminority tomajority community , revealing that the selective retentionmech- anism was more important than individual organizing skills .
before coming to almelo , degeuswas at the helm of a small dutch reformed congregation in the catholic town of beuningen , near nijmegen .
within this enclave he forcefully and freely preached against the nazis without any repercussions .
despite numerous warnings from within his congregation , he continued his anti-nazi tirades when he was transferred to protestant almelo in 1940 .
“ if church and christ no longer tell the truth no one will ” ( touw 1946 , p. 620 ) wasdegeus ’ s responsewhen his closest followers tried to caution him .
in line with the fears of congregation members , de geus was apprehended by the nazi security police when they found out he had distributed pro-jewish texts among his followers in january 1942 ( touw 1946 ) .
selective retention also operated in the catholic southeast .
before the ger- man invasion , pastor stokman from oldenzaal worked with the catholic mayor to help jewish refugees from germany .
he called on his followers to open their houses for those fleeing anti-semitic legislation and convinced both the local franciscan monastery and parish house to set up emergency kitch-13 yad vashem file a .

minorities and collective actionens .
numerous followers answered his requests .
a roman catholic cinema owner even made one of his theater rooms available as a shelter .
of course , stokman had to abandon his open help to jewish refugees when the germans took over the country .
instead , he shifted his focus to a more covert operation.he tried tomobilize people he knew from thecatholic labor union to help jews and to distribute anti-nazi pamphlets .
unfortunately , he failed miserably , as his activities became known to the nazis within weeks .
one of his followers had leaked information .
already in 1940 , two years be- fore themajor deportations started , he had to fleeoldenzaal .
his partner , the mayor , was imprisoned .
despite the revealed preference for resistance , no catholic rescue network filled the void left by stokman ’ s departure ( weus- tink 1985 ) .organizer ’ s selectivity close inspection of rescue operations a few miles outside of twente suggests that a minority shell also made it easier for religious leaders to recognize and recruit committedmembers .
theroukema familywas part of the tightly knit vrijgemaakten church , within which there “ were no social boundaries. ” al- though they were not particularly interested in politics , they listened to the sermons of themilitant reverendklaas schilder who called on true believers to step up against anti-jewish policies during the early years of the war .
the oldest roukema son , gijs , was motivated by schilder ’ s words : “ he encour- aged us to stop talking and resist forcefully.out of the emergency shelter , into your uniform ” ( hilbrink 1998 , 96–98 ) .
the leadership of the vrijgemaakten church was soon made aware of gijs ’ s attitudes toward the germans .
a local pastor happened to be in the roukema residence when gijs openly expressed how excited he was about the foresight of resistance .
not much later , another reverend visited the family .
he knew the family because roukema senior had been his school- teacher , and he had heard about gijs ’ s defiance toward the germans .
the pastor approached gijs to become his assistant in an illegal rescue organiza- tion that helped hundreds of jews by the end of the war .
not far fromwhere the roukemas lived , youngster spanhaak also got in- spired by one of his religious leaders : horreeus de haas .
in debates with national socialist leader antonmussert , dehaas attacked the anti-semitic foundations of the dutch nazi party .
when he lost his job , spanhaak was committed to do something about german policies .
as a mainstream prot- estant , however , he was unaware of the activities being undertaken by the nearby minority enclave of the vrijgemaakten church until much later .
al- thoughwilling to participate , he always remained “ an outsider ” to the better organized clandestine resistance networks of the small orthodox community287 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am all use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
american journal of sociology alla fewblocks away and , as a result , was never able to fully engage in organized resistance ( hilbrink 1998 ) .
as the comparison between gijs roukema and spanhaak illustrates , be- ing a member of a minority congregation conditioned the impact that a mo- tivated rescuer could have on the fate of jews because individuals were de- pendent on leadership and organization to make a difference .
compared to their majority counterparts , minority leaders had the advantage of organiz- er ’ s selectivity ; that is , they were more likely to recognize committed recruits and incorporate them in rescue operations ( marwell and oliver 1993 ) .
the reverse also happened .
sometimesminority leaders could exploit their local intelligence to determine who was not suited for clandestine work .
in goor , for instance , church chaplains refused to include one of their parish- ioners into their rescue operations .
as it turns out , this was a wise idea .
the devote catholic was somewhat delusional , thinking he could single-handedly win the war by physically besieging city hall.16 not being embedded in a community of dedicated fellows not only ham- pered secrecy ; it also made it hard to solve complex problems , such as find- ing enough financial resources .
the nervous diary entry of jewish theresa wertheim , who decided to go underground in enschede but was not helped by a minority congregation , is emblematic : “ when does the misery finally stop ?
two or three months at most and our money will be gone .
.
.
.
we are starting to get worried .
soon we will run out of money .
then what will happen ? ” 17 minorities , however , were able to find financial resources because leaders had enough intelligence to selectively recruit actors with a wide range of skills who were willing to support their cause .
when discussing the rescue activities of catholic chaplain van der brink , we already saw that minor- ity leaders were able to mobilize funds from rich and committed parish members to overcome the problem thattheresawertheimwas facing .
some- times , however , the coordination of different skill sets was so strong that it simply solved financial problems by turning a rescue operation into little au- tarchic firms in which jewish fugitives provided labor .
in nijverdal , an or- thodox reverend brought together the owner of a fabric store , a baker , and a group of farmers , some of whom already knew each other from the ortho- dox school , the church , or choir.18 the baker provided food for jews , who in turn made bags out of straw provided by the farmers .
the straw bags were then sold by the shopkeeper who used themoney to pay for food .
as a result , 90 jews were rescued without outside money.1916 svb file 40 , docdirect , winschoten .

minorities and collective actionminority networks in which close social relationships abound , thus , not only embed rescue organizers in hubs of commitment but also create an in- ventory of different skills and resources available within the confines of trusted enclaves .
in this way , the network closure of minorities cut across individuals with different skill sets , allowing for coordinated solutions to complex problems while minimizing risks of defection.segregation and mixing one striking feature of both catholic and protestant rescue operations was that they tended to be completely segregated by denomination .
despite co- operation among religious leaders at the national level , local clandestine networks simply reproduced the structure of dutch society .
as prewar reli- gious networks were completely separated at a local level , recruitment of participants was almost automatically contained within one congregation .
a baker ’ s son from nijverdal who mobilized rescuers explains this general pattern quite straightforwardly : “ we were orthodox , hence so were our friends and customers .
so these were the people where you brought [ jewish ] children .
.
.
.
this way i placed ten jews. ” 20 mutual distrust and ignorance between different religious groups rein- forced network segregation .
protestants either did not know or refused to accept that catholics were effective organizers of rescue operations .
despite the fact that the aforementioned catholic chaplain van der brink from enschede was able to run a rescue operation that sheltered almost 500 in- dividuals , some protestants still considered him a sloppy and indiscrete daredevil who lacked organizational skills .
the leader of a protestant group in hengelo even claimed that catholics in general were nothing more than passive bystanders who were either cowards or pro-german.21 fewwere as extreme as orthodox leader johannes ter horst , who repeatedly expressed his contempt for people from different backgrounds .
he went as far as to say he would shoot members of another denomination if he would run into them during a secret operation ( hilbrink 1989 , p. 78 ) .
stereotypes also permeated catholic society .
members of catholic net- works in twente used the pejorative term “ reverend ’ s clique ” to allude to the passiveness and insolence of orthodox protestants .
mutual disrespect was equally widespread .
on the rare occasion that actors from different de- nominations did come together , catholics got annoyed by the fact that prot- estants always had to start every communication with prayer ( hilbrink 1989 ) .20 interview flim , archive flim niod 471 13c .

american journal of sociology allinherited mistrust could even trump proven dedication to the illegal cause .
in catholic borne , a member of the majority church volunteered to join a protestant resistance organization after he had helped one of its lead- ers escape fromagerman security official .
despite the risks the boy had taken to save the life of one of its coremembers , the protestant organization refused his further services because he was considered “ too loose ” by the protestant community .
ironically , his reputation was partly created by his mother , who spread negative rumors about him because she wanted to sabotage his rela- tionshipwith a protestant girl he had recently started dating .
as a goodcath- olic , she could not approve of this relationship.22 actors aiming to bridge social divides were seen as intruders by other re- sistance fighters .
in almelo , a social democrat decided to join an orthodox group in 1943 .
despite the fact that he had already proven to be a dedicated resistance worker on his own , it did not work at all .
other orthodox prot- estants found it difficult to cooperate with him and looked at the outsider with contempt .
on more than one occasion they tried to get rid of him early on by providing misinformation about future meetings and activities .
a year after he joined the organization , he was arrested.23 as emerged out of the stories of chaplains van der brink and visser , re- ligious leaders often actively guarded the boundaries of their group .
in a similar vein , leendert overduin , the reverend of the tiny reformed church in restored dependency in enschede , also made sure his networks did not interfere with the activities of other groups beyond what was strictly neces- sary .
overduin was infuriated when he found out that one of the families in his network had recently started to house a resistance fighter andmember of a different network who was on a mission to kill a local collaborator .
overduin did everything in his power to prevent the murder from happen- ing and had the resistance member removed from the household ( weus- tink 1985 ) .
repeatedly , overduin had arguments with secular rescuer tusveld about who should take care of specific jews .
overduin did not trust tusveld , and the men refused to cooperate with each other , despite the fact that they were sheltering members of the same family ( bekkenkamp 2000 ) .24 one of over- duin ’ s closest accomplices commented that “ you got reprimanded ” by over- duin if a rescuer engaged in other resistance activities and networks.25 in an extreme case , arguments over segregation even created a rupture within organizations .
in catholic oldenzaal , a protestant rescue mission led by political party leaders van der v. and p. operated at the margins be-22 svb file 52 , docdirect , winschoten .

vanderv .
tried to circumvent this problem by coopting a few catholic helpers from outside his trusted circle in the orga- nization .
p. was outraged when he found out about this and immediately decided to split off from the already minuscule organization .
after the war , it was discovered that the two catholic recruits were actually traitors.26 several other cases reveal that minority leaders had good reason to be concerned about religious mixing , as it often undermined their clandestine mobilization advantage by increasing exposure .
when information left the confines of the minority enclave , coordination problems emerged and denun- ciation became more likely .
for example , when a rescue network emerged within the confines of a catholic minority community in almelo , it expanded outward quite suddenly .
this turned out to have dramatic consequences for the movement .
take , for example , the catholic boy scout leader van hessen who initi- ated the movement ; secrecy was of the utmost importance .
he even refused to tell his own brother the exact details of his activities .
after a while , how- ever , his friend buiter became less careful and started to recruit outside of van hessen ’ s network , feeling that the catholic enclave was too small for his ambitions .
the resulting inclusion of people from different backgrounds caused internal conflict about what strategy to pursue and , eventually , be- came buiter ’ s downfall , at least according to van hessen : “ in the begin- ning , he [ buiter ] relied heavily on my contacts to build up a resistance net- work .
soon , however he seemed to know more people than i did .
he even forged a link between our group and the lo [ protestant ] .
soon after , the network was betrayed and infiltrated by a v-man [ nazi spy ] . ” 27 together with protestant organizers , several members of the originally catholic move- ment , including buiter , were arrested .
before the arrest , numerous people had already warned buiter that the movement was becoming too visible ( hilbrink 1989 ) .
after this partial dismantling of the network , van hessen moved back to a more segregated setup , which in his own view was safer : “ we decided to go fully underground again .
shield the organization from the outside world to make it harder to penetrate by outsiders .
create a more camouflaged and fragmented organization. ” 28 the story of buiter and van hessen is emblematic of numerous cases in which crossing religious boundaries resulted in operational failure of whole rescue missions .
mixing , however , could also affect the success rate within the same rescue operation .
in catholic borne , an anonymous protestant minister encouraged at least two families within his parish to shelter jews.2926 svb files 50 and 33 , docdirect , winschoten .

american journal of sociology allwhereas the first worked in isolation and was able to keep jews under- ground despite several searches , the second failed to do so.30 the head of the second household was arrested during a meeting with socialist and catholic resistance workers .
the meeting was set up to resolve disagree- ments about the distribution of food coupons between different factions within the network.31 all but one of the attendees was arrested ( hilbrink 1989 ) .
all these examples reveal how selective retention amplifies the overall segregation of clandestine organizations .
expansion of recruitment outside the confines of existing groups was appealing to some , as it could enlarge an organizations ’ impact and scope .
unfortunately , networks that scaled out- ward often created internal differences in ideology , strategy , or style .
this triggered innate strife and , in turn , increased the demand for coordination , reducing the likelihood that a rescue organization could keep intelligence out of the hands of its much stronger opponent .
whereas assurance and organizer ’ s selectivity both enhance minorities ’ capacity to produce clandestine networks , the selective retention mecha- nism guarantees that minorities are also better at preventing detection .
on the basis of this , we can derive two hypotheses that will be tested with quan- titative data in the next section : hypothesis 1.—minority communities are more likely to produce rescue operations for jews .
hypothesis 2.—once mobilized , minority communities are less likely to suffer from arrests.quantitative analysis to establish whether the minority advantage also operates outside of the borders of twente , i use data on the location , religion , and detention of 1,013dutch rescuers throughout thenetherlands provided byyadvashem ( michman et al .
2004 ) to statistically analyze whether minority groups were indeed both more likely to mobilize and less likely to get arrested when they did .
although these data are less refined and less complete than the data presented in the previous section , they do allow us to assess whether the les- sons drawn from the twente case travel beyond its borders .
as a first cut at the data , i divided the netherlands into municipalities dominated by prot- estants and those dominated by catholics .
i then counted the number of dutch reformed rescuers in the latter half as well as the number of catholic rescuers in the former half and added the number of rescuers belonging to30 svb file 30 , docdirect , winschoten .

minorities and collective actionorthodox protestant denominations .
this sum was then divided by the to- tal number of rescuers for whom their religion was known .
the results are presented in figure 5 .
according to this coding scheme , 26.6 % of the general population would belong to a minority congregation .
overall , postwar tes- timonies seem to confirm that minority groups were more likely to rescue jews .
of all the rescuers commemorated by yad vashem ( michman et al .
2004 ) , 62 % belonged to a minority church .
the data have serious limita- tions , as yad vashem only recognizes altruistic rescue and ignores rescue provided out of financial or personal motives .
therefore , i conducted a sim- ilar analysis using survey data collected among jewish survivors ( evers- emden and flim 1996 ) .
a similar picture emerges : of the 226 rescuers whose religion is known , 61 % adhered to aminority religion .
aswe can see , the per- centage of minority rescuers is very close in both data sets , giving us some confidence that measurement is valid .
it is of course possible that geographical difference and other omitted var- iables might be driving this result .
in particular , it is plausible that instead of the minority status that is based on relative size , it is absolute group size that causesmobilization .
smaller groups have an advantage inmobilization because contributions aremore likely tomake a difference , and they are eas- ier to monitor ( olson 1965 ) .
therefore , i also analyzed the yad vashem data in a multivariate framework keeping geographical factors and abso- lute size constant.32 imatchedyadvashem–recognized rescuers to all cath- olic , mainstream protestant , and orthodox protestant communities that ex- isted in the netherlands in 1930 ( central bureau for statistics 1931 census ) .
this results in a database of 2,883 religious communities nested in 1,027 counties for which we know how many rescues took place according to yad vashem .
if the minority hypothesis holds , we would expect catholic communities to be more likely to produce rescuers in protestant parts of the country , protestant communities to produce more rescuers in catholic parts of the country , and orthodox communities to be more likely to rescue everywhere .
to capture this minority effect , i interact whether a commu- nity is catholic with the percentage of catholic christians in amunicipality .
the logic behind this is that catholics should be more likely to rescue in ar- eas where relatively few catholics live but less likely to rescue in areas where catholicism is widespread because they are no longer a minority.33 i control for logged group size to disentangle the minority effect from small32 i prefer to use the yad vashem files over the survey data , as the former have a broader coverage providing more opportunities to keep geographical factors constant .
analysis based on the survey data is consistent with the results presented below .
33 this strategy tests the minority argument for catholics and mainstream protestants in one model , as catholics are not mainstream protestants and vice versa .

minorities and collective actiongroup effects .
results of the analyses , with municipality clustered standard errors and population weights , are presented in table 1 .
model 1 looks at the percentage of rescuers for each religious community , while model 2 looks at whether at least one rescuer was active in a commu- nity .
in line with theminority hypothesis , the effect of catholicism on rescue is conditional on the overall strength of catholicism in the region , regard- less of what outcome variable is chosen .
since interaction effects are some- what hard to interpret , the model is visualized in figure 6 .
as we can see in figure 6b , catholics are 50 % more likely to produce networks of assistance to jews in protestant areas , while the same is true for protestants in catholic areas ( see also fig .
7 ) .
figure 8 reveals that orthodox groups , the smallest congregation everywhere , are about 12 % more likely to stage rescue opera- tions .
the third model shows that the results are robust to the inclusion of municipality-level fixed effects , suggesting that the minority effects are not driven by local-level omitted-variable bias .
the case study of twente shows that minority networks were also less likely to be exposed and uprooted .
using yad vashem files , it is possible to retrieve whether rescuers were arrested , which can be used as a proxy for ex- posure .
again , the effect of catholicism on getting arrested is conditional ontable 1 religious communities and rescue of jews , 1940–45 % rescue rescue yes/no % rescue model 1 : ols model 2 : logit model 3 : ols catholic community .

minorities and collective actionthe overall religious environment .
as we can see in figure 7b , catholics en- gaged in rescue operations in protestant parts of the netherlands were more than 20 % less likely to get arrested than their protestant counterparts .
this effect reverses in areas dominated by catholics , where mainstream protes- tant clerics were almost 10 % less likely to get arrested .
figure 8 reveals that orthodox protestant clerics were about 8 % less likely to get arrested overall .
the effects become more pronounced when municipality-level fixed effects are included , suggesting that the minority argument is not likely to be con- founded by local geographical factors ( see table 2 ) .
yad vashem files are based on testimonies of jewish survivors and are therefore likely to capture successful mobilization missing large numbers of exposed networks .
this truncates the sample and could potentially bias the results .
retrieving religious information from all arrested rescuers in the country is probably impossible .
as another test , i focus on a important sub- set of rescuers for which denominational information is easy to obtain : cler- ics .
the case study above revealed that clerics frequently played a role in rescue operations .
it is therefore reasonable to assume that arrests of clerics provide some insight into the overall exposure rate of religious groups .

american journal of sociology allhave constructed a database of 405 clerics from 200 municipalities who en- gaged in rescue operations throughout the county , by combining informa- tion on successful attempts culled from the already used yad vashem files ( michman et al .
2004 ) , with unsuccessful attempts obtained from religious commemoration books ( hamans 2008 ; hovingh 2015 ) .
this allows me to compare arrests rates between majority and majority clerics .
figure 7c vi- sualizes the results .
in line with what we saw for rescuers in the yad vashem files alone , ro- mancatholic clerics active in protestant areasweremore than 60 % less likely to get apprehended by security forces , while protestants were 26 % less likely to be exposed in catholic areas .
orthodox protestants were 17 % less likely to be arrested throughout the country .
focusing on clerics reduces the number of observations and , as a result , variationwithinmunicipalities .
thismakes it impossible to include fine-grained fixed effects .
nevertheless , taken together these analyses provide compelling support for the minority analysis in sug- gesting that in the protestant parts of the netherlands , catholics were more likely to produce successful rescue operations that were less likely to be ex- posed , while the same is true for protestant communities in catholic parts of the country.discussion and conclusion this article shows that local minority groups are better at producing and sustaining clandestine operations .
because they form isolated hubs of commitment , minority enclaves can mobilize while reducing exposure to uncommitted outsiders , thereby overcoming the clandestine collective ac- tion dilemma .
studying the protection of jews in the netherlands provides a unique opportunity to substantiate this thesis .
still , it is plausible that the clandestine capacity of minorities is conditional on the associational seg- mentation , overall levels of opposition to foreign occupation , pluralism , open and cooperative protests by national elites , or the highly centralized nature of religious communities that characterized dutch society during the war .
to explore whether these conditions somehow delimit the importance of minority mobilization , making my finding unique to the netherlands , i turn to yad vashem testimonies of 6,407 religious rescuers during the holocaust living in 20 countries with different political and religious traditions .
i divide the share of minority rescuers in the body of testimonies by the percentage of minority believers in a particular country , to assess whether religious minor- ities were under- or overrepresented among rescuers .
an overview of these ratios is presented in figure 9 .
as we can see , religious minorities are overrep- resented among clandestine rescuers in both majority catholic and protes- tant countries , including countries with limited religious segmentation ( e.g. , france ) , where resistance was rare ( e.g. , italy ) , where national leaders did300 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .

american journal of sociology allnot protest ( e.g. , belgium ) , and that were not occupied ( i.e. , germany ) .
more- over , minority mobilization not only emerged in more formally centralized protestant andcatholic congregations but also within communities that lack formal hierarchies such as thequakers in germany and france , seventhday adventists in the ukraine , or pentecostals in russia , suggesting that minority capacity accommodates different forms of formal authority .
although minorities are overrepresented among clandestine rescuers al- most everywhere , the theory does not seem to travel to places where rescue missionswere highly individualized , such as poland andlithuania , or where the persecuting regime permitted national elites to openly cooperate with leaders of majority congregations to resist the nazi occupation in general , suchas indenmark .
in otherwords , the theorydoesnotwork incases inwhich rescue was neither collective nor clandestine ( braun , in press ) .
the overall prevalence of religious minority mobilization throughout eu- rope forces us to rethink the relationship between religion and theholocaust , which often gets analyzed as a function of doctrine .
for catholics , it has been argued that their religion reduced solidaritywith jews because of its reaction- ary tendencies and the traditional jewish-christian schism.orthodox protes- tantism has been linked to fascism , as it hinges on biblical racism , while others claim that orthodox protestants were willing to defy german author- ities because of their individualistic traditions and emphasis on the old tes- tament , in which the jews were depicted as the chosen people .
the opposite has been said about lutherans who , the conventional wisdom goes , blindly accepted any form of secular political authority in line with their religion ( moore 2010 ) .
this analysis reveals that it is not doctrine , dogma , or religious identity that drives religious resistance .
instead , i draw attention to the social position of religious communities and its subsequent network effects .
this in turn raises the question whether we are observing a distinctively religious phenomenon .
it is possible that religious minority status during worldwar ii in the netherlands provided a concrete research site through which the relationship between organized minority status and clandestine mobilization could be studied ( guhin 2014 ) .
but , religion ’ s strong organiza- tional infrastructure and defining powers might make it more robust in the creation of undergroundmovements than other social categories ( brubaker 2015 ) .
the twente data speak directly to this question .
although 49 out of the 58 rescue networks could be classified as religious , secular networks did also play an important role .
with the exception of a network run by a no- bleman who housed jews on his estate and another for which the actual or- ganizational base could not be identified , secular groups protecting jews in twente all had a radical left profile .
as in most of western europe , commu- nists and radical left-wing organizations in thenetherlandswere political out- casts .
much like members of minority congregations , several prominent com- munist resistance workers active in twente were therefore expelled from302 this content downloaded from 128.250.144.144 on august 07 , 2019 07:18:56 am use subject to university of chicago press terms and conditions ( http : //www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c ) .
minorities and collective actionmainstream organizations and had to pay the costs for their revolutionary ide- als and formed isolated hubs.34 these extreme-left hubs translated into rescue organizations invriezenveen , almelo , hengelo , andenschede ( hilbrink 1989 ) .
outside of the netherlands , ethnic minorities played an important role in clandestine protection to jews .
most notably , poles , often lamented for not doing enough for the jews in their own country , came to the rescue of jews in the ukraine where they formed an ethnic enclave ( arad 2009 ) , again con- firming the notion that a formal ( church ) hierarchy was not necessary to ac- tivate minority mechanisms .
moving beyond protection networks for jews , an abundance of anecdotal evidence suggests that minorities provide the clandestine backbone for revo- lutions and insurgencies across time and space .
for centuries , rebellions and revolutions in china have been facilitated by buddhist groups , such as the white lotus society ( perry 1976 ) , while lollard enclaves , millenarian sects , and ethnic communes have played the same role in western europe as well as in latin america ( engels 1967 ; hobsbawm 1971 ) .
together , this supports smelser ’ s ( 1962 ) claim that minority groups often form the secretive linchpin of major social transformations .
the importance of quakers , methodists , and immigrant groups for the underground railroad ( foner 2015 ) , ethnic minorities ’ role in criminal networks ( light 1977 ) , and the overrepresentation of sects and immigrants among terrorist groups ( berman 2011 ; sageman 2011 ) all draw attention to the fact that extremely centralized and “ leaderless ” minorities alike have an advantage in maintaining clandestine operations .
this does not imply that my theory travels everywhere .
it is important to note that pure minority isolation can only operate in the presence of mass media , such as the radio or telephone during world war ii or the internet more recently , which can transmit information aboutmovement goals with- out relying on face-to-face interaction .
in the absence of such communica- tion lines , weak ties and central leadership structures are likely to become more important for overcoming the clandestine collective action dilemma ( sageman 2011 ) .
this article makes a call for a multilevel perspective on clandestinity that interrogates the interactions between microlevel factors , local community structures , and national processes to better understand how , when , andwhere social relations can be translated into covert resistance against genocide ( hagan and rymond-richmond 2008 ) .
the data presented above illustrate the usefulness of such an approach .
first , they provide powerful evidence that the influence of microlevel factors , such as biographical availability , motiva- tion , and adventurousness , is conditional on minority capacity .
my analysis , for instance , shows that adventurous individuals in minority communities34 svb file 48 , docdirect , winschoten .

american journal of sociology allwere able to join successful clandestine operations and rescue hundreds of jews , while individuals with the same traits in majority congregations failed to have a similar impact .
it also reveals that moral outrage was not sufficient for clandestine collective action .
many individuals were shocked by anti- jewish legislation but refrained from clandestine collective action because they were not assured that the production of rescue networks was feasible .
only outraged individuals embedded in minority groups had the ability to translate their sentiments into underground networks .
in addition , altruistic religious majority leaders who mobilized on behalf of jewish refugees before the war were not able to continue their activities illegally once the occupation began because their networks were immediately exposed or because they could not recruit the right people .
hence , whether adventurous , available , and outraged individualswith strong identities and values are able tomobilize in secret is dependent on the local-level structures in which they are embed- ded .
second , national forces affect clandestinemobilization differently , depend- ing on whether communities form minority enclaves .
several testimonies re- veal that national church leaders played an important role in motivating christians to engage in rescue .
others believed that the persecution of jews didnotbelong inaplural society.however , most of these peoplewerenot able to translate theirmotivations into action because they considered the risks too high .
gentiles who did try saw their attempts thwarted by the nazi security apparatus early on .
it was citizens embedded inminority enclaves who could not only see an opportunity to act on national norms and obey their national leaders but who could also circumvent the challenges of a wartime repressive context .
as withmicrolevel factors , the impact of national leadership , plural- istic norms , and repressive contextswas conditioned by the availability of dis- tinct local networks .
this article thus suggests that ifwewant to better under- stand clandestine operations in times of mass repression , we need to take into consideration the local challenges of clandestine collective action in addition to micromotives and national conditions , and in turn we need to explain when , where , and how social networks can be appropriated for underground mobilization .
although this article compellingly shows the usefulness of a multilevel perspective for explaining the initial production of clandestine mobiliza- tion , it also has its shortcomings .
most important , it fails to shed light on how hubs of commitment can come together to produce social transforma- tion .
minority isolation facilitates secrecy , but at the same time , it limits the carrying capacity of rescue networks that hardly ever spread beyond the narrow confines of small enclaves , preventing the emergence of concerted challenges to authority .
this highlights both the potential and the inefficien- cies ofminority groups that , much like tight-knit neighborhoodmovements , require interregional ties to transform society ( gould 1995 ) .

minorities and collective actionnority thesis explains not only clandestine mobilization but also its frag- mented nature .
however , we know from successful insurgencies and revo- lutions that secret cells do sometimes come together to transform society .
therefore , future studies should try explain why some disjointed covert ac- tivities percolate upward and forge these connections while others do not , exploring interactions with broader political opportunities , broader institu- tional coalitions , or broader issue networks ( loveman 1998 ) .appendixall use subjecprimary source archive flim niod 471 13 d archive niod 251a 61 dagbook douwes , niod 244 1065 diary of theresa wertheim , http : //www.joodscheraadenschede.nl interview flim , archive flim niod 471 13c interview kapelaan van der brink , niod svb file 8 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 13 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 14 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 22 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 23 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 28 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 30 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 33 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 40 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 41 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 47 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 48 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 50 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 51 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 52 , docdirect , winschoten svb file 55 , docdirect , winschoten yad vashem file a .

this study tested whether intervention-induced reductions in unprotected intercourse during a 12-month period endured over a 54-month period and whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of stis , which increase risk for hiv .
method : grade 6 learners ( mean age 12.4 years ) participated in a 12-month trial in eastern cape province , south africa , in which 9 matched pairs of schools were randomly selected and within pairs randomized to a theory-based hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention or an attention-control intervention .
they completed 42- and 54-month postintervention measures of unprotected intercourse ( the primary outcome ) , other sexual behaviors , theoretical constructs , and , at 42- and 54-month follow-up only , biologically confirmed curable stis ( chlamydial infection , gonorrhea , and trichomoniasis ) and herpes simplex virus 2 .
results : the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention reduced unprotected intercourse averaged over the entire follow-up period ( or 0.42 , 95 % ci [ 0.22 , 0.84 ] ) , an effect not significantly reduced at 42- and 54-month follow-up compared with 3- , 6- , and 12-month follow-ups .
the intervention caused positive changes on theoretical constructs averaged over the 5 follow-ups , although most effects weakened at long-term follow-up .
although the intervention ’ s main effect on stis was nonsignificant , an intervention condition time interaction revealed that it significantly reduced curable stis at 42-month follow-up in adolescents who reported sexual experience .
conclusion : these results suggest that theory-based behavioral interventions with early adolescents can have long-lived effects in the context of a generalized severe hiv epidemic .

6 , 610–621 0278-6133/15/ $ 12.00 http : //dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0000140 610 accounting for an estimated 1.6 million deaths in 2012 ( unaids , 2013a ) , the hiv epidemic continues to have devastat- ing effects on global health .
approximately 70 % of new hiv infections occur in sub-saharan africa , where heterosexual expo- sure is the main mode of transmission ( unaids , 2013a ) .
people ages 15–24 years account for 39 % of new hiv infections ( un- aids , 2013b ) , raising concern about hiv prevention for youth .
in south africa , the sub-saharan african nation with the largest number of people living with hiv in the world that is experiencing a generalized ( unaids and world health organization , 2000 ) severe epidemic , hiv disproportionately affects young women : approximately 3 % of males and 7 % of females ages 15–19 years are hiv positive , as are 5 % of males and 21 % of females ages 20–24 years ( shisana et al. , 2009 ) .
the median age of first sex in south africa is about 16 years ( richter , 2005 ; simbayi , chauveau , & shisana , 2004 ) .
intervening in early adolescence , ages 10–14 years before or just after children become sexually active , is a way to educate them about safer sex practices before they establish habitual patterns of unsafe behavior ( unicef , 2011 ) .
although several randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) have found that interventions reduced hiv sexual risk behaviors in early adolescents ( coyle , kirby , marin , gomez , & gregorich , 2004 ; j .
b. jemmott , jemmott , & fong , 1998 , 2010 ; stanton et al. , 1996 ) , only one such trial focused on sub-saharan african early adolescents ( j .
b. jemmott , jemmott , o ’ leary , et al. , 2010 ) .
intervention trials with sub-saharan african youth have had mixed results .
one trial ( jewkes et al. , 2008 ) found a reduced incidence of herpes simplex virus 2 ( hsv-2 ) , whereas two found interventions did not affect hsv-2 ( cowan et al. , 2010 ; ross et al. , 2007 ) .
two trials found intervention-induced reductions in sexual risk behaviors ( ross et al. , 2007 ; stanton et al. , 1998 ) , but two others ( cowan et al. , 2010 ; jewkes et al. , 2008 ) did not .
moreover , no trials have tested the effects of hiv/sexually transmitted infec- tion ( sti ) risk-reduction interventions in sub-saharan african early adolescents as they age into middle and late adolescence when their sexual activity increases .
although some trials exam- ined effects 2 or more years postintervention ( cowan et al. , 2010 ; doyle et al. , 2010 ; jewkes et al. , 2008 ) , the participants were older adolescents and the trials did not test statistically whether the interventions ’ effects were significantly reduced at longer term follow-up .
here we report tests of ( a ) an intervention ’ s effects on south african early adolescents during a 54-month postintervention pe- riod and ( b ) whether its effects were smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postinterven- tion .
a cluster rct of the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention let us protect our future with grade 6 learners ( mean age 12.4 years ) found that those in the intervention schools had lower odds of reporting vaginal intercourse , unprotected vaginal intercourse , and multiple partners during the 12-month postintervention period compared with an attention-matched control group ( j .
b. jemmott , jemmott , o ’ leary , et al. , 2010 ) .
the intervention also caused positive changes on potential mediators of sexual risk behaviors the intervention targeted ( o ’ leary et al. , 2012 ) .
besides examining these outcomes , we examined whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis ( ct ) , neisseria gonor- rhoeae ( gc ) , trichomonas vaginalis ( tv ) , and hsv-2 infections , based on assays of biological specimens 42 and 54 months postin- tervention .
method institutional review board 8 at the university of pennsylvania , the designated institutional review board under the federal-wide assurances of the university of pennsylvania and the university of fort hare , south africa , approved the study .
the human research ethics committee of the university of the witwatersrand approved the laboratory testing undertaken at the national institute for communicable diseases .
we conducted the study in an urban township and a neighboring semirural settlement in eastern cape province , south africa .
schools serving grade 6 learners from the general population were eligible .
of 36 schools serving grade 6 learners in the catchment area , one serving children with learning disabilities was ineligible , leaving 35 eligible schools ; all agreed to participate .
from 17 matched pairs of schools similar in numbers of grade 6 learners , classrooms , and classrooms with electricity , including one “ pair ” consisting of three schools , we randomly selected nine .
we used a cluster rct design , reducing the potential for con- tamination between treatment arms that would be present were individuals randomized .
we enrolled schools over 13 months beginning in october 2004 and used computer-generated random number sequences to randomize , within pairs , one school to the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention and one to the control group .
recruiters , following a standardized scripted recruitment protocol , announced the study at the schools and distributed cover letters and parent/guardian consent forms to grade 6 learners .
during recruitment , school personnel , potential participants , and recruiters were masked to the schools ’ randomized intervention assignment .
the nature of the intervention precluded masking the facilitators and participants to the group assignment during the interventions .
interventions as described elsewhere ( l. s. jemmott et al. , 2014 ) , we devel- oped the interventions based on social–cognitive theory ( bandura , 1986 ) and the theory of planned behavior ( ajzen , 1991 ) , integrated with qualitative information from extensive formative research with the target population ( o ’ leary et al. , 2012 ) .
each intervention included 12 modules , each lasting 1 hr , with two modules deliv- ered during each of six sessions on consecutive school days .
sessions involved games , brainstorming , role-playing , group dis- cussions , and comic workbooks with a series of characters and storylines .
using standardized manuals , male and female adult cofacilitators implemented each intervention in mixed-sex small groups of nine to 16 adolescents .
twenty-one women and 22 men ages 27–56 years ( m 42 years ) bilingual in english and xhosa served as cofacilitators ( l. s. jemmott et al. , 2014 ) .
fifty percent had a bachelor ’ s degree , 65 % previously worked as teachers , and 63 % previously taught hiv education .
we randomly assigned them to an 8-day training to implement one of the two interven- tions , a training in which trainers modeled the intervention activ- ities and facilitators learned their intervention and practiced im- plementing it with feedback .
the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention was designed to ( a ) increase hiv/sti risk-reduction knowledge , ( b ) enhance outcome t hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e a m er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca l a ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

table 1 includes the specific theoretical constructs the intervention targeted .
to facilitate parent–child discussions of sexual matters , we gave the learners take-home assignments to complete with a parent .
the health-promotion control intervention ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 2011 ) included activities similar to the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention , but targeting physical activ- ity and fruit and vegetable consumption , behaviors linked to chronic diseases that are leading causes of death in south africa ( joubert et al. , 2007 ; schneider , norman , steyn , & bradshaw , 2007 ) .
procedure we enrolled in the trial grade 6 learners who completed the preintervention questionnaire and attended session 1 of the inter- vention .
they completed immediate-post and 3- , 6- , and 12-month postintervention questionnaires by december 2006 .
the initial informed-consent process covered activities through the 12-month follow-up .
accordingly , we located the learners , then attending more than 200 secondary schools , and gave them parent/guardian consent forms and cover letters explaining the continuation of the trial and inviting their parents or guardians to a meeting where they could ask questions about the follow-up study .
we began 42-month data collection in april 2008 and com- pleted 54-month data collection in june 2010 .
as compensation , learners received a notebook , a pen , and a pencil for the 3-month follow-up ; a t-shirt for the 6-month follow-up ; a backpack for the 12-month follow-up ; an umbrella ( if female ) or a cap ( if male ) for the 42-month follow-up ; and a jacket for the 54-month follow-up .
we held the intervention and data collection sessions except the 42- and 54-month follow-ups at the learners ’ schools during the extracurricular period at the end of the school day .
we held the 42- and 54-month follow-ups on saturdays at one of the 18 schools , a centrally located school with suitable plumbing facilities ; trans- portation was provided to the sessions .
measures the primary outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the learner reported having unprotected vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months .
we defined vaginal intercourse as “ your penis in a female ’ s vagina ” ( male version ) or “ a boy ’ s penis in your vagina ” ( female version ) .
we coded the responses 1 for learners reporting not having vaginal sex or using a condom during vaginal sex and 2 for those reporting vaginal sex without using a condom .
sec- ondary behavioral outcomes included sexual experience ( i.e. , whether they ever had vaginal sex ) and behaviors in the past 3 months : vaginal sex , multiple partners , heterosexual anal sex , consistent condom use , frequency of condom use , condom use at last sex , and talking to parents about condoms and about not having sex .
we defined anal intercourse using the term “ anus/ behind. ” condom use measures excluded learners not reporting vaginal sex in the past 3 months .
consistent condom use was report of using condoms 100 % of the time .
frequency of condom use was on a scale from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ) .
additional secondary outcomes included potential mediators— theoretical constructs the hiv risk-reduction intervention target- ed—and biologically confirmed stis .
the number of items , coef- ficient alpha , and mean ( se ) by intervention condition and data collection period for each theoretical construct are shown in table 1 .
hiv risk-reduction knowledge ( j .
b. jemmott , jemmott , braver- man , & fong , 2005 ) and its subscales on cultural myths ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 2014 ) and condom use knowledge ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 2005 ) are the sum of the correctly answered true–false questions .
we assessed three types of condom use outcome ex- pectancies .
hedonistic outcome expectancy concerns the belief that using condoms will not interfere with sexual enjoyment ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2005 , 2007 ) .
an example item is “ when a condom is used , sex is more fun. ” prevention outcome expectancy is the belief that condoms can reduce the risk of pregnancy and hiv/sti ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2007 ) .
an example item is “ condoms help prevent aids. ” expected parental approval of condom use is the participants ’ belief that their mother and father would approve of their using condoms ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 2007 ) .
items were rated on scales from 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 5 ( agree strongly ) ; the mean is the score .
we assessed three types of condom use self-efficacy .
negotia- tion self-efficacy is the learners ’ belief that they can convince their partner to use condoms ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 2005 , 2007 ) .
an example item is “ i can get my partner to use a condom , even if he or she doesn ’ t want to. ” technical skill self-efficacy is learners ’ belief that they know how to use condoms ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2005 , 2007 ) .
an example item is “ i can use a condom , even if the room is dark. ” impulse control self-efficacy is the learners ’ belief that they can control themselves sufficiently when sexually excited to use a condom ( j .
b. jemmott et al. , 1998 , 2005 ) .
an example item is “ if i am sexually aroused , i can stop before sex to use a condom. ” learners rated items composed of self-efficacy on scales from 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 5 ( agree strongly ) ; the mean is the score .
we assessed three abstinence or sexual intercourse outcome expectancies .
abstinence–career goals outcome expectancy is the belief that practicing abstinence will facilitate achieving career goals ( jemmott et al. , 1998 ) .
abstinence–prevention outcome ex- pectancy is the belief that practicing abstinence prevents preg- nancy and hiv/sti ( jemmott et al. , 1998 ) .
expected parental approval of sex is the learners ’ belief that their mother and father would approve of their having sex .
this scale was related to increased odds of reporting sexual intercourse in pilot data ( o ’ leary et al. , 2012 ) .
items were rated on scales from 1 ( disagree strongly ) to 5 ( agree strongly ) ; the mean is the score .
we measured two types of abstinence or sexual intercourse self-efficacy : self- efficacy to refuse sex and to avoid sexual-risk situations .
items were rated on 4-point scales from 1 ( not at all sure ) to 4 ( com- pletely sure ) ; the mean is the score .
an example item for self- efficacy to refuse sex is “ how sure are you that you could refuse to have sex with a person even if you loved him ? ” ( female version ) .
an example of an item measuring self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations is “ how sure are you that you could refuse a ride offered to you by a person that you thought might want to have sex with you ? ” both scales were related to reduced intention for sexual intercourse in pilot data ( o ’ leary et al. , 2012 ) .
after completing the 42- and 54-month postintervention ques- tionnaires , learners provided a first-pass urine specimen and a blood specimen , which were delivered to the sti reference centre of the national institute for communicable diseases , johannes- t hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e a m er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca l a ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

burg , south africa .
urine specimens were assayed for ct and gc using the aptima combo assay ( hologic gen-probe , san diego , ca ) and tv using the aptima trichomonas vaginalis assay ( hologic gen-probe , san diego , ca ) .
sera were tested for hsv-2 using the herpeselect 2 elisa igg assay ( focus diagnostics , cypress , ca ) .
participants testing positive for curable stis ( ct , gc , or tv ) received directly observable single-dose antimicrobial treatment and risk-reduction counseling per centers for disease control and prevention recommendations .
those testing seropos- itive for hsv-2 were counseled , given a short course of acyclovir for flare-ups , and referred for treatment for future flare-ups .
statistical analysis the a priori unit of inference was the individual ( j .
b. jemmott , jemmott , o ’ leary , et al. , 2010 ) .
a sample size calculation was performed to detect an effect of d 0.25 standard deviations ( cohen , 1988 ) on the a priori primary outcome unprotected inter- course , adjusting for the expected variance inflation due to clus- tering ( donner & klar , 2000 ) .
assuming .05 , a two-tailed test , intraclass correlation ( icc ) coefficient .00864 based on unpub- lished pilot data , 20 % attrition , and n 1,100 grade 6 learners enrolled in the trial from 16 schools with an average of 67 learners in each school , the trial was estimated to have 80 % power to detect d 0.25 effect of the intervention .
we also performed a power analysis for the intervention ’ s effect on stis , a secondary outcome introduced 42 and 54 months postintervention .
in studies in schools and other nonclinic settings , some adolescents will be sexually experienced and therefore at risk of sti , whereas others will not be sexually experienced and hence not at risk .
based on prior research ( richter , 2005 ; simbayi et al. , 2004 ) , we considered three estimates of the percentage of learners who would be sexual experienced : 76.5 % ( n 809 ) , 51.3 % ( n 542 ) , and 38.3 % ( n 405 ) of the original 1,057 learners .
assum- ing that 15.4 % of the sexually experienced learners in the absence of an intervention would test positive for ct , gc , or tv , .05 , a two-tailed test , icc .009 , attrition 20 % , and a reduction in sti rates from 15.4 % in the control group to 8.0 % in the inter- vention group , the estimated power was .84 if 51.3 % were sexually experienced , .95 if 76.5 % were sexually experienced , and .72 if 38.3 % were sexually experienced .
in the primary analyses , the efficacy of the hiv/sti intervention compared with the control intervention on behavioral outcomes over the 3- , 6- , 12- , 42- , and 54-month follow-ups was tested using gen- eralized estimating equation models , adjusting for longitudinal re- peated measurements on learners clustered within schools ( fitzmau- rice , laird , & ware , 2004 ; liang & zeger , 1986 ) .
robust standard errors were used , and an exchangeable working correlation matrix was specified .
the models included time-independent covariates , baseline measure of the criterion , time ( five categories representing 3- , 6- , 12- , 42- , and 54-month follow-up ) , intervention condition , and the intervention condition time interaction .
in models for theoretical constructs , time had six categories because the immediate-post as- sessment was included .
we report estimated intervention effects av- eraged over all postintervention assessments constructed from appro- priate “ estimate ” statements from fitted generalized estimating equation models .
we used intervention condition time interaction contrasts to test whether the effect of the intervention was significantly different 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postintervention .
in analyses of condom use , baseline condom use was not included because too few learners reported vaginal intercourse at baseline .
we intended to examine the efficacy of the intervention on stis , restricting the analysis to learners who reported sexual experience , but found that some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for stis ; accordingly , we also report anal- yses for those reporting no sexual experience .
analyses focused on any curable sti and hsv-2 separately and controlled for gender , a strong correlate of stis , including hiv , in this setting .
we tested the intervention effects on report of sexual inexperience by the 54-month follow-up using logistic regression not controlling for baseline sexual experience because the analysis was restricted to those sexually in- experienced at baseline .
we used an intent-to-treat mode with partic- ipants analyzed based on their intervention assignment , regardless of the number of intervention or data collection sessions attended .
we used chi-square and t tests to analyze attrition .
analyses were com- pleted using sas version 9 .
results more than 90 % of 1,057 learners attended each follow-up ses- sion ( see figure 1 ) .
the percentage that attended at least one follow-up did not differ between the hiv/sti risk-reduction ( 99.5 % ) and control interventions ( 99.2 % ) , p .583 .
attending a follow-up was unrelated to sex , father ’ s presence in the household , residing in the semirural area , or sexual behavior at baseline .
however , only 171 ( 97.7 % ) of learners ages 14–18 years at baseline returned for a follow-up compared with 631 ( 99.5 % ) of those ages 12–13 and 248 ( 100 % ) of those ages 9–11 , p .011 .
unprotected vaginal sex in the past 3 months increased over the follow-up period ( see table 2 ) .
a smaller percentage of learners in the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention schools reported having unprotected vaginal sex averaged over the postintervention period compared with their counterparts in control schools ( d 0.15 ) , controlling for baseline unprotected vaginal sex ( see table 3 ) .
the intervention condition time interaction contrast was nonsig- nificant , indicating that the effect was not significantly different at 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postintervention .
the intervention also had effects on two secondary behavioral outcomes , decreasing the odds of heterosexual anal sex ( d 0.16 ) and increasing the odds of talking to parents about not having sex ( d 0.14 ) averaged over the postintervention period in hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention participants compared with controls , effects that were not smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with 3 , 6 , and 12 months postintervention .
two effects approached significance : nonsignificantly lower odds of self- reported vaginal sex ( d 0.11 ) and multiple partners ( d 0.10 ) , effects that were smaller at the 42- and 54-month follow-ups compared with the first 12 months .
there were no significant differences between the interventions in measures of condom use and talking to parents about condom use .
the intervention had the hypothesized effect on each theo- retical construct ( see table 4 ) .
its effect on condom use hedo- nistic expectancy , condom use technical skills , expected paren- tal approval of sex , self-efficacy to refuse sex , and self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations was not smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with the first 12 months of follow- t hi s do cu m en t is co py ri gh te d by th e a m er ic an ps yc ho lo gi ca l a ss oc ia tio n or on e of its al lie d pu bl is he rs .

615efficacy of an hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention up , whereas its effect on hiv/sti knowledge , cultural myths , condom use knowledge , condom use prevention outcome ex- pectancy , expected parental approval of condom use , condom use impulse control , abstinence– career goal outcome expec- tancy , and abstinence–prevention outcome expectancy was smaller 42 and 54 months postintervention compared with the initial follow-ups .
even though the effect was smaller at long- term follow-up on the three knowledge variables and condom use impulse control , it was still significant ( see table 4 ) .
we treated all learners testing positive for a curable sti .
table 2 presents the percentages of learners testing positive for stis .
of those reporting sexual experience at 42 months , 123 ( 21.1 % ) tested positive for a curable sti , as did 29 ( 7.7 % ) of those reporting no sexual experience ( p .001 ) .
at 54 months , the figures were 119 ( 19.6 % ) and 11 ( 6.0 % ) , respectively ( p .001 ) .
in the analyses on self-reported sexually experienced learners , the intervention effect on curable stis averaged over the 42- and 54-month follow-ups was nonsignificant , or 0.91 , 95 % ci [ 0.73 , 1.12 ] .

discussion these results , obtained more than 4 years postintervention , indicate that the let us protect our future intervention had significant effects on south african early adolescents .
averaged over the 54-month follow-up period , the intervention reduced self-reported unprotected vaginal sex and heterosexual anal sex and increased self-reported talking to parents about not having sex compared with the control group .
moreover , nonsignificant inter- vention condition time interaction contrasts revealed that these effects were not smaller during the longer term compared with shorter term follow-ups .
the intervention ’ s effects on reports of vaginal sex and multiple partners were smaller at long-term compared with short-term figure 1 .

617efficacy of an hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention follow-up , and its effects averaged over the follow-up period revealed only nearly significant trends toward reductions in vagi- nal sex and multiple partners .
the attenuation of the intervention ’ s effects on some behavioral outcomes after more than 4 years is perhaps not surprising ; the durability of its effects on unprotected vaginal sex , heterosexual anal sex , and talking to parents about not having sex is surprising .
in this connection , some might argue that the intervention , based on a western theoretical model , social– cognitive theory , implemented in sub-saharan africa , would have little effect on behavior .
contrary to this , its effects were similar to those in a meta-analytic review of hiv risk-reduction interven- tions with adolescents , although none of the trials reviewed had a follow-up as long as 54 months postintervention ( johnson , scott- sheldon , huedo-medina , & carey , 2011 ) .
the intervention also had a significant effect averaged over the postintervention period on each theoretical construct .
moreover , its effects on several of them , including condom use hedonistic outcome expectancy , condom use technical skills , expected parent approval of sex , self-efficacy to refuse sex , and self-efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations , did not decrease at long-term com- pared with short-term follow-up .
interestingly , two of these theo- retical constructs , expected parent approval of sex and self- efficacy to avoid sexual risk situations , mediated the intervention ’ s efficacy over the first 12 months postintervention ( o ’ leary et al. , 2012 ) .
that effects on these constructs endured may well account for the continued efficacy of the intervention , a possibility that future mediation analyses must explore .
in the planned analysis on learners reporting sexual experience , the intervention did not reduce curable stis or hsv-2 averaged over the 42- and 54-month follow-ups .
however , its effect on curable stis differed significantly at the two follow-ups .
it re- duced curable stis 42 months , but not 54 months , postinterven- tion .
reducing stis is important because having an sti increases the risk of coinfection with hiv ( fleming & wasserheit , 1999 ) .
stis detected 42 months postintervention are a measure of prev- alence because when the learners contracted the stis is unknown .
in contrast , stis detected 54 months postintervention are a mea- sure of 1-year incidence because we treated all curable stis detected 42 months postintervention .
thus , the intervention had an effect on curable stis sometime between the intervention ’ s cul- mination and the 42-month assessment , an effect that did not persist sufficiently to affect sti incidence at 54-month follow-up .
although some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for sti , analyses revealed no significant intervention or intervention condition time interaction effects on curable stis or hsv-2 in learners reporting no sexual experience .
a few other studies on youth in sub-saharan africa have found intervention-induced behavior change ( michielsen et al. , 2010 ; paul-ebhohimhen , poobalan , & van teijlingen , 2008 ) , but the follow-up periods were generally shorter than 1 year and rarely 2 or more years , and none targeted early adolescents .
notably , one cluster rct found a decreased hsv-2 incidence during a 2-year follow-up period and , in men , decreased transactional sex and problem drinking ( jewkes et al. , 2008 ) .
another intervention study , employing a 9-year follow-up , reported no effects on hiv or hsv-2 incidence or self-reported behavior ( doyle et al. , 2010 ) .
we are unaware of any other rct reporting effects of an hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention on sub-saharan african early adolescents over 4.5 years .
indeed , we are not aware of any other trials that have tested an hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention 1-year postintervention period compared with longer term follow- up , and most meta-analyses have not investigated whether inter- vention efficacy varies over time .
although a meta-analysis ( john- son et al. , 2011 ) reported that the length of postintervention follow-up did not affect effect size estimates , such review- generated evidence as opposed to study-generated evidence ( coo- per , 1989 ) is correlational , not addressing whether the effects within trials are significantly smaller at long-term follow-up be- cause length of follow-up may be related to other aspects of trials , complicating interpretation .
future trials , like the present trial , reporting statistical tests comparing short-term and long-term follow-up results , are needed to provide the data for meta-analyses on the whether the size of intervention effects varies over time .

a common concern about providing hiv education , including information about condoms , to young sexually inexperienced ad- olescents is that such education would encourage them to have sex .
the present study in which only 3.3 % of young adolescents reported sexual experience before the intervention ( j .
b. jemmott , jemmott , o ’ leary , et al. , 2010 ) should allay that concern .
the adolescents who received the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention were less likely to report unprotected vaginal sex during a 54- month postintervention period than were their counterparts in the control group , a finding suggesting that intervening with adoles- cents before they are sexually active is salubrious , causing reduc- tions in their sexual risks .
the strengths of this study include the attention-matched control group , random selection of schools , long-term follow-up , high retention rates , biological markers , generalized epidemic setting , and the cluster rct design , which increased internal validity while decreasing risk of contamination between arms .
the use of self- reports is a limitation .
the fact that some learners reporting no sexual experience tested positive for sti suggests socially desir- able responding , but the significant relation between self-reported sexual experience and stis 42 and 54 months postintervention reassures that results were not entirely due to socially desirable responding .
moreover , the robust and consistent results for inter- vention effects on theoretical constructs lend credence to the validity of the data .
the intervention reduced unprotected vaginal sex , but did not increase condom use .
analyses of the interven- tion ’ s effects on condom use had less power than did analyses on other outcomes : data from the first three follow-ups were ex- cluded from the condom use analyses because too few learners reported having sex , as were data from learners who did not report sex at 42-month or 54-month follow-up , whereas analyses on other outcomes included all learners , irrespective of whether they had sex .
therefore , we may have underestimated the intervention ’ s effects on condom use .
another limitation is that the results may not generalize to all south african adolescents .
unknown is whether the intervention would continue to be efficacious if im- plemented by teachers in classrooms across south africa .

619efficacy of an hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention tion and its effects can be maintained with implementation in the real world , important questions implementation research will have to answer .
nonetheless , the fact that adolescents who received only 12 hr of intervention in grade 6 , when few reported sexually experience , retained risk-reduction knowledge , self-efficacy , and outcome ex- pectancies and were continuing to engage in safer sexual behavior during a 54-month follow-up period is quite extraordinary .
the hiv epidemic is having devastating effects in south africa , the country with the most people living with hiv .
these results indicate that intervening early , before the initiation of sexual activity , can have long-lasting effects on behavior—necessary effects should we hope to see an aids-free generation .

american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) 780 –803 © american sociological association 2012 doi : 10.1177/0003122412458509 http : //asr.sagepub.com during the past 30 years , people with serious diseases have raised their political voices to an unprecedented degree , organizing to demand funding for research on their condi- tions .
this study tracks their influence on federal medical research priority-setting .
pre- vious studies of advocacy ’ s political effects have focused narrowly on achievement of benefits for constituents , but i show that advocacy can produce two additional types of political outcomes , which i call distributive and systemic effects .
using data on 53 dis- eases over 19 years , i find that diseases with the most organized patients secured dramatic increases in research funding .
i find sugges- tive evidence that diseases affecting primarily women and blacks tend to have lower levels of advocacy , so as disease advocacy became increasingly influential , the funding distribu- tion shifted away from those diseases .
addi- tionally , disease advocates made claims on the basis of dollars per death , encouraging policymakers to use mortality as a metric to commensurate diseases and creating political pressure to standardize the national institutes of health ( nih ) budget .
finally , the rise of disease advocacy encouraged policymakers to think of research funding as a benefit given to patients with various diseases .
once patients , rather than scientists or the public at large , were thought of as the primary benefi- ciaries of medical research funding , their perceived moral worthiness became increas- ingly relevant to funding decisions .
these results bridge medical sociology and social movements research to demonstrate that 458509 asrxxx10.1177/00031224124 58509american sociological reviewbest 2012 auniversity of michigan corresponding author : rachel kahn best , department of sociology , university of michigan , 500 south state street , ann arbor , mi , 48109 e-mail : rkb @ umich.edu disease politics and medical research funding : three ways advocacy shapes policy rachel kahn besta abstract in the 1980s and 1990s , single-disease interest groups emerged as an influential force in u.s. politics .
this article explores their effects on federal medical research priority-setting .
previous studies of advocacy organizations ’ political effects focused narrowly on direct benefits for constituents .
using data on 53 diseases over 19 years , i find that in addition to securing direct benefits , advocacy organizations have aggregate effects and can systemically change the culture of policy arenas .
disease advocacy reshaped funding distributions , changed the perceived beneficiaries of policies , promoted metrics for commensuration , and made cultural categories of worth increasingly relevant to policymaking .
keywords advocacy organizations , culture , health , politics , social movements best 781 advocacy organizations transform the catego- ries and meanings that shape policymaking .
diseases as interest groups before the 1980s , disease patients ’ advocates rarely participated in the politics of federal medical research funding .
a few organiza- tions targeted diseases like tuberculosis and polio , but patients rarely played a leading role in these philanthropic public health cam- paigns ( carter 1961 ; kedrowski and sarow 2007 ) .
when these groups testified before congress , they rarely competed with each other , tending to “ close ranks behind a com- mon goal : to increase the overall pot of money for biomedical research ” ( marshall 1997:344 ) .
although some groups pushed for creation of new institutes at the nih , few lob- bied congress about the distribution of nih funds to specific diseases ( dresser 2001 ) .
the 1990s saw explosive growth in the number of disease advocacy organizations .
in a departure from the earlier philanthropic public health model , new disease advocates viewed patients as their constituents .
at the beginning of the 1990s , about 400 large non- profits targeted diseases ; by 2003 , more than 1,000 did so .
their lobbying expenditures expanded even more dramatically ( see figure 1 ) .1 inspired by the successes of the aids ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) and breast cancer movements , they lobbied congress for medical research funding to an unprecedented degree , making competitive claims for a greater share of nih funding ( anglin 1997 ; dresser 1999 ) .
scholars have argued that the rise of health advocacy2 transformed the social contract for science ( callon 2003 ; guston 2000 ; see also banaszak-holl , levitsky , and zald 2010 ) .
advocates challenged scientific autonomy ( guston 2000 ) , changed how medical knowl- edge is produced and distributed ( clarke et al .
2003 ; epstein 2007 ) , and increased the prom- inence of lay expertise ( epstein 1996 ) .
we know relatively little , however , about disease advocacy ’ s effects on the politics of medical research funding .
virtually all studies of dis- ease advocacy focus on a single disease movement ( for reviews , see epstein 2008 ; hess et al .
2008 ) .
single-disease studies can neither document advocacy ’ s effects by statisti- cally comparing outcomes across diseases nor observe the overall effects of the increase in dis- ease advocacy .
a few researchers have conducted surveys of existing patients ’ organizations 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 400 600 800 1000 1200 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 l ob by in g e xp en di tu re s ( m ill io ns ) n um be r of n on pr of its number of disease nonprofits lobbying expenditures by disease nonprofits figure 1 .
expansion and politicization of disease nonprofits , 1991 to 2004 note : disease nonprofits includes organizations targeting one or several diseases .
782 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) ( allsop , jones , and baggott 2004 ; keller and packel 2007 ; wood 2000 ) , but these cross- sectional data can neither track the growth of disease advocacy over time nor conclusively document its effects on medical research pol- icymaking .
simultaneously , a growing litera- ture explores the determinants of nih funding but does not measure the influence of advo- cacy ( gross , anderson , and powe 1999 ; hegde 2009 ) .3 this study is the first to analyze longitudi- nal data on the emergence of disease move- ments and also the first to demonstrate how disease advocacy affected medical research funding priority-setting .
understanding this dramatic change in health politics expands and refines theories of advocacy ’ s political effects .
political outcomes of advocacy organizations i argue that advocacy organizations4 can pro- duce three types of political outcomes : direct benefits , distributive changes , and systemic effects .
despite a growing body of research on advocacy ’ s outcomes ( amenta et al .
2010 ; andrews and edwards 2004 ; baumgartner and leech 1998 ; burstein 1999 ; giugni 1999 ; smith 1995 ) , only direct benefits have been systematically studied empirically .
direct benefits most studies of advocacy ’ s political effects focus on what i call direct benefits : the extent to which movements secure gains for their constituents .
researchers have looked for success in relation to a movement ’ s stated goals ( burstein , einwohner , and hollander 1995 ; gamson 1990 ) or achievement of “ col- lective goods [ for the ] intended beneficiary group ” ( amenta and young 1999:40 ) .
studies show that advocacy organizations can move issues up the agenda ( burstein 1991 ; cobb and elder 1983 ; johnson 2008 ; king , bentele , and soule 2007 ) and influence policy content and passage ( andrews 2001 ; baumgartner and leech 1998 ; skrentny 2006 ) .
however , not all studies show political outcomes for movements , leading to some controversy over the extent to which movements influ- ence policy ( amenta et al .
2010 ; andrews and edwards 2004 ; baumgartner and leech 1998 ) .
studying multiple diseases over time pro- vides an ideal test of whether movements can secure direct benefits for their constituents .
previous longitudinal studies of social move- ment effects focused on organizations within a single movement ( mcadam and su 2002 ; meyer and minkoff 2004 ; olzak and ryo 2007 ; olzak and soule 2009 ) or a small num- ber of movements ( giugni 2004 ; soule and king 2008 ) .
sampling 53 diseases over 19 years gives my analyses more statistical power and allows for more conclusive tests of whether advocacy organizations obtain direct benefits .
additionally , some previous studies of social movements sample on the dependent variable by only studying issues with rela- tively high levels of mobilization .
sampling diseases instead of movements allows me to compare diseases that were and were not tar- geted by advocacy , enabling stronger conclu- sions about causality .
i draw on these unique features of my data to test whether disease advocates secured increased medical research funding .
however , we can not fully under- stand advocacy ’ s political outcomes without exploring aggregate effects .
when advocates enter a political arena , how do they change the distribution of resources and the decision- making process ?
distributive changes when advocacy organizations enter a politi- cal arena and begin receiving direct benefits , the distribution of resources shifts to favor the type of people who are most likely to orga- nize .
if traditionally excluded groups are more likely to mobilize for change , then advocacy will tend to diminish elites ’ politi- cal influence ( berry 1999 ; dahl 1961 ; lofland 1996 ; loomis and cigler 1995 ; mcadam 1982 ; piven 2006 ; radcliff and saiz 1998 ) .
alternatively , if socially advantaged people best 783 mobilize more , then advocacy organizations will tend to skew the distribution of benefits toward advantaged groups ( edwards and mccarthy 2004 ; hacker and pierson 2010 ; schattschneider 1960 ; schlozman et al .
2007 ) .
i use the term distributive changes to describe these aggregate consequences of multiple groups ’ achievement of direct bene- fits .
as disease advocacy expanded , some researchers hoped it would challenge inequi- table funding distributions and direct resources toward minorities ’ and women ’ s diseases ( callahan 2003 ) , while others wor- ried it would draw funds away from these groups ( dresser 1999 ) .
despite being the focus of extensive theo- retical debates , distributive changes are rarely empirically observed due to methodological challenges .
many studies focus on a single social movement , making it impossible to observe advocacy ’ s aggregate effects .
other studies document biases in mobilization with- out determining whether they lead to distribu- tive effects on policy , in part because it is difficult to systematically classify policies by who benefits from them .
collecting data on multiple diseases over time allows me to track changes in the funding distribution .
and because diseases can be classified by patients ’ race and gender , i can track whether the emer- gence of disease advocacy shifted funding to or from diseases that primarily affect minori- ties and women .
systemic effects direct benefits occur when advocacy organi- zations secure advantages for their constitu- ents ; distributive changes are the aggregate results of these individual outcomes .
systemic effects occur when advocates go beyond achieving benefits for their own constituents and change the structures , systems , or sche- mas of political decision-making .
because most researchers focus on direct benefits , systemic effects are rarely discussed .
when they are mentioned , systemic effects are gen- erally presumed to be rare , intentional , and concrete .
i argue , instead , that systemic effects may be common , unintended , and cultural .
first , many scholars assume that “ social movements rarely alter political institutions ” and that they can do so only when crises make institutions vulnerable ( giugni 1999 : xxix ; kriesi and wisler 1999 ) .
second , most research- ers focus on systemic effects that are intention- ally sought .
giugni ( 1999 : xxix ) suggests that social movements “ face a fundamental dilemma ” : the choice between demanding “ short-term policy changes ” and “ long-term institutional changes. ” kitschelt ( 1986:67 ) views systemic effects as an alternative strategy for achieving direct benefits : when an advocacy group can not achieve its goals in the current political system , it “ will try to broaden its demands to include those for altering the exist- ing political system fundamentally. ” third , existing studies focus on concrete changes in formal rules and systems of representation , such as the introduction of new parties ( kitschelt 1986 ) , interest groups ( clemens 1997 ) , government offices that serve as institu- tional homes for advocates ( bonastia 2000 ; epstein 2007 ; skrentny 2002 ) , and direct legis- lation ( kriesi and wisler 1999 ) .5 although scholars recognize that social movements often have unintended consequences and cultural effects on society at large ( andrews 2002 ; della porta 1999 ; earl 2004 ; giugni 1999 ; haveman , rao , and paruchuri 2007 ) , these effects are rarely discussed in the political realm .
growing literatures demonstrate , however , that policymaking has a strong cultural element ( berezin 1997 ; campbell 2002 ; skrentny 1996 ; steensland 2009 ) .
policies are profoundly affected by problem definitions ( guetzkow 2010 ; rochefort and cobb 1993 ; stone 1989 ) , cognitive and normative ideas ( campbell 2002 ) , and logics of action ( skrentny 1996 ) .
scholars recognize that social movement fram- ing seeks to change the ideas that shape policy- making , but they generally describe framing as a strategic process that helps individual organi- zations or movements achieve direct benefits ( benford and snow 2000 ; cress and snow 2000 ; mccammon et al .
2007 ; mcveigh , 784 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) welch , and bjarnason 2003 ) .6 however , if advocacy organizations change the ideas that shape policymaking , effects will likely go beyond direct benefits for individual move- ments , changing the rules of the game for all participants ( armstrong and bernstein 2008 ) .
next , i discuss two systemic effects of advo- cacy organizations : the introduction of catego- ries for commensuration and changes in policies ’ perceived target populations .
commensuration .
political decision- making often requires comparing different entities on a single metric in a process called commensuration ( espeland and stevens 1998 ; timmermans and epstein 2010 ) .
advocacy organizations tend to promote metrics for comparison that favor their causes , and if policymakers adopt an organization ’ s pre- ferred metric , the organization will likely receive direct benefits .
but criteria for evalu- ating claims affect all participants , not just the ones who lobbied for them , meaning that new metrics for commensuration have systemic effects on policy arenas .
i will show that as some disease advocates promoted dollars per death as a way to commensurate diseases , nih funding for all diseases drifted toward this standard .
target populations and worthiness .
government policies vary profoundly depend- ing on their perceived beneficiaries or target populations—that is , the groups to whom they distribute resources , whom they take resources from , or whose behavior they try to change .
beliefs about policy targets ’ worthiness shape which policies seem appropriate or politically feasible , influence the available frames , and are institutionalized in programs that rein- force these categories ( steensland 2006 ; see also lieberman 2009 ; skrentny 1996 , 2002 , 2006 ; steinmetz 2007 ) .
policies and laws tend to disadvantage , punish , or impose restric- tions on stigmatized groups and distribute benefits to positively constructed groups ( gilens 1999 ; schneider and ingram 1993 ) .
most existing research treats target popu- lations as a constant feature of policies , often coding the target population directly from the text of bills ( donovan 2001 ; schroedel and jordan 1998 ) .7 in contrast , i argue that a pol- icy ’ s perceived targets can change over time .
changes in perceived beneficiaries matter because they determine whose moral worthi- ness is relevant to the policymaking process.8 i will show that congress formerly thought of scientists and the public at large as the main beneficiaries of medical research funding , but disease advocates encouraged congress to think of disease patients as beneficiaries .
once patients were considered beneficiaries , their perceived moral worthiness was increas- ingly relevant to funding decision-making , which disadvantaged stigmatized diseases .
existing research on advocacy ’ s political outcomes focuses primarily on direct bene- fits .
distributive changes have rarely been explored empirically and systemic effects have been mostly ignored .
the growth of disease advocacy provides an ideal opportu- nity to document advocacy ’ s direct , distribu- tive , and systemic effects .
data and methods i draw on quantitative and qualitative data to track the effects of disease advocacy .
first , i constructed a longitudinal dataset with infor- mation on 53 diseases from 1989 to 2007.9 the unit of analysis is the disease .
for each disease in each year , i collected data on the amount of federal medical research funding for the disease , advocacy targeting the dis- ease , and the number and characteristics of people it killed .
table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis .
funding data the dependent variable is federal medical research funding from the national institutes of health ( nih ) and the department of defense–congressionally directed medical research programs ( dod-cdmrp ) .
in the united states , the nih is the primary public funder of medical research , and the dod- cdmrp also distributes a substantial amount best 785 of medical research funding.10 i used the freedom of information act to obtain histori- cal information on nih research funding .
dod-cdmrp funding data were available online .
i converted the funding totals into mil- lions of 1987 dollars using the cpi-urs ( bureau of labor statistics 2008 ) .
data on disease nonprofits the first two disease advocacy variables come from nonprofit tax data that i aggregated by disease .
i purchased the national center for charitable statistics ’ ( nccs ) core trend file pc,11 a longitudinal dataset compiled from nonprofits ’ internal revenue service ( irs ) forms covering the years 1989 to 2007.12 i con- verted all financial data into 1987 dollars using the cpi-urs ( bureau of labor statistics 2008 ) .13 i focused on nonprofits in two catego- ries : “ diseases , disorders , and medical disciplines ” and “ medical research. ” 14 for each of the approximately 15,000 nonprofits in these categories , i coded the disease or diseases the nonprofit was related to , if any.15 having linked organizations to the diseases they target , i summed variables from this organization- level data to create two disease-level variables : the total number of organizations targeting the disease and their total lobbying expenditures16 in a given year .
i use these measures as inde- pendent variables denoting the level of advo- cacy surrounding each disease.17 congressional appropriations hearings witnesses .
to measure participation of dis- ease advocacy organizations in nih funding deliberations , i collected data on witnesses at house appropriations hearings for labor , health and human services ( hhs ) , and edu- cation , which include nih appropriations.18 for every fifth year from 1965 to 1985 and every year from 1989 to 2007,19 i downloaded lists of witnesses and their organizational affil- iations from lexisnexis congressional .
with a team of seven undergraduate research assis- tants , i classified witnesses into 16 categories.20 i then coded whether witnesses classified as health advocates represented a disease or dis- eases .
within each year , i summed the number of advocates testifying for each disease .
i use these counts as a third measure of disease advocacy.21 in addition , to document the increasing prominence of disease advocates , i graph the annual percentages of witnesses in various categories .

i also collected data on the content of witnesses ’ testimony .

second , to collect more nuanced data on how advocates justify their claims , two research assistants and i read table 1 .

mortality data next , i collected data from the centers for disease control ( cdc ) on the annual number of deaths recorded for black , white , and other race men and women for each disease.23 i calculated percentages of blacks and women among fatalities and also created dummy variables equal to one if over 95 percent of fatalities were women ( breast , cervical , ovar- ian , and uterine cancers ; pelvic inflammatory disease ) or blacks ( sickle cell anemia ) .
i also use the total annual deaths for each disease as an independent variable .
disease categories to combine these data sources , i had to align several disease classification schemes .
the nih data included information on 212 dis- eases , conditions , and research areas.24 i selected all diseases at the lowest level of aggregation in the nih data , matched them with the icd-9 and icd-10 codes used by the cdc , and classified nonprofits and witnesses based on these disease categories.25 table 2 lists the 53 sampled diseases , which include the 15 leading causes of death in the united states besides murder , suicide , and accidents .
my sample includes hiv/aids and breast cancer , which were targeted by unusually large and successful advocacy campaigns .
when these outliers are included in the analy- ses , the effects of advocacy appear dramati- cally larger .
therefore , all models shown in table 3 exclude hiv/aids and breast cancer , with notes in the text explaining when their inclusion would change the results .
analysis i began by using absolute funding levels as the dependent variable and including a lagged measure of funding in the regression equa- tion .
its coefficient was very close to one , indicating the presence of a unit root .
therefore , i first-differenced the dependent variable , yielding models that predict changes in research funding .
i use the cochrane- orcutt transformation to correct for first- order autocorrelation .
all independent variables are lagged by one year , and all models use robust standard errors to account for clustering by disease ( rogers 1993 ; williams 2000 ) .
results are robust to model specification.26 all figures show five-year moving averages .
i supplement the quantitative analysis with a qualitative analysis of testimony and sec- ondary sources .
i examined the congressional testimony of a representative sample of 200 disease advocates , news coverage of nih policymaking in newspapers ( including the washington post and the new york times ) and scientific journals ( science and the new eng- land journal of medicine ) , and congression- ally mandated reports from the congressional research service and the institute of medi- cine .
these qualitative data help me document cultural changes in medical research politics .
i look for direct , distributive , and systemic effects in different ways .
if advocacy organiza- tions received direct benefits , we should observe positive coefficients for the advocacy variables , indicating that diseases with more advocacy had bigger funding increases .
if advocacy created distributive changes on the basis of race and gender , we should see race and gender coefficients that are mediated by advocacy , indicating that different levels of mobilization shifted the funding distribution across demographic groups .
if advocacy had systemic cultural effects , graphical and qualita- tive data should show changes in policy mean- ings that are attributable to advocacy .
these changed terms of the debate should affect how all diseases fare in the competition for funds .
results direct benefits scholars have argued that disease advocates successfully lobbied for research funds ( brown and zavestoski 2004 ; dresser 1999 ; best 787 epstein 1996 ) .
to test this claim , model 1 ( see table 3 ) controls for changes in mortality and includes three measures of disease advocacy : the change in the number of nonprofits target- ing a disease , their total lobbying expendi- tures , and the number of witnesses testifying on behalf of the disease.27 the results reveal a strong relationship between advocacy and funding changes .
increases in the number of nonprofits and lobbying expenditures are both significantly associated with increases in research funding , with each $ 1,000 spent on lobbying associated with a $ 25,000 increase in research funds the following year .
the coeffi- cient for witnesses is also positive , but it is not statistically significant.28 these findings sug- gest that disease advocacy organizations secured direct benefits in the form of increased medical research funding .
distributive changes contemporary observers made competing predictions about how advocacy might affect the overall distribution of research funding .
some scholars and advocates argued that dis- ease advocacy would correct inequities , shift- ing funds to diseases that disproportionately affect women and racial minorities .
others worried that disease advocacy would have the opposite effect , drawing money away from diseases that affect disadvantaged groups ( callahan 2003 ; dresser 1999 ) .
the results tentatively support the latter prediction .
in the aggregate , disease advocacy may have shifted money away from diseases that primarily affect women and blacks .

788 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) fatalities are female or black .
both coeffi- cients are negative and statistically signifi- cant , suggesting that women ’ s and blacks ’ diseases tended to receive smaller funding increases .
to see whether these smaller increases are attributable to lower levels of advocacy , model 3 ( table 3 ) controls for advocacy .
the coefficient for blacks ’ diseases decreases significantly , indicating that low levels of advocacy explain some of the fund- ing disparities .
the coefficient for women ’ s diseases also moves closer to zero , but the decrease is not statistically significant .
these results should be interpreted cau- tiously for two reasons .
first , the disadvan- tage for women ’ s diseases disappears when breast cancer is included in the analyses .
second , my sample includes only one black- dominated disease ( sickle cell anemia ) and only four female-dominated diseases besides breast cancer ( cervical , ovarian , and uterine cancers and pelvic inflammatory disease ) .
the observed effects might be particular to these specific diseases and not general pat- terns based on patients ’ demographics .
to address this concern , i re-ran all models with an alternate specification of the race and gen- der variables : the percentage of women and blacks among each disease ’ s fatalities .
the patterns are similar in these models , suggest- ing that the results are not particular to the small number of female- and black- dominated diseases , but the results are no longer statistically significant.29 systemic effects thus far , i have shown that disease advocates secured large funding increases , and that these successes may have created funding table 3 .

best 789 disparities on the basis of patients ’ race and gender .
turning to systemic effects , i find that disease advocates changed the political mean- ing of medical research , with profound conse- quences for the distribution of research funds .
mortality as a metric for commensu- ration .
seeking increased funding for their diseases , many advocates argued that nih funding was out of sync with the burden of disease .
mortality emerged as an influential metric for commensurating diseases and reshaped the funding distribution .
following aids advocacy ’ s successes in the 1980s , hiv/aids received more research funding than any other disease .
these funding levels meant advocates for virtually every disease could use measures of dollars per death or per patient to claim their disease was underfunded compared to hiv/aids .
for example , in 1984 , breast cancer advocate rose kushner testified that the federal gov- ernment was spending $ 11,000 for each new aids patient but only $ 400 per person diag- nosed with breast cancer ( u.s. congress 1984:49 ) .
in 1995 , a representative of the american heart association noted that “ in fiscal year 1993 , hhs spent 36 times more on research funding per death of an aids victim than was spent per death of a heart disease victim ” ( u.s. congress 1995:129 ) .
most advocates based their claims on mortality , but advocates for non-fatal diseases based their claims on prevalence , comparing dollars per patient ( marshall 1997 ) .
policymakers liked mortality and preva- lence metrics because they came from official government statistics and provided a simple and seemingly rational way to compare fund- ing across diseases ( see porter 1995 ) .
in the house , representatives istook ( r-ok ) and nethercutt ( r-wa ) echoed advocates ’ claims that some diseases were underfunded com- pared to hiv/aids , a point istook pushed in appropriations subcommittee meetings ( dresser 1999 ; istook 1997 ; marshall 1997 ) .
representative bonilla ( r-tx ) also picked up the dollars-per-death frame to push for more money for diabetes research ( marshall 1997 ) .
all three representatives used the mortality metric to push for increased congressional intervention in the nih budget .
these dollars-per-death claims created political pressure to standardize the nih funding process .
a congressional research service report complained that advocates tended to choose the comparisons most favorable to their own diseases , offering up a “ vast and sometimes confusing array of charts and tables comparing disease-specific research funding with statistics on morbidity , mortality , and health care costs ” ( johnson 1998 ) .
in response to advocates ’ various met- rics and standards , some members of con- gress began requesting reports of nih funding by mortality .
in 1994 , the senate appropria- tions committee ordered the nih to submit a report of funding by death rates , medical spending , and diseases ’ indirect economic costs ( agnew 1996 ) .
that same year , the congressional research service produced a report of nih funding and mortality rates for the leading causes of death ( johnson 1994 ) .
in 1997 , the senate held a hearing examining nih priority-setting .
the nih resisted the push for standardiza- tion .
at the senate hearing , nih director harold varmus argued that diseases are inap- propriate categories for judging the funding distribution and opposed formal commensu- ration as a priority-setting tool .
he testified that it would be foolhardy to set funding tar- gets by diseases because medical advances often arise from non–disease-targeted basic research or spill over across diseases .
he also argued against adopting standardized formu- las for commensuration , saying that “ num- bers are suspect ” and that “ assessing or designing a research portfolio from numbers alone is a very tricky , indeed a hazardous enterprise ” ( u.s. congress 1997b:9 , 8 ) .
var- mus was supported by a group of representa- tives including appropriations subcommittee chair john porter ( r-ill ) , who sought to pre- serve nih autonomy in setting funding pri- orities ( dresser 1999 ; epstein 2007 ) .
faced with the conflict between scientific autonomy and advocates ’ critiques , policy- 790 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) makers compromised by avoiding earmarks but also opening the black box of nih deci- sion-making .
congress requested a report from nih on its priority-setting procedures and asked the institute of medicine ( iom ) to issue recommendations on how to improve the process ( dresser 1999 ) .
in the report , the nih for the first time listed criteria for prior- ity-setting between diseases .
they provided five unranked criteria : public health needs , scientific quality of the research , potential for scientific progress ( the existence of promising pathways and qualified investigators ) , portfolio diversifi- cation along the broad and expanding frontiers of research , and adequate support of infrastructure ( human capital , equipment instrumentation , and facilities ) .
( institute of medicine 1998:4 ) these criteria provide some information about nih priority-setting while maintaining significant scientific autonomy over funding decisions .
although congress stopped short of explicitly standardizing the nih budget , the series of reports and hearings made it clear that advocates and members of congress would continue to question whether nih funding lined up with mortality and other measures of the burden of disease .
and as the nih was increasingly critiqued on the basis of dollars per death , mortality gradually became a better predictor of nih funding .
model 4 ( table 3 ) includes the number of deaths attributable to each disease during the previous year .
the coefficient for mortality is positive and significant , showing that during the time period under study , “ big killers ” had larger increases in nih funding.30 as the mortality metric became increasingly taken for granted , high-mortality diseases were at an advantage in the competition for funds.31 did the dollars-per-death frame advantage all high-mortality diseases or only those whose advocates used the frame ?
model 5 ( table 3 ) includes an interaction effect between witnesses and mortality .
the positive interaction effect , showing that high-mortality diseases had a larger payoff from witness testimony , suggests that dollars-per-death claims helped witnesses secure funding increases for their diseases .
importantly , though , the main effect for mortality remains large and statistically significant , suggesting that the rise of mortality as a metric for com- mensuration advantaged high-mortality dis- eases even if their advocates did not testify.32 thus , the dollars-per-death frame was more than a mechanism for witnesses to secure direct benefits for their diseases ; the introduc- tion of the mortality metric systemically changed the terms of the debate over medical research funding .
perceived beneficiaries .
disease advo- cacy organizations encouraged congress to think of patients with specific diseases as ben- eficiaries of medical research funding .
throughout most of the twentieth century , when fights broke out over the distribution of nih funding , diseases were not generally the competitors .
midcentury congressional cri- tiques of the nih focused on whether money was being disbursed to unqualified research- ers and whether nih funding was “ geographically elitist ” ( guston 2000:74 ) .
testifying before congress in 1963 , nih director shannon argued that the large nih budget was defensible because the scientists who received the money deserved it : “ the national figures are very large .
.
.
.
but when you go from a national picture to a state .
.
.
and begin to recognize institutions and scien- tists , you begin to understand the role they play in the community life ” ( u.s. congress 1963:30 ) .
although the institutes ’ overarch- ing goal was always to improve the nation ’ s health , this rhetoric constructed scientists as the beneficiaries of nih funding .
this construction was reflected in the characteristics of witnesses at appropriations hearings .
in the 1960s and 1970s , over 15 percent of witnesses testifying at house labor , health , education , and welfare appro- priations hearings represented health institu- tions like medical schools , research institutes , best 791 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 pe rc en t o f w itn es se s disease organizaons health instuons figure 2 .
witnesses at house appropriations hearings representing disease organizations and health institutions , 1965 to 2004 note : disease organizations includes organizations targeting one or several diseases .
and hospitals ( see figure 2 ) .
as the groups most likely to receive money directly from the nih , they were a natural constituency for nih policy .
meanwhile , only 5 to 10 percent of witnesses represented organizations target- ing diseases ( see figure 2 ) .
subsequent changes reveal the increasing prominence of disease patients in nih policy- making .
the proportion of witnesses repre- senting health institutions dropped dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s , declining to fewer than 7 percent of witnesses by 2004 .
they were replaced by disease advocates , who made up over 20 percent of witnesses by the 1990s ( see figure 2 ) .33 this percentage is astonishingly high , given that the denominator includes witnesses testifying about the appro- priations for all of hhs , labor , and educa- tion .
even though these disease advocacy organizations were not receiving money directly , they expressed an interest in the dis- tribution of funding to diseases , and their pres- ence as witnesses suggests that members of congress viewed these claims as legitimate .
in their testimony , disease advocates por- trayed patients as the beneficiaries of research funding .
for instance , in 1992 , one breast cancer advocate argued that “ my daughter jody , the women in this room , and women everywhere deserve no less ” than increased funding for breast cancer research .
another asked , “ is this too much to ask for your wife , your sister , your mother ? ” ( u.s. congress 1992:31 , 59 ) .
these advocates depicted breast cancer patients , not scientists , as the benefi- ciaries of breast cancer research funding .
dis- cussions of the distribution of funding among states and researchers did not disappear , but they were now overshadowed by discussions of the distribution of funds to diseases .
in another indication of the shift to view- ing patients as beneficiaries , witnesses were increasingly likely to mention patients when they discussed the nih.34 in 1960 , approxi- mately 40 percent of references to the nih appeared in close proximity to references to patients ; by 2010 , this number had increased to over 70 percent ( see figure 3 ) .
this grow- ing discursive link between the nih and patients supports the claim that patients were increasingly thought of as beneficiaries of medical research funding .
the relevance of deservingness .
once patients were viewed as beneficiaries of nih funding , moral judgments about their 792 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) deservingness became increasingly relevant to funding deliberations .
when scientists and the public at large were viewed as the beneficiaries of medical research funding , it would have made little sense to argue that patients of any particular disease “ deserved ” more research funds .
but once patients were constructed as beneficiaries , some advocates began arguing that individuals suffering from their diseases were innocent victims , with the implication that other diseases merited less support .
in a letter to representative porter , a muscular dystrophy advocate attacked funding for research on drug abuse and alcoholism , saying that “ it is shocking that over $ 754 million is devoted to address the health problems of people whose irresponsible behavior causes those problems , while less than 1 percent of that sum helps children dying of duchenne muscular dystrophy ” ( havemann 1998 ) .
such direct attacks were rare , but my analyses of congressional transcripts reveal that advocates for stigmatized and nonstigmatized diseases made different types of claims .
witnesses for nonstigmatized diseases tended to focus their testimony on patients ’ and families ’ suffering .
for example , one mother spoke about her 13-year-old son , say- ing that “ michael is not comfortable as he sits here strapped to his wheelchair .
if you look into his beautiful brown eyes , he has no vision .
.
.
.
it is horrible what batten ’ s disease does to a normal healthy child ” ( u.s. con- gress 1990:701 ) .
another mother who lost a child to a genetic disease described her “ agony [ at ] the thought that another child will die from this ” ( u.s. congress 1997a:108 ) .
these witnesses sometimes made claims on scien- tific and economic grounds , but their most common strategy was to evoke sympathy .
in contrast , witnesses with potentially stig- matized diseases spent their testimony attempting to manage the stigma .
for exam- ple , one witness with liver disease emphasized that he did not drink or smoke , “ never experi- mented with drugs , ” and “ had one sexual partner and continue to have one sexual part- ner in my whole life , my wife ” ( u.s. congress 1997a:132 ) .
some advocates strategically focused on the least stigmatized subgroups of their patient populations .
juvenile diabetes advocates emphasized the differences between their disease and type 2 diabetes , which has more behavioral risk factors ( perez-pena 2006 ) .
lung cancer advocates focused public awareness campaigns on types of lung cancer not caused by smoking ( griffith 2005 ) .
addi- tionally , witnesses for stigmatized diseases were more likely to justify funding on eco- nomic grounds .
for example , a former drug user emphasized that research and treatment allowed her to go from “ tax burden to tax payer ” ( u.s. congress 1997a:318 ) , and a 40 50 60 70 80 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 c o- oc cu rr en ce s p er 1 00 n ih r ef er en ce s nih / patients co-occurrences figure 3 .

lung cancer and liver cancer ’ s cumulative residuals from regressions of funding changes on mortality and advocacy , 1992 to 2006 spokesman for the american lung associa- tion noted that “ lung diseases cost the u.s. economy an estimated $ 84.4 billion annually ” ( u.s. congress 1997a:143 ) .
perhaps less con- fident that their stories would evoke sympa- thy , these witnesses were disproportionately likely to rely on economic arguments to justify funding increases .
stigmatized diseases received less funding in the new political climate .
i document this pattern by tracking funding for lung cancer and liver cancer .
both cancers have potentially stigmatized risk factors ( smoking for lung can- cer ; hepatitis infection and alcohol consump- tion for liver cancer ) .
year after year , both diseases received smaller funding increases than would have been predicted based on mor- tality .
to document this cumulative disadvan- tage , i summed each disease ’ s residuals from regression analyses over time ( see figure 4 ) .
the diamonds in the graph are the diseases ’ cumulative residuals from model 4 ( table 3 ) , which controls for mortality .
by 2006 , lung cancer and liver cancer were receiving about $ 100 million and $ 35 million dollars less , respectively , than would have been expected based on how many people they killed.35 con- trolling for advocacy does not move the residu- als substantially closer to zero , indicating that lung and liver cancer ’ s disadvantages can not be explained by lack of advocacy ( see figure 4 , cumulative residuals from model 5 , table 3 ) .
the increasingly negative residuals for lung and liver cancer suggest that once patients were viewed as beneficiaries of medical research funding , stigmatized diseases were at a growing disadvantage .
by constructing patients as beneficiaries of medical research funding , disease advo- cates unintentionally increased the relevance of stigma to medical research priority-setting .
but the history of aids activism reveals complexities in the relationship between dis- ease advocacy and stigma .
the fact that hiv/ aids disproportionately affected stigmatized groups limited the initial public health response to the emerging epidemic .
the aids movement emerged in response to the federal government ’ s inaction , and the movement was extremely successful in overcoming stigma and putting hiv/aids on the govern- ment agenda ( donovan 2001 ; epstein 1996 ) .
794 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) subsequent campaigns targeting other dis- eases were inspired by the aids movement ’ s successes and adopted its symbols and strate- gies , including ribbons , fundraising walks , and federal advocacy ( anglin 1997 ; dresser 2001 ; klawiter 2008 ) .
these movements inspired by aids advocacy expanded the influence of disease stigma on federal health policy .
discussion disease advocacy transformed the politics of medical research funding .
by examining quantitative and qualitative data on 53 dis- eases over 19 years , i identified several previ- ously overlooked effects of advocacy .
in addition to securing direct benefits , disease advocacy organizations reshaped the funding distribution , introduced metrics for commen- suration , changed the perceived beneficiaries of medical research , and made deservingness increasingly relevant to funding deliberations .
regarding direct benefits , i found a strong relationship between advocacy and increases in nih funding to diseases .
these results indicate that advocacy organizations can secure large benefits for their constituents .
however , we should not expect equally large effects in every policy arena .
medical research funding can be given out in small units , meaning that congress can distribute resources widely to placate as many groups as possible ( lowi 1964 ) .
advocacy ’ s effects might be smaller when organizations compete over legislation .
also , congressional representatives tend to view dis- ease advocates more favorably than other lob- byists because disease advocates do not directly profit from medical research expenditures ( cook-degan and mcgeary 2006 ) .
advocates who are less favorably viewed might be less successful .
finally , the large funding increases occurred in the context of an expanding nih budget .
advocacy ’ s effects might be smaller during times of austerity .
with respect to distributive changes , i found suggestive evidence that with the excep- tion of breast cancer , there was less advocacy for women ’ s and blacks ’ diseases .
therefore , as more disease advocates secured direct ben- efits , the funding distribution shifted away from women ’ s and blacks ’ diseases.36 this pattern suggests that contemporary inequali- ties in mobilization may create health dispari- ties for future generations .
however , these results are based on a small number of female- dominated and black-dominated diseases and change with inclusion of breast cancer in the analysis , so they are not definitive .
my findings concerning systemic effects reveal two processes related to categorization .
advocates first asserted that diseases were the relevant categories across which to judge the nih funding distribution .
making these judgments then required classifying and com- paring diseases through commensuration and cultural categories of worth ( see lamont and molnar 2002 ) .
in the first categorization process , social movements construct , maintain , or highlight group boundaries ( polletta and jasper 2001 ) and then import these categories into political deliberations .
in this case , advocates organ- ized around disease categories and encour- aged policymakers to judge the distribution of funds to diseases .
but advocacy organizations do not create categories in a vacuum , and the move to hold the nih accountable for fund- ing to diseases reveals an unexpected rela- tionship between advocacy and established disease categories .
patients mobilized around disease definitions and diagnoses provided by healthcare systems ( brown et al .
2004 ; rabi- now 1992 ; see also bowker and star 2000 ; rosenberg 2007 ) .
they then created political pressure for the nih to target research fund- ing to these diseases , despite nih officials ’ preference for funding research that might cross traditional disease boundaries .
this pressure may have increased the likelihood that future scientific advances would fall within established disease categories .
thus , in challenging scientific authority over fund- ing decisions , disease advocacy may actually have reinforced dominant disease classifica- tions by diminishing scientists ’ ability to con- duct research across categories.37 in the same way that groups mobilize around categories best 795 encoded in policies ( pierson 1993 ; skocpol 1992 ) , advocacy develops around preexisting disease categories and can reinforce those categories .
when advocates used the dollars-per-death frame to demand funding increases for their diseases , they created political pressure to standardize the nih budget by mortality and to formalize nih priority-setting procedures .
sociological theory often links standardiza- tion and expert authority ( weber 2003 ) .
how- ever , my findings support recent observations that standardization challenges experts ’ autonomy ( espeland and stevens 1998 ; evans 2002 ; guston 2000 ; porter 1995 ; timmer- mans and epstein 2010 ) .
calls for public accountability force professionals to justify their decisions on the basis of objective stand- ards instead of expert judgment ( porter 1995 ) .
in this case , the nih managed to avoid explic- itly standardizing its priority-setting process , but the funding distribution gradually approached the standard proposed by many advocates .
this implicit compromise illus- trates the strong but challenged professional authority of scientists and medical profes- sionals in the contemporary united states ( epstein 1996 ; guston 2000 ; pescosolido 2006 ) .
advocates also encouraged policymakers to think of patients as beneficiaries of medical research funding .
this pattern reveals a rarely discussed pathway through which advocacy shapes policy : by changing a policy ’ s per- ceived beneficiaries .
political scientists have long recognized that policies vary dramati- cally based on whether affected parties are attentive to and engaged in political debates ( may 1991 ; schattschneider 1960 ) .
but when disease advocates asserted their interest in the distribution of medical research funding , they did more than awaken a predefined group of beneficiaries : they redefined who counted as a beneficiary , making a new set of interests relevant.38 once patients were viewed as beneficiar- ies of medical research funding , disease stigma became increasingly relevant to nih priority-setting .
this finding suggests a new source of variation in the influence of deserv- ingness on policy .
even if the symbolic con- struction of a group remains constant—for example , if liver cancer patients face a con- sistent amount of stigma , or if welfare recipi- ents are routinely disparaged—the extent to which stigma shapes policy depends on who is thought of as the policy ’ s beneficiaries .
beneficiary groups ’ perceived worthiness tends to change slowly ( steensland 2006 ) , but the political relevance of worthiness can change quickly and dramatically depending on whether a group is considered a benefi- ciary.39 advocates for stigmatized groups can interpret this finding either as a rallying cry or as a cautionary tale .
advocates could strategi- cally redefine policy beneficiaries to decrease the relevance of stigma .
however , the emer- gence of advocacy may encourage politicians to view movement constituents as policy ben- eficiaries , calling attention to their moral characteristics .
political environments are not only a con- text for social movements—they are also a field that social movements work to reshape .
in promoting mortality as a metric for com- mensuration and framing deserving patients as beneficiaries , advocates changed the rules of the competition for medical research funds ( see armstrong and bernstein 2008 ) .
these cultural changes had concrete effects on the funding distribution , shifting money toward high-mortality diseases and away from stig- matized diseases .
the field metaphor should not lead us to assume that all systemic effects are strategi- cally sought .
when disease advocates used the dollars-per-death frame to push for more funding for their diseases , the pressure to formalize nih priority-setting and the increasing influence of mortality were side effects .
similarly , when disease advocates defined patients as beneficiaries of medical research funding , they never intended to increase the relevance of stigma .
these find- ings suggest a more subtle role for social movement framing , which researchers view primarily as a strategy for achieving direct benefits ( amenta et al .
2010 ; benford and 796 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) snow 2000 ; burstein and hirsh 2007 ; cress and snow 2000 ) .
social movement frames can have unintended effects on metrics for commensuration , perceived beneficiaries , and cultural categories of worth in policy arenas .
because these changes affect all participants in political fields , outlast the advocates who introduced them , and contribute to institu- tional change ( clemens and cook 1999 ) , they may be the most sweeping and durable effects of advocacy .
advocates are not the only players in political fields .
social movements and the state often interpenetrate each other , with advocates collaborating with policymakers ( armstrong and bernstein 2008 ; epstein 2007 ; goldstone 2003 ; santoro and mcguire 1997 ; skrentny 2002 ; wolfson 2001 ) .
when advocates strategically adopted the mortality metric , some members of congress joined them in arguing that the nih budget did not line up well with the burden of disease .
other policymakers and nih officials responded by defending scientific autonomy .
the nih ulti- mately provided some information about pri- ority-setting procedures and shifted more funding to high-mortality diseases .
these out- comes depended on the actions of advocates , policymakers , and government officials .
in studying political outcomes of advocacy , we should not ignore effects that depend on mul- tiple actors ; we can attribute causality to movements even when they are not exoge- nous shocks .
my analysis of the systemic political effects of advocacy parallels research on social movement ’ s societal effects .
while scholars have generally assumed that political effects are concrete and intentionally sought , studies of movements ’ effects on society at large have discovered unintended conse- quences and cultural changes ( amenta et al .
2010 ; della porta 1999 ; earl 2004 ; haveman et al .
2007 ) .
focusing on systemic effects brings these insights to the political sphere and reminds us that culture is not an isolated realm of social life that can be separated from politics ( armstrong and bernstein 2008 ) .
advocacy ’ s effects include changes in the categories and meanings that shape political decision-making .

notes 1 .
see the data and methods section for a description of the data .
because i exclude some disease lobbying organizations , figure 1 provides a conservative esti- mate of the expansion of the disease nonprofit sector .
2 .
the new health advocacy has been variously described as “ biosociality ” ( rabinow 1992 ) , “ embodied health movements ” ( morello-frosch et al .
2006 ) , and “ the politics of life itself ” ( rose 2006 ) .
3 .
in one exception , hegde and sampat ( 2011 ) find that lobbying has positive effects on federal funding for rare diseases .
4 .
researchers traditionally distinguished social movements from interest groups , arguing that the former uses noninstitutionalized or disruptive strat- egies ( mccarthy and zald 1977 ; tarrow 1994 ) and makes moral claims ( lofland 1996 ) .
however , a growing number of scholars argue that these vari- ables are continua , making it problematic to draw a clear line between social movements and interest groups ( andrews and edwards 2004 ; burstein 1998 ; clemens 2005 ; tarrow 1999 ) .
because the organizations i study share some of the characteris- tics traditionally assigned to social movements and interest groups , i call them “ advocacy organiza- tions ” ( andrews and edwards 2004 ) and draw on both research literatures .
best 797 5 .
clemens ( 1993 ) describes changes in the taken-for- granted rules for political action that are both cultural and material .
6 .
one exception is pedriana and stryker ’ s ( 1997 ) finding that supporters of affirmative action recast the meaning of equal employment opportunity .
this reframing reshaped subsequent debates about civil rights law and legitimated future government enforcement strategies .
7 .
some researchers recognize that policies ’ perceived targets can vary over time or across institutional locations .
weir ( 1992 ) argues that during the 1960s , the media and politicians reframed the war on pov- erty as primarily benefiting african americans .
laumann and knoke ( 1987 ) find that when consid- ering capping hospital charges , actors from the health policy domain focused on impacts on patients and healthcare providers , while actors from the domestic economy domain focused on the over- all economy and federal budget .
8 .
skrentny ( 1996 ) shows that the relevance of worthi- ness depends on meanings attributed to a policy .
the race riots of the late 1960s changed the ratio- nale for affirmative action from justice to crisis management , making african americans ’ per- ceived worthiness less relevant ( skrentny 1996 ) .
i argue that perceived beneficiaries are an aspect of policy meaning that is especially likely to change the relevance of worthiness .
9 .
this time frame was determined by data availabil- ity .
it includes most of the expansion of disease advocacy but begins after the initial successes of the aids movement .
10 .
because dod-cdmrp expenditures are much lower than nih expenditures , i also ran all analyses with only nih funding as the dependent variable .
the results were substantively unchanged .
11 .
this dataset includes 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations clas- sified by the irs as “ public charities ” and excludes those designated as “ private foundations. ” ( the latter make up only 10 percent of 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organi- zations ) .
because most private foundations distribute funds to charities , including both types of nonprofits in my sample would risk double-count- ing their financial data ( national center for charitable statistics 2006 ) .
these data also exclude nonprofits with designations other than 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) .
12 .
many 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations are not represented in these irs data , but their omission does not sub- stantially bias the data used for this study .
many are absent because they are very small .
some local non- profits appear to be missing but actually filed their taxes using their headquarters ’ addresses .
pre- schools and religiously affiliated nonprofits are least likely to appear in irs data , but they are not included in this study ( grønbjerg 2002 ) .
thus , the fact that not all nonprofits file tax forms poses few problems when studying health nonprofits at the national level .
13 .
organizations with budgets below $ 25,000 do not file the tax forms that yield the nccs data .
because the irs does not adjust this cutoff for inflation , i dropped all organizations with budgets below $ 25,000 in 1987 dollars to avoid inflating the number of organizations in later years .
14 .
although there are many problems with the full nccs nonprofit classification scheme , it validly classifies organizations at this broad level ( grøn- bjerg 1994 ) .
15 .
i was able to code disease affiliations ( or lack thereof ) from the names of approximately three quarters of the organizations .
web searches for the remaining ( approximately 4,000 ) organizations allowed me to identify all but 600 .
i coded an addi- tional 169 organizations using guidestar ( an online database of nonprofits ) .
a total of 429 organizations remained uncoded out of the original 15,000 .
16 .
501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations are allowed to lobby the government , but this lobbying must not constitute a “ substantial part ” of their activities ( internal reve- nue service 2010 ) .
17 .
because nonprofits have various sizes and mis- sions , the number of organizations is a broad measure of the organizational activity targeting a disease .
for example , the breast cancer organiza- tions studied include ribbon of hope , which supports patients in northeastern wisconsin , and the susan g. komen foundation , a large national organization that lobbies the government and funds research , education , and screening .
the lobbying variable directly measures financial attempts to influence government bodies , but not all lobbying is focused on research funding .
this heterogeneity likely biases my results downward , because not all of the measured activity is focused on lobbying for research funds .
18 .
prior to 1980 , the hearings are for labor , health , education , and welfare .
appropriations hearings are held in both the senate and the house , but the house hearings tend to include the same witnesses as the senate hearings , along with many additional witnesses .
therefore , i only analyzed house hearings .
19 .
i collected annual data beginning in 1989 to create independent variables for the statistical analyses .
20 .
we classified witnesses as representatives of pro- fessional associations , places/programs , and private companies ; advocates ; federal officials ; local offi- cials ; members of congress ; and individuals without organizational affiliations .
we split each category into health-related and non–health-related .
during each week of coder training , all research assistants coded the same hearing , discussed and resolved disagreements , and refined the coding scheme .
after five weeks , intercoder agreement ranged from 80 to 90 percent , with krippendorff ’ s alpha statistics from .75 to .8 ( krippendorff 2009 ) .
we then finalized the codebook and began coding 798 american sociological review 77 ( 5 ) for data collection .
two research assistants coded each witness list , with krippendorff ’ s alpha statis- tics from .67 to .92 .
21 .
compared with total nonprofits and lobbying expenditures , this variable is more narrowly focused on research advocacy .
congressional testi- mony is a direct attempt to influence federal appropriations , and 80 to 90 percent of witnesses focus their testimony on research funding .
22 .
we coded the testimony of approximately 20 ran- domly selected witnesses per year .
unfortunately , we could not achieve sufficient levels of intercoder reli- ability until we made our codes so broad that there was little variation in the resulting variables .
fortu- nately , we also wrote memos about the qualitative patterns we observed in the testimony and met to dis- cuss these patterns , yielding useful qualitative data .
23 .
mortality statistics are affected by reporting biases and by conventions for selecting a primary cause of death , making them imperfect measures of the true burden of disease .
but because they are used by policymakers and advocates , they are ideal mea- sures of mortality as it may affect policymaking .
24 .
the nih categories are not mutually exclusive .
for example , a study of breast cancer would be coded as both breast cancer and cancer .
to avoid double- counting research dollars , i only use data on diseases at the lowest level of aggregation .
25 .
some organizations target broad categories like cancer or lung disease , while others target narrow cat- egories like breast cancer or tuberculosis .
i collected data on the full range of disease advocacy organiza- tions for the qualitative analyses , but i include only single-disease organizations in the counts of wit- nesses and nonprofits targeting each disease .
26 .
to test the robustness of the results , i ran the models in various ways : using the prais-winsten method instead of cochrane-orcutt ; excluding dod- cdmrp funding from the dependent variable ; limiting the sample to fatal diseases ; controlling for disability-adjusted life-years lost in addition to mortality ; including hiv/aids and breast cancer in the analysis ; and coding patients ’ race and gender as a percentage instead of as a dichotomous variable .
the key findings were very similar in all models .
results are available from the author upon request .
27 .
i use the absolute number of witnesses and lobbying expenditures as independent variables ( rather than changes in these numbers ) because the modal value for these variables is zero .
in many cases , the first-differ- enced versions of these variables would have negative values the year after a disease ’ s advocacy organizations lobbied or testified in congress .
these models would implicitly predict that a disease whose advocates had been active the previous year would do worse the fol- lowing year than diseases with no advocacy .
28 .
when hiv/aids and breast cancer are included , the coefficients for lobbying and witnesses increase dramatically .
29 .
because they vary over time , these alternate mea- sures allow me to ask whether the race and gender effects operate between or within diseases .
when i include disease fixed effects , the race and gender coefficients are close to zero , indicating that within diseases , changes in patients ’ demographics do not affect research funding .
perhaps short-term demo- graphic changes do not lead to substantial changes in organizing or in public perceptions of a disease .
rather , the race and gender effects are driven by diseases that are consistently “ raced ” or “ gendered ” in the public imagination .
30 .
this finding is separate from the pattern in which funding responds to changes in mortality , increas- ing as diseases become more prevalent .
these adjustments are reflected in the positive coefficient for change in deaths , not for the absolute number of deaths .
31 .
carpenter ( 2010 ) describes a similar case of a metric for evaluation changing a federal agency ’ s actions .
in the 1970s , academics and advocates criticized the food and drug administration ( fda ) for being too slow to approve new drugs .
they judged the fda ’ s performance by the number of new chemical entities approved per year and the average lag between drug approvals in europe and the united states .
after facing public criticism on the basis of these metrics , the fda began keeping data on them , discussing them in reports , and considering them when making decisions ( carpenter 2010 ) .
32 .
model 5 also controls for advocacy .
holding non- profits , lobbying , and witnesses constant , we still see a large positive coefficient for mortality , indicat- ing that the effect is not an artifact of higher-mortality diseases being targeted by more advocacy .
33 .
a similar change occurred at the fda .
in the 1960s , the fda ’ s main external critics were scientists , industry representatives , medical professionals , and congress ; this changed in the 1970s and 1980s as cancer and aids patients began to challenge the fda ’ s practices ( carpenter 2010 ) .
34 .
i used wordij software ( danowski 2009a , 2009b ) to track the frequency with which names of nih institutes were mentioned in close proximity to words referring to patients : patient ( s ) , sufferer ( s ) , survivor ( s ) , affected , individuals , person , people , women , woman , men , and man .
several measures of proximity revealed similar increases over time : within witnesses , within sentences , and within win- dows of three to ten words .
35 .
these funding deficits are substantial , given that the total 2005 funding levels for lung cancer and liver cancer were $ 180 million and $ 50 million , respectively .
36 .
i focused on patients ’ race and gender , but distribu- tive changes may occur across any variable correlated with advocacy .
disease advocacy may have caused distributive changes based on other characteristics , including patients ’ social class or age and diseases ’ causes or psychiatric nature .
best 799 37 .
epstein ( 2007 ) describes another case in which advocates ’ use of categories constrained scientific autonomy .
advocates assumed that race and gender would be meaningful biological categories for the conduct of scientific research .
this successful “ cat- egorical alignment ” resulted in mandates to include research subjects of varying races and genders and to analyze scientific results by race and gender .
38 .
this process has occurred in other realms as well , as when the crime victims ’ movement asserted their interest in sentencing policy ( elias 1985 ) .
39 .
smith ( 1984 ) similarly argues that although policy- makers ’ values change slowly , their perceptions of which values are relevant to a particular policy are relatively fluid .

healthy-left , unhealthy-right : can displaying healthy items to the left ( versus right ) of unhealthy items nudge healthier choices ?
marisabel romero dipayan biswas would laterally displaying a healthy item to the left versus right of an unhealthy item influence choice and consumption ?
the results of seven studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items enhances prefer- ence for the healthy options .
in addition , consumption volume of a healthy item ( vis- à-vis an unhealthy item ) is higher when it is placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the un- healthy item .
we propose that a “ healthy-left , unhealthy-right ” ( vs. healthy-right , un- healthy-left ) lateral display pattern is congruent with consumers ’ mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness , which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control , thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choos- ing healthy options .
while prior studies have examined the role of several factors in influencing choices between healthy and unhealthy options , the present research is the first to demonstrate the effects of lateral display positions of healthy/unhealthy options on choice and healthful consumption .
the findings of our research have im- portant implications for designing retail food displays and restaurant menus as well as for conducting research studies involving healthy and unhealthy food displays .
keywords : healthy and unhealthy choices , lateral visual display position , food and beverage consumption , sensory marketing would the lateral display patterns of food items influ-ence choice ?
more specifically , would displaying healthy item ( s ) on the left and unhealthy item ( s ) on the right lead to different choice outcomes than displaying the items in the opposite pattern ?
the results of our experiments show that not only does the lateral display pattern of healthy and unhealthy items influence choice , it also has consequential effects on consumption volume .
the findings of our re- search have important conceptual and practical implications , especially in light of growing worldwide concerns related to obesity and a heightened focus on encouraging healthful consumption .
also , given that marketers have considerable flexibility in terms of how they display food items in retail outlets and restaurant menus , they can use the findings of this research to design optimal display patterns that are aligned with their objectives in terms of consumer choices .
building on research in the domain of left-to-right or- ganization of stimuli ( bueti and walsh 2009 ; casasanto 2009 ; lourenco and longo 2010 ) , we propose and find that the lateral position of healthy/unhealthy foods influences choices .
specifically , we demonstrate that when a healthy and an unhealthy item are organized laterally , there is rela- tively greater preference for the healthy option when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option .
furthermore , we propose and find that consumers ’ natural marisabel romero ( romerom @ usf.edu ) is a ph.d. candidate , university of south florida , tampa , fl 33620 .

43 2016 doi : 10.1093/jcr/ucw008 103 tendency is to mentally organize healthy items to the left of unhealthy items , which in turn influences self-control and food choices .
we base these propositions on research related to spatial representation of magnitude , in which individuals tend to mentally map increases in magnitude from left to right ( chae and hoegg 2013 ; kadosh et al .
2008 ) .
to elaborate , research shows that individuals hold a generalized system of magnitude representation in which dimensions such as time duration , number magnitude , and spatial extent are mentally organized in increasing magni- tude from left to right ( bueti and walsh 2009 ; lourenco and longo 2010 ; walsh 2003 ) .
in the context of foods , a healthy item is perceived to be less heavy ( deng and kahn 2009 ) , lower in calories ( chandon and wansink 2007 ) , less filling ( oakes 2006 ) , and even less tasty ( raghunathan , naylor , and hoyer 2006 ) than an unhealthy item .
since stimuli of lower magnitude tend to be mentally organized on the left and those of higher magnitude tend to be men- tally represented on the right ( e.g. , hubbard et al .
2005 ) , we propose that consumers naturally represent healthy items to the left of unhealthy items .
additional evidence in favor of this mental representation model is provided by the body-specificity theory ( casasanto and chrysikou 2011 ) that proposes individuals link desirable products to their dominant side and undesirable products to their nondomi- nant side ( brookshire and casasanto 2012 ) .
incidentally , about 90 % of the world population is right-handed ( eelen , dewitte , and warlop 2013 ) .
since consumers often deem unhealthy ( vs. healthy ) foods as inducing more favorable affect ( shiv and fedorikhin 1999 ) as well as being more de- sirable and tempting ( hofmann et al .
2010 ) , most individ- uals should mentally associate unhealthy foods with the right lateral field .
studies across different research streams have shown that when mental representations are congruent ( vs. incon- gruent ) with display patterns , ease of processing is higher ( chae and hoegg 2013 ; lee and aaker 2004 ) .
hence food displays that are congruent ( vs. incongruent ) with con- sumers ’ mental representation should facilitate greater ease of processing .
moreover , ease of processing should enhance self-control and facilitate resistance to temptation , which in turn should lead to a higher likelihood of choosing healthier options ( shiv and fedorikhin 1999 ) .
accordingly , we hy- pothesize that choice likelihood of the healthier option will be higher when the healthy items are displayed laterally to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items .
we examine this phe- nomenon with the help of seven studies .
study 1a : display positions of healthy and unhealthy items design , participants , and procedure study 1a was a between-subjects experiment with two manipulated conditions ( healthy items displayed to the left vs. right of unhealthy items ) .
a restaurant menu was used ; the menu featured a picture of a healthy item ( chicken salad ) and of an unhealthy item ( bacon cheeseburger ) .
the menu also had a listing of four healthy items and four un- healthy items .
( the appendix and online appendix a pro- vide menu details . )
to ensure ecological validity , the food items presented on the menu and the overall menu layout were similar to those used by an actual restaurant .
first , a pretest ( n¼ 22 ; average age¼ 37 years , 50 % female ) verified the healthiness/unhealthiness of the items chosen .
participants rated the perceived healthfulness of the eight menu items ( appendix ) on a 7-point scale ( 1 ¼ not at all healthy , 7¼ very healthy ) .
the four salad entrees were perceived as healthier ( m¼ 4.59 ) than the four burger entrees ( m¼ 2.86 ; t ( 21 ) ¼ 4.91 , p < .01 ) .
consistent with this pretest finding , we coded participants ’ choice for any of the four salads as healthy and choices for the four bur- gers were coded as unhealthy .
in the main study , 48 respondents recruited through an online ( mechanical turk [ mturk ] ) panel ( average age¼ 35 years ; 50 % female , 90 % right-handed ) partici- pated in exchange for monetary compensation .
they were evenly and randomly assigned to either the “ healthy-left , unhealthy-right ” or the “ healthy-right , unhealthy-left ” con- dition .
participants viewed a menu and were told that the menu was from a new restaurant and that all portions and prices across the different options were equivalent .
they then selected one menu item they would like to eat if they were visiting this restaurant .
finally , they provided general demographic information .
results and discussion consistent with our hypothesis , there was greater prefer- ence for the healthy items when they were displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy items on the menu ( 58.33 % vs. 29.16 % ; v2¼ 4.15 , p < .05 ) .
next , study 1b replicated these effects using a simpler choice set—one healthy item and one unhealthy item .
also , study 1a used online ( mturk ) participants ; study 1b was conducted in a con- trolled lab setting .
study 1b : lateral display of a healthy and an unhealthy item study 1b replicated the findings of study 1a by asking participants to choose an item from a set of two food op- tions : one healthy and one unhealthy .
a total of 93 students ( average age 22 years , 57 % female , 87 % right-handed ) from a major us university participated in this study in ex- change for course credit .
broccoli salad was used as the healthy item ; grilled cheese sandwich was the unhealthy item ( e.g. , chernev 2011 ) .
participants first arrived at a waiting area and were then brought into a computer lab by a research assistant .
participants had to click through the 104 journal of consumer research introduction page to go to the page ( on the computer screen ) that displayed the food items .
in one condition , the broccoli salad was displayed on the left and the grilled cheese sandwich was displayed on the right .
in the other condition , this pattern was reversed ( details in online ap- pendix b ) .
the computer software randomly assigned each participant to an experimental condition .
after viewing the images of the food items , participants indicated their pref- erence for one of the items .
consistent with our hypothesis and the findings of study 1a , preference for the healthy item ( broccoli salad ) was relatively higher when it was on the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item ( 41.30 % vs. 19.14 % ; v2¼ 5.42 , p < .05 ) .
this replicates the finding of study 1a using a dis- play pattern that featured only two food items , one healthy and one unhealthy .
next , studies 2a and 2b provide evi- dence of the left-to-right mental organization of healthy and unhealthy foods .
studies 2a and 2b : organizing items in different lateral fields procedure study 2a tested whether consumers naturally organize healthy and unhealthy concepts in different lateral fields .
we employed a conceptual classification task , similar to a procedure used in prior studies ( e.g. , casasanto 2009 ) .
seventy-eight participants recruited from an online ( mturk ) panel ( average age 31 years , 30 % female , 90 % right-handed ) performed a task in which they were asked to place word pairs on the left versus right lateral field .
there were two empty boxes on a computer screen ( one on the left side and one on the right side of the screen ) .
for each trial , participants indicated which one of the two words they would place in the left box .
the focal word pairs were “ eating healthy–indulging , ” “ strawberries– cheesecake , ” “ nutrition–pleasure , ” “ grilled chicken–fried chicken , ” and “ healthy foods–unhealthy foods. ” the order of presentation of the words in the pairs was counterbal- anced .
in terms of counterbalancing , there were order ef- fects for the “ nutrition–pleasure ” pairing and a marginally significant effect for the “ eating healthy–indulging ” pair- ing ; however , we did not find order effects ( p > .10 ) for any of the other relevant word pairs .
to avoid hypothesis guessing , filler trials were included : “ email–call , ” “ fruit salad–apples , ” “ bat–net , ” and “ work–enjoyment. ” results and discussion overall , participants consistently associated the healthy ( vs. unhealthy ) concept with the left lateral field .
specifically , for the “ eating healthy–indulging ” word pair , 64.10 % of participants indicated that eating healthy belonged on the left ( v2¼ 6.20 , p < .05 ) ; for the “ nutrition– pleasure ” word pair , 62.82 % of participants placed “ nutri- tion ” on the left ( v2¼ 5.13 , p < .05 ) , and for the “ healthy foods–unhealthy foods ” word pair , 71.79 % of participants placed “ healthy foods ” on the left ( v2¼ 14.82 , p < .01 ) .
additionally , for the specific food pairings , we found the same trend , whereby 65.38 % of respondents placed straw- berries ( vs. cheesecake ) on the left ( v2¼ 7.38 , p < .01 ) , and 64.10 % placed grilled chicken ( vs. fried chicken ) on the left ( v2¼ 6.20 , p < .05 ) .
handedness did not influence place- ment decisions ( p > .10 ) .
the results of this study provide evidence for our the- oretical claim that a healthy option is mentally represented to be on the left of an unhealthy option .
also , this study eliminates the possibility of items being organized alpha- betically .
for example , the word pairing “ strawberries– cheesecake ” reveals the same pattern of results even though the healthy ( unhealthy ) item begins with the letter “ s ” ( “ c ” ) .
the same holds for the “ grilled chicken ” and “ fried chicken ” pair .
in a follow-up study ( 2b ) , we replicated our findings in the context of a menu design task .
forty-four respon- dents from an online ( mturk ) panel ( average age 29 years , 34 % female , 91 % right-handed ) were asked to place two food items , a grilled chicken sandwich ( healthy item ) and a fried chicken sandwich ( unhealthy item ) , on different sides of a blank menu .
the presentation of the items was coun- terbalanced to avoid order effects .
as theorized , a greater proportion of participants placed the healthy ( unhealthy ) item on the left ( right ) side of the menu compared to plac- ing the healthy ( unhealthy ) item on the right ( left ) side ( 70.45 % vs. 29.55 % ; v2¼ 7.36 , p < .01 ) .
no order effects were found for the counterbalanced presentation of the items ( p > .10 ) .
these results provide additional support for the theoretical claim related to mental representation of healthy items being to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items .
next , study 3 rules out an alternative explanation for the effects observed in studies 1a and 1b .
study 3 : ruling out left-side bias effects the results of studies 1a and 1b show that preference for the healthy item is higher when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item .
a corollary to that finding is that preference for the unhealthy item is also higher when it is displayed on the left ( vs. right ) .
we proposed a mental representation explanation and found empirical evi- dence of that claim in studies 2a and 2b .
nevertheless , a potential alternative explanation for the findings of studies 1a and 1b is a left-side bias , whereby there is greater over- all preference for the item displayed on the left , irrespec- tive of whether it is healthy or unhealthy .
hence in study 3 , we examined this alternative explanation .
specifically , while in studies 1a and 1b we displayed healthy/unhealthy romero and biswas 105 items on the left and on the right , in study 3 we also in- cluded a control condition related to displaying the healthy and unhealthy items in a neutral location ( i.e. , the center ) in order to demonstrate how preference for the healthy and unhealthy items changes in comparison to this baseline ( control ) condition .
design , participants , and procedure study 3 was a between-subjects experiment with three manipulated conditions ( healthy left–unhealthy right vs. healthy right–unhealthy left vs. healthy and unhealthy both in center ) .
the last condition ( i.e. , both items in center ) was counterbalanced by having the healthy item on the top and the unhealthy item on the bottom or having this in the reverse pattern .
there were no effects of top versus bottom positions on choice ( v2¼ .30 , p¼ .58 ) .
online appendix c presents the images of the different experimental condi- tions .
strawberries and chocolate cake slice ( both weighing 300 g ) were the healthy and unhealthy options , respec- tively .
a total of 109 students ( average age 24 years , 59 % female , 90 % right-handed ) from a major us university par- ticipated in exchange for course credit .
participants first ar- rived at a waiting area and were subsequently brought into a lab by a research assistant .
the food items were dis- played on a screen in the lab after participants sat in the center of the room .
after seeing the food image , partici- pants indicated their preference on a survey .
one partici- pant ( from the “ healthy right–unhealthy left ” condition ) did not look at the displayed image ; however , keeping or removing this participant did not alter the pattern of results .
results and discussion consistent with the findings observed in studies 1a and 1b , preference for the healthy option was higher when it was displayed on the left ( vs. right ) ( 70.0 % vs. 47.50 % ; v2¼ 3.54 , p¼ .06 ) .
removing the participant who did not look at the image displayed on the screen made the effect stronger ( v2¼ 3.92 , p < .05 ) .
more interestingly , dis- playing the healthy item on the left ( vs. control condition of center ) led to higher preference for the healthy item ( 70.0 % vs. 46.15 % ; v2¼ 3.92 , p < .05 ) , while displaying the unhealthy item on the left ( vs. control condition ) led to a similar preference for the unhealthy item ( 52.50 % vs. 53.85 % ; v2¼ .01 , p¼ .91 ) .
these findings rule out the effects of studies 1a and 1b being attributed to a left-side bias .
specifically , if there were a left-side bias , then preference for the unhealthy item also would have been higher when it was displayed on the left versus at the center .
instead , we find that , com- pared to a baseline ( i.e. , center ) condition , only displaying the healthy item on the left side increases preference ; im- portantly , we see no such effects for the unhealthy item .
next , study 4 rules out another potential alternative explanation .
study 4 : ruling out potential effects of gaze starting point research indicates that when exposed to visual stimuli , people from western societies tend to process the informa- tion starting from the left visual field ( chae and hoegg 2013 ; chokron and de agostini 2000 ; shaki , fischer , and petrusic 2009 ) .
in other words , consumers tend to first no- tice items displayed on their left visual field before notic- ing items on their right visual field .
hence the findings observed in studies 1a and 1b could be attributed to pri- macy effects ( biswas , grewal , and roggeveen 2010 ; biswas et al .
2014 ) whereby consumers notice the healthy item first , leading to higher preference for the healthy item .
to rule out primacy effects as an alternative explanation , in study 4 , we manipulated gaze starting point position ( left vs. right ) to test whether it alters the pattern of findings .
method study 4 was a 2 ( healthy item displayed to the left vs. right of the unhealthy item ) 2 ( gaze starting point : left vs. right ) between-subjects experiment .
a total of 169 stu- dents ( average age 23 years , 48 % female , 91 % right- handed ) from a major us university participated in ex- change for course credit .
we selected raisins as the healthy option and chocolate chip cookies as the unhealthy option ( e.g. , laran 2010 ) .
as in studies 1 and 3 , we manipulated the first factor by presenting the healthy item to the left versus right of the unhealthy item .
we also manipulated the location of the gaze starting point by asking partici- pants to focus on a fixation cross ( adapted from mormann et al .
2012 ) , which was presented on the left versus right side of the screen .
participants first arrived at a waiting area .
they were then brought into a lab and instructed to take a seat in the center of the room .
the images of the food items were projected on a screen located in the front of the lab .
before showing the two food items , participants were asked to fo- cus on a fixation image ( i.e. , a cross ) placed on either the left or right side of the screen .
with participants fixating on the cross , the slide changed and transitioned into an im- age of two food options laterally displayed ( with the healthy and unhealthy items displayed in a left-right vs. right-left pattern ) .
after this , participants indicated their food choice on a survey .
results and discussion the results of a 2 2 logistic regression revealed a sig- nificant main effect of display position on choice ( wald 106 journal of consumer research v2¼ 7.78 , p < .01 ) .
the interaction effect and the main ef- fect of gaze starting point were nonsignificant ( p ’ s > .95 ) , which rules out gaze starting point as an alternative expla- nation for the effects of lateral display positions on choice .
contrast tests showed that overall , there was a main effect of display position , whereby consistent with the find- ings of our earlier studies , preference for the healthy option was higher when it was displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option ( 26.93 % vs. 9.89 % ; v2¼ 8.34 , p < .01 ) .
for the “ left gaze starting ” condition , preference for the healthy option was higher when it was displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option ( 26.83 % vs. 9.80 % ; v2¼ 4.59 , p < .05 ) , and the pattern of results re- mained the same for the “ right gaze starting ” condition ( 27.03 % vs. 10.0 % ; v2¼ 3.75 , p¼ .05 ) .
the results of study 4 demonstrate higher preference for the healthy option when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy option , and this pattern persists irre- spective of the initial fixation position .
hence these find- ings rule out primacy effects , of noticing items on the left first , as a potential alternative explanation for the effects observed in our studies .
next , study 5 demonstrates a downstream behavioral outcome of lateral display positions .
study 5 : effects of display position on consumption volume in our previous studies , participants indicated their pref- erence for a single item that was either healthy or un- healthy .
however , in many real-world contexts , consumers might be able to undertake consumption involving a com- bination of both healthy and unhealthy items ( chandon and wansink 2007 ) .
moreover , in our earlier studies , partici- pants indicated preferences , but there were no serious con- sequences of their choices in terms of amount of consumption .
hence study 5 incorporates an important consequential element in the choice process , whereby par- ticipants were allowed to consume healthy and unhealthy items in whatever quantities they wanted .
the results of our studies show that displaying healthy items to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items nudges healthful choices .
along similar lines , we expect consump- tion volume of the healthy item ( vis-à-vis the unhealthy item ) will be higher when it is placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item .
design , participants , and procedure study 5 was a mixed-design experiment where the dis- play positions of the beverages were manipulated across two between-subjects conditions ( healthy beverage dis- played to the left vs. right of the unhealthy beverage ) ; con- sumption of healthy and unhealthy drinks was measured within subjects .
sixty students ( average age 24 years , 50 % female ) from a major us university participated in this study .
the healthy beverage was a low-calorie orange juice with high vitamin content ; the unhealthy beverage was a high-calorie synthetic orange soda with no vitamin content .
the beverages had comparable color and texture .
a pretest ( n¼ 30 ) confirmed ( on a 1 to 7 scale ) that the low-calorie orange juice was perceived as healthier than the high-calo- rie orange soda ( mjuice¼ 5.20 vs. msoda¼ 1.50 , t ( 29 ) ¼ 14.54 , p < .01 ) .
for the main study , participants arrived at a waiting area .
they were then brought into a lab and asked to sit at specific desks .
before bringing in the participants to the lab , a research assistant placed a healthy beverage to the left ( vs. right ) of an unhealthy beverage based on where the participants would be seated .
the serving size for the beverages was 3.5 oz .
each .
first , participants were provided with information about the calorie and nutrition contents of each respective beverage and were asked to take a look at each beverage .
they were then told that they could drink as much or as lit- tle of each beverage as they wanted .
the key dependent variable , consumption volume , was measured by weighing the cups before and after consumption ( i.e. , before partici- pants arrived and after they left the lab ) .
toward the end of the survey , participants were also asked to indicate how they were feeling at that moment , on six different items based on 1 to 7 scales ( such as bad–good , sad–happy , calm–excited , tired–energetic ) .
these items did not differ in their ratings across the two manipulated conditions ( all p ’ s > .25 ) and hence are not discussed any further .
results and discussion the results of a 2 ( lateral display pattern of healthy/un- healthy options ) 2 ( consumption of healthy and unhealthy beverages ) mixed analysis of variance revealed a margin- ally significant interaction effect ( f ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ 3.45 , p < .07 ) .
follow-up tests showed that participants consumed a higher volume of the healthy beverage when it was placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy beverage ( mleft¼ 1.79 oz .
vs. mright¼ 1.14 oz .
; f ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ 4.86 , p < .05 ) .
interestingly , the lateral position of the unhealthy item did not influence its consumption volume ( means¼ 1.27 oz .
vs. 1.07 oz .
; f ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ .43 , p¼ .52 ) .
additionally , we find that participants had a higher in- take of the healthy ( vs. unhealthy ) beverage only when the healthy beverage was on the left ( means¼ 1.79 vs. 1.27 ; f ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ 10.76 , p < .01 ) .
however , when the healthy bev- erage was on the right , participants consumed an equal amount of the healthy and unhealthy beverages ( means¼ 1.14 vs. 1.07 ; f ( 1 , 58 ) ¼ .12 , p¼ .74 ) .
online appendix d graphically presents the key results of this study .
study 5 demonstrates an important behavioral out- come of lateral positions of healthy and unhealthy items in romero and biswas 107 the form of overall consumption volume .
specifically , when having the option to consume both healthy and un- healthy beverages , participants had a higher intake of the healthy beverage ( vis-à-vis the unhealthy beverage ) when it was displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy bev- erage .
at a broader level , while product choice is an impor- tant managerially relevant variable , overall consumption volume has strong practical implications for health and well-being .
in that regard , study 5 , which examines how the lateral positions of a healthy and an unhealthy item might influence consumption volume of each item , has strong substantive implications .
general discussion summary and conclusions we examined the effects of lateral positions of healthy and unhealthy food items on choice and consumption vol- ume across a robust set of food items .
the results of our seven studies demonstrate that in a scenario involving healthy and unhealthy food items placed at different lateral positions , consumers are more likely to choose the healthy item when it is displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of the un- healthy food item .
we also found that when given the op- tion to consume both healthy and unhealthy items placed at different lateral positions , consumption volume of the healthy item ( vis-à-vis the unhealthy item ) is higher when it is placed to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy item .
we base our propositions on research related to spatial representation of magnitude in which individuals tend to mentally map increases in magnitude from left to right ( kadosh et al .
2008 ) .
thus , in the context of food , un- healthy items with relatively higher affective values ( shiv and fedorikhin 1999 ) , higher perceived taste ( raghunathan et al .
2006 ) , higher desirability , and greater temptation as- sociations ( hofmann et al .
2010 ) are likely to be organized to the right of healthy items .
furthermore , we conceptual- ize that when food items are laterally displayed in a man- ner congruent ( vs. incongruent ) with consumers ’ natural mental representation , it enhances the likelihood of choos- ing healthier options .
to elaborate , we propose that consumers experience greater self-control when healthy/unhealthy items are dis- played in a manner congruent with their natural mental rep- resentation .
that is , as demonstrated by studies 2a and 2b , consumers tend to mentally represent healthy items to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items .
hence a display pattern that is congruent with this mental representation should fa- cilitate ease of information processing , which in turn should enhance self-control and resistance to temptation ( e.g. , shiv and fedorikhin 1999 ) , thereby leading to a rela- tively higher likelihood of choosing healthy options .
online appendices e and f report the results of two experi- ments that provide empirical evidence regarding the role of self-control as a mediator for the effects of healthy/un- healthy food display positions on choice .
another related ( but conceptually different ) explana- tion for our observed effects is that encountering a display pattern that is congruent ( vs. incongruent ) with the natural mental representation increases consumers ’ belief that they are capable of exerting self-control .
this is in line with re- cent research linking processing fluency to self-efficacy judgments ( white , macdonnell , and dahl 2011 ) .
clearly , additional research is needed to examine these underlying processes in greater depth .
although there can be several possible explanations for our findings , based on the results of study 3 , resource depletion is not a viable alternative explanation for the ob- served effects .
specifically , a resource depletion model would imply that compared to the baseline condition , choice likelihood for the healthy option should be lower for the condition with a high level of cognitive resource de- pletion ; in contrast , choice likelihood for the healthy option should be similar for the baseline condition and the condi- tion with a low level of cognitive resource depletion .
in study 3 , the “ healthy-right ” ( “ healthy-left ” ) condition was incongruent ( congruent ) to the natural mental representa- tion and hence required higher ( lower ) cognitive resources .
so a resource depletion model would predict choice likeli- hood difference between the baseline and the “ healthy- right ” conditions and no difference between the baseline and the “ healthy-left ” conditions .
however , we find a greater likelihood of healthy food choices in the “ healthy- left ” ( vs. baseline ) condition , effectively ruling out the al- ternative explanation related to a resource depletion model .
similarly , the results of study 2a rule out the role of price as an alternative explanation .
specifically , research shows that consumers place less expensive items on the left than on the right ( cai , shen , and hui 2012 ; valenzuela and raghubir 2015 ) and perceive healthy items as more expensive than unhealthy items ( drewnowski and barratt- fornell 2004 ) ; however , the findings of study 2a demon- strate effects in the opposite direction .
the findings of this research have important concep- tual implications .
while prior research has examined dif- ferent factors that can influence choices between healthy versus unhealthy foods , such as affective/cognitive states ( shiv and fedorikhin 1999 ) , temptation ( dhar and wertenbroch 2000 ) , body types of others ( mcferran et al .
2010 ) , assortment structure ( kahn and wansink 2004 ) , self-control ( baumeister 2002 ; kivetz and simonson 2002 ) , and health claims ( chandon and wansink 2007 ) , among others , no study , to the best of our knowledge , has examined the effects of lateral display positions of healthy and unhealthy options on consumer choices .
the present research takes an important step in this direction .
in es- sence , choosing between healthy and unhealthy options of- ten entails trading off between short-term benefits in terms of taste/pleasure and long-term benefits in terms of health/ 108 journal of consumer research well-being .
as a result , self-control in resisting temptation plays an influential role in determining final choice out- come between healthy and unhealthy options .
our research shows that laterally displaying healthy options to the left ( compared to the right ) of unhealthy options is congruent with their natural mental representation .
this increases ease of processing and enhances self-control , which in turn increases the likelihood of choosing the healthy option ( the experiments reported in online appendices e and f provide empirical evidence regarding the role of self- control ) .
our findings also contribute to research in the domain of sensory marketing and specifically to the domain of vi- sual marketing .
in particular , visual cues are usually en- countered prior to other sensory cues ( e.g. , olfactory , gustatory , haptic , or auditory ) because they usually require the least amount of proximity and are processed faster neu- rologically compared to the other sensory cues ( herz and engen 1996 ) .
hence , not surprisingly , visual cues play a dominant role in influencing food choices and evaluations ( biswas et al .
2014 ; chandon and ordabayeva 2009 ; hoegg and alba 2007 ) .
the findings of our research add to this growing literature in the domain of visual marketing by highlighting how subtle cues such as lateral visual posi- tions can influence healthful choices .
additionally , the findings of this research contribute to the literature on lateral and visual field positions .
prior studies examining lateral positions and mental representa- tion of magnitude have focused on a variety of topic do- mains such as number processing , time perception , aesthetics , and ad evaluations ( calabria and rossetti 2005 ; chae and hoegg 2013 ; chokron and de agostini 2000 ; janiszewski 1990 , 1993 ) .
also , previous research has dem- onstrated how items displayed in the center lead to higher preference and value inferences ( raghubir and valenzuela 2006 ; valenzuela and raghubir 2009 ) , as well as higher vi- sual attention ( atalay , bodur , and rasolofoarison 2012 ) .
the present study , however , is the first to examine how lat- eral display patterns of healthy and unhealthy food options influence choice and consumption volume .
our research also has potentially serious implications for lab-based ( or even field-based ) research studies involv- ing healthy and unhealthy options .
at the very least , the lateral display positions ( left vs. right ) of healthy and un- healthy items need to be counterbalanced for such research studies .
this is an important issue that future research stud- ies need to factor in when designing studies/experiments involving food displays , to avoid potential confounding ef- fects related to lateral display positions .
implications for managers , regulators , and consumers the findings of our study have interesting implications for retail product displays and menu designs .
for instance , if a store wants to enhance sales of their healthy items , they can display them to the left ( vs. right ) of the unhealthy options , from the consumer ’ s visual perspective .
similarly , while designing restaurant menus , a restaurant wanting to enhance sales of healthy food items might want to display the healthy items on the left side of the menu and the un- healthy items on the right side .
with growing trends toward focusing on healthy eating , optimal menu designs can help restaurant managers in driving sales of healthy versus un- healthy items .
incidentally , while there is high interest in the popular press about the psychological aspects of menu designs ( zhang 2014 ) , there is very limited research in the marketing academic literature examining psychological phenomena behind menu design .
our research aims to take an important step in this direction by identifying how lat- eral display patterns of healthy/unhealthy items on a menu can potentially influence choice .
clearly , additional stud- ies , especially in field settings , are needed to examine this phenomenon in greater depth .
given the worldwide concerns related to obesity and factors influencing choices for healthy ( vs. unhealthy ) op- tions , understanding how visual cues influence choice has important consequential implications .
in particular , pol- icymakers could use the findings of this research to nudge consumers toward healthier choices .
specifically , the find- ings of this research have implications for consumer welfare in terms of facilitating healthy choice behavior .
policymakers and consumers might want to promote having healthy items displayed to the left ( vs. right ) of unhealthy items in order to nudge healthier food choices and consumption .
limitations and future research directions in our studies , we examined only healthy and unhealthy items , while many food items might be “ neutral ” ( i.e. , nei- ther healthy nor unhealthy ) .
additional studies are required to examine how the left-to-right mental organization holds for “ neutral ” products .
similarly , there can be several rele- vant moderators that can influence the pattern of effects observed in this research .
for instance , would a person ’ s orientation toward a healthy lifestyle or health goals influ- ence the results observed here ?
cultural background can be another relevant moderator .
that is , in our studies , all the participants were based in the united states and were ex- pected to be oriented to process information from left to right .
it will be interesting to examine if the pattern of our results hold for consumers who tend to read and process in- formation from right to left .
in this research , we focused primarily on the interest- ing effects of lateral display positions of food items on choice .
we did not explore the underlying processes in depth .
while we report the findings of process studies dem- onstrating mediating effects , in online appendices e and f , there is scope for additional research on the process front .
romero and biswas 109 in other words , future research should explore the underly- ing process in greater depth .
as mentioned previously , something “ good ” ( or “ pos- itive ” ) is often represented on the right , whereas something “ bad ” ( or “ negative ” ) is represented on the left ( casasanto 2009 ) .
from a scholarly or regulatory perspective , healthy ( unhealthy ) items are considered to be “ good ” ( “ bad ” ) .
however , from a consumer standpoint , “ good ” can refer to “ good taste ” ( and not necessarily “ good for you in the long term ” ) , as has been highlighted earlier .
hence the situa- tional concept of what is considered “ good ” or “ bad ” might moderate the effects observed in our studies .
similarly , can the handedness ( right vs. left ) of a person moderate our ef- fects ?
this can be even more interesting when considering individuals who have flexible concepts of handedness ( eelen et al .
2013 ) .
this research focused on the effects of lateral displays of food items on the left versus on the right .
future re- search can extend this by examining the implications of display patterns in other formats , such as vertical ( top-bot- tom ) displays of healthy and unhealthy items .
given the relatively nascent stage of research on effects of food dis- play patterns , there is scope for significant additional work in this area .
finally , while it is important to understand choices be- tween healthy and unhealthy options , display positions can possibly also bias choices in other marketplace scenarios ( chandon et al .
2009 ) .
for example , would lateral positions of two items , with different price or indulgence levels , influ- ence choice ?
such studies would be conceptually interesting and have relevant managerial implications .
indeed , with hardly any research examining the effects of lateral display positions of products on choice , there is scope for substantial future research studies in this domain .
we hope our research will encourage work in these and related areas .
