However, most prior studies do not account sufficiently for how and why these reference points vary across employees, even if they work within the same or similar organizational contexts. While the effects of contemporaneous employee attitudes on perceptions of red tape have been considered in prior analyses, how do perceptions of organizational rules and procedures as red tape relate to workers' prior career trajectories and occupational contexts? Variable norms and expectations across organizations as well as across the public and private sectors may produce different attitudes toward rules and procedures. Of equal import, current occupational characteristics are relatively unexamined in studies of worker perceptions of red tape. Using a survey of state level public managers, this paper examines how employees' perceptions of red tape are mediated by their prior career trajectories and experiences, as well as by their occupational context. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","author_address":"[Ponomariov, Branco L.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Publ Adm, San Antonio, TX USA; [Boardman, P.

We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. Research Design and Methods: We conducted two online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards, COVID-19 beliefs, social distancing behaviors, and mental health symptoms. We used the initial study (N = 233) to form our hypotheses about social distancing behaviors and we ran the second, pre-registered study (N = 243) to determine if these relationships replicated.Results: We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Although older adults reported being more likely to contract Covid-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall Covid-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. Discussion and Implications: These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.","author_address":"na","reprint_address":"na","author_email":"na","funding":"na","publisher":"na","publisher_address":"na","ISSN_WOS":"na","eISSN":"na","pub_year_WOS":"na","volume":"na","issue":"na","DOI_WOS":"na","WOS_category":"na","category":"na","accession_number":"na","pg":"na","author_last_WOS":"na","author_first_WOS":"na","published":"2020-07-17","pdf_filename":"Seaman_covid_9NDq","claim2_abstract":"We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior.","coded_claim2":"We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior.","claim2_pg":2.0,"claim2_start":941.0,"claim2_box":"(x1: 117.28 y1: 379.80) (x2: 316.51 y2: 443.03)","claim3a_concretehyp":"It is possible that the decrease in everyday social interaction will increase the value of social-related rewards.
