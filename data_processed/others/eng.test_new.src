importantly , the prediction of performance on intelligence tests by the self‐ concept of intelligence was shown to be independent of self‐ esteem ( study 3 ) .
in each study , assessment of participants ’ esci and isci was followed by a standard intelligence test focusing on crystallized intelligence ( study 1 ) , fluid intelligence ( study 2 ) or both ( study 3 ) .
in study 3 , we additionally assessed explicit and implicit self‐ esteem to establish that the observed effects were independent from or incremental to matters of self‐esteem ( hypothesis 3 ) .
study 1 study 1 was also conducted with the goal of establishing a psychometrically sound measure of individual differences on isci and to test its moderating effect .
method participants seventy‐four students ( 63 women , 11 men ) of a variety of majors at the university of koblenz‐landau participated in this study in exchange for monetary compensation .
for the purpose of estimating its internal consistency , the iat was split into four parts by applying the scoring algorithm separately to these four subsets , and then cronbach ’ s alpha was calculated and examined ( see also greenwald et al. , 2003 ) .
results internal consistencies ( cronbach ’ s alpha ) associated with each variable , descriptive statistics of each variable and intercorrelations between the variables are presented in table 3 .
the hypotheses were tested by regressing crystallized intelligence test scores on isci , esci and their interaction term , r2 = .31 .
the analysis revealed a significant main effect of esci , β= .41 , t ( 70 ) = 4.08 , p < .01 .
importantly , this effect was qualified by a significant two‐way interaction between isci and esci , β= .33 , t ( 70 ) = 3.25 , p < .01 ( supporting hypothesis 2 ) .
simple slope analysis revealed that individuals with a high esci showed a significant positive relationship between isci and mwta , β= .36 , t ( 70 ) = 2.43 , p < .05 ( see figure 1 ) .
the relationship between isci and mwta among individuals with a low esci , defined as an esci at least one standard deviation below the mean , was negative and significant , β= −.31 , t ( 70 ) = 2.14 , p= .05 , suggesting that individuals with a consistently low sci performed better than individuals with a modest sci ( low esci and high isci ) .
study 2 to replicate the findings from study 1 and to further extend them with respect to the intelligence construct , in study 2 , the advanced progressive matrices ( raven , raven , & court , 2003 ) were used as a measure of intelligence .
constructs and measurement instruments the measures of isci and esci employed in study 2 were identical to those used in study 1 .
procedure the procedure used in study 2 was very similar to the procedure used in study 1 .

results the descriptive statistics and internal consistency statistics ( cronbach ’ s alpha ) for all measures in study 2 are reported in table 4 .
as in study 1 , no gender differences regarding esci and isci were found .
performance‐ based assessment of intelligence paralleling the analysis used in study 1 , all variables were centred , and the cross product of isci and esci was calculated to create the interaction term for the regression analysis ( aiken & west , 1991 ) .
performance‐based assessment of intelligence scores were regressed on isci , esci and their interaction term , r2 = .28 .
the main effect of esci was significant , β = .49 , t ( 51 ) = 3.82 , p < .01 , indicating that participants with a high esci tended to achieve higher scores on the intelligence test ( raven matrices ; supporting hypothesis 1 ) .
as predicted , however , this effect was qualified by a significant interaction between isci and esci , β= .27 , t ( 51 ) = 2.16 , p < .05 ( see figure 2 ; supporting hypothesis 2 ) .
simple slope tests revealed that , among participants with a high esci ( +1 sd ) , there was a significant positive relationship between isci and the raven matrices score , β= .43 , t ( 51 ) = 2.05 , p < .05 .
discussion the results of study 2 corroborated the results of study 1 .
as in study 1 , among individuals who had a high esci , performance‐based assessment of intelligence varied as a function of their level of isci .
the finding that a discrepant sci leads to worse performance also for those individuals with a low esci was found only descriptively in study 2 .
this hypothesis was tested in study 3 .
study 3 although in studies 1 and 2 , the idea of a moderating effect of isci on the relationship between esci and intelligence test scores was tested , the main goal of study 3 was to test whether the relationship between esci and isci and performance‐based assessments of intelligence was unique table 4 .

this question is important for determining whether the effects found in study 1 and study 2 are due to people generally having a positive connotation of intelligence such that the results could be explained by general self‐esteem .
therefore , one goal of study 3 was to determine the discriminant validity of the sci with respect to self‐esteem .
furthermore , hypotheses 1 and 2 from study 1 were tested again .
in study 3 , intelligence was operationalized as and measured by participants ’ perfor- mance on a general intelligence structure test that includes both crystallized intelligence , examined in study 1 , and fluid intelligence , examined in study 2 .
procedure the procedure used in study 3 was similar to the procedures used in studies 1 and 2 .

no significant amount of variance in performance on the intelligence test was predicted by the self‐esteem terms , r2 = .10 .
next , the centred isci score , centred esci score and their interaction term were added to the same regression equation , which led to a significant increase in explained variance , δr2 = .28 .
the regression analysis ( r2 = .38 ) revealed a significant main effect of esci , β= .58 , t ( 104 ) = 6.68 , p < .01 .
furthermore , a significant two‐way interaction between isci and esci , β= .28 , t ( 104 ) = 3.74 , p < .01 , was uncovered .
additional simple slope analyses ( cohen & cohen , 1983 ) revealed a significant positive relationship between isci and scores on the intelligence test for participants with a high esci , β= .36 , t ( 104 ) = 2.43 , p < .05 ( hypothesis 2a ) .
among individuals with a low esci , the relationship between isci and performance on the intelligence test was significantly negatively correlated , β=−.31 , t ( 104 ) = 2.14 , p < .05 , indicating lower performance on the intelligence test for individuals with a modest versus a consistently low sci ( hypothesis 2b ) .
results from study 3 indicated that this effect was independent of implicit and explicit self‐esteem , indicating discriminant validity—and thus the unique , conceptual value—of the isci with respect to implicit self‐esteem .

moreover , this scent had a high association with neatness ( m ¼ 5.44 , sd ¼ 1.33 ) , which was significantly different from the scale middle point of 4 ( t ( 24 ) ¼ 5.43 , p < .001 , r ¼ .74 ) .
participants also rated the lemon-tangerine scentas more pleasant ( m ¼ 5.08 , sd ¼ 1.32 ; t ( 24 ) ¼ 4.09 , p < .001 , r ¼ .64 ) and as more arousing ( m ¼ 4.88 , sd ¼ 1.27 ; t ( 24 ) ¼ 3.47 , p ¼ .002 , r ¼ .58 ) than the scale middle point of 4 .
these criteria led to the selection of the black cherry scent as the scent not associated with neatness ( m ¼ 3.92 , sd ¼ 1.50 ) , not significantly different from the scale middle point of 4 ( t ( 24 ) ¼.27 , p ¼ .79 ) .
respondents found the black cherry scent more pleasant ( m ¼ 5.52 , sd ¼ 1.33 ; t ( 24 ) ¼ 5.73 , p < .001 , r ¼ .76 ) and more arousing ( m¼ 4.64 , sd¼ 1.15 ; t ( 24 ) ¼ 2.78 , p¼ .01 , r¼ .49 ) than the scale middle point of 4 .
moreover , the lemon-tangerine scent and black cherry scent differed on association with neatness ( t ( 24 ) ¼ 5.25 , p < .001 , r ¼ .73 ) , but did not differ on pleasantness ( t ( 24 ) ¼ 1.19 , p ¼ .25 ) and arousing quality ( t ( 24 ) ¼ .86 , p ¼ .40 ) .
a separate pretest ( n ¼ 15 ) was conducted to verify the fit of both scents with casual clothing .
the association of lemon- tangerine scent ( m ¼ 2.40 , sd ¼ 1.72 ) and black cherry scent ( m ¼ 2.47 , sd ¼ 1.55 ) with casual clothing did not differ ( t ( 14 ) ¼ .10 , p ¼ .92 ) .
results indicated that the messy store ( m ¼ 4.53 , sd ¼ .88 ) was indeed perceived as messier than the tidy store ( m ¼ 2.80 , sd ¼ 1.15 ; t ( 60 ) ¼ 6.61 , p < .001 , r ¼ .34 ) , and both stores were significantly different from the scale middle point of 4 ( messy store : t ( 30 ) ¼ 3.33 , p ¼ .002 , r ¼ .52 ; tidy store : t ( 30 ) ¼ 5.78 , p < .001 , r ¼ .73 ) .
manipulation checks to test whether scent had an affective priming effect , an anova was conducted with scent condition as a fixed factor and respondents ' feelings before they saw the store pictures as the dependent variable .
results indicated at the 90 % level of significance that when a lemon-tangerine scent was present , re- spondents were 2.49 times more likely to mention tidiness of the store as an important store element than when a black cherry scent was present ( b ¼ .91 , wald ¼ 3.38 , p ¼ .07 ) .
we found no significant differences in mentioning tidiness of the store between the black cherry scent and the no-scent conditions ( b ¼ .69 , wald ¼ 1.93 , p ¼ .17 ) or between the lemon-tangerine scent and the no-scent conditions ( b ¼ .22 , wald ¼ .28 , p ¼ .60 ) .
experimental findings a two-way anova with scent and store messiness as fixed factors was conducted for each of the dependent variables .
compared to a messy store , a tidy store led to enhanced pleasure ( f ( 1,192 ) ¼ 17.42 , p < .001 , u2 ¼ .08 ) , enhanced evaluation of the store environment ( f ( 1,192 ) ¼ 11.52 , p ¼ .001 , u2 ¼ .05 ) , enhanced evaluations of the store ( f ( 1,192 ) ¼ 16.27 , p < .001 , u2 ¼ .07 ) , enhanced evaluations of the products ( f ( 1,192 ) ¼ 13.05 , p < .001 , u2 ¼ .06 ) , and enhanced self-reported approach behavior ( f ( 1,192 ) ¼ 16.65 , p < .001 , u2 ¼ .08 ) .
more precisely , the products in the messy store were evaluated more negatively when black cherry scent was present ( m ¼ 3.58 , sd ¼ 1.11 ) compared with the no-scent condition ( m ¼ 4.36 , sd ¼ 1.07 ; p ¼ .002 ) .
for product evaluation , we found that when a pleasant scent not associated with neatness ( i.e. , black cherry ) was present , the respondents who saw the tidy store responded more positively than the respondents who saw the messy store ( p < .001
we used multilevel modelling ( n¼ 141 ) to investigate the dimensionality and predictors of intraper- sonal variance in place identification , drawing on psychological and anthropological literatures .
participants and procedure participants ( n¼ 141 141 41 41 ) completed questionnaires in three formats : in hard-copy ( n¼ 18 ) , in an e-mailed word document ( n¼ 29 ) , and in a .php format mounted on a website ( n¼ 94 ) .
all 141 participants in the sample were adults ( m¼ 36 years and two months , sd¼ 12 years and 8 months ) ; 100 were female and 41 were male .
in terms of ethnicity , the vast majority of responses provided could be cat- egorised as caucasian ( 127 participants ) whilst the very limited , albeit diverse , remaining responses on ethnicity occurred at minimal frequencies.2.2 .
dimensionality of place identity we ran a series of multilevel confirmatory factor analyses using the mplus software package ( muthén & muthén , 1998–2007 ) to test whether our measures successfully distinguished between the four dimensions of place identity we had identified on theoretical grounds .
this model fit the data significantly better than a single-factor model : dc2ð5þ ¼ 436:6 ; p < :001 p < :001 p < :001 p < :001 p < :001 : however , the correlation between the two of the latent factors , emotional attachment and self-exten- sion , was estimated at .98 , clearly suggesting that these items did not form two distinct factors .
fit indices for this model remained excellent : c2ð11þ ¼ 34:4 ; cfi ¼ :996 ; tli ¼ :986 ; rmsea ¼ :042 ; srmrwithin ¼ :014 ; srmrbetween ¼ :005 ; and this model showed no significant loss of fit compared to the 4-factor model : dc2 ( 2 ) ¼ 1.2 , p¼ .55 .
hence , for the analyses which follow , we decomposed place identity into three closely related subfacets , calculating separate scores for self-extension/attachment ( 3 items : a¼ .90 ) , environmental fit ( 2 items : r¼ .67 ) , and place-self congruity ( 2 items : r¼ .73

study 1a 1.1 .
study 1a : introduction since humans form rich impressions of others based on limited ex- posure to faces ( e.g. , willis & todorov , 2006 ) , we used a face- perception paradigm to test the effects of various cues on treatment in the ug .
study 1a : materials and methods 1.2.1 .
these recorded ug decisions allowed us to pay our study 1a par- ticipants based on the actual outcomes of their games .
male target stimuli facial photographs of 83 male students were used as stimuli ( “ targets ” ) in study 1a .
thirty-five self-identified as caucasian , 20 as asian , 16 as hispanic , and the rest as multiracial or “ other. ” all gave permission for their photographs to be used for research purposes .
measurements were made independently by two re- search assistants ; there was high agreement between the two sets of measurements ( r = .95 ) , and their mean was used in analysis .
sixty- nine students ( 42 female ) rated 39 of the male targets ; these raters were 17–22 years old ( mean=18.6 years , s.d .
forty-eight stu- dents ( 19 female ) rated the other 44 male targets ; these raters ' ages ranged from 18 to 22 years ( mean = 18.6 years , s.d .
full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in appendix a .

generally speak- ing , including all participants changed zero-order correlations only in the third decimal place . )
however , they were drawn from the same subject pool as the raters used in study 1a , so we expect a similar age distribution .
we calculated bivariate correlations in order to evaluate the zero-order effect of each of the tar- get traits ( measured fwhr , measured strength , and ratings of attrac- tiveness , health , dominance and prosociality ) on how the target faces were treated in the ultimatum game .
study 1a : results table 1 presents the correlations between fwhr , strength , attrac- tiveness , health , dominance and prosociality for the male targets .
( note that the traits rated in study 1b are included in the same table , for efficiency of presentation . )
there was a significant negative correlation between the mean of- fers and mean demands received by targets ( i.e. , the ug partner in the photograph ) , r ( 83 ) = − .45 , p b .001 , such that targets who received higher offers also received lower demands .
table 2 presents the zero-order correlations of mean generosity re- ceived by targets with their fwhr , strength , and ratings of attractive- ness , health , dominance and prosociality ( for efficiency of presentation , the traits rated in study 1b are also included in this table ) .
effect sizes were especially large for health and attractiveness ratings ( which were highly correlated with each other ; see table 1 ) , with these traits accounting for nearly two-thirds of the variance in how well specific targets were treated ( rs n 0.75 ) .table 1 intercorrelations among fwhr , strength , and the rated traits in studies 1a and 1b .

variables 1−6 were collected in study 1a , and variables 7–10 were collected in study 1b .
study 1a : discussion the results of study 1a defied our expectations : fwhr negatively predicted generosity received in the ug .
these ambiguities led us to have the target faces rated for additional traits in order to test between the pc and awamodels ( study 1b ) .
study 1b 2.1 .
study 1b : introduction study 1b used the same ug decisions as in 1a , but the target faces were rated for additional traits in order to better test the awa and pc theories against each other .
in addition , the pcmodel predicts that the positive effect of strength on generosity observed in study 1a will be mediated by pro- ductivity , while the awamodel predicts that the effect of strength will be mediated by dangerousness .
second , proposers in study 1a could have attempted to maximize their earnings in the game by matching their offer to the de- mand expected from the responder .
study 1b : materials and methods 2.2.1 .
male target stimuli the target stimuli were exactly the same as those used in study 1a .
eighteen students ( 13 female ) rated the male target faces for their ap- parent social status ( 7 items ; alpha = .988 ) .
( ratings of male so- cial status were performed after study 2 , given the strong effect of social status in women . )
full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in appendix a .
data analysis bivariate correlations were employed in order to evaluate the zero- order effects of perceived productivity , dangerousness , desirability as a friend , and social status on generosity received in the ug .
the positive effect of target strength observed in study 1a is consistent with both the awa and pc models .
in order to test the effects of target traits beyond attractiveness halo effects , we calculated partial correlations , controlling for attractiveness , between the remaining target traits ( from studies 1a and 1b ) and gen- erosity received in theug .
in order to control for the possibility that pro- posers might try to maximize their income by matching their offer to the target 's expected demand , we calculated partial correlations be- tween all of the target traits and offers received , controlling for the de- mands expected from the targets .
we calculated partial correlations between all of the target traits and generosity received , controlling for estimates of the targets ' generosity , in order to control for any possible reciprocity motivations .
study 1b : results table 1 presents the correlations between the ratings of productivi- ty , dangerousness , desirability as a friend , and social status , aswell as all of the traits rated or measured in study 1a .
zero-order correlations between perceived traits and generosity received table 2 presents the zero-order correlations of mean generosity re- ceived by targets with their ratings of productivity , dangerousness , desir- ability as a friend and social status ( for convenience , the variables from study 1a are also shown in this table ) .
productivity , desirability as a friend , and social statuswere all very highly and positively correlatedwith gener- osity received ( r 's ≥ 0.7 ) , which is consistent with the pc model .
( this same reversal also oc- curred when productivity ( β= .89 , t ( 80 ) = 9.27 , p b .001 ) and danger- ousness ( β=− .31 , t ( 80 ) =−3.23 , p= .002 ) were entered as the only predictors of generosity received . )
independent effects of productivity in the regressionmodel with productivity and prosociality ratings as simultaneous predictors of generosity received , productivity had a sig- nificant positive effect , β = .57 , t ( 80 ) = 7.64 , p b .001 , as did prosociality , β= .37 , t ( 80 ) =4.94 , p b .001 .
adding health as a predictor improved the accuracy of themodel , r2 change= .101 , f ( 1,79 ) =27.18 , p b .001 .
productivity remained a significant predictor , β= .37 , t ( 79 ) = 4.90 , p b .001 , and health had a significant positive effect , β = .51 , t ( 79 ) = 5.21 , p b .001 , but prosociality was no longer a significant pre- dictor of generosity received , β = .09 , t ( 79 ) = 1.10 , p = .28 .
participants were more generous toward targets who were expected to be more generous , r ( 83 ) = .43 , p b .001 , but the effects of target traits on generosity received were virtually un- changed after controlling for expected generosity ( see som , table s3 ) .
participants offered less to targets who looked like they would demand more to accept an offer , r ( 83 ) =− .39 , p b .001 , which is the opposite of an income-maximizing strategy , and sensitivity to all target traits ( except productivity ) had a negative effect on ug earnings ( see som , strength generosity received perceived productivity perceived dangerousness .25 * ( .07 , n.s . )
* p b .05 * * p b .01 ; * * * p b .001 .table s4 ) .
study 1b : discussion the results of study 1b robustly supported the pc hypothesis over the awa hypothesis .
while apparent dangerousness had a positive zero-order effect on generosity received , dangerousness had a significant negative effect on generosity once productivity was con- trolled for , suggesting that formidability above and beyond implied pro- ductivity is actually penalized in the ug.moreover , the positive effect of strength on generosity observed in study 1a wasmediated by ratings of productivity , further supporting the partner choice model .
study 2 3.1 .
we there- fore had the female target faces used in study 2 rated for social status as well , and predicted that social status would positively predict the qual- ity of treatment received in the ug .
design the design of study 2 was largely the same as the design of study 1a ( see section 1.2.1 ) ; female participants played one-shot ugs with a se- ries of target partners represented by face photographs that had been measured and rated on various dimensions .
the only difference from study 1a is that not all of the targets used as ug partners in study 2 had previously played the ug .
participants in study 2 were told truthfully that some of the targets theywould playwith had previously played theug , but that theywould be unable to tell which targets had or had not played the ug.when par- ticipants returned for session 2 , they rolled a die .
female target stimuli facial photographs of 100 female students thatwere collected in two unrelated studies were used as targets , i.e. , to represent ug partners to the participants in study 2 .
photographs were taken and processed in the same way as in study 1a .
each rater was ran- domly assigned to rate or estimate 5-6 items , and ratings on specific items continued until intra-class correlations for all rated items were at least .7 .
full wording of all items and their intra-class correlations are presented in appendix a .
data analysis we used a data analysis strategy similar to that of study 1b ( see section 2.2.3 ) to evaluate the pc hypothesis , control for alternative ex- planations , and evaluate the effect of partner choice heuristics on ug earnings .
we next computed a series of partial correlations in order to control for various alternative explanations .
first , in order to control for the ef- fect of attractiveness , we computed partial correlations , controlling for attractiveness , between ug decisions and the remaining target traits .
/ evolution and human behavior 37 ( 2016 ) 429–439computed partial correlations between ug treatment received and tar- get traits , controlling for the targets ' expected decisions .
finally , in order tomeasure the effect of partner choice heuristics on earnings in the ug , we calculated the correlations between participant earnings and sensitivity to each of the target traits tested in study 2 ( see section 2.2.3 ) .
study 2 : results table 3 presents the correlations between all of the measured and rated traits in study 2 .
there was a significant positive correlation between themean offers and demands received by targets , r ( 100 ) = .20 , p = .05 .
zero-order correlations between target traits and ug treatment table 4 presents the zero-order correlations between target traits and mean offers and demands received .
when productivity and prosociality were entered into the same regression model predicting mean offers received , prosociality had a significant positive effect , β = .26 , t ( 96 ) = 2.61 , p = .010 , while productivity did not , β= .15 , t ( 96 ) = 1.47 , p= .15 .
effects on earnings and controlling for alternative explanations controlling for attractiveness substantially reduced the effects of other target traits on offers and demands received , but social status , prosociality and dangerousness retained at least marginally significant partial correlations with offers received ( see som , table s5 ) .
there were significant positive correlations between mean offers received by targets and the mean offers they were expected to make , and between the mean demands received by targets and the mean demands they were expected to make ( both correlations : r ( 100 ) = .37 , p b .001 ) .
however , ratings of health , social status and attractiveness hadtable 3 intercorrelations among strength and the rated traits in study 2 .
⁎⁎ p b 0.01 , two-tailed.significant partial correlations with offers received , controlling for ex- pected offers , and ratings of target health , prosociality , social status , and attractiveness had significant partial correlations with demands re- ceived , controlling for expected demands ( see som , table s7 ) .
there was a significant positive correlation between the mean demands ex- pected from targets and the mean offers they received , r ( 100 ) = .22 , p = .028 , which is consistent with an income-maximizing strategy , but therewere significant effects of health , prosociality , social status , at- tractiveness , and dangerousness , on offers , controlling for expected de- mands ( see som , table s6 ) .
study 2 : discussion as expected , female participantsmade higher offers in the ug to tar- gets who appeared healthier , more attractive , more productive , more prosocial and higher in social status .
this may represent more than just an attractiveness halo effect ; women in ancestral environments likely derived substantial social influence from their attractiveness ( see sell et al. , 2009 ) , so attrac- tivenessmay have been an important cue of women 's abilities to gener- ate benefits for social partners.table 4 zero-order correlations between female target traits and mean offers and demands re- ceived ( study 2 ) .

the cognitive control model , in contrast , predicts that self-reg- ulation in the first phase will improve self-regulatory per- formance in the second phase in case participants have de- ployed similar control processes to deal with the demands of the first task ( i.e. , response reversal after engaging in response reversal in study 1 , moderated food intake in the taste test after resisting a food temptation in study 2 , choos- ing for the delayed larger rather than the immediate smaller reward after having done so repeatedly in study 3 , and re- sisting the impulse options after having done so repeatedly in study 3 ) .

in study 1 , we found that a depleting response re- versal task enhanced self-regulation on a similar task in the second phase .
in study 2 , we showed that inhibiting food intake , although depleting , subsequently improved self-reg- ulation in the domain of food intake control .
in study 3 , we observed that choice making , although depleting , facilitated subsequent self-regulation when the control processes re- quired to solve the response conflict were similar in both phases .
we found that adapting to a response reversal task facilitates performance in a subsequent response re- versal task ( study 1 ) ; inhibiting food intake in a first phase enhances food intake control in a subsequent taste test ( study 2 ) ; and considering choices that present a conflict of a certain nature enhances self-regulation in subsequent choice situ- ations presenting a similar conflict ( study 3 ) .
finally , we would like to draw attention to the fact that cognitive control theory typically models conflicts between informational inputs ( as we did in study 1

the results of model 1 indicate that new product crea- tivity and contract specificity are not significantly related ( b1 = .02 , p > .10 ) but that frequency of new product introductions ( b2 = .25 , p < .01 ) and performance ambiguity ( b3 = -.24 , p < .01 ) are both statistically significant .

adjusted r2 for model 2 = .30 ; r2 change between model 1 and model 2 = .044 ( p < .05 ) .
the results demonstrate a level of consistency wherein interaction effects between new product creativity and both ( 1 ) frequency of new product introductions ( b = .26 , p < .05 ) and ( 2 ) performance ambiguity ( b = .21 , p < .05 ) retain their signs and significance .
furthermore , the link between contract specificity and frequency of new product introductions is not significant ( b = -.02 , p > .10 ) .
discussion in study 1 , we find that the variability in contract specificity depends on the interaction between new product creativity and both frequency of new product introductions and performance ambiguity .
although study 1 increases our understanding of how manufacturers craft contract terms for selling creative new products , new product introductions also necessitate a retailer ’ s ongoing support of the new product under the contract terms .
study 2 procedure study 2 is a repeated measures experiment that tests the influence of contract specificity on a retailer ’ s relational behaviors throughout the duration of the contract , moderated by new product success .
we recruited cpg retail managers through the same market research company contracted in study 1 .

appendix a presents the item loadings , and table 4 reports cronbach ’ s alphas .
cronbach ’ s alphas of .88 or above demonstrate good reliability .
model 1 estimates the main effects of time , contract specificity , new product success , and control variables .
in model 2 , we add the interaction terms .
equation 2 shows the level 1 equation for model 2 .
we did not include the interaction terms between control variables and time because they are not theoretically expected to affect the growth curve , and their addition did not result in an improved model fit ( p > .10 ) .
to examine more nuanced effects in relational behaviors during the contractual period ( i.e. , earlier vs. later in the duration of the contract ) , we also fitted a third model ( model 3 ) using piecewise splines ( chou et al .
as table 5 reveals , adding the interaction terms to model 1 improves fit ( ddeviance ( 4 ) = 23.86 , p < .01 ) .
model 3 , in which piecewise splines are added , further improves the model fit relative to model 2 ( ddeviance ( 7 ) = 18.72 , p < .01 ) .
results model 2 reveals that both contract specificity ( b01 = .23 , p < .01 ) and newproduct success ( b02= .18 , p < .05 ) are positively related to a retailer ’ s relational behaviors related to the product .
the interaction between new product success and contract specificity is not significant ( b03 = .001 , p > .10 ) .
we find a significant negative interaction between time and contract specificity ( b11 = -.10 , p < .01 ) and a significant positive interaction between time and new product success ( b12 = .24 , p < .01 ) .
the results show that retailers increase their relational behaviors over the contract ’ s duration when the new product is successful ( b = .13 , p < .05 ) but decrease their relational behaviors when the new product is unsuccessful ( b = -.28 , p < .01 ) .
the results show that retailers ’ relational behaviors do not change over time when the new product is successful ( b = .002 , p > .10 ) orwhen it is unsuccessful ( b = .12 , p > .10 ) .
model 3 examines the changes in a retailer ’ s behaviors over time using two stages .
the results reveal a significant negative interaction between time and contract specificity ( b11 = -.11 , p < .05 ) and a positive interaction between time and newproduct success ( b12= .21 , p < .01 ) .
the three-way interaction of contract specificity , new product success , and time , however , is not significant at stage 1 ( b13 = .12 , p > .05 ) .
it is important to note that whereas the interaction between time and newproduct success remains significant ( b22= .28 , p < .01 ) , the interaction of time with contract specificity becomes nonsignificant ( b21 = -.09 , p > .05 ) .
in contrast , the interaction among contract specificity , new product success , and time becomes significant at stage 2 ( b23 = .14 , p < .05 ) .
discussion study 2 extends our prior findings by examining a retailer ’ s relational behaviors related to the new product during the duration of the initial contract .
the test of model 3 presents particularly notable findings .

methods we begin our analysis by estimating a linear probability model
analyses of national health interview survey data from 1986 to 2004 ( n = 935,802 ) , prospectively linked to mortality through 2006 ( including 1,238 suicides ) , reveals a process of compensation in the way work status and fam- ily combine to affect adult suicide : individuals who are not working experience more suicide defense from more protective family support systems than do working adults .
finally , because of mortality selection at the oldest ages and because most adults complete their educa- tion and enter the workforce by early adulthood , the final data set included information on 935,802 adults ages 25 to 65 residing within 564,594 households .
age was a continuous variable , and gender was coded dichotomously with women as the referent , and multivariate analyses stratified models separately for men and women .
the reference category in all multivariate analyses is an adult living alone .
estimation multivariate analyses investigating the relation- ships among individual characteristics , house- hold living arrangements , and suicide employ a cox proportional hazard framework ( allison , 1984 ) .
the cox models are particularly useful because they do not impose a distribution of death across age ; neither do they require the analyst to choose a particular form for the times of survival specified ( allison , 1984 ) .
the model declares the hazard rate for the jth respondent as h ( t |xj ) = h0 ( t ) exp ( xjβx ) , where the coefficients βx are estimated from the data using a partial likelihood approach ( hoffman , 2004 ) .
a key assumption of the cox model is proportional hazards .
these results , together with evidence suggesting that cox estimates are sturdy despite proportionality assumptions when based on large , nationally representative samples ( therneau & grambsch , 2000 ) , provide some confidence in the techniques used here .
all results from the cox proportional hazard analyses are reported as hazard ratios ( hrs ) .
to evaluate effects across groups , interaction models were estimated , and wald tests were calculated using the results from those models , a procedure referred to as the generalized linear model solution to compare model results ( hoffman , 224 journal of marriage and family 2004 ) .
the wald test is distributed chi-square and provides the analyst with some important flexibility , including the ability to evaluate differences across all household types and differences across specific types of household configuration .
the multivariate analyses proceeded by first establishing the relationship between household living arrangement and suicide for the full sam- ple and separately by gender ( see table 2 ) .
the wald test information from these models represent tests of two-way inter- actions ( i.e. , living arrangement × work status ) .
the wald test information for significant three-way interac- tion models is presented in table 4 .
the wald test information provided in tables 3 and 4 was used to assess the proposed processes of combined influence .
finally , if living arrangements , work status , and educational attainment exert independent effects on mortality risk , no significant differ- ences across groups will be observed in the wald tests .
the difference between men and women in that household type was marginally significant ( p = .08 ; results available on request ) .
but although men with less education showed a higher risk of suicide than more highly educated men , the education association was reversed among women ( and significantly different from men , p ≤ .05 ; results available on request ) .
table 3 presents results from cox analysis testing the combined associations of household formation with work status ( top panel ) and education ( bottom panel ) .

in accord with the reinforcement perspective , this bottom panel shows that more educated persons had lower suicide risks in family households than did less educated persons ( χ2 = 11.6 , p ≤ .05 ) .
more educated persons experienced a significantly lower suicide risk in married- couple households with ( hr = 0.35 ) and without children ( hr = 0.49 ) than did less educated persons ( hrs = 0.58 and 0.84 , respectively ) .

tests across education were estimated after finding a significant three-way interaction ( p ≤ .10 ) between living arrangement , gender , and education in a model that included all one-way terms as well as two-way terms and the three-way term .

accordingly , table 4 provides wald tests for the interaction between living arrangement and education separately for men and women .
the process of reinforcement identified in table 3 can most clearly be seen among men ( χ2 = 10.5 , p ≤ .05 ) .
