In Experiment 1, participants named pictures while ignoring superimposed distractor pictures that were semantically related, phonologically related, or unrelated. Eye movements and naming latencies were recorded. The distractor pictures affected the latencies of gaze shifting and vocal naming. The magnitude of the phonological effects increased linearly with latency, excluding lapses of attention as the cause of the effects. In Experiment 2, no distractor effects were obtained when both pictures were named. When pictures with superimposed distractor words were named or the words were read in Experiment 3, the words influenced the latencies of gaze shifting and picture naming, but the pictures yielded no such latency effects in word reading. The picture\u2013word asymmetry was obtained even with equivalent reading and naming latencies. The picture\u2013picture effects suggest that activation spreads continuously from concepts to phonological forms, whereas the picture\u2013word asymmetry indicates that the amount of activation is limited and task dependent.\nKeywords: attention, cascade processing, eye movements, word production\nDoes activation spread in an automatic and continuous fashion through associative memory, or is the activation flow discrete and goal dependent at some points? This issue has been intensively investigated in the cognitive and brain sciences (e.g., D. E. Meyer, Osman, Irwin, & Yantis, 1988). Following a seminal study by Levelt et al. (1991), the nature of the flow of activation has also been a major issue in psycholinguistic research on object naming. The naming of objects seems to involve the activation of concepts, lemmas, morphemes, phonemes, and syllable motor programs in associative memory (e.g., Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). Lemmas code the words\u2019 syntactic properties. For example, in the WEAVER model (Levelt et al., 1999; Roelofs, 1992, 1997, 2003), the conceptually driven production of the word cat involves the activation in a lexical network of the representation of the concept CAT(X), the lemma of cat specifying that the word is a noun (for languages such as Dutch, lemmas also specify grammatical gender), the morpheme cat , the phonemes /k/, /\u00e6/, and /t/, and the syllable motor program [k\u00e6t]. A fragment of the lexical network of WEAVER is illustrated in Figure 1. No consensus exists in the literature as to whether activation spreads from level\nto level in an automatic and continuous fashion or whether the activation flow is discrete and goal dependent at some points in the network (for recent discussions see, e.g., Bloem & La Heij, 2003; Morsella & Miozzo, 2002; Navarrete & Costa, 2005; Roelofs, 2003).\nUp until now, the discussions in the literature on spoken word planning have typically concentrated on the two most extreme theoretical positions (but see Dell & O\u2019Seaghdha, 1991): The spread of activation is either automatic and continuous versus discrete and goal dependent at some points. However, according to a third intermediate theoretical position, which is explored in the present article, activation spreads from level to level in a continuous fashion, but the amount of activation that spreads through the system is limited and task dependent. For example, following Dell (1986), I proposed in several articles (e.g., Roelofs, 1992, 1997, 2003) that retrieval of information from the lexical network involves selective attentional enhancement of the activation of goalrelated nodes (cf. LaBerge, 1995; Posner & Dehaene, 1994). The enhancements occur only when the task requires the retrieval of lexical information. Activation of nodes decreases with network distance. In the absence of activation enhancements, the network distance between concepts and phonological forms is too long to obtain much phonological activation induced by concepts. In addition, the connections between lemmas and word forms may be weak, which limits the amount of activation that spreads between levels at this point in the lexical network (Roelofs, 2003).\nLevelt et al. (1999) argued that perceived objects continuously activate their concepts and lemmas, whereas the morphemes, phonemes, and motor programs of the object names are activated only when a speaker has the goal of naming the objects and selects a lemma. Lemma selection is goal dependent, and the goal of object naming allows the connection between lemmas and word forms to be made. Consequently, only the form corresponding to a selected lemma becomes activated. For example, in referring to a perceived\nArdi Roelofs, Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information and F. C.

In contrast, other researchers (e.g., Dell, 1986) have argued that all word forms corresponding to the activated concepts and lemmas become continuously activated. According to this view, the form of dog is also activated in planning to say \u201ccat.\u201d More recently, Altmann and Davidson (2001) and Bloem and La Heij (2003) argued that although objects activate their concepts and related ones, the lemmas, morphemes, phonemes, and motor programs of the object names are activated only when a speaker has the goal of naming the objects. In seeing a cat, the concepts CAT(X) and DOG(X) become activated, but the lemma and form of cat become active only when a speaker wants to name the cat. Thus, whereas Dell (1986) and Levelt et al. (1999) assumed that activation spreads continuously from concepts to lemmas, Altmann and Davidson and Bloem and La Heij argued that the activation flow is discrete in that only a selected concept activates its lemma. Moreover, whereas Dell assumed that activation spreads continuously from lemmas to word forms, Levelt et al. (1999) argued that the spread of activation is discrete in that only a selected lemma activates its word form.\nReview of Empirical Evidence\nSeminal evidence that activation spreads continuously from concepts to lemmas but not from lemmas to word forms came from a series of experiments by Levelt et al. (1991). They tested for the activation of the phonological form of semantic competitors of a picture name. For example, is the phonological form of the word dog activated in naming a pictured cat? Participants were asked to name pictured objects (e.g., a pictured cat) and, on some critical\ntrials, to interrupt the preparation of the picture name and decide whether an auditory probe presented after picture onset was a word or not (auditory lexical decision). If activation spreads continuously from concepts to phonological forms, the phonemes of semantic competitors of the target (e.g., the phoneme /d/ of the word dog, which is a semantic competitor of cat) should become active. Levelt et al. (1991) obtained no effect on the lexical decision latencies for spoken probes that were phonologically related to semantic competitors (e.g., the probe DOLL, which is phonologically related to dog), whereas they obtained interference for probes that were semantic competitors (DOG) or directly phonologically related (CAP). These results support the view that activation spreads continuously from concepts to lemmas, yielding the semantic interference for semantic competitors (DOG), but not from lemmas to word forms, explaining the lack of activation for the phonemes of those semantic competitors (e.g., the /d/ of DOG), as indexed by the absence of an effect on DOLL (see also Jescheniak, Hahne, & Schriefers, 2003).\nUsing word reading rather than auditory lexical decision, Peterson and Savoy (1998) replicated the findings of Levelt et al. (1991). However, whereas Levelt et al. (1991) obtained semantic and phonological interference effects on the lexical decisions, Peterson and Savoy obtained semantic and phonological facilitation of word reading. Clearly, the direction of the effects (interference versus facilitation) depends on the task. Moreover, Peterson and Savoy reported activation of the phonological form of near-synonyms of the picture name (e.g., for PULL, related to puss, in naming a pictured cat), indicating that the phonological activation of semantic competitors may be detected when the semantic relation between words is strong. This suggests that activation in the word production system cascades between levels.\nAlternatively, it may be that near-synonyms are a special case. Levelt et al. (1999) suggested that speakers habitually or mistakenly select both words in cases of near-synonymy and repair the multiple selection later in the planning process (e.g., after phonological encoding). According to this view, the activation of the forms of near-synonyms is the result of misselection and covert repair rather than a continuous spread of activation from lemmas to forms.\nGriffin and Bock (1998) argued, however, specifically for the continuous activation view. They observed that the effect of word frequency (i.e., high-frequency words are produced faster than low-frequency words) is smaller in syntactically constrained than unconstrained sentential contexts. Earlier evidence suggested that the effect of word frequency arises during accessing lexical forms or morphemes (Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994; Roelofs, 1998). If the transition from lemma to word form is a discrete step, then syntactic constraint and word frequency should yield additive effects. Setting aside misselection, the interaction between syntactic constraint and word frequency therefore suggests that activation spreads continuously from lemmas to word forms. Furthermore, Cutting and Ferreira (1999) observed that when speakers named pictures of objects with a homophone name (e.g., they said \u201cball\u201d to a toy ball, whereby the other meaning of ball was party), an auditory distractor word that was semantically related to the other meaning (DANCE) speeded picture naming relative to an unrelated control. This suggests that hearing a distractor like DANCE activated the other meaning of ball (party), which automatically activated the word form of ball, speeding the naming of the toy ball. More recently, Morsella and Miozzo (2002) presented the primes directly as distractor pictures in picture naming. Speakers were given pictures in green superimposed onto pictures in red. The task was to name the pictures in green while ignoring the pictures in red. The picture names were phonologically related or unrelated. Morsella and Miozzo observed that target pictures were named faster when the distractor picture was phonologically related than when it was unrelated. This suggests that activation spreads continuously from the distractor picture to the phonological form of its name. Navarrete and Costa (2005) replicated and extended these findings. Taken together, the empirical evidence seems to favor the position of Dell (1986) over the positions of Levelt et al. (1999), Altmann and Davidson (2001), and Bloem and La Heij (2003). Activation seems to cascade from concepts to phonological forms.\nOther evidence indicates, however, that the amount of activation that spreads from concepts to phonological forms is limited, in line with the data of Levelt et al. (1991) and Peterson and Savoy (1998). It is often assumed that pictures have direct access to concepts and only indirect access to word forms, whereas words have direct access to word forms and only indirect access to concepts (cf. Roelofs, 1992, 2003), as illustrated in Figure 1. Naming pictures requires concept selection, whereas words can be read aloud without concept selection. The latter is achieved by mapping input word-forms (e.g., CAT) directly onto output wordforms (e.g., cat , /k/, /\u00e6/, /t/, and [k\u00e6t]), as illustrated in Figure 1. Semantically related written words (e.g., DOG) superimposed onto pictured objects (e.g., a cat) hamper the naming of the objects. However, the pictures have no effect on reading the words aloud (e.g., M. O. Glaser & Glaser, 1982; W. R. Glaser & Du\u0308ngelhoff, 1984; W. R. Glaser & Glaser, 1989; Roelofs, 2003,\n2006a, 2006b; Smith & Magee, 1980; see MacLeod, 1991, for a review). The absence of an effect of picture distractors on word reading suggests that the amount of activation that spreads from pictures to word forms is limited (Roelofs, 2003). One may argue that the interference of pictures on word reading is absent because words are read without accessing the mental lexicon, namely via the application of grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondence rules (e.g., mapping the c of cat onto /k/), and that the rule application shields word reading from distracting pictures. However, that does not seem to be the case. Digits (e.g., the digit 3) superimposed onto dice (e.g., two dots) affect dice naming, whereas the dice have no effect at all on digit naming (Roelofs, 2006b). However, digits cannot be read by applying grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondence rules. This suggests that the absence of an effect of pictures/dice on word reading is due to the limited amount of activation spreading from pictures/dice to word forms (see Roelofs, 2003, 2006a, 2006b, for further discussion).\nBloem and La Heij (2003) argued that the finding of Morsella and Miozzo (2002) concerning the effect of a phonological relation between target and distractor pictures is problematic in the light of the finding by Damian and Bowers (2003) that a semantic relation between pictures does not yield an effect. Navarrete and Costa (2005) also obtained no semantic effect of picture distractors on picture naming latencies. According to Bloem and La Heij, if a distractor picture has no semantic effect on naming another picture, suggesting that activation does not spread continuously from concepts to lemmas, it is surprising that a phonological relationship has an effect, suggesting a continuous spread of activation from concepts to lemmas and from lemmas to word forms. The reasoning of Bloem and La Heij is not completely convincing, however.\nFirst, whereas Damian and Bowers (2003) obtained no semantic effect of picture distractors on picture naming, W. R. Glaser and Glaser (1989) obtained semantic interference. It seems that the difference in effects between studies is related to methodological differences. Whereas in the study of Damian and Bowers the superimposed pictures differed in size and the participants had to name the largest picture, in the study of W. R. Glaser and Glaser the onset of the presentation of the two pictures differed, and participants had to name the first (or second) picture that appeared on the screen. Using the same technique as W. R. Glaser and Glaser, La Heij, Heikoop, Akerboom, and Bloem (2003) replicated the semantic interference. Moreover, in a second experiment, the selection of the target picture was made easier by reducing the presentation duration of the distractor picture. Then semantic facilitation was obtained. On the basis of these findings, La Heij et al. concluded that \u201cthe ease of target selection is at least one of the factors that contributed to the reversal from semantic interference in Experiment 1 into semantic facilitation in Experiment 2\u201d (p. 58). To conclude, in contrast to what Bloem and La Heij (2003) maintained, picture distractors may yield semantic effects, depending on the task situation.\nSecond, the model of word planning proposed by Bloem and La Heij (2003) does not distinguish between lexical selection and phonological encoding, so semantic and phonological effects are expected to co-occur. This makes the presence of a phonological effect in the absence of a semantic effect surprising. However, other models attribute semantic and phonological effects to different planning processes. For example, the WEAVER model\nassumes that lemma retrieval and phonological encoding are distinct processes, which are differentially sensitive to semantic and phonological manipulations, as is evident, for example, from the difference in time course of semantic and phonological effects (Levelt et al., 1999). Thus, phonological manipulations may have an effect even when semantic manipulations do not (cf. Schriefers, Meyer, & Levelt, 1990).\nThese two arguments against the reasoning of Bloem and La Heij (2003) do not mean, however, that the picture\u2013picture results obtained by Morsella and Miozzo (2002) and Navarrete and Costa (2005) provide straightforward evidence for cascading. As the results of La Heij et al. (2003) indicate, how participants deal with the selective attention problem posed by naming one of two superimposed pictures is in itself a complicated issue (e.g., Allport, Tipper, & Chmiel, 1985). Participants have to name the green picture and ignore the red picture. A theoretical possibility is that participants plan the names of both pictures and then finally select the motor program for the green picture name from an articulatory buffer and initiate articulation (Roelofs, 2006a). Thus, the phonological facilitation might arise from a particular planning strategy adopted for dealing with the selective attention problem posed by overlapping pictures rather than reflect a continuous spread of activation.\nOverview of the Present Experiments\nResearch on spoken word planning has shown that there is a close link between phonological activation and gaze shifting in picture naming (e.g., A. S. Meyer, Sleiderink, & Levelt, 1998; Griffin, 2001), whereby gaze shifts index shifts of attention (Roelofs, 2007). For example, when speakers are asked to name two objects in a row, they look longer at first-to-be-named objects with two- versus one-syllable names even when the object recognition times are the same (A. S. Meyer, Roelofs, & Levelt, 2003). The effect of the phonological length suggests that the shift of gaze from one object to the other is initiated only after the phonological form of the name for the object has been planned sufficiently (cf. Korvorst, Roelofs, & Levelt, 2006; Levelt & Meyer, 2000). A. S. Meyer and Van der Meulen (2000) observed that phonologically related spoken distractor words reduce picture naming latencies and gaze shift latencies compared to phonologically unrelated distractors. Thus, again, gaze shifts were linked to phonological activation. Moreover, Levelt and Meyer (2000) and Korvorst et al. (2006) observed that gaze shift latencies may reflect the phonological length of the utterance even when vocal response latencies do not. If distractor pictures activate the phonological form of their names, they should affect not only the latency of naming the target pictures but also the latency of gaze shifting. Earlier research suggests that the variability in latencies tends to be less for gaze shifting than for vocal responding (A. S. Meyer et al., 2003; A. S. Meyer & Van der Meulen, 2000). Effects in the picture\u2013picture task tend to be small (around 10\u201320 ms in the studies of La Heij et al., 2003; Morsella & Miozzo, 2002; Navarrete & Costa, 2005). By measuring gaze shift latencies in addition to vocal response latencies, the chances are enhanced for detecting the effects if they are there.\nThe present article reports three eye-tracking experiments that further explored the issue of the extent to which activation spreads between word planning levels and how the activation flow is\ninfluenced by attention. In particular, the reported research examined effects of picture distractors in naming one of two superimposed pictures (Experiment 1), naming both pictures (Experiment 2), and reading words (Experiment 3). In all the experiments, the target was presented in green color and the distractor in red. Experiment 1 concerned a replication and extension of the studies of Morsella and Miozzo (2002) and Navarrete and Costa (2005). Different from Morsella and Miozzo, all pictures occurred both as targets and distractors. This manipulation served to optimize a comparison between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, where both pictures had to be named, and therefore both were part of the response set. The picture\u2013picture stimuli (Experiments 1 and 2) and picture\u2013word stimuli (Experiment 3) were presented on the left-hand side of a computer screen. To give the participants an incentive to move their gaze away from the picture\u2013picture or picture\u2013word stimuli, a secondary stimulus requiring a manual response was presented on the right-hand side of the screen. This response involved pressing a left or right button to indicate the direction of a left- or right-pointing arrow.\nPhonological effects in the picture\u2013picture task do not necessarily support a continuous spread of activation within the word production system. The effects may also be obtained when speakers mistakenly select the names of both pictures, as suggested by Levelt et al. (1999) for synonyms. Bloem, Van den Boogaard, and La Heij (2004) suggested that lapses of attention, leading to an erroneous selection of the wrong picture name on some of the trials, explain the picture\u2013picture effects observed by Morsella and Miozzo (2002). The robustness of the effects was tested by examining the latency distributions in Experiment 1. If phonological effects are due to an erroneous selection of the red picture name on some of the trials, followed by a covert repair, the effects should be present for only a part of the latency distribution, namely for the slow responses only. Instead, if the effects reflect cascading of activation, the difference in the latency between the related and unrelated conditions should be present through most of the latency range. The latency distributions were examined using \u201cquantile\u2013 quantile\u201d plots (Thomas & Ross, 1980; Wilk & Gnanadesikan, 1968). A quantile\u2013quantile plot is a standard technique for determining whether two distributions belong to the same distribution family. If they do, the plot should be linear, indicating that the distributions differ only by a scale or shift factor. Linearity in a distribution plot indicates that the difference between conditions varies proportionately with latency (e.g., De Jong, Liang, & Lauber, 1994; Ridderinkhof, 2002; Zhang & Kornblum, 1997). If a linear function is obtained, this would exclude that the effects are caused by lapses of attention.\nSelecting the names of both pictures may be the way that participants deal with the selective attention problem in the picture\u2013picture task. Experiment 2 explicitly examined the effect of multiple selection. On each trial, participants named both pictures, first the green one and then the red one. If the phonological effects in Experiment 1 are due to the selection of the names of both the green and the red pictures, the results from naming one picture in Experiment 1 should be replicated with the naming of both pictures in Experiment 2.\nThe absence of an effect of picture distractors on word reading reported in the literature suggests that the amount of activation that spreads from concepts to word forms is limited and attention dependent (Roelofs, 2003). Experiment 3 examined the influence\nof picture distractors on word reading using picture\u2013word versions of the stimuli used in Experiments 1 and 2. Participants named the picture or word of picture\u2013word stimuli depending on whether the picture or word was presented in green (the picture or word in red had to be ignored), which varied randomly from trial to trial. If phonological effects of picture distractors are obtained on picture naming (Experiment 1) but not on word reading (Experiment 3), this would corroborate the existing evidence that the amount of activation spreading from concepts to word forms is limited and task dependent.\nExperiment 1\nIn the first experiment, participants were presented with green pictures superimposed onto red pictures. Eye movements were recorded while participants named the green picture of the picture\u2013 picture stimuli (presented on the left side of a computer screen) and manually responded by pressing a left or right button in response to the left- or right-pointing arrows ( or , presented on the right side of the screen). For example, they said \u201chammer\u201d in response to a pictured hammer in green color, while trying to ignore a pictured chisel in red (the semantically related condition) or a pictured sandal in red (the semantically unrelated condition). Or they said \u201ccircle\u201d in response to a pictured circle in green, while trying to ignore a pictured circus in red (the phonologically related condition) or a pictured table in red (the phonologically unrelated condition). To minimize the chance that participants would identify the direction of the arrows by their peripheral vision, the arrows were flanked by two Xs on each side, yielding XX XX and XX XX as stimuli."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. The experiment was carried out with a group of 24 paid participants from the pool at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. All participants were young adults who were native speakers of Dutch. None of the participants took part in one of the other experiments.\nMaterials and design. From the picture gallery available at the Max Planck Institute, 40 pictured objects were selected. All pictures had disyllabic names. The pictures were chosen such that 10 pairs of pictures had names that were semantically related and the 10 remaining pairs had names that were phonologically related. The pictures with phonologically related names shared the first syllable. The unrelated conditions were created by recombining the pictures such that each semantically related picture also served as a semantically unrelated picture and each phonologically related picture also served as a phonologically unrelated picture. The Appendix lists the materials. The pictures were line drawings on a black background. They were digitized and scaled to fit into a virtual frame of 10 cm 10 cm. On average, the pictures subtended 8.7\u00b0 horizontally and 8.7\u00b0 vertically at a viewing distance of 66 cm (roughly the distance between the participant and the screen). The arrows were presented in 28-point uppercase Arial font, subtending 3.5\u00b0 horizontally and 0.9\u00b0 vertically. The horizontal distance between the middle of the picture\u2013picture stimuli and the arrow stimuli was 15.2\u00b0.\nThere were two independent variables: type and relation. The variable type indicated whether the pictures were from the semantic or\nthe phonological sets. The variable relation indicated whether the paired pictures were related or unrelated. Both variables were tested within participants. Relation was tested within items and type was tested between items. A participant received 20 picture\u2013picture pairings in each of the four distractor conditions, yielding 80 picture\u2013 picture stimuli in total. Each picture pair was presented twice, yielding 160 trials per participant in total. The order of presenting the stimuli across trials was random, except that repetitions of pictures and words on successive trials were not permitted.\nApparatus. Materials were presented on a 39-cm ViewSonic 17PS screen. Eye movements were measured using an SMI EyeLink-HiSpeed 2D headband-mounted eye-tracking system (SensoMotoric Instruments GmbH, Teltow, Germany). The eye tracker was controlled by a Pentium 90 MHz computer. The experiment was run under the Nijmegen Experiment Setup (NESU) with a NESU button box on a Pentium 400 MHz computer. The participants\u2019 utterances were recorded over a Sennheiser ME400 microphone to a SONY DTC55 digital audio tape (DAT) recorder. Vocal response latencies were measured using an electronic voice key.\nProcedure. The participants were tested individually. They were seated in front of the computer monitor, a panel with a left and a right push button, and the microphone. The distance between participant and screen was approximately 66 cm. Participants were given written instructions telling them how their eyes would be monitored and what the task was. The experimenter also orally described the eye-tracking equipment and restated the instructions. The participants were told that they had to name the green picture of picture\u2013picture stimuli presented on the left side of a computer screen and manually respond by pressing a left or right button in response to the arrows presented on the right side of the screen. To familiarize them with the pictures, the participants received a booklet showing them all pictures used in the experiment together with the expected names.\nWhen a participant had read the instructions and studied the picture booklet, the headband of the eye-tracking system was placed on the participant\u2019s head, and the system was calibrated and validated. For pupil-to-gaze calibration, a grid of 3 3 positions had been defined. During a calibration trial, a fixation target appeared once, in random order, in each of these positions for one second. Participants were asked to fixate upon each target until the next target appeared. After the calibration trial, the estimated positions of the participant\u2019s fixations and the distances from the fixation targets were displayed to the experimenter. Calibration was considered adequate if there was at least one fixation within 1.5\u00b0 of each fixation target. When calibration was inadequate, the procedure was repeated, sometimes after adjusting the eye cameras. Successful calibration was followed by a pupil-to-gaze validation trial. For the participants, this trial did not differ from the calibration trial, but the data collected during the validation trial were used to estimate the participants\u2019 gaze positions, and the error (i.e., the distance between the estimated gaze position and the target position) was measured. Validation was considered completed if the average error was less than 1.0\u00b0 and the worst error less than 1.5\u00b0. Depending on the result of the validation trial, the calibration and validation trials were repeated or testing began.\nAfter successful calibration and validation, a block of 40 practice trials was administered, in which each picture was shown and named once. This was followed by the 160 experimental trials. The\nstructure of a trial was as follows. A trial started by the simultaneous presentation of the left picture\u2013picture and right arrow stimuli. The stimuli remained on the screen until the participant pushed the button in response to the arrow. The arrows were presented in white. The colored pictures and the arrows were presented on a black background. Before the start of the next trial there was a blank interval of 1.5 sec. The position of the left and right eyes was determined every 4 ms. Drift correction occurred automatically after every 8 trials.\nAnalyses. A naming response was considered to be invalid when it included a speech error, when a wrong word was produced, or when the voice key was triggered incorrectly. Error trials were discarded from the analyses of the naming latencies and gaze shift latencies. To analyze the speakers\u2019 gaze shifts, their eye fixations were classified as falling within or on the outer contours of the left stimulus or elsewhere. Although viewing was binocular and the positions of both eyes were tracked, only the position of the right eye was analyzed. Gaze shift latency was defined as the time interval between the beginning of the first fixation on the left stimulus and the end of the last fixation before the first shift of gaze was initiated to the right arrow. The vocal response latencies, gaze shift latencies, and errors were submitted to analyses of variance. The analyses were performed both by participants (F1) and by items (F2). Faster responding in the related than unrelated condition will be called descriptively facilitation and slower responding will be called interference."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Table 1 gives for each distractor condition the mean latencies, their standard deviations, and the error percentages for the vocal responses and gaze shifts. The table shows that the vocal naming latencies were slightly shorter (11 ms) in the semantically related than unrelated condition, and the gaze shift latencies showed a similar, but larger effect (25 ms). The latencies were shorter in the phonologically related than unrelated condition for both the vocal responses and the gaze shifts (respectively, 29 and 27 ms).\nVocal responses. The statistical analysis of the vocal response latencies yielded a main effect of relation (related vs. unrelated), F1(1, 23) 12.14, MSE 799, p .002; F2(1, 38) 5.59, MSE 1,436, p .02, but not of type (semantic vs. phonological), F1(1, 23) 6.86, MSE 1,069, p .02; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 7,571, p .40. Type and relation did not interact, F1(1, 23) 1.60, MSE 1,401, p .22; F2(1, 38) 1.43, MSE 1,436, p .24. There was a by-items effect of type on the error\nrates, F1(1, 23) 2.77, p .11; F2(1, 38) 4.98, p .03. There were no other effects on the errors (all ps .10).\nAlthough type and relation did not interact, the magnitude of the relatedness effect was numerically smaller for the semantic than for the phonological distractors. Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately revealed that the semantic effect did not reach significance, t1(23) 1.0, p .33; t2(19) 1.17, p .26, but there was a phonological effect, t1(23) 3.45, p .002; t2(19) 2.05, p .05. This suggests that the relatedness effect was driven by the phonological distractors.\nGaze shifts. The statistical analysis of the gaze shift latencies yielded a main effect of relation, F1(1, 23) 23.14, MSE 709, p .001; F2(1, 38) 5.72, MSE 2,512, p .02, but not of type, F1(1, 23) 6.58, MSE 1,206, p .02; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 7,374, p .40. Type and relation did not interact, F1(1, 23) 1, MSE 774, p .88; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 2,512, p .80. Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately showed that there were semantic and phonological effects in the analysis by participants, respectively, t1(23) 3.47, p .002; t2(19) 1.91, p .07, and t1(23) 3.21, p .004; t2(19) 1.60, p .13. Whereas the main effect of relation was significant both by participants and by items, the relatedness effects within the semantic and phonological conditions separately reached significance in the analysis by participants only, presumably because dividing the pictures by type reduced the power of the analysis by items. To conclude, the effects obtained for the vocal response latencies were basically replicated for the gaze shift latencies, except that the semantic effect was now more robust.\nTo summarize, the experiment replicated the facilitation effect of phonological relatedness obtained by Morsella and Miozzo (2002) and Navarrete and Costa (2005) not only for the vocal responses but also for the corresponding gaze shifts. The effect of phonological relatedness of two pictures was obtained in the context of a semantic facilitation effect, which was present in the gaze shift latencies. Table 1 suggests that the difference in semantic effect between vocal responding and gaze shifting may be due to greater variability in the vocal latency data. The standard deviations of the latencies tended to be greater for the vocal responses than for the gaze shifts and greater for the semantic than for the phonological conditions. This may explain why there was no robust semantic effect in the vocal responses.\nBloem et al. (2004) suggested that erroneously selecting the wrong picture name on some of the trials explains the phonological picture\u2013picture effects, as observed by Morsella and Miozzo (2002) and in the present experiment. This hypothesis was evaluated by examining the latency distributions for the vocal responses and gaze shifts in the phonologically related and unrelated conditions. To obtain the latency distributions, I divided the rankordered latencies for each participant into deciles (10% quantiles) and computed mean latencies for each decile, separately for the vocal responses and gaze shifts and for the phonologically related and unrelated conditions. By averaging these means across participants, so-called Vincentized cumulative distribution functions are obtained (Ratcliff, 1979). Vincentizing the latency data across individual participants provides a way of averaging data while preserving the shapes of the individual distributions. Figure 2 shows the distributional plots for Experiment 1. Rank-ordering the\nlatencies for each item and using these to compute Vincentized cumulative distribution functions yielded equivalent distributional plots (which are not shown).\nFigure 2 shows that the phonological effect was present throughout the entire latency range for the gaze shifting, except in the 10% quickest gaze shifts. This suggests that when gaze shifts occur really early, before phonological encoding, no phonological effect is obtained. The phonological effect was present across the entire latency distribution for the vocal responses. For both the vocal responses and gaze shifts, the difference between the related and unrelated conditions increased with latency. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no interaction of relation (related vs. unrelated) and decile (1\u201310) for the vocal responses, F(9, 207) 1.18, MSE 3,266, p .31, but there was an interaction for the gaze shifts, F(9, 207) 3.73, MSE 3,055, p .001. Further\nanalyses revealed that the increase of the phonological effect with latency was not disproportionate. The latencies in the related and unrelated conditions were linearly related for both the vocal responses and the gaze shifts, as illustrated by the quantile\u2013quantile plots in Figure 3. The figure shows the relationship between condition distributions based on a grouping of the latencies by participants. Grouping of the latencies by items (not shown) yielded the same results. This finding of a linear relationship between latencies excludes an interpretation of the phonological effects in terms of lapses of attention (Bloem et al., 2004).\nExperiment 2\nIn the second experiment, participants were presented with the same picture\u2013picture stimuli as in Experiment 1. Eye movements\nwere recorded while participants named both pictures of the picture\u2013picture stimuli and manually responded to the arrows. For example, they said \u201chammer chisel\u201d in response to a pictured hammer in green color and a pictured chisel in red (semantically related) and they said \u201chammer sandal\u201d in response to a pictured hammer in green color and a pictured sandal in red (semantically unrelated). Or they said \u201ccircle circus\u201d in response to a pictured circle in green and a pictured circus in red (phonologically related) and they said \u201ccircle table\u201d in response to a pictured circle in green and a pictured table in red (phonologically unrelated). The utterances had to be produced fluently, without a pause between the two names. If the phonological effects obtained in Experiment 1 were due to the selection of both picture names, the results from naming one picture in Experiment 1 should be replicated with the naming of both pictures in Experiment 2."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The method was the same as in Experiment 1, except that the participants named both pictures on each trial, first the green one and then the red one. The experiment was run with 18 new participants."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Table 2 gives for each distractor condition the mean latencies, their standard deviations, and the error percentages for the vocal responses and gaze shifts. The table shows that the latencies of the vocal responses were slightly longer in the semantically related than unrelated condition (17 ms), whereas those of the gaze shifts did not differ (0 ms). The latencies also did not differ much between the phonologically related and unrelated conditions for the vocal responding and gaze shifting (respectively, 7 and 11 ms).\nVocal responses. The statistical analysis of the vocal response latencies yielded no effect of relation, F1(1, 17) 1, MSE 2,268, p .62; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 2,640, p .74, but there was an effect of type, F1(1, 17) 18.57, MSE 2,039, p .001; F2(1, 38) 4.36, MSE 9,033, p .04. Type and relation did not interact, F1(1, 17) 1.53, MSE 2,313, p .23; F2(1, 38) 1.06, MSE 2,640, p .31. Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately confirmed that there were no semantic and phonological effects, respectively, t1(17) 1.26, p .23; t2(19) 1.24, p .23, and t1(17) 0.52, p .61; t2(19) 0.41, p .68. There were no effects in the analysis of the error rates (all ps .40).\nGaze shifts. The statistical analysis of the gaze shift latencies yielded no effect of relation, F1(1, 17) 1, MSE 10,018, p .83; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 10,626, p .84, and also no reliable effect of type, F1(1, 17) 8.11, MSE 4,812, p .01; F2(1, 38) 2.06, MSE 24,997, p .16. Type and relation did not interact, F1(1, 17) 1, MSE 2,684, p .65; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 10,626, p .73. Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately showed that there were no semantic and phonological effects, respectively, t1(17) 0.00, p .99; t2(19) 0.10, p .91, and t1(17) 0.39, p .70; t2(19) 0.35, p .73.\nFigure 4 shows that the phonological effect was absent throughout the entire latency range for the gaze shifting and vocal responding. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no interaction of relation and decile for the gaze shifts, F(9, 153) 0.19, MSE 10,814, p .95, and also none for the vocal responses, F(9, 153) 1.15, MSE 2,958, p .33. Thus, the absence of phonological effects is a robust phenomenon, and it does not depend on latency.\nTo summarize, the experiment yielded no semantic and phonological relatedness effects on the latencies of naming and gaze shifting. If the phonological effects in Experiment 1 were due to the selection of the names of both the green and the red pictures, the results from naming one picture in Experiment 1 should be replicated with the naming of both pictures in Experiment 2. This was not the case, which suggests that the effects of Experiment 1 did not arise because of selecting the names of both pictures.\nThis raises the question of why semantic and phonological effects were obtained in naming one of the two pictures (Experiment 1), whereas no such effects were obtained in naming both pictures (Experiment 2). Elsewhere (Levelt et al., 1999; Roelofs, 1992, 1997, 2003), it was argued that effects of distractor words in picture naming reflect not only the activation flow within the word production network but also the attentional weighting of node activations in selecting a node (cf. Bundesen, 1990, for visual attention). Whether the outcome is interference or facilitation may depend on the task and experimental context. The findings from Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that the outcome for picture\u2013picture stimuli depends on whether one or two pictures have to be named. When both pictures have to be named (the task in Experiment 2), both picture names have to be planned. This may make the related red picture name a stronger competitor for the green picture name than when only the green picture name has to be planned (the task in Experiment 1) and the red one can be ignored. The larger attentional weight assigned to the picture in red in naming both pictures may counteract its facilitatory effect on the naming of the picture in green. The net result may be a null effect, as empirically observed.\nWhereas the gaze shifts were initiated, on average, 145 ms before the onset of articulation in Experiment 1, they happened, on average, 450 ms after articulation onset in Experiment 2. This difference in timing can be explained by assuming that gaze shift latencies reflected the phonological planning of the whole utterance referring to the picture\u2013picture stimulus, whereas speech onset latencies did not. The utterance included the names of both pictures in Experiment 2 (e.g., \u201chammer chisel\u201d), but only the name of the green picture in Experiment 1 (e.g., \u201chammer\u201d). Levelt and Meyer (2000) and Korvorst et al. (2006) observed that gaze shift latencies may reflect the phonological length of the\nutterance even when vocal response latencies do not. For example, Levelt and Meyer instructed their participants to describe colored left and right objects (e.g., a big red scooter and a ball) in a simple or in a complex way. Participants either had to respond with \u201cthe scooter and the ball\u201d or \u201cthe big red scooter and the ball.\u201d The gaze shift latencies for the left stimulus (the scooter) were much shorter for the simple utterances than for the complex utterances. However, the vocal response latencies did not differ between the two utterance types. Furthermore, the shift of gaze to the right stimulus was initiated before articulation onset for the simple utterances, but after articulation onset for the complex utterances, similar to what was observed in the present Experiments 1 and 2. This suggests that the shift of attention and gaze, but not the onset of articulation, is triggered by the completion of phonological encoding of the utterance referring to the left stimulus.\nWhereas semantic and phonological effects were absent in the present experiment, Freedman, Martin, and Biegler (2004) observed semantic effects in a double-picture naming task used to study the role of short-term memory in noun phrase production. There are several methodological differences between the experiments, which may have yielded the difference in effects. First, whereas the two pictures were superimposed in the present experiment, they were presented side by side in the experiment of Freedman et al. Second, whereas semantically related and unrelated trials were randomly intermixed in the present experiments, the related and unrelated conditions were presented in different blocks of trials by Freedman et al. Third, whereas the participants produced two nouns in the present experiments, they produced conjoined noun phrases (i.e., the two nouns were connected by the word \u201cand\u201d) in the study of Freedman et al. Fourth, whereas the pictures remained on the screen until the onset of the manual response to the arrows in the present experiment, the pictures disappeared from the screen as soon as the participants began the utterance in the experiment of Freedman et al. The latter forced the participants to attend to both pictured objects before speech onset,\nwhich allowed Freedman et al. to study the role of short-term memory in producing the noun phrases. It seems plausible to assume that the need to use short-term memory in the experiment of Freedman et al., but not in the present experiment, is responsible for the difference in semantic effect between experiments.\nExperiment 3\nPicture distractors yielded semantic and phonological effects in Experiment 1 but no such effects in Experiment 2, supporting the cascade view. The literature indicates, however, that there is no effect of picture distractors on word reading (e.g., M. O. Glaser & Glaser, 1982; W. R. Glaser & Du\u0308ngelhoff, 1984; W. R. Glaser & Glaser, 1989; Roelofs, 2003, 2006a, 2006b; Smith & Magee, 1980). The absence of an effect of pictures on word reading suggests that the amount of activation that spreads from concepts to word forms is limited (Roelofs, 2003). The picture\u2013word asymmetry in effects between picture naming and word reading does not seem to be due to the relative speed of processing of pictures and words per se. Words are typically named faster than the corresponding pictures, namely some 100\u2013200 ms (e.g., MacLeod, 1991; Roelofs, 2003). However, when one compensates for the slower processing of pictures by presenting them in advance of the words to be named (e.g., 300 or 400 ms), still no interference on word reading is observed (W. R. Glaser & Du\u0308ngelhoff, 1984). A similar asymmetry is obtained between naming colors and reading their names in the color\u2013word Stroop task (Stroop, 1935; see MacLeod, 1991, for a review) and also between color naming and spoken color\u2013word naming (Roelofs, 2005). Again, an effect of distractor color is absent even when the colors are preexposed to compensate for the difference in processing speed between colors and words (M. O. Glaser & Glaser, 1982; Roelofs, 2005). This suggests that the asymmetry between naming pictures and colors, on the one hand, and naming written or spoken words, on the other, is due to an architectural difference (i.e., a byproduct of network\ndistance as illustrated in Figure 1, see Roelofs, 2003, 2005) rather than a difference in relative speed of processing.\nExperiment 3 investigated the impact of picture distractors on word reading using picture\u2013word versions of the stimuli used in Experiments 1 and 2. The pictures were in red and the words in green or vice versa. Participants named the picture or word of the picture\u2013word stimuli depending on whether the picture or word was presented in green, which varied randomly from trial to trial. If the effects of picture distractors obtained in Experiment 1 are absent in word reading, this would corroborate the available evidence that the amount of activation that spreads from concepts to word forms is limited. As in the previous experiments, both vocal response latencies and eye movements were recorded."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The method was the same as in Experiment 1, except that picture\u2013word stimuli were used. There were 20 picture\u2013word pairs per condition in each task, yielding 160 trials per participant. Participants named the picture or the word of the picture\u2013word stimuli depending on whether the picture or the word was presented in green, which varied randomly from trial to trial. The distractor words were presented in 36-point lowercase Arial font. On average, the words subtended 5.2\u00b0 horizontally and 1.3\u00b0 vertically. The experiment was run with 14 new participants."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Table 3 gives for each task and distractor condition the mean latencies, their standard deviations, and the error percentages for the vocal responses and gaze shifts. The table shows that the latencies of picture naming and gaze shifting were longer in the semantically related than unrelated condition (respectively, 33 and 41 ms for the vocal responses and gazes). Also, the latencies were longer in the phonologically related than unrelated condition for both picture naming and gaze shifting (respectively, 38 and 53 ms). However, the latencies for word reading and gaze shifting were similar in the semantically related and unrelated conditions\n(respectively, 3 and 3 ms difference). Also, the latencies for word reading and gaze shifting were similar in the phonologically related and unrelated conditions (respectively, 3 and 10 ms difference). Thus, there were no differences among conditions for word reading.\nVocal responses. The statistical analysis of the vocal response latencies yielded main effects of task, F1(1, 13) 344.52, MSE 3,732, p .001; F2(1, 76) 260.54, MSE 7,023, p .001, type, F1(1, 13) 6.51, MSE 3,176, p .02; F2(1, 76) 4.15, MSE 7,023, p .04, and relation, F1(1, 13) 5.92, MSE 1,537, p .03; F2(1, 76) 3.53, MSE 3,071, p .06. Moreover, there were interactions of task and type, F1(1, 13) 60.80, MSE 675, p .001; F2(1, 76) 8.15, MSE 7,023, p .006, task and relation, F1(1, 13) 7.11, MSE 1,234, p .02; F2(1, 76) 3.72, MSE 3,071, p .06, but not of type and relation, F1(1, 13) 1, MSE 2,509, p .89; F2(1, 76) 1, MSE 3,071, p .91. For the picture naming latencies, there were effects of type, F1(1, 13) 29.56, MSE 2,029, p .001; F2(1, 38) 8.15, MSE 10,318, p .007, and relation, F1(1, 13) 10.63, MSE 1,680, p .006; F2(1, 38) 6.14, MSE 3,623, p .02. Type and relation did not interact, F1(1, 13) 1, MSE 1,758, p .97; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 3,623, p .93. Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately showed that there were semantic and phonological effects in the analysis by participants, respectively, t1(13) 2.39, p .03; t2(19) 1.59, p .13, and t1(13) 2.18, p .05; t2(19) 1.94, p .07. Again, whereas the main effect of relation was significant both by participants and by items, the relatedness effects within the semantic and phonological conditions separately reached significance in the analysis by participants only, presumably because dividing the items by type reduced the power of the analysis by items. For the word reading latencies, there were no effects of type and relation, and type and relation did not interact (all Fs 1). Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately showed that there were no semantic and phonological effects, respectively, t1(13) 0.22, p .83; t2(19) 0.14, p .88, and t1(13) 0.20, p .84; t2(19) 0.24, p .81. To conclude, there were effects in picture naming but not in word reading. The error rates differed between tasks, F1(1, 13) 10.48, p .006; F2(1, 76) 15.52, p .001, showing that more errors were made in the picture naming than in the word reading task. Given that more errors were made in the slower task, there is no evidence for a speed\u2013accuracy trade-off. There were no other error effects (all ps .15).\nGaze shifts. The statistical analysis of the gaze shift latencies yielded main effects of task, F1(1, 13) 172.86, MSE 6,750, p .001; F2(1, 76) 171.52, MSE 9,780, p .001, relation, F1(1, 13) 5.37, MSE 3,257, p .04; F2(1, 76) 5.45, MSE 4,381, p .02, but not of type, F1(1, 13) 1.01, MSE 3,459, p .33; F2(1, 76) 1, MSE 9,780, p .44. Moreover, there were interactions of task and type, F1(1, 13) 17.42, MSE 2,144, p .001; F2(1, 76) 5.55, MSE 9,780, p .021, task and relation, F1(1, 13) 7.66, MSE 1,731, p .02; F2(1, 76) 4.54, MSE 4,381, p .04, but not of type and relation, F1(1, 13) 1, MSE 2,061, p .46; F2(1, 76) 1, MSE 4,381, p .59. For picture naming, there was an effect of type in the byparticipants analysis, F1(1, 13) 11.57, MSE 2,751, p .005;\nF2(1, 38) 3.03, MSE 15,997, p .09, and there was an effect of relation, F1(1, 13) 10.83, MSE 2,826, p .006; F2(1, 38) 7.22, MSE 6,048, p .011. Type and relation did not interact, F1(1, 13) 1, MSE 2,331, p .63; F2(1, 38) 1, MSE 6,048, p .80. Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately showed that there was a semantic effect in the analysis by participants, t1(13) 2.76, p .02; t2(19) 1.59, p .13, and a phonological effect, t1(13) 2.32, p .04; t2(19) 2.29, p .03. For word reading, there were no effects of type, F1(1, 13) 3.16, MSE 2,851, p .10; F2(1, 38) 3.31, MSE 3,664, p .08, or relation (both Fs 1), and type and relation did not interact (both Fs 1). Planned comparisons between the related and unrelated conditions within the semantic and phonological conditions separately showed that there were no semantic and phonological effects, respectively, t1(13) 0.26, p .80; t2(19) 0.26, p .80, and t1(13) 0.52, p .61; t2(19) 0.57, p .58. Thus, there were effects in picture naming but not in word reading.\nFigure 5 shows the distributional plots for the latencies of the gaze shifts and vocal responses of word reading and picture naming in the phonologically related and unrelated conditions. The left panel shows that the phonological effect on the gaze shifts was absent throughout the latency distribution for word reading, whereas the effect was present across the entire latency range except for the short latencies in picture naming. This suggests that when the gaze shifts occur early, before the onset of phonological encoding, phonological effects are absent. Statistical analysis revealed that there was an interaction of relation and decile for picture naming, F(9, 117) 5.82, MSE 4,862, p .001, but there was no reliable interaction for word reading, F(9, 117) 1.74, MSE 1,731, p .09. The right panel shows that the phonological effect on the vocal responses was also absent throughout the latency distribution for word\nreading, whereas the effect was present throughout the latency range for picture naming. Statistical analysis revealed that there were no interactions of relation and decile for picture naming, F(9, 117) 1.87, MSE 6,012, p .06, and word reading, F(9, 117) 0.50, MSE 3,065, p .87. Figure 5 also reveals that for both the gaze shifts and the vocal responses, the asymmetry in effects between picture naming and word reading existed even in the overlapping latency ranges, namely between 460 and 1,000 ms for gaze shifting and between 540 and 1,000 ms for vocal responding. The presence of the asymmetry in the absence of a latency difference provides evidence that the picture\u2013word asymmetry is a byproduct of network distance (Roelofs, 2003, 2005) rather than being caused by a difference in relative speed of processing.\nTo summarize, word distractors yielded semantic and phonological effects in picture naming, whereas picture distractors yielded no effect on word reading, regardless of latency. The asymmetry in effects was obtained in the latencies of both vocal responding and gaze shifting. The picture\u2013word asymmetry suggests that the amount of activation that cascades from concepts to word forms is limited and attention dependent (Roelofs, 2003).\nWhereas phonologically related distractor words usually speed up picture naming compared to unrelated words (e.g., Damian & Martin, 1999; Schriefers et al., 1990), they yielded phonological interference in the present experiment. Thus, the fact that the distractor word affords the other task in the experiment (oral reading) does influence the nature of the effect it has on picture naming. The phonological interference effect suggests that the phonologically related distractor words were stronger competitors in the present experiment than they normally are (i.e., when they are not the targets of the other task in an experiment), turning the usual phonological facilitation into interference.\nWEAVER Simulations\nFollowing Levelt et al. (1999) and Roelofs (1992, 2003), the difference in the direction of the distractor effects between experiments (facilitation in Experiment 1, no effect in Experiment 2, and interference in Experiment 3) was explained as a difference in trade-off between facilitation and interference in word planning, depending on the task situation. Here, I report the results of WEAVER simulations of the phonological effect that demonstrate the utility of this approach. The procedures in simulating the phonological effects were identical to the procedures in the simulations reported by Roelofs (1997), except that the effect of picture rather than spoken word distractors was examined in the present simulations. The phonological effect of picture distractors was simulated by giving input activation to the morpheme nodes of both the target and the distractor picture names. For example, the target picture name was Dutch hamer (English hammer), and the name of the distractor picture was phonologically related (havik, English hawk) or phonologically unrelated (bezem, English broom). To simulate weak cascading of activation, the input to the distractor morpheme (i.e., havik or bezem ) was only 5% of the input to the target (i.e., hamer ). This yielded a basic phonological facilitation effect of 27 ms in the simulations. The real effect in Experiment 1 was 29 ms. Roelofs (2003) showed that WEAVER accounts for the picture\u2013word asymmetry if the spreading rate between lemmas and word forms is lower than 40% of the spreading rate within the form network. Thus, a weakly cascading version of WEAVER accounts for the picture\u2013 picture phonological facilitation effect, on the one hand, and the picture\u2013word asymmetry, on the other.\nIn WEAVER , phonological encoding is followed by the selection of syllable motor programs from a mental syllabary. Based on the constructed phonological word representation, corresponding syllable motor programs are isolated in the syllabary. The probability of actual selection of a syllable program node at a particular moment in time is given by the ratio of the activation of the target syllable program and the sum of the activations of all stored syllable motor programs (Roelofs, 1997). The attentional weighting of the activations in the ratio may depend on the task situation (Levelt et al., 1999). The outcomes of Experiment 3 suggest that phonologically related distractors are stronger competitors in a task-mixing situation than in a normal picture\u2013word interference experiment with only one task (i.e., picture naming). The confidence of the system in an isolated target syllable may be lower when tasks are mixed than when they are blocked. The negative effect of phonological overlap in a task-mixing situation was simulated by reducing the weight of the target syllable in the selection ratio, representing lower confidence in the target. For example, a weight of 0.8 implied that the model was less likely than normal (with a weight of 1.0) to select the target syllable because it was part of the distractor name. Figure 6 shows the effect of the attentional weight on the phonological facilitation effect. When the weight is still large (e.g., 0.8 or 0.6), there is only a small reduction in the size of the phonological facilitation effect. However, with smaller weights (e.g., 0.4 or 0.2), the phonological facilitation effect (observed in Experiment 1) turns into phonological interference (observed in Experiment 3).\nA similar explanation may be given for the difference in direction of semantic effects. Whereas Damian and Bowers (2003)\nobtained no semantic effect of picture distractors on picture naming, W. R. Glaser and Glaser (1989) obtained semantic interference, and La Heij et al. (2003) obtained semantic interference or facilitation depending on the ease of target selection. Thus, it seems that if separating the target and distractor is easy, the system\u2019s confidence in the isolated lemma is high, and the lemma receives a large weight in the selection ratio relative to other lemmas. Consequently, semantic facilitation appears (cf. Figure 6). In contrast, if separating target and distractor is difficult, the system\u2019s confidence in the isolated lemma is lower, and the lemma receives a smaller weight in the selection ratio. As a consequence, semantic interference occurs (cf. Figure 6). Roelofs (1992) demonstrated the utility of such an approach through computer simulations.\nTo summarize, the simulations revealed that a weakly cascading version of WEAVER can account for the phonological effect in the picture\u2013picture task, on the one hand, and the picture\u2013word asymmetry, on the other. Moreover, the simulations showed that the differences in direction of the phonological effects (facilitation in Experiment 1, no effect in Experiment 2, and interference in Experiment 3) may be explained as differences in trade-off between facilitation and interference, depending on the task situation (cf. Levelt et al., 1999). A similar account may be given for the difference in direction of the semantic effects (cf. Roelofs, 1992).\nClearly, the proposed account of the variation in direction of effects is tentative and needs to be examined further in future research. However, it is important to note that the difference in direction of effects does not really affect the main conclusions. The presence of a phonological effect in the picture\u2013picture task in Experiment 1 suggests that context pictures activate the phonological forms of their names. This conclusion holds regardless of whether the effect is one of facilitation or interference. The phonological effect per se supports the cascade view. Moreover, the absence of an effect of pictures on word reading in Experiment 3 suggests that the amount of activation that spreads from concepts to phonological forms is limited and task dependent. This conclusion holds regardless of whether the effects of the words in naming the pictures concern facilitation or interference.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present article reported three experiments that examined the relative merits of the continuous and discrete views on the activation flow within the word production system. Experiment 1 was a replication and extension of Morsella and Miozzo (2002) and Navarrete and Costa (2005), testing for an effect of phonological relatedness of two pictures with the use of eye tracking. Different from Morsella and Miozzo, all pictures occurred both as targets and distractors. This manipulation served to optimize a comparison between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, where both pictures had to be named and therefore both were part of the response set. Experiment 1 replicated the effect of phonological relatedness obtained by Morsella and Miozzo not only for the vocal responses but also for the gaze shifts. The effect of phonological relatedness of two pictures was obtained in the context of a semantic effect, which was clearly present in the gaze shift latencies.\nDistractor pictures that are part of the response set may be more salient than distractor pictures that are not. Moreover, naming a picture may strengthen the stimulus\u2013response connection. Presenting a previously named picture as distractor may lead to more activation of the distractor\u2019s name than presenting a distractor picture that has not been named before (e.g., Waszak, Hommel, & Allport, 2003). It may be argued that the phonological facilitation effect is due to the fact that the distractor pictures were possible responses in the present experiments. However, this cannot be the case, because Morsella and Miozzo (2002) and Navarrete and Costa (2005) obtained the phonological facilitation effect for distractor pictures that were not targets in the experiment. Similarly, A. S. Meyer and Damian (2007) investigated effects of phonological begin- and end-overlap between two pictures, as well as potential effects of a familiarization phase. Both types of overlap yielded comparable phonological facilitation effects, and whether participants had been familiarized with the pictures prior to the experimental session did not really matter. The phonological effect did not change systematically over six repetitions of the materials. Moreover, a greater salience or stimulus\u2013response connection strength of distractor pictures could only lead to phonological activation of their names in a discrete system if the greater salience or strength leads to the selection of the concept (Bloem & La Heij, 2003) or the lemma (Levelt et al., 1999) of the distractor\u2019s name. Selection is goal dependent in the model of word planning proposed by Levelt et al. (1999). However, Experiment 2 showed that when the goal explicitly includes the selection of the name of the picture in red, this still does not yield phonological facilitation.\nPhonological effects in the picture\u2013picture task do not necessarily support a continuous spread of activation within the word production system. The effects may also be obtained as a result of misselection. Levelt et al. (1999) suggested that in case of synonyms, speakers mistakenly select the names of both pictures. Bloem et al. (2004) argued that the participants in the experiment of Morsella and Miozzo (2002) mistakenly selected the wrong picture name on some of the trials. This would explain the phonological effect. However, distributional analyses in Experiment 1 revealed that the phonological effect increased linearly with latency, for both the vocal responses and the gaze shifts. The linearity excludes that the effect occurred on some of the trials (i.e., the slow ones) only. This suggests that the phonological effect does not arise because of lapses of attention. Still, the\nfindings on the latency distributions are compatible with the idea that selecting the names of both pictures is the way that participants deal with the selective attention problem in the picture\u2013 picture task. Experiment 2 examined the effect of planning the names of both pictures. On each trial, participants named both pictures, first the green one and then the red one. If the phonological effects in Experiment 1 were due to the selection of the names of both the green and the red pictures, the results from naming one picture in Experiment 1 should be replicated with the naming of both pictures in Experiment 2. This was not the case, which suggests that the effects in Experiment 1 did not arise because of a special planning strategy adopted to deal with the overlapping pictures.\nPicture distractors yielded semantic and phonological facilitation effects in Experiment 1 but no such effects in Experiment 2, supporting the continuous view. The literature suggests, however, that the amount of activation that cascades from concepts to word forms is restricted, because there is no effect of picture distractors on word reading. Experiment 3 examined the influence of picture distractors on word reading using picture\u2013word versions of the stimuli used in Experiments 1 and 2. Participants named the picture or word of picture\u2013word stimuli depending on whether the picture or word was presented in green, which varied randomly from trial to trial. The experiment showed that word distractors yielded semantic and phonological effects in picture naming, but picture distractors yielded no effect on word reading. The picture\u2013 word asymmetry suggests that the spread of activation from concepts to word forms is limited and attention dependent.\nThe attention dependence of the flow of activation also explains why there is a phonological facilitation effect in the picture\u2013 picture task, whereas there is no easily detectable activation of the phonological form of semantic competitors of a picture name, as observed for picture naming in the dual-task paradigm used by Levelt et al. (1991), Peterson and Savoy (1998), and Roelofs (2003). A major difference between the picture\u2013picture task and picture naming in a dual-task situation is that the competitor that yields phonological activation is explicitly presented as a picture in the picture\u2013picture task but not in the dual-task situation. In performing the picture\u2013picture task, both the target and the distractor picture are probably given attention as part of the process of separating them (cf. Allport et al., 1985; MacLeod, 1998). This would mean that the competitor that yields phonological activation is more activated in the picture\u2013picture task than in picture naming in the dual-task paradigm, explaining the phonological effect. As indicated, a difference in selective attention also explains why picture distractors yield a phonological effect in picture naming, whereas they have no effect at all in word reading. Only when participants attentionally enhance the activation of the picture name do pictures have an effect on word reading, as observed by Peterson and Savoy, and as observed by Roelofs (2003) for the color\u2013word Stroop task. These differences among studies suggest that the amount of activation that cascades through the system is limited.\nThe evidence from the present experiments for limited cascading agrees with the observation of Roelofs, O\u0308zdemir, and Levelt (2007) that passive picture viewing does not lead to significant phonological activation. Participants were shown pictures while hearing a tone or a spoken word presented 600 ms after picture onset. When a spoken word was presented, participants indicated\nwhether it contained a prespecified phoneme. When the tone was presented, they indicated whether the picture name contained the phoneme (one experiment), or they named the picture (another experiment). Phoneme monitoring latencies for the spoken words were shorter when the picture name contained the prespecified phoneme compared to when it did not. However, no priming of phoneme monitoring was obtained (in another experiment) when the pictures required no response but were only passively viewed, regardless of monitoring latency. These results suggest that attentional enhancements are a precondition for obtaining phonological activation from pictures.\nWhat do the present findings imply for existing theories of lexical access in word production? Levelt et al. (1999) argued that perceived objects continuously activate their concepts and lemmas, whereas the morphemes, phonemes, and syllable motor programs of the object names are activated only when a speaker has the goal of naming the objects. Dell (1986) argued that all word forms corresponding to the activated concepts and lemmas become continuously activated. And Altmann and Davidson (2001) and Bloem and La Heij (2003) argued that although objects activate their concepts and related ones, the lemmas, morphemes, phonemes, and motor programs of the object names are only activated when a speaker has the goal of naming the objects. The phonological facilitation effect from distractor pictures in Experiment 1 and the absence of the effect in Experiment 2 challenges the claim of Bloem and La Heij that only selected concepts activate their lemmas and forms, and it challenges the claim of Levelt et al. (1999) that only selected lemmas activate their word forms. The phonological facilitation effect from the picture\u2013picture task supports the claim of Dell that activation spreads continuously from concepts to lemmas and from lemmas to forms. However, the evidence from word reading in Experiment 3 suggests that the amount of activation from pictures arriving at the word forms is limited and task dependent (Roelofs, 2003). Whereas Levelt et al. (1999) assumed that the transition of activation from lemmas to word forms occurs in a discrete step, the present findings suggest that the activation is weakly cascading. That is, activation cascades from lemmas to forms, but the amount of activation is limited and task dependent.\nTo conclude, the results from the present picture\u2013picture and picture\u2013word interference experiments support the cascade view and demand a change of discrete models like WEAVER . At the same time, the absence of an effect of distractor pictures on word reading suggests that the amount of activation that spreads continuously from concepts to phonological forms is limited. Computer simulations using a weakly cascading version of WEAVER showed that the model accounts for the phonological effect in the picture\u2013picture task, on the one hand, and for the picture\u2013word asymmetry, on the other. Moreover, the simulations showed that the differences between experiments in the direction of the phonological effects may be explained as differences in the trade-off between interference and facilitation in word-form encoding, depending on the task situation.\nReferences\nAllport, D.

Morris and Mary L. Still Iowa State University\nRepetition blindness (RB) for nonwords has been found in some studies, but not in others. The authors propose that the discrepancy in results is fueled by participant strategy; specifically, when rapid serial visual presentation lists are short and participants are explicitly informed that some trials will contain repetitions, participants are able to use partial orthographic information to correctly guess repetitions on repetition trials while avoiding spurious repetition reports on control trials. The authors first replicated V. Coltheart and R. Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords (Experiment 1). When all participants were encouraged to utilize partial information in a same/different matching task along with an identification task, a repetition advantage was observed for both words and nonwords (Experiment 2). When guessing of repetitions was made detectable by including non-identical but orthographically similar items in the experiments, the repetition advantage disappeared; instead, RB was found for both words and nonwords (Experiments 3 and 4). Finally, when experiments did not contain any identical items, participants almost never reported repetitions, and reliable RB was found for orthographically similar words and nonwords (Experiments 5 and 6).\nKeywords: repetition blindness, nonwords, lexical, sublexical, word recognition\nShort-term repetition effects, such as those found by using masked priming paradigms, currently constitute a major source of information concerning the types of representations thought to mediate early stages of word recognition. Accordingly, questions about the role of lexical versus sublexical representations in repetition effects are often investigated by comparing priming effects for words and nonwords, because words, by definition, are listed in the lexicon, and nonwords are not. Although the question of whether masked repetition priming can be found for nonwords as well as words appears to be straightforward, the results have been mixed, largely because much of the evidence to date has been obtained by using the lexical decision task\u2014a task influenced by lexicality and familiarity (Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Bodner & Masson, 1997; Bowers, 1994; Feustel, Shiffrin, & Salasoo, 1983; Forster, 1998). Similarly, demonstrations of reliable masked repetition priming for nonwords in the naming task (Masson & Isaak, 1999) may simply reflect facilitation of articulatory processes (Forster, 1998).\nRepetition blindness paradigms (RB; Kanwisher, 1987) offer another opportunity to investigate the role of lexical and sublexical representations in short-term repetition effects. When a series of words is displayed in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP; Forster, 1970) at a rate of approximately 8\u201310 items per second, and viewers are asked to identify all the words shown, a repeated word will often go unreported if the two instances of the word\nappear in close temporal proximity (usually less than 500 ms). Although RB is strong for identical words, non-identical words with similar orthography such as cap and cape (Kanwisher & Potter, 1990), home and hose (Bavelier, Prasada, & Segui, 1994), brace and crack (Harris & Morris, 2000), and even martini and tactile (Harris, 2001) also show robust RB. These findings as well as those of Morris and Harris (1999) and Harris and Morris (2001b) have suggested that some RB effects might have a sublexical locus.\nHowever, questions have been raised as to whether RB between orthographically similar items (orthographic RB) reflects the same phenomenon as RB between identical items (identity RB). Chialant and Caramazza (1997) argued that RB for identical words is strictly a lexical-level phenomenon, whereas RB for non-identical words stems from inhibitory processing that occurs during recognition of a single word. On this view, RB between home and hope occurs because during the process of recognizing home, the representations of orthographically similar words such as hope are inhibited. When hope is subsequently displayed, its representation is affected by residual inhibition and therefore the word may not be recognized. Chialant and Caramazza further suggested that identity and orthographic RB differ in time course; that is, whereas identity RB decreased with increasing lag (number of items intervening between the critical words), orthographic RB showed the reverse pattern. Unfortunately, their experiments manipulated lag between items, introducing potential confounds. By using a within-items design and a greater number of stimuli, Harris and Morris (2001a) obtained a monotonic decrease in RB with increasing lag for both identity and orthographic RB. Thus, there is as yet no unequivocal evidence that the mechanisms underlying identity and orthographic RB differ.\nFurthermore, an experiment from Morris and Harris (2004) provided evidence against the lexical inhibition account of orthographic RB. In that experiment, orthographically similar words\nAlison L. Morris and Mary L.

When a blue question mark appeared, participants were to report all the words in the sentence (serial report condition); however, when \u201cword?\u201d appeared in a red font, participants were to perform a lexical decision on a word appearing after the sentence (lexical decision condition). Large RB effects were found in the serial report task, but in the lexical decision task, equal amounts of priming were obtained in the repeated (beef, beer) and nonrepeated (rice, beer) conditions when compared with control conditions in which beer was not displayed. In other words, the representation for beer was activated to the same extent in the repeated and nonrepeated conditions. This result is not what one would expect if RB for beer stemmed from lexical inhibition occurring during the process of recognizing beef.\nAn additional test of the role of sublexical representations in short-term repetition involves investigating the presence of RB for nonwords. If Chialant and Caramazza (1997) are correct, and RB occurs only for items that are lexically identical, then RB should be readily demonstrated for words, but not for nonwords (Coltheart & Langdon, 2003). On the other hand, if RB is not restricted to lexical representations, it should be possible to demonstrate RB for nonwords. Harris and Morris (2004) obtained significant RB for nonwords in four experiments with only two items per trial (two words, a word\u2013nonword pair, or two nonwords) to minimize encoding and memory demands for the nonwords. Masson, Caldwell, and Whittlesea (2000), using longer RSVP streams, found RB for nonword\u2013word pairs such as choif\u2013chief when the nonword was displayed for a sufficient duration (600 ms). However, two published reports (Campbell, Fugelsang, & Hernberg, 2002; Coltheart & Langdon, 2003) failed to find RB for nonwords. The Coltheart and Langdon findings are particularly noteworthy in that across several experiments they consistently found RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; that is, the joint report of the critical items (known as the \u201cboth\u201d score, meaning that both critical items were reported) was actually higher for repeated trials than for control trials.\nBecause nonwords are difficult to read in RSVP displays, Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of a repetition advantage for nonwords might seem intuitive; it might take two opportunities to read a nonword in order to encode it accurately. If this were the case, one would find that the second of the repeated nonwords (C2) would be correctly reported more often than would a nonrepeated nonword in the same position in the RSVP stream (a control C2). For example, when comparing performance on narp jeal narp with snoy jeal narp, one might expect the second narp to be reported more accurately in the repeated condition than in the nonrepeated condition. However, this is not what Coltheart and Langdon found. They found an increase in the joint report of C1 and C2. This distinction (between increased report of C2 and increased report of both C1 and C2) is important.\nColtheart and Langdon (2003) couched their findings within the token individuation hypothesis of RB originally proposed by Kanwisher (1987). According to this hypothesis, each stimulus item activates its type representation (an abstract representation), but an item is consciously identified only if spatiotemporal information (a token) is bound to its type. In this framework, RB occurs when the first instance of the item is bound to a token, but its type becomes temporarily unavailable for additional tokenization. This means\nthat participants will often fail to report the second occurrence of the repeated item. However, in cases where C1 is not tokenized (therefore not reported), C2 is free to be tokenized, and there is no RB; in fact, C2 may be reported more often than a nonrepeated item. Note that this explanation still assumes that only one of the identical items is reported; it does not explain how a repetition advantage in the both score might be obtained. Coltheart and Langdon explained the finding of a repetition advantage for nonwords as follows:\nWhen the items are nonwords, because these have no preexisting types, token individuation is likely to be slower, and it might even require copies of multiple, smaller orthographic segments. Thus, at high rates of presentation, these items\u2019 probability of being represented in tokens is much lower. However, if the first critical item is successfully tokenized, the repeated item, as a consequence of priming, will be recognized more quickly, and its orthographic segments will be able to participate in token formation more rapidly than will the segments of an unrelated nonword for which the recognition and orthographic segmentation processes must begin anew. (Coltheart & Langdon, 2003, p. 183)\nThis explanation raises a number of questions. If token individuation for nonwords requires copies of smaller orthographic segments, then why aren\u2019t these sublexical tokens subject to the same limitations as lexical tokens; that is, why isn\u2019t there a time window during which identical types cannot be retokenized? Similarly, why does successful tokenization of words result in RB while for nonwords it results in priming? According to Kanwisher\u2019s theory, priming for C2 is observed when C1 consistently fails to be tokenized (Kanwisher, 1987).\nA more recently proposed theoretical account of short-term repetition effects, known as the competition hypothesis (Morris, Still, & Caldwell-Harris, 2007), may prove more helpful in understanding the differences between performance on words and nonwords in RB experiments. The competition hypothesis is in part derived from two well-known findings from neurophysiological studies. The first is that repetition of a stimulus often results in a decrease in the total amount of activation associated with that stimulus. This has been demonstrated in fMRI studies using human participants (e.g., Buckner et al., 1998; Dehaene et al., 2001) and in electrophysiological recordings from macaque monkeys (e.g., Baylis & Rolls, 1987; Miller & Desimone, 1994; Miller, Li, & Desimone, 1993). Some electrophysiological studies further have suggested that although the overall neural activity decreases with repetition, the activity of the cells most critical for representing the stimulus actually increases (Ringo, 1996). A stimulus representation containing increased activity of critical cells combined with decreased activity of noncritical cells is known as a \u201csharpened\u201d representation (Desimone, 1996; Wiggs & Martin, 1998).\nThe second neurophysiological finding on which the competition hypothesis is based concerns the neural correlates of perceptual awareness. Several investigators have suggested that transient activation of a stimulus representation beyond a particular threshold is not sufficient for conscious awareness. At a minimum, sustained activation of a representation for several hundred milliseconds is required for the item\u2019s occurrence to be stabilized in working memory; synchronized activity involving a larger network may also be required (for further discussion of these ideas, see Dehaene & Naccache, 2001; Dehaene et al., 2001; Subrama-\nniam, Biederman, & Madigan, 2000; Summerfield, Jack, & Burgess, 2002; Tononi & Edelman, 1998; Ward, 2003).\nIf stimulus representations require sustained activation to reach consciousness, it is therefore not surprising that some items fail to be reported from even short RSVP displays, or that viewers often have a sense of fleeting awareness accompanied by rapid forgetting (Wolfe, 1999). In addition, the rapid display of successive items creates competition between the item representations for access to conscious awareness (Enns & Di Lollo, 2000). If the sustained activation of an item\u2019s representation is interfered with by competing representations, the item may go unnoticed, or the viewer may be aware that a target item occurred but may be unable to identify the item (Park & Kanwisher, 1994).\nSpecific predictions of the competition hypothesis are best illustrated by a computational implementation, which is more completely described in Morris et al. (2007). In the competition model, type representations for single letters are overlapping distributed representations consisting of both signal and noise nodes. Five premises guide the predictions: (a) Type representations are activated sequentially and their activity decays over time; (b) forward masking consists of residual activation from the previously encoded item which is incorporated into the type activation of the current item; (c) backward masking (in conjunction with forward masking) induces competition for access\nto awareness between adjacent items; (d) when a letter is repeated, its type representation is sharpened\u2014that is, the representation has increased signal relative to noise and decreased total activation; (e) each item representation competes with adjacent items for access to awareness, and the type representation with the larger summed activity (type representation attention) wins the competition. Because the sharpened representations of repeated items carry less total activation, they lose the competition for access to awareness more often than do nonrepeated items. Thus, RB is an emergent property of competitive interactions between items displayed in RSVP.\nFigure 1 illustrates the difference between the type representations for repeated and nonrepeated items according to the competition model. Under rapid or brief display conditions, some of the activation from C1 fails to decay prior to display of C2, and this persisting activation is added to the type representation for C2. In the case of nonrepeated items, the result is a noisier type representation which sometimes results in misidentification. When C1 and C2 are identical, however, forward masking has the effect of sharpening the representation. A sharpened representation is produced when the activation of the signal node reaches an upper limit, while the activation of the noise nodes decreases. Sharpened representations are most often associated with repetition priming; however, they can also\nproduce RB when multiple items are competing for access to awareness.1\nAlthough the competition model was designed to simulate RB for single letters, similar principles could be applied to RB for words by assuming that the total activation associated with a word is in part determined by the activations associated with the representations of its constituent letters. Because the degree of orthographic overlap is greater for identical words than for similar words, the competition hypothesis predicts that RB for orthographically similar words should generally be smaller than RB for identical words; this is in fact the typical finding (Harris & Morris, 2000).2 The competition hypothesis also provides a principled explanation for the probabilistic nature of RB; because of noise in the system, repeated items will sometimes exceed adjacent items in total activation and consequently will gain access to awareness.\nWhat are the implications of the competition hypothesis concerning RB for nonwords? It is generally accepted that nonwords are encoded more poorly than are words in RSVP displays; thus, nonword representations have a smaller signal-to-noise ratio than do more familiar stimuli (e.g., words). This means that the signal node of a nonword C1 generally has a lower activation level than that of a word C1. Consequently, when a nonword is repeated, its signal node will increase in activation but may not reach ceiling (as it would if C1 had been better encoded; see Figure 1). The lack of a ceiling effect means that there is no decrease in total activation associated with C2\u2019s representation. In other words, under conditions of poor encoding, there will be a benefit associated with repetition (increased signal-to-noise ratio), but no cost; there will be priming of the type representation, but no RB. In sum, the competition hypothesis predicts that RB should be more difficult to demonstrate for nonwords than for words. However, it should be possible to obtain RB for nonwords if they are sufficiently well encoded. This requirement explains why Harris and Morris (2004) and Masson et al. (2000) were able to demonstrate small RB effects when short lists or long display durations were used. Most important for the present discussion, a repetition advantage in the joint report of C1 and C2 for nonwords coincident with RB for words is not generally predicted by the competition hypothesis.\nHowever, it is possible that the repetition advantage for nonwords found by Coltheart and Langdon (2003) could be explained as the result of a participant guessing strategy that is separate from the RB phenomenon itself. For example, if participants tended to guess repeated items when recall of the stimuli was poor (as it was for nonwords in their experiments) this may have inflated the both score in the repeated condition for nonwords, masking any indication of RB and producing an apparent repetition advantage. Coltheart and Langdon did consider the possibility that their obtained repetition advantage for nonwords reflected a guessing bias in favor of repeated items, but they rejected it because spurious reports of repeated items on control and two-item trials were infrequent.\nUnfortunately, attempting to control for guessing of repetitions by considering only spurious repetition reports on control or twoitem trials may be inadequate, because it assumes that participants cannot discriminate between repeated and control trials, or between two- and three-item trials. In Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) procedure, participants were warned to expect repeated items; RSVP lists had only two or three items that were to be reported; and repetitions occurred frequently and always involved\nthe first and last words or nonwords. This means that participants were likely to be able to discriminate potential repeated trials from control trials simply on the basis of partial identification of the items.\nFor example, if the nonrepeated control stimulus %%%% #### gerb foat sulp @@@@ was displayed, and participants were able to identify \u201cgerb, foat, and something beginning with s,\u201d they would not have enough information to obtain credit on the both score but would have enough information to know it was not a repeated trial; consequently, they would not be likely to guess a repetition. Similarly, participants would not be likely to report three items following a two-item list if they simply observed that symbols always intervened between the two words or nonwords in such lists. However, if the repeated stimulus %%%% #### sulp foat sulp @@@@ was displayed, and the participant identified \u201csulp, foat, and something else,\u201d there would be the possibility of a repetition, and so they may have guessed a second sulp with some probability P. We propose that fleeting awareness of a third item coupled with a lack of evidence that the item differed from the others could be sufficient to support accurate guessing of repetitions.\nGuessing of repetitions with probability P on repeated trials but not on control or two-item trials would inflate the both score for repeated trials (for both words and nonwords) while having no effect on the both score for control trials. If several participants guessed repetitions, the both scores across participants on repeated trials would tend to equalize across words and nonwords (e.g., 40% accuracy) while the both scores for control trials would remain high for words (e.g., 60% accuracy) and low for nonwords (e.g., 20% accuracy) because nonwords are less easily identified than words. The result would be that the repeated score would be higher than the control score for nonwords (repetition advantage) but would still be lower than the control score for words (RB). This is exactly the pattern obtained by Coltheart and Langdon (2003; Experiments 1, 2, and 6).\nIn this article, we examined the possibility that \u201cinformed guessing\u201d strategies could account for the finding of RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; we also investigated RB for non-identical nonwords. To anticipate, in Experiment 1 we replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; in Experiment 2, we encouraged all participants to employ an informed guessing strategy by including a same/different discrimination task, producing a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords; in Experiments 3 and 4, we discouraged the use of such a strategy by including orthographically similar trials, eliminating the repetition advantage for nonwords and producing RB for both words and nonwords; and\n1 In addition, attention can increase the total activation associated with a representation, making it more competitive against adjacent items. If attention is applied at the beginning of an RSVP stream and is allowed to decay, items near the beginning of the stream will have an advantage over later items; if the level of attention is low, or the RSVP stream consists of many items, the performance function will tend to be U-shaped.\n2 Phonological and semantic overlap may also play a role in RB; however, these effects are generally small compared with the effects of orthographic overlap.\nin Experiments 5 and 6, we conducted additional investigations of RB for orthographically similar nonwords.\nExperiment 1\nTo examine the possibility that an informed guessing strategy was responsible for producing the outcome of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords, we first needed to replicate this finding. In the majority of Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) experiments, word and nonword trials were presented in separate blocks. Unfortunately, this complicates the interpretation of results from these experiments, because presenting words and nonwords in separate blocks can lead to the use of different strategies for reporting words and nonwords. Accordingly, Experiment 1 was designed as a replication of Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s Experiment 6, in which word and nonword trials were intermixed."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Twenty-four Iowa State University undergraduates participated for course credit. All were native speakers of English; 3 were bilingual.\nMaterials. Following Coltheart and Langdon (2003), we selected 72 monosyllabic words and 72 pronounceable nonwords; nonwords were selected from the ARC Nonword Database (Rastle, Harrington, & Coltheart, 2002). All items were 4 letters in length and were monosyllabic. Orthographic neighborhood size (orthographic N) was included as a factor in the design; half the words and nonwords had an orthographic N of 12 or greater, and the other half had an orthographic N of 5 or less. High-N and low-N words were similar in print frequency (15 per million; Francis & Kuc\u030cera, 1982). On the basis of the literature investigating N effects in naming tasks (see Andrews, 1997, for a review), we did not expect large differences in report of high-N and low-N words, but considering the difficulty of reporting nonwords displayed in RSVP, we expected that high-N nonwords would be better encoded than would low-N nonwords. Thus, we predicted that it might be easier to demonstrate RB for high-N nonwords than for low-N nonwords.\nThe high-N and low-N items were each divided into three sets of 12 items for counterbalancing purposes, and the sets were matched on N and print frequency (mean N sizes per set were 14.8, 14.7, and 14.3 for the high-N words; 13.9, 13.9, and 13.9 for the high-N nonwords; 3.8, 3.8, and 3.8 for the low-N words; and 3.1, 3.2, and 3.1 for the low-N nonwords). Sequences of 3 words or 3 nonwords were created with the first and last words or nonwords designated C1 and C2. These were then made into 6-item RSVP streams by displaying rows of symbols (e.g., %%%%, ####) as the first, second, and sixth items in each RSVP stream. The words or nonwords occupied the third, fourth, and fifth positions in each RSVP stream. Stimulus sets 1 and 2 were used to create the repeated condition, where C1 and C2 were identical. The control condition was created from the repeated condition by substituting a word from Stimulus set 3 for C1. Words or nonwords intervening between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 5 and 12. Two versions of the stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed 12 three-word lists in the high-N repeated condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, 12 in the low-N repeated condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition. The same was true for the 3-nonword lists. Each\nparticipant also viewed 40 RSVP streams with only 2 words or nonwords (a row of symbols was substituted for the intervening word or nonword). Each participant saw each critical word or nonword only once. In both versions of the stimulus list, word and nonword lists were randomly intermixed. All stimulus items used in Experiments 1 and 2 are shown in the Appendix (additional stimulus items used in Experiments 3\u20136 may be obtained from Alison L. Morris).\nApparatus and procedure. The stimuli for all experiments reported in this article were presented on a Macintosh G4 with display controlled by the PsyScope experimental control software (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993). The procedure was similar to that of Coltheart and Langdon (2003) except for the mode of response. In the Coltheart and Langdon studies, participants wrote down all the words or nonwords they had seen, whereas in the present experiment, participants named all words or nonwords displayed and the experimenter coded the response into the data file by using the computer keyboard (keys were labeled C1, C2, N, and B, thus providing minimal feedback to participants). In both cases, participants were warned that some of the RSVP lists would contain repeated items, and they were to report these twice.\nEach trial began with a \u201c \u201d displayed in the middle of the computer screen for 560 ms, followed by a blank interval of 560 ms. The RSVP stream was then displayed with each item appearing for 126 ms. Following the RSVP stream, a \u201c?\u201d was displayed to indicate that the participant should report the items. The next trial began immediately after the experimenter keyed in the participant\u2019s response. All stimuli were displayed in a white font (36 pt. Chicago) on a black background. The experimental trials were preceded by 10 practice trials."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Critical pair recall. Following Coltheart and Langdon (2003), we measured RB by comparing the percentage of trials in which both C1 and C2 were reported for the repeated condition compared with the control condition. The results are shown in Figure 2. Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the factors condition (repeated or control), lexicality (word or nonword), and neighborhood size (high-N or low-N) revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (47.0% vs. 18.9%), F1(1, 23) 66.22, F2(1, 92) 201.99, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than repeated pairs (38.4% vs. 27.4%), F1(1, 23) 4.63, p .05, F2(1, 92) 33.18, p .001. There was no main effect of neighborhood size (both Fs 1). The main effect of condition was qualified by a significant crossover interaction between condition and lexicality, F1(1, 23) 110.85, F2(1, 92) 103.43, both ps .001. There was also a significant interaction between lexicality and neighborhood size, F1(1, 23) 7.58, F2(1, 92) 5.68, both ps .05. The Condition Lexicality interaction reflects an RB effect for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; the Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction reflects superior recall of low-N words compared with high-N words, with the reverse pattern for nonwords. The Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction was qualified by a significant Condition Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 6.44, F2(1, 92) 4.28, both ps .05. As can be seen in Figure 2, the triple interaction reflects the fact\nthat the Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction is seen only in the control trials and not in the repeated trials; the same pattern was found by Coltheart and Langdon (2003). The finding of higher accuracy for low-N words compared with high-N words is often observed in perceptual identification tasks; although this finding is sometimes attributed to inhibitory effects of higher frequency neighbors during word recognition, it has also been attributed to a guessing process. If participants guess when the identities of words are poorly encoded, high-N words will be associated with incorrect guesses more often than will low-N words (Snodgrass & Mintzer, 1993; see also Andrews, 1997).\nMost important, we replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s finding of a significant crossover interaction between condition and lexicality in critical item recall. Further analysis of this interaction revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 7.83, p .05, F2(1, 46) 102.54, p .001. Nonwords showed a significant repetition advantage in the item analysis, F(1, 46) 12.75, p .005; although not in the subject analysis, F(1, 23) 2.57, p .12.\nIntervening item recall. To further investigate RB in this experiment, report of the item intervening between C1 and C2 was examined. Recall of the intervening item, on both word and nonword trials, was increased when it appeared in the context of repeated items. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in Table 1.3 Correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 236.19, F2(1, 94) 318.49, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, such that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when it appeared in the context of repeated items, F1(1, 23) 62.33, F2(1, 94) 62.85, both ps .001. The main effect of condition was qualified by a Condition Lexicality interaction, F1(1, 23) 15.22, p .005, F2(1, 94) 8.47, p .01. The interaction reflects a larger increase in intervening item recall for nonwords versus words. Our finding of increased recall of the intervening item on repeated trials mirrors that of Coltheart and Langdon (2003); however, our explanation for the intervening item effect is different from theirs.\nRecall that according to the competition hypothesis, adjacent items compete for access to awareness on the basis of the summed neural activity for each item (Morris et al., 2007). Because a repeated C2 is generally associated with less summed neural activity than is a nonrepeated C2, a repeated C2 will compete less effectively against the preceding item (the item intervening between C1 and C2). The result will be an increase in report of the intervening item in the repeated condition compared with that in the control condition. If both RB for C2 and the intervening item effect are indeed driven by the same process (reduced competitiveness of repeated items), the presence of an intervening item effect for nonwords suggests that RB might have been observed if there had not been any guessing of repetitions on repeated trials. Coltheart and Langdon (2003) attempted to reconcile the cooccurrence of a repetition advantage and the intervening item effect on nonword trials by arguing that the intervening item effect stems from a decrease in processing resources needed at the type identification stage. Thus, by their account, the increase in report of the intervening item in the repeated condition occurs because type identification of C2 is easier when it is a repeated item.\nSome might claim a memory locus for this intervening item effect in that when an item from the RSVP stream is missed, there are fewer items that one has to hold in memory\u2014thereby giving an advantage to any other item that appeared in the list. While this is a reasonable hypothesis, we (along with Luo and Caramazza, 1996) argue that such a memory benefit should occur for any of the items from the list, not just those immediately adjacent to C2. Although the results of this experiment cannot rule out a memory effect, other investigations, using five-item displays, have observed a significant increase in report of the item immediately preceding a repeated C2 (Luo & Caramazza, 1996; Morris et al., 2007). Thus the intervening item effect is more localized than would be predicted by a memory account.\nIn sum, Experiment 1 successfully replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) main findings even though a different response format was used (verbal responses were used as opposed to handwritten responses). In contrast to Coltheart and Langdon, however, we suggest that the repetition advantage for nonwords reflects the use of an informed guessing strategy based on partial orthographic information and/or fleeting awareness of the stimuli. Informed guessing would tend to selectively inflate the both scores on repeated trials; this could in turn mask any RB for nonwords and reduce RB for words. Our finding that the repetition advantage for\n3 Intervening item data are presented collapsed across the factor of neighborhood size.\nnonwords was significant in the item analysis but not significant in the subject analysis is consistent with the idea that some participants may have employed such a strategy to a greater degree than others did.4 Most important, such informed guessing would not be detectable by examining spurious reports of repetitions on control trials or two-item trials. We propose that participants would be unlikely to guess repetitions on control trials as they may have access to partial information pertaining to the repetition status of the trial and the number of items appearing in the trial. Spurious repetition reports were in fact rare in Experiment 1 (reports of repetitions occurred on 2.5% of control trials and 4.3% of two-item trials).\nAlthough the results of Experiment 1 are consistent with our proposal that the repetition advantage for nonwords is produced by some participants using an informed guessing strategy, the results are also consistent with Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) contention that identity at the lexical level is required to produce RB. Additional support for our claim that participants have sufficient access to partial stimulus information to reliably discriminate repeated from control trials (and from two-item trials) would be found if we could demonstrate that more widespread use of partial information can produce a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords. This possibility was investigated in Experiment 2.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, a second task was introduced that encouraged participants to use partial information about the stimuli in making their recognition judgments. As we have mentioned, participants could reliably discriminate repeated from three-item control trials if they simply gleaned enough partial orthographic information from each of the items to know that they differed. However, to effectively use a strategy of guessing repetitions, participants must also discriminate repeated trials from two-item trials. There are at least two ways that participants could make this discrimination in the absence of explicit identification of both of the repeated items. The first is to note that on two-item trials, a symbol string always intervened between the target items, whereas on three-item trials, the three words always appeared in succession. The second method involves a process of low-level visual matching between the target items; it may be the case that participants can detect a match or mismatch between C1 and C2 even when awareness of C2 is insufficient to support explicit identification.\nPerformance on cross-field matching has been demonstrated to be significantly higher than forced-choice identification performance in patients with visual neglect (Verfaellie, Milberg, McGlinchey-Berroth, & Grande, 1995). According to Verfaellie et al. (1995), one explanation for the dissociation is that only a fleeting awareness of visual information is required for the matching task but a more stable record is required for identification. It is possible that a similar dissociation occurs when participants view RSVP streams; participants may sometimes have access to sufficient information to judge whether C1 and C2 match in the absence of explicit identification of C2. Of course, if C1 is identified and C2 is judged a match, then the identity of C2 can be inferred.\nIn Experiment 2, in addition to asking participants to identify all the RSVP items, participants were asked to judge whether the first and last words or nonwords on each trial were the same or\ndifferent. The same/different task allows a more direct assessment of the amount of partial information available on repeated and control trials; specifically, it allows us to determine the extent to which participants can discriminate potential repeated trials from control trials. Furthermore, if participants often have access to partial information about the stimuli, drawing their attention to this information via the same/different judgment should increase the accuracy of their reports of repeated items in the identification task. Making increased use of partial stimulus information should not increase participants\u2019 identification accuracy for control trials because explicit knowledge of the identities of both items is needed. However, partial orthographic information on control trials should prevent false reports of repeated items on these trials. Similarly, false reports of repeated items on two-item trials (which are always nonrepeated trials) should be low if participants can ascertain that only two words or nonwords were presented, and that they differed orthographically.\nIf the available partial stimulus information is sufficient for most participants to make accurate same/different judgments about the stimuli, and they apply this knowledge to the identification task, their reports of repeated items (on repeated trials) should be increased for both words and nonwords in comparison with those of Experiment 1. Identification accuracy for control trials, however, should not differ significantly from that observed in Experiment 1."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Twenty-four Iowa State University undergraduates participated for course credit. All were native speakers of English; 3 were bilingual.\nMaterials. Two blocks of trials were created from the stimuli used in Experiment 1. Two different tasks (same/different judgment and identification) were performed on each RSVP trial, with the order of these tasks varied by block. During the first block, half the participants first made the same/different judgment and then identified the words or nonwords; the other participants first identified the words or nonwords and then made the same/different judgment. During the second block, the respective task orders were reversed. Block was a between-items variable, that is, half the items were assigned to the first block and the other half to the second block. Each block contained equal numbers of trials defined by the factors condition (repeated or control), lexicality (word or nonword), and neighborhood size (high-N or low-N).\nProcedure. The procedure was similar to that in Experiment 1, but with the addition of the same/different task. When the same/ different task occurred first, the cue \u201csame or different?\u201d appeared following the RSVP stream. After the experimenter keyed in the same or different response, the cue \u201cidentify all items\u201d appeared. When the identification task appeared first, the cues appeared in the opposite order. The experimental trials were again preceded by 10 practice trials.\n4 As suggested by an anonymous reviewer, the fact that some participants are influenced more than others by partial information and knowledge of prior probabilities is also consistent with Bayesian accounts of perceptual processing."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Initial analyses on results from the same/different and identification tasks revealed that task order (a between-subjects variable) did not show a main effect, nor did it interact with any other factor; therefore, subsequent analyses were collapsed across task order.5 Results from the same/different and identification tasks in the two blocks are shown in Figure 3.\nSame/different task. Participants were highly accurate on the same/different task (89.4% correct overall on the repeated and control trials, with only 4 of the 24 participants scoring less than 80%). A repeated-measures ANOVA on the percentage of correct scores with the factors condition, lexicality, neighborhood size, and block revealed a significant main effect of lexicality, with slightly higher scores for words (90.8%) than for nonwords (88.0%), F1(1, 23) 4.73, F2(1, 88) 5.40, both ps .05; and a significant main effect of block, with higher scores in the second\nblock (92.8%) than in the first block (86.0%), F1(1, 23) 10.63, p .005, F2(1, 88) 37.92, p .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, with higher scores on control trials (97.2%) than on repeated trials (81.6%), F1(1, 23) 8.57, p .01,\n5 It may initially seem surprising that task order did not have more of an influence on the results. For example, one might expect identification scores for repeated items to be more influenced by the same/different judgment when the latter was performed first. This would be the case if the judgments required for the two tasks were indeed made sequentially. However, the lack of task order effects suggests that even though the responses on the two tasks were made sequentially, the judgments driving the responses may have been interdependent rather than sequential. For some participants, regardless of task order, the same/different judgment may have influenced the identification judgment, while for others, the reverse may have been the case.\nF2(1, 88) 130.39, p .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 6.52, F2(1, 88) 6.90, both ps .05; as was the Condition Block interaction, F1(1, 23) 5.22, p .05, F2(1, 88) 16.09, p .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction indicated that the main effect of lexicality was driven by the scores in the repeated condition (84.7% correct for words, 78.5% correct for nonwords), whereas the scores in the control condition were equivalent (96.9% for words, 97.6% for nonwords). The Condition Block interaction indicated that the difference in accuracy between the repeated and control scores was reduced in the second block. No other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses.\nThe high accuracy level on the same/different task for both words and nonwords suggests that participants were largely able to discriminate potential repeated trials from control trials. In particular, participants were very unlikely to report \u201csame\u201d on control trials, possibly because they had access to sufficient partial orthographic information to rule out a repetition on these trials. However, in order for one to reliably use partial orthographic information as part of an informed guessing strategy, one must also be able to discriminate two-item trials from three-item trials. The mean probability of report of \u201csame\u201d on two-item trials was 12.7%, which is higher than the 4.3% obtained in Experiment 1. However, the rate of spurious reports of repetitions on two-item trials varied greatly among the participants. Four of the participants should be considered outliers, as they reported repetitions on 32.5%\u201377.5% of two-item trials. The mean percentage of spurious repetition reports on two-item trials for the remaining 20 participants was only 4.5%, comparable with the rate found in Experiment 1. Thus, the majority of participants were able to effectively discriminate repeated from control trials and two-item trials.\nIdentification task: Critical pair recall. As in Experiment 1, we measured RB by comparing the percentage of trials in which both C1 and C2 were reported (both scores) for the repeated condition compared with the control condition. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with the factors condition, lexicality, neighborhood size, and block revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (73.9% vs. 42.1%), F1(1, 23) 263.87, F2(1, 88) 243.99, both ps .001; and repeated pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were control pairs (74.2% vs. 41.8%), F1(1, 23) 72.23, F2(1, 88) 316.15, both ps .001. Although the finding of greater joint report of words than of nonwords is consistent with the results of Experiment 1, the finding of greater report of repeated items than of control items (a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords) is not. The repetition advantage in Experiment 2 was greater for nonwords than for words, as revealed by a significant interaction between condition and lexicality, F1(1, 23) 54.97, F2(1, 88) 94.05, both ps .001. Follow-up comparisons revealed that the repetition advantage was significant for words, F1(1, 23) 15.06, p .005, F2(1, 44) 35.63, p .001; and for nonwords, F1(1, 23) 99.30, F2(1, 44) 348.54, both ps .001. We also found a significant Block Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 6.76, F2(1, 88) 4.60, both ps .05. In the first block, high-N words were correctly reported at a higher rate than were low-N words, whereas low-N nonwords were correctly reported at a higher rate than were high-N nonwords; in the second block, the opposite pattern was found. A significant Condition Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 14.42, F2(1, 88) 10.52,\nboth ps .005, further indicates that for control trials, low-N words were correctly reported at a higher rate than were high-N words, whereas high-N nonwords were correctly reported at a higher rate than were low-N words; the opposite pattern was found for repeated trials.\nIdentification task: Intervening item recall. As in Experiment 1, recall of the intervening item on both word and nonword trials was increased when it appeared in the context of repeated items. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in the three-item lists for both blocks of trials and both task orders is shown in Table 2. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with the factors task order, condition, lexicality, and block revealed that correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 22) 405.84, F2(1, 92) 356.36, both ps .001. The main effect of condition was significant such that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when it appeared in the context of repeated items, F1(1, 22) 74.48, F2(1, 92) 110.70, both ps .001. There was also a significant Task Order Block interaction, F1(1, 22) 7.15, p .05, F2(1, 92) 15.60, p .001, which indicates that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when the identification task occurred first. This likely reflects the effect of rapid forgetting of the intervening item when the identification task was performed following the same/different task. Finally, there was a significant Condition Lexicality Block interaction, F1(1, 22) 8.95, p .01, F2(1, 92) 9.57, p .005. This interaction reflects the fact that the intervening item effect for words was greater in the first block than in the second block, whereas the intervening item effect for nonwords showed a tendency to increase in the second block. No other main effects or interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses.\nThe results of Experiment 2 were as predicted; when all participants were required to make a same/different judgment in addition to identifying the words or nonwords, both words and nonwords showed a repetition advantage in the identification task. The implication is that participants are able to use partial orthographic information and/or fleeting awareness of the stimuli to reliably\nNote. For Task Order 1, in Block 1 the same/different task was performed first, and in Block 2 the identification task was performed first. For Task Order 2, in Block 1 the identification task was performed first, and in Block 2 the identification task was performed first.\ndiscriminate repeated from control trials. When they use this information in their identification reports, any RB that might have been evident, whether for words or nonwords, can be masked by guessing of repetitions. Most important, such guessing is not detectable as spurious reports of repetitions on control trials (these occurred on less than 3% of control trials in Experiment 2). Therefore, the usual type of guessing correction based on false reports of repeated items on control trials may be inadequate.\nCould spurious reports of repetitions on two-item trials still be used to correct for guessing? One might surmise that the 4 participants who produced large numbers of spurious repetition reports on two-item trials were the source of the repetition advantage found for words in Experiment 2. Accordingly, we conducted additional analyses on the critical item recall scores, excluding the 4 participants in question. These analyses produced the same pattern of results as those computed over all participants; that is, a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords was exhibited by participants who were able to reliably discriminate repeated from control trials and two-item trials.\nThe results of Experiment 2 support our proposed explanation for the finding of a repetition advantage for nonwords in Experiment 1. If several participants used an informed guessing strategy in Experiment 1, this would have raised the level of repetition reports on repeated trials enough to produce a repetition advantage for nonwords (which exhibited low accuracy on control trials) but not for words (with much higher accuracy on control trials). When all participants were encouraged to use an informed guessing strategy in Experiment 2, the level of repetition reports on repeated trials was raised still further, producing a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords.\nSome might argue that the addition of the same/different task in Experiment 2 changed the way participants processed the stimuli, making it difficult to draw inferences about the findings of Experiment 1 from those of Experiment 2. We suggest that such inferences would be warranted if performance on Experiment 2 closely resembled that on Experiment 1, with the exception of the increase in repetition reports on repeated trials. Figure 4 demonstrates that the addition of the same/different task in Experiment 2 served to increase correct reports of repeated items but left reports of control items unchanged from the level obtained in Experiment 1. This was confirmed by two cross-experiment ANOVAs. For repeatedcondition trials, a significant main effect of experiment showed that the joint report of critical items was higher in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1, F(1, 46) 38.63, p .001, whereas for control trials there was a null effect of Experiment (F 1).\nAdditional evidence supporting our contention that the stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2 were processed in a similar manner can be found by comparing identification performance for the item intervening between C1 and C2. Participants may have attended to the critical items at the expense of the intervening item in Experiment 2 because the same/different task required comparison of only the critical items. However, inspection of the data in Tables 1 and 2 reveals that performance on the intervening item was similar in the two experiments; if anything, performance was slightly better in Experiment 2.\nFinally, one might wonder whether the same/different task provided participants with feedback regarding the correctness of their responses on this task, which could then influence performance on the identification task. There are two reasons that this is unlikely.\nThe first is that the participants\u2019 same/different responses were keyed in as \u201csame\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d rather than \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d The second is that there was no effect of task order on identification performance; that is, performing the same/different task first did not result in an improvement in performance on the identification task.\nIn sum, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants could make use of partial and/or fleeting information from the display to accurately discriminate repeated from control trials. If sufficient numbers of participants in Experiment 1 used an informed guessing strategy on a sufficient proportion of trials, the amount of measurable RB would be reduced for both words and nonwords, but the effect on nonwords would be much greater because the identification score for control nonwords tends to be much lower than that for words. Thus, the net effect would be a reduction in RB for words, and a complete reversal of the RB effect for nonwords, just as was found in Experiment 1.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to determine which participants in Experiment 1 may have been using such a strategy, and to what extent. The results of Experiment 2 make it clear that applying a\nguessing correction based on false reports of repeated items on control trials is not adequate, because participants can glean sufficient information from control trials to avoid making false reports of repetitions. A similar limitation applies to the use of false reports on two-item trials to correct for guessing, as most participants can reliably discriminate two-item from repetition trials.\nWhat is needed is a type of trial in which RB occurs, but in which guessing a repetition is an incorrect response. Recall that a number of experiments have demonstrated RB for words which are similar but not identical (e.g., Bavelier et al., 1994; Harris & Morris, 2000; Kanwisher & Potter, 1990; Morris & Harris, 1999). Trials in which C1 and C2 are orthographic neighbors (e.g., cart and cast, slan and slad) may provide a way of gauging the degree to which participants are guessing repetitions. If participants experience RB on some of these trials, they may guess a repetition; and unlike on trials in which C1 and C2 are identical, such a guess would be counted as incorrect. In addition to providing a means of documenting guessing of repetitions, including the neighbor trials may have the effect of discouraging such guessing because the ability to determine which trials are potential repeated trials is reduced. If the amount of guessing of repetitions is reduced sufficiently, this may in turn allow RB for identical nonwords to be revealed.\nExperiment 3\nIn Experiment 3, trials in which the critical words were orthographic neighbors (e.g., cart and cast, slan and slad) were included in an attempt to decrease guessing of repetitions on repeated trials. If guessing of repetitions does persist, it may be apparent on these trials; a report of cart and cart would be an incorrect response if cart and cast had actually been displayed. Participant\u2019s scores can then be corrected for guessing by subtracting the proportion of spurious repetitions on neighbor trials from the proportion of repetition responses on repeated trials."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Twenty-four Iowa State University undergraduates participated for course credit. All were native speakers of English.\nMaterials. Each item in Experiment 3 appeared in three conditions: repeated, control, and neighbor. To create the neighbor condition, words and nonwords from Experiments 1 and 2 were paired with an orthographic neighbor C1 (e.g., cast was paired with cart). The control condition was created from the repeated condition by substituting an orthographically nonsimilar word or nonword for C1.6 Words or nonwords intervening between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 4 and 12; these words were orthographically dissimilar to C1 and C2. Four versions of the stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed 6 three-word lists in the high-N repeated condition, 6 in the high-N neighbor condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, 6 in the low-N repeated condition, 6 in the low-N neighbor condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition. The same was true for the 3-nonword lists. Thus, the proportion of repeated trials was smaller than in Experiments 1 and 2. Each item appeared in repeated, neighbor, and control conditions, counterbalanced across participants. In addition to these\ntrials, participants also viewed 40 RSVP streams with only 2 words or nonwords (a row of symbols was substituted for the intervening word or nonword). Participants viewed each critical word or nonword only once. In all versions of the stimulus list, word and nonword lists were randomly intermixed.\nProcedure. The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1; again, participants were warned that some of the RSVP lists would contain repeated items, and they were to report these twice. Participants were also warned that \u201csome of the words or nonwords will look similar to each other\u201d and that they should read them carefully."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "The major purpose of Experiment 3 was to discourage guessing of repetitions by adding neighbor trials to the design and by cautioning participants that some of the words and nonwords would look similar to each other. A second purpose was to provide a means of estimating the probability of guessing of repetitions should they still occur. The top half of Table 3 shows the percentage of participants reporting 0, 1, 2, or 3 false repetitions on control, two-item, and neighbor trials for words and nonwords in Experiment 3. Each participant viewed only six word and six nonword neighbor trials, so even one spurious report of a repetition amounted to a significant percentage (16.7%) of those trials. As can be derived from the table, 42% of participants reported a repetition on a neighbor trial at least once on word trials, and 37% reported a repetition at least once on nonword trials. Spurious reports of repetitions on control or two-item trials were rare. Thus, even though Experiment 3 was designed to discourage the use of an informed guessing strategy, many participants appear to have used such a strategy nonetheless.\nCritical pair recall. Figure 5 shows the uncorrected mean percentage of joint recall of critical items for all conditions in Experiment 3. Separate analyses were conducted on repeated and neighbor trials (each in comparison with control trials) to examine RB for repeated and orthographically similar words and nonwords. Turning first to the repeated items, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (repeated vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (66.1% vs. 31.2%), F1(1, 23) 170.47, F2(1, 92) 169.13, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were repeated pairs (55.2% vs. 42.2%), F1(1, 23) 8.89, p .01, F2(1, 92) 25.07, p .001. There was no main effect of neighborhood size (both Fs 1). The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 20.78, F2(1, 92) 26.45, both ps .001; but all other interactions were nonsignificant (all Fs 1). Further analysis of the critical Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for repeated words, F1(1, 23) 17.52 p .001, F2(1, 46) 50.23, both ps .001; but a null effect for repeated nonwords (both Fs 1). It appears that including neighbor trials in the design may have discouraged guessing of repetitions to the extent that the repetition advantage for nonwords was eliminated, but not enough so that RB for repeated nonwords could be shown with the uncorrected scores.\n6 Adding the neighbor condition necessitated altering several of the stimuli from Experiments 1 and 2.\nAlthough guessing of repetitions has the potential to reduce the appearance of RB for the repeated nonwords, it should not mask RB for the orthographically similar nonwords because such guesses would not be counted as correct. Turning to the neighbor trials, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (neighbor vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (65.5% vs. 25.0%), F1(1, 23) 177.29, F2(1, 92) 214.52, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than neighbor pairs (55.2% vs. 35.2%), F1(1, 23) 41.63, F2(1, 92) 58.91, both ps .001. The main effect of neighborhood size was not significant, F1(1, 23) 2.71, p .10, F2(1, 92) 2.06, p .15. The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 7.83, p .05, F2(1, 92) 8.53, p .005; whereas the Condition Neighborhood Size interaction was significant in the\nsubjects analysis, F1(1, 23) 5.91, p .05; but only approached significance in the items analysis, F2(1, 92) 2.88, p .09. The Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction was significant in the subjects analysis, F1(1, 23) 4.49, p .05; but not in the items analysis, F2(1, 92) 1.40, p .20. The Condition Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction was not significant, F1(1, 23) 1.07, p .30, F2(1, 92) 1.33, p .25. Further analysis of the Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for neighbor words, F1(1, 23) 43.22, F2(1, 46) 60.38, both ps .001; as well as a significant RB effect for neighbor nonwords, F1(1, 23) 12.16, F2(1, 46) 10.56, both ps .005.\nIn sum, the uncorrected critical item recall scores from Experiment 3 revealed RB for repeated words, a null effect for repeated nonwords, and RB for neighbor words and nonwords. The finding of RB for neighbor nonwords but not for repeated nonwords is consistent with the notion that the scores for repeated nonwords (and, by extension, repeated words) were inflated by guessing. Furthermore, the pattern of reports of repetitions on neighbor trials shown in Table 3 suggests that the use of an informed guessing strategy may have been widespread in Experiment 3, despite attempts to discourage it.\nCorrected scoring. Would a significant RB effect for repeated nonwords emerge if the scores were corrected for guessing? To investigate this, false reports of repetitions in the neighbor condition were subtracted from the uncorrected score for the repeated condition for each participant (and each item in the item analysis). The results are shown in Figure 6. Planned comparisons revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 29.51, F2(1, 46) 69.18, both ps .001; and an effect of RB for nonwords that approached significance, F1(1, 23) 3.04, F2 (1, 46) 3.10, both ps .09. These data show that when a more appropriate guessing correction is applied, a small amount of repetition blindness for repeated nonwords becomes apparent.\nIntervening item recall. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in the top half of Table 4. Correct report of intervening words was higher\nNote. In Experiment 3, all stimulus items were displayed for 126 ms. In Experiment 4, when the first critical item was a nonword, it was displayed for a longer duration (252 ms) than when it was a word (126 ms).\nthan correct report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 201.12, F2(1, 94) 462.78, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, F1(2, 46) 23.46, F2(2, 188) 22.12, both ps .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant (both Fs 1). Planned comparisons indicated that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate in the context of repeated items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 40.54, F2(1, 94) 63.32, both ps .001; and at a higher rate in the context of neighbor items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 5.73, F2(1, 94) 4.09, both ps .05. Thus, intervening item effects were found for both the repeated and neighbor conditions relative to the control condition. This finding is relevant to the debate concerning the mechanism underlying RB for orthographically similar words. If orthographic RB stems from residual lexical inhibition occurring during the process of recognizing C1, there is no reason to expect an intervening item effect for the neighbor trials. If, on the other hand, orthographic RB stems from the same mechanism as identity RB, one should find an intervening item effect in both cases (although the intervening item effect associated with orthographic RB should be smaller because the representations of C1 and C2 are not identical\u2014thus only a portion of the representation of C2 is sharpened). The results of the intervening item analysis provide support for our contention that the same mechanism underlies both identity and orthographic RB.\nTaken together, the results of Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that the finding of a repetition advantage depends on the widespread use of an informed guessing strategy. Experiment 2 demonstrated that when participants are encouraged to use such a strategy (by drawing their attention to the frequent repetitions in the experiment) a repetition advantage can be obtained for both words and nonwords. Experiment 3 demonstrated that when an informed guessing strategy is made less efficacious, even the repetition advantage for nonwords disappears.\nIt is important to note that the results of Experiment 3 do not reflect only a decrease in guesses of repeated items. If that were the case, the magnitude of the RB effect for repeated words should have been higher in Experiment 3 than that in Experiment 1. Furthermore, there should not have been a difference between the two experiments in the accuracy of report of control items. In contrast, a comparison of the results from Experiment 3 (shown in Figure 5) with those from Experiment 1 (shown in Figure 2)\nsuggests that overall accuracy on both repeated and control trials was considerably higher in Experiment 3. Thus, although the main goal of Experiment 3 was to decrease guessing of repetitions, the result may be more properly characterized as a decrease in reliance on guessing accompanied by an overall increase in attention to the stimuli.\nExperiment 3 further demonstrated that RB can be obtained for neighbor nonwords, whereas RB for repeated nonwords was weak (only approaching significance in our sample of 24 participants). The finding of more RB for neighbor nonwords than for repeated nonwords is puzzling, as more RB is generally found for identical items than for orthographically similar items (e.g., Harris & Morris, 2000). However, it is possible that the amount of guessing of repetitions on repeated trials was underestimated. Recall that the estimate of guessing was based on spurious repetition reports on the neighbor trials, so if a participant is highly accurate on those trials, the amount of guessing that can be measured is constrained. A few participants were indeed highly accurate on their reports of neighbor nonwords, so the estimate of guessing of repetitions based on errors in the neighbor condition could be too low. If RB for repeated nonwords is generally small, it may still be masked by any residual guessing of repetitions not accounted for in the corrected scores.\nHowever, if the size of the RB effect could be increased, it should be possible to demonstrate more reliable RB for repeated nonwords even when all guessing is not accounted for in the corrected scores. As discussed previously, the competition hypothesis predicts that little to no RB will be found when items are poorly encoded (Morris et al., 2007). An estimate of the relative encoding effectiveness of words versus nonwords can be derived from the percentage of correct reports of these items in the control condition. In Experiment 3, report of C1 words was highly accurate (92.5% correct), whereas report of C1 nonwords was less accurate (67.2% correct). If the effectiveness of nonword encoding were somehow increased, the amount of RB for repeated nonwords should also be increased.\nExperiment 4\nIn Experiment 4, type encoding of the C1 nonword was increased by doubling its display duration relative to that used in the previous experiments. Although this manipulation also increased the SOA between the critical nonwords, the increase in RB from improved type encoding was expected to outweigh any diminution of the RB effect stemming from the increased SOA. In addition, whereas the competition hypothesis predicts an increase in RB with increased encoding effectiveness of the C1 nonword, Coltheart and Langdon (2003) would appear to predict the opposite. According to their explanation of the repetition advantage for nonwords, successful report of the first nonword results in priming of the repeated nonword. On their view, therefore, an increase in the ability to correctly report C1 might result in an increase in the repetition advantage for nonwords."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

The bottom half of Table 3 shows the percentage of participants reporting 0, 1, 2, or 3 false repetitions on control, two-item, and neighbor trials for words and nonwords in Experiment 4. As can be derived from the table, 46% of participants reported a repetition on a neighbor trial at least once on word trials, and 41% reported a repetition at least once on nonword trials, a guessing rate that was comparable with that seen in Experiment 3.

Figure 7 shows the uncorrected mean percentage of recall of both critical items for all conditions in Experiment 4. Separate analyses were conducted on repeated and neighbor trials (each in comparison with control trials) to examine RB for repeated and orthographically similar words and nonwords. Turning first to the repeated items, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (repeated vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (54.7% vs. 28.5%), F1(1, 23) 104.57, F2(1, 92) 70.93, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were repeated pairs (49.6% vs.\n33.5%), F1(1, 23) 8.54, p .01, F2(1, 92) 24.09, p .001. There was no main effect of neighborhood size (both Fs 1). The main effect of condition was qualified by a significant Condition Lexicality interaction, F1(1, 23) 26.74, F2(1, 92) 15.68, both ps .001. No other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses. Further analysis of the critical Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 16.22, p .005, F2(1, 46) 33.21, p .001; but a null effect for nonwords (both Fs 1).\nTurning to the neighbor trials, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (neighbor vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (53.0% vs. 24.8%), F1(1, 23) 113.04, F2(1, 92) 99.66, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were neighbor pairs (49.6% vs. 28.1%), F1(1, 23) 43.17, F2(1, 92) 42.42, both ps .001. The main effect of neighborhood size was significant in the subjects analysis, F1(1, 23) 6.30, p .05; but only approached significance in the items analysis, F2(1, 92) 2.90, p .09. The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 20.43, p .001, F2(1, 92) 10.43, p .005; as was the Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 8.10, p .01, F2(1, 92) 5.07, p .05. No other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses. Further analysis of the Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 49.00, F2(1, 46) 36.64, both ps .001; as well as a significant RB effect for nonwords, F1(1, 23) 11.91, p .005, F2(1, 46) 7.65, p .01. In sum, the uncorrected critical pair recall scores from Experiment 4 revealed RB for repeated words, a null effect for repeated nonwords, and RB for neighbor words and nonwords. This is the same pattern found for the uncorrected scores in Experiment 3.\nCorrected scoring. As in Experiment 3, we corrected the critical pair recall scores for guessing by subtracting false reports of repetitions in the neighbor condition from the uncorrected score for the repeated condition for each participant (and each item in the item analysis). The results are shown in Figure 8. Planned comparisons revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 31.54, F2(1, 46) 44.68, both ps .001; and a significant RB effect for nonwords, F1(1, 23) 4.80, F2(1, 46) 4.32, both ps .05. Thus, the corrected scores for Experiment 4 revealed that RB can be demonstrated for repeated nonwords as well as for repeated words.\nIntervening item recall. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in the bottom half of Table 4. Correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 257.76, F2(1, 94) 175.40, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, F1(2, 46) 33.41, F2(2, 188) 22.65, both ps .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant in either analysis. Planned comparisons indicated that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate in the context of repeated items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 76.83, F2(1, 95) 45.30, both ps .001; and at a higher rate in the context of neighbor items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 7.54, F2(1, 95) 5.36, both ps .05."}, {"heading": "Guessing or Misreading?", "text": "We have suggested that the spurious reports of repetitions on neighbor trials indicate the use of an informed guessing strategy. However, some might argue that a false repetition report merely represents misreading of an item as an orthographically similar item, as has been observed to occur in RSVP (e.g., Kanwisher & Potter, 1990). Perhaps the participants reporting high numbers of repeated items in the neighbor condition were simply poorer at reading rapidly presented words and nonwords. To further investigate the source of spurious repetition reports, we divided the participants in Experiments 3 and 4 (combined) into low repetitions (0 repetitions on neighbor trials, n 23) and high repetitions ( 0 repetitions on neighbor trials, n 25) groups; the results are shown in Figure 9. As can be seen in the figure, the high repetitions participants were not less accurate than the low repetitions participants at reporting words and nonwords in the control or neighbor conditions. In fact, the scores for the high repetitions participants were numerically higher than the scores for the low repetitions participants, although these differences did not reach statistical significance for the control condition, F(1, 46) 1.98, p .15; or for the neighbor condition, F(1, 46) 2.27, p .10. However, the two groups did differ significantly in accuracy of report in the repeated condition, with greater accuracy for the high repetitions group, F(1, 46) 24.58, p .001. It is also noteworthy that for the high repetitions group, RB for repeated words (12%) was much smaller than that for neighbor words (29%); as noted previously, RB for repeated words is generally larger than RB for orthographically similar words. Although it is post hoc, this analysis reinforces our contention that spurious reports of repetitions on neighbor trials were largely guesses rather than misreadings of otherwise correctly perceived stimulus items.\nIn sum, increasing the encoding effectiveness of the C1 nonword in Experiment 4 by increasing the exposure duration enabled statistically significant RB to be demonstrated for the repeated nonwords when the scores were corrected for guessing. It is also\nimportant to note that increasing the percentage of correct report of the C1 nonwords did not restore the repetition advantage for nonwords obtained in Experiment 1. Thus, the results of Experiment 4 provide additional evidence in support of our argument that the repetition advantage for nonwords is an artifact of informed guessing strategies rather than a result of successful tokenization of the C1 nonword.\nTaken together, the experiments thus far demonstrate the difficulties in estimating the magnitude of the RB effect for repeated nonwords when guessing of repetitions is prevalent. Guessing of repetitions has also posed problems in correctly estimating the magnitude of RB for repeated words when a similar words-andsymbols paradigm has been used (Harris & Morris, 2001a). One strategy to reduce guessing of repetitions is to refrain from informing participants that many trials will contain repeated items; however, this could result in an overestimation of the RB effect by introducing a response bias. A second strategy is to use longer RSVP lists and vary the serial positions of the repeated items. Although this may be an effective strategy for investigating RB for words, the use of longer lists would likely drive report of nonwords to floor levels, making it impossible to obtain measurable RB.\nUsing non-identical items rather than repeated items in investigations of RB appears to significantly decrease the use of guessing strategies (although it may not eliminate them altogether).7 Harris and Morris (2004) were able to obtain reliable RB for nonidentical nonwords by using a two-word display with intervening symbol masks. However, it is important to establish that RB for non-identical nonwords is replicable across different display formats. Although significant RB for neighbor nonwords in threeitem displays was demonstrated in Experiments 3 and 4, those experiments also included repeated items. Accordingly, Experi-\n7 If rhyming items compose a significant proportion of the stimuli, participants may adopt the strategy of guessing rhyming items (Harris & Morris, 2000).\nment 5 investigated whether RB for neighbor nonwords occurs when no repeated items are present in the experiment.\nExperiment 5\nExperiment 5 examined RB for words and nonwords that are orthographic neighbors (e.g., swim and slim; kerg and kerp); no repeated items were present in the experiment. The use of orthographic neighbors rather than repeated items should make it more difficult for participants to use an informed guessing strategy to overcome RB for words or nonwords. As a significant amount of guessing was not anticipated, we did not increase the exposure duration for the C1 nonword; all words and nonwords were displayed for the same duration (126 ms)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

As in the previous experiments, N and print frequency of C1 were similar across neighbor and control conditions.\nProcedure.

None of the other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses. Further analysis of the Condition Lexicality interaction revealed that the RB effect was significant for words, F1(1, 23) 110.13, F2(1, 46) 179.22, both ps .001; and nonwords, F1(1, 23) 12.63, p .005, F2(1, 46) 18.39, p .001.\nIn contrast to the previous four experiments, participants did not tend to produce spurious repetition reports. Only 1 participant reported a repetition on a neighbor trial, and no repetitions were reported on two-item or control trials. These results support our contention that the repetition reports noted on neighbor trials in Experiments 3 and 4 indicated the use of an informed guessing strategy in those experiments.\nIntervening item recall. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in the top half of Table 5. Correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 402.35, F2(1, 94) 353.23, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, such that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when it appeared in the context of neighbor items, F1(1, 23) 10.19, F2(1, 94) 11.51, both ps .005. The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant (both Fs 1). The significant intervening item effects found in Experiments 3, 4, and 5 for neighbor items compared with control items are predicted by the competition model; when C2 is orthographically similar to C1, C2\u2019s representation will be associated with less activation than will a control C2, and therefore will compete less effectively against adjacent items. The result is a net gain in competitiveness for the item immediately preceding the orthographically similar C2. Note also that the intervening item effect in Experiment 5 cannot be attributed to lexical priming from C1 to C2; in the case of neighbor words, C1 and C2 are not the same lexical item, and in the case of nonwords, neither one is a lexical item.\nIn sum, Experiment 5 revealed that reliable RB can be demonstrated for non-identical nonwords in three-item displays when no repeated items are present in the experiment. RB was obtained for nonwords even though performance on control trials was relatively low (19% correct joint report), and participants were explicitly told to expect similar-looking items. In Experiment 6, we provide a replication of this effect, using a different response format and additional analyses to further examine nonword recall from RSVP displays.\nExperiment 6\nIn each of the experiments described thus far, participants viewed the RSVP stream and immediately reported what they saw to an experimenter, who then keyed in the response. Pilot studies\nindicated that having participants type in their responses rather than report them to the experimenter resulted in an overall decrease in performance, perhaps because this response mode tended to be slower and some of the stimuli were forgotten before they could be typed. However, a typed record of the participants\u2019 responses can be useful in obtaining a better estimate of partial orthographic information obtained from the stimuli. Our claim is that the guessing strategy assumed to be operating in Experiments 1\u20134 was effective (and largely undetectable on control trials in Experiments 1\u20132) because most participants could glean sufficient partial information from a trial to determine whether it was a potential repetition trial or not. The both score, while providing a good estimate of the RB effect, may severely underestimate the amount of partial information available. Accordingly, in Experiment 6 we attempted to replicate the RB effect for neighbor nonwords obtained in Experiment 5, but participants were instructed to type their responses in addition to reporting them to the experimenter."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant (both Fs 1). In sum, Experiment 6 successfully replicated the results of Experiment 5, in that reliable RB was found for neighbor nonwords as well as words, and both types of stimuli showed an intervening item effect. We next report the results of additional analyses designed to further investigate RB for words and nonwords.\nAdditional analyses. To provide a better estimate of the availability of partial orthographic information from three-item RSVP displays, we calculated the percentage of trials on which at least two letters of a word or nonword were reported correctly. For example, suppose the stimulus item bink juff rast was reported as\nbink just raff. With the standard scoring, neither the joint report of critical items nor the report of the intervening item would be scored as correct. With the alternative scoring, however, all three items (C1, C2, and the intervening item) would be scored as correct. Table 6 shows the alternative scoring results from the control condition of Experiment 6. As can be seen in the table, participants were able to report a significant percentage of the letters from the word and nonword displays in the control condition. The implication is that a strategy of guessing repetitions will be effective for many participants because their access to partial orthographic information will be sufficient to avoid spurious reports of repetitions on control trials.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe six experiments reported in this article demonstrate that previous failures to find RB for identical nonwords shown in RSVP streams could be due to participants\u2019 use of \u201cinformed guessing\u201d strategies combined with poor encoding of nonwords. Experiment 1 replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords. In Experiment 2, participants performed a same/different matching task in addition to identifying all the items; this task revealed that participants can reliably discriminate between repeated and control trials, perhaps on the basis of partial orthographic information. Thus, participants who would be likely to guess repetitions on repeated trials would not tend to do so on control trials because they would have gleaned enough partial information from the control trial to rule out a repetition. Indeed, encouraging the use of informed guessing via the same/different task produced a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords.\nIn Experiments 1 and 2, it was not possible to distinguish correctly perceived repetitions from guesses. Accordingly, in Experiments 3 and 4 we included trials containing orthographic neighbor pairs; if participants were using informed guessing to report repetitions, they might report cast and cast following a trial containing the words cast and cart, providing evidence of guessing. Alternatively, including the neighbor trials might be expected to discourage guessing by making it less efficacious. In fact, both goals were achieved; the repetition advantage for nonwords found in Experiments 1 and 2 was eliminated, suggesting that guessing was decreased compared with that in the previous experiments, but a substantial proportion of the participants still reported a repetition on at least one neighbor trial, validating our claim that participants guess repetitions when they are informed that some\ntrials will contain repeated items. In Experiment 4, we improved the encoding effectiveness of the first critical item on nonword trials by increasing its exposure duration. Significant RB was found for repeated words, neighbor words, and neighbor nonwords in both Experiments 3 and 4; significant RB was also found for repeated nonwords in Experiment 4 when scores were corrected for guessing.\nOne additional finding corroborates our contention that the repetition advantage found in Experiments 1 and 2 was the result of informed guessing. In the control condition of Experiments 1 and 2, low-N words were reported more accurately than were high-N words, a finding that is thought to be an indicator of guessing in perceptual identification (Snodgrass & Mintzer, 1993). However, when guessing of repetitions was made less efficacious via the inclusion of neighbor trials (Experiments 3 and 4) both the repetition advantage and the low-N word advantage disappeared. Thus, it appears that participants relied less on guessing of repetitions (and less on guessing in general) in Experiments 3 and 4 than in Experiments 1 and 2.\nFinally, Experiments 5 and 6 demonstrated that RB for orthographic neighbor nonwords could still be obtained when no repeated items were present in the experiment. In addition, in Experiment 6, participants were asked to report the contents of each trial aloud and to type their responses. This additional response format allowed for further investigation of the partial orthographic information available to participants in the control condition. Liberal scoring of these responses (counting an item as correct if at least two letters were reported correctly) showed that although participants had great difficulty reporting nonwords correctly, they did perceive most of the letters from the nonwords. This enabled them to avoid spurious repetition reports.\nThe results of these experiments have several important implications. First and foremost, these experiments show that RB can be obtained for nonwords if appropriate procedures are used to detect and correct for informed guessing of repetitions. Second, the finding of RB for nonwords is consistent with the notion that RB can have sublexical effects (Harris & Morris, 2001b, 2004; Morris & Harris, 1999). Third, these results provide additional support for the claim that orthographic and identity RB stem from the same processes. Recall that some have claimed that identity RB should only be found for lexically identical stimuli (Chialant & Caramazza, 1997; Coltheart & Langdon, 2003) and that other forms of RB must be driven by a different process, such as residual lexical inhibition. Evidence bearing on this claim comes from our analyses of report of the item intervening between C1 and C2. In each of our experiments, we found a benefit for report of the intervening item when it was displayed in the context of identical items or orthographically similar items compared with control items. Coltheart and Langdon (2003) associated this intervening item effect with priming; that is, processing of an identical C2 is facilitated, leaving more resources for processing the intervening item. If, however, orthographic RB represents lexical inhibition (rather than priming) of C2, there should be no processing advantage for the intervening item. Thus, we propose that finding an advantage for the intervening item in identical and orthographically similar trials is further evidence against the lexical inhibition account.\nOur preferred account of RB phenomena is a more parsimonious one. RB, whether for identical or orthographically similar words or nonwords, is driven by sharpening of stimulus representations,\nwhich confers a benefit within the type recognition system but a cost in the competition for awareness when items are rapidly displayed (Morris et al., 2007). The competition hypothesis proposes that the intervening item effect emerges from these competitive interactions, wherein a repeated or orthographically similar C2 is associated with less total activation than is a nonrepeated C2. Because items must compete with adjacent items for access to awareness, a C2 with relatively low activation will be outcompeted by the intervening item or by the following pattern mask more often than will a nonrepeated C2, resulting in RB for C2 and facilitation for the intervening item. Furthermore, the benefit for the intervening item that emerges out of this competitive interaction should be smaller when C1 and C2 are merely orthographically similar than when they are identical, because similar items contain some nonrepeated letters (the lack of identity at phonological and semantic levels may also decrease the size of the intervening item effect).\nThe competition hypothesis also provides a principled explanation for the seemingly sporadic presence of RB for nonwords. According to this account, the potential magnitude of RB is related to the encoding effectiveness of the critical items. For example, when C1 is well encoded, large RB effects are possible; conversely, a poorly encoded C1 will not produce RB (refer to Figure 1 for an illustration). Because nonwords are infrequently encountered, they are more difficult to encode than are words; thus the potential RB one can find for nonwords is smaller than the potential RB for words. Furthermore, poor encoding effectiveness for nonwords means that performance in the control conditions is generally low, meaning that even a small amount of guessing of repetitions will have a much larger effect on RB for nonwords than for words.\nIn addition to the clear implications that our results have for theories of RB, they may also have implications for interpreting results from priming paradigms comparing words and nonwords. Although many researchers have focused on the most obvious difference between words and nonwords\u2014lexicality\u2014this difference may bring with it other, perhaps unanticipated, differences. For example, briefly displayed nonwords are encoded more poorly than words; thus, dissociable performance between words and nonwords on a task might not tell us as much about interactions within the lexicon as it tells us about the effects of differing amounts of noise in initial encoding. We believe this is the case in the comparison of RB for words and nonwords.\nReferences\nAndrews, S. (1997).

The present study addressed this issue by implementing task switching in continuous complex span tasks with strictly controlled time parameters. A series of 4 experiments demonstrate that recall performance decreased as a function of the number of task switches and that the concurrent load of item maintenance had no influence on task switching. These results indicate that task switching induces a cost on working memory functioning. Implications for theories of task switching, working memory, and resource sharing are addressed.\nKeywords: task switching, working memory, resource sharing, complex span tasks\nAn important aspect of cognitive control is our capability to flexibly allocate attention to several activities at the same time and to swiftly reallocate attention from one activity to another in a minimum of time. Although we can think of daily examples reflecting this flexibility (e.g., writing an article and switching attention to a telephone call, Monsell, 2003), performance during task switching is inferior compared with the performance during task repetition. Indeed, task switching is associated with longer latencies and higher error rates, which is known as the task switch cost (Allport, Styles, & Hsieh, 1994; Jersild, 1927; Meiran, 1996; Rogers & Monsell, 1995).\nWhile the effect of task switching on general performance measures has been extensively studied, the impact of task switching on working memory functioning remains underspecified. This is a rather surprising state of affairs because, on the one hand, several accounts of task switching have postulated working memory processes as the main source of the switch cost (e.g., Baddeley, Chincotta, & Adlam, 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003; Rubinstein, Meyer, & Evans, 2001), and on the other hand, switching is supposed to be a key process within working memory functioning (Barrouillet, Bernardin, & Camos, 2004; Cowan, 2005). Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of task switching on working mem-\nory functioning and more precisely the effect of task switching on concurrent maintenance of information within working memory.\nTask Set Reconfiguration and Task Switching\nThe view of working memory functioning as the main source of the switch cost is mainly endorsed by accounts emphasizing the role of control processes in task switching. More specifically, working memory would be involved in the configuration and the maintenance of the different task settings needed to perform an upcoming task (i.e., task set reconfiguration; Rogers & Monsell, 1995). For instance, some authors proposed that only one task set can be present at the same time in working memory and that, in order to switch between two tasks, the relevant task set must be retrieved from long-term memory by means of executive processes and subsequently maintained in working memory (e.g., Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003; Rubinstein et al., 2001), while the irrelevant task set is no longer active (Koch & Philipp, 2005; Schuch & Koch, 2003; Verbruggen, Liefooghe, Szmalec, & Vandierendonck, 2005; Verbruggen, Liefooghe, & Vandierendonck, 2006).\nMore direct evidence demonstrating such involvement of working memory and executive processes in task switching was reported by Baddeley et al. (2001). In a series of experiments based on the list-completion procedure (Jersild, 1927), both a verbal variant of the trials task and random letter generation interfered more with mixed lists with two tasks requiring switching than with the pure lists containing only one task and requiring no switching. As these secondary tasks typically involve executive control processes, these findings demonstrate that the central executive is involved in task switching. It has also been shown that the phonological loop is involved in the retrieval and maintenance of task sets (Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Liefooghe, Vandierendonck, Muyllaert, Verbruggen, & Vanneste, 2005; Miyake, Emerson, Padilla, & Ahn, 2004; Saeki & Saito, 2004a, 2004b) as well as in tracking sequential action plans (Bryck & Mayr, 2005).

First, recent studies challenged the view that working memory is involved in the maintenance of task sets. More specifically, it has been suggested that task elements such as response codes are represented in the activated part of long-term memory rather than in working memory itself (e.g., Kiesel, Wendt, & Peters, 2007; Meiran & Kessler, 2008; Rubin & Meiran, 2005). Second, and more importantly, while accounts calling upon task set reconfiguration are prominent, it is not univocally accepted that such processes are necessary to explain switch costs. It has been demonstrated that switch costs also substantially issue from priming effects, which facilitate task repetition and interfere with task switching. Such priming effects are elicited by associations between tasks, stimuli, and responses (Allport & Wylie, 2000; Waszak, Hommel, & Allport, 2003, 2004, 2005; Wylie & Allport, 2000) or by the repetition of instructional cues indicating the task to be performed (Arrington & Logan, 2004; Logan & Bundesen, 2003, 2004; D. W. Schneider & Logan, 2005). However, although these priming accounts challenge the necessity of task set reconfiguration\u2014and by consequence the involvement of working memory in such reconfiguration\u2014they still recognize a more generic contribution of executive control during task switching (e.g., Allport & Wylie, 1999). On the one hand, it has been argued that switch costs cannot be explained only in terms of task set priming and that they probably arise from the interaction between task set priming and executive control processes (e.g., Gilbert & Shallice, 2002; Yeung & Monsell, 2003). For instance, Yeung and Monsell (2003) suggested that task set priming is influenced by top-down control biases, which ensure that the correct task is executed. On the other hand, D. W. Schneider and Logan (2005) suggested that while executive control may not be required on a trial-to-trial basis during task switching, it is still needed to set the cognitive system in a way that enables performance during task switching without frequent top-down intervention.\nIn sum, switch costs can be explained with and without task set reconfiguration, or even through the combination of both views in the assumption that switch costs consist of several components with each component having a different source (e.g., Meiran, Chorev, & Sapir, 2000; Monsell, 2003). Moreover, as we have seen, working memory related processes can play a role in these different views, albeit in a varying degree of importance. The question is thus not whether working memory is involved in task switching or not, but to what extent working memory is involved in task switching.\nTask Switching and Working Memory\nLogan (2004) addressed this issue by testing the hypothesis that working memory and task switching share a single common set of resources. To that end, the task span procedure was used (Logan, 2004, 2006, 2007; D. W. Schneider & Logan, 2006). This procedure consists of two parts. In a first step, the study phase, participants have to memorize a series of task names such as Hi\u2013Low (indicating a magnitude judgment, is the number greater than or\nless than 5?), Odd\u2013Even (indicating a parity judgment, is the number odd or even?), or Digit\u2013Word (indicating a form judgment, is the number a digit or a word?). In the second step, the test phase, a list of targets (a series of digits) is presented. This digit series is of the same length as the corresponding series of task names presented in the study phase. Logan (2004) compared three conditions. In the perform condition, for each digit in the target list, the corresponding task had to be performed by retrieving the task name from the memorized list and applying it to the presented digit. On the basis of this performance, the task span (i.e., the maximum number of correctly remembered and executed tasks) was calculated. In the recall condition, participants recalled the names of the corresponding tasks without applying them to the target stimulus (memory span for task names). In the control condition, participants performed the same task throughout the list of targets in the absence of a memory load. The primary finding of this research is that task spans and memory spans were equal. Importantly, conditions in which task names required task switching after every target stimulus (e.g., Hi\u2013Low, Odd\u2013Even, Hi\u2013Low, Odd\u2013Even, Hi\u2013Low, Odd\u2013Even) and conditions requiring only one task switch (i.e., Hi\u2013Low, Hi\u2013Low, Hi\u2013Low, Odd\u2013Even, Odd\u2013 Even, Odd\u2013Even) yielded the same span. The latter results clearly suggest that task switching, operationalized as the number of task switches made, has no impact on working memory functioning, and Logan (2004) suggested that task switching and working memory maintenance do not share a single set of resources.\nMore recently, Kane, Conway, Hambrick, and Engle (2007) have reported several studies in which they investigated the connection between working memory capacity and switch costs. Although their \u201cexecutive attention\u201d theory of working memory capacity predicts such a connection (Engle, Kane, & Tuholski, 1999), they failed in four successive experiments to find any significant difference in switch costs between high- and low-span participants. The authors explained this unexpected result by suggesting that task set switching may not be the executive measure it is widely assumed to be, and they endorsed the aforementioned accounts, which claim that switch costs result from priming effects rather than from task set reconfiguration (e.g., Allport & Wylie, 2000; Logan & Bundesen, 2003). Thus, working memory capacity would not have any impact on switch cost because most task switching paradigms do not tap volitional, executive control processes.\nThese findings are corroborated by many correlational studies. Some of these studies reported a clear relation between task switching and working memory. Lehto (1996) reported fairly high correlations between performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Berg, 1948)\u2014often assumed to be a test of switching between task settings\u2014and performance on complex span tasks such as the reading span task (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) and the operation span task (Turner & Engle, 1989). However, Miyake et al. (2000) observed that the latent variable underpinning different measures of task switching was not related to the latent variable underlying the performance on complex span tasks. Additionally, Friedman et al. (2006) found no significant relation between task switching and measures of fluid intelligence, whereas there are well-known relations between fluid intelligence and working memory (Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999). Thus, most of the correlational studies equally suggest an independence between task switching and working memory.\nDual-Task Paradigms and Time Control\nThe above section offers a rather pessimistic perspective with respect to the possible impact of task switching on working memory functioning. However, such a conclusion is highly surprising. Of course, it could be assumed that task switching does not interfere with storage, either because task switching does not call upon working memory resources in a sufficient way (Kane et al., 2007) or because task switching and storage tax different resources (Logan, 2004). This latter view implies (a) the rejection of unitary conceptions of working memory that assume a unique resource shared between processing and storage, and (b) the adoption of a multicomponent view in which processing and storage rely on separate resources and supplies. However, the process of switching is an essential property of executive functioning (Collette & Van der Linden, 2002; Miyake et al., 2000), being referred to as the \u201cgold-standard measure of executive control\u201d (Kane et al., 2007, p. 35). It is thus difficult to imagine that switching could occur without central executive involvement. As a consequence, even within the multicomponent view of working memory, task switching should at least interfere with those working memory activities implicating the central executive. For example, the processes underpinning the completion of complex span tasks (performing a secondary task while maintaining items to be recalled) are known to involve the central executive, and the ensuing spans\u2014like reading, counting, or operation spans\u2014are usually considered as central executive measures. It can be noted that the task span procedure is akin to a complex span task (maintaining a list of tasks while performing them), and it is thus puzzling that the results issuing from this procedure did not indicate any effect of switching on performance.\nOne reason for this finding could reside in the procedure used. The clearest evidence for a direct relation between working memory and switching relies upon studies using selective interference procedures (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Liefooghe et al., 2005). A common feature of such studies is the demand to perform primary and secondary tasks at virtually the same time. For instance, when Baddeley et al. (2001) combined task switching with a letter span, the participants had to encode one letter every second. In Emerson and Miyake (2003), participants had to make articulations every 500 or 750 ms. These constraints may create a tight temporal window in which the primary and the secondary tasks are forced to compete with each other, necessitating control and coordination by the central executive. Alternatively, if there are no strong temporal constraints, participants can engage in each step at their own pace and there is less need for competition because there is more time to delay some aspects of one task in order to process another task.\nThe importance of temporal constraints in examining the coordination of the processing and the maintenance of information has recently been stressed by Barrouillet and colleagues, who created computer-paced continuous span tasks in which time parameters are carefully controlled (Barrouillet et al., 2004; Le\u0301pine, Bernardin, & Barrouillet, 2005). This procedure revealed that even fairly simple tasks performed under temporal constraints could have a highly disruptive effect on concurrent maintenance (Le\u0301pine et al., 2005).\nBarrouillet et al. (2004) accounted for these phenomena by proposing the time-based resource-sharing model, which suggests\na unitary view of working memory. This model assumes that both processing and maintenance of information within working memory require attention, a limited resource that must be shared. Those items of knowledge that are inside the focus of attention receive activation, but when attention is switched away, their activation suffers from a time-related decay. These memory traces can be refreshed through a covert retrieval process that requires attention (Cowan, 1995; Cowan et al., 1994). However, following Pashler (1998), it is assumed that there is a central bottleneck that constrains central processes and that attention can be allocated to only one thing at a time (Garavan, 1998; Oberauer, 2003). As a consequence, attention must be switched away from processing to refresh the decaying memory traces of the information to be maintained. Barrouillet et al. assume that this attentional switching occurs throughout processing, attention being frequently diverted for short pauses during which other items can be focused upon and memory traces refreshed. In other words, there is a time-based resource sharing through a frequent and rapid switching of attention from processing to storage. In this account, any activity that occupies attention would have a detrimental effect on storage because it impedes, at least for short periods of time, the refreshment of the decaying memory traces. More precisely, if we define the cognitive cost of a given activity as the detrimental effect it has on other activities to be concurrently performed, cognitive cost corresponds to the proportion of time during which this activity occupies attention and impedes other activities. By comparing continuous span tasks, which involve different processing tasks presented at the same computer-controlled rate, we can investigate the detrimental effect that cognitive processes have on working memory storage (Barrouillet et al., 2004; Barrouillet, Bernardin, Portrat, Vergauwe, & Camos, 2007; Gavens & Barrouillet, 2004; Le\u0301pine et al., 2005). The differences in recall performance offer a measure of the cognitive cost that investigated processes place on working memory. Thus, the present study took advantage of the continuous span task procedure to assess the cognitive cost of task switching.\nThe Present Study\nIn the present article, we report on a series of four experiments in which the relationship between task switching and working memory was investigated. More precisely, the cognitive load of task switching was examined by incorporating task switching in a continuous span task. In each experiment, participants were presented with time-constrained tasks in which they had to switch between two digit judgments while remembering letters. The question was raised whether the number of switches impaired the concurrent maintenance of items. In Experiment 1, we compared recall performance from continuous span tasks in which participants had either to apply the same task to each target (e.g., either a magnitude or a parity judgment) or to systematically alternate between the two tasks. Experiment 2 evaluated more precisely the effect of task switching. Participants had to switch between the two tasks in both conditions, but one condition involved only a few task switches whereas the other condition involved a lot of task switches. In Experiment 3, the results of Experiment 2 were generalized to a preload procedure (Sternberg, 1967). Finally, Experiment 4 tested the hypothesis that the effect of task switching on storage is commensurate with the time during which task\nswitching occupies attention. For this purpose, we compared the effect of task switching on storage to the effect of stimulus degradation, which is equally attention demanding but independent of task switching (e.g., Rubinstein et al., 2001).\nAs we have seen, many accounts evoked above do not predict any effect of task switching on maintenance. By contrast, following the unitary conception of working memory and the time-based resource-sharing model, we expected a clear impairment of task switching on working memory storage. Because task switching requires attention that is no longer available for refreshing decaying memory traces, the extra time of attentional occupation it induces would thus impair the maintenance of the to-be-recalled items. As a consequence, in all experiments, we predicted that recall would be poorer when more task switches were required.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 was based on the list-completion procedure (e.g., Allport et al., 1994; Jersild, 1927). In this procedure three types of lists are presented: (a) a pure list containing only Task A, (b) a pure list containing only Task B, and (c) a mixed list in which participants have to alternate between Task A and Task B. The switch cost is computed as the difference between the mean latencies (and error rates) of both pure lists and the mixed list. Although this method has proven to be useful in many investigations of task switching (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Saeki & Saito, 2004a, 2004b), it is important to note that the cost observed in this situation does reflect a broad range of demands and processes that are not all specific to task switching. For this reason, it is more appropriate to refer to this cost as a global switching cost (e.g., Kray & Lindenberger, 2000; Mayr, 2001). An advantage of this method is that the difference between pure and mixed lists is large and robust. In view of the present purpose, namely finding evidence for an effect of task switching on working memory storage, it seems appropriate to start with such a large effect. If no difference is observed under these conditions, the search for a cognitive cost associated with more fine grained measures of task switching is futile.\nThe present experiment compared recall performance in continuous span tasks including either pure lists or mixed lists of tasks. Participants were presented with a number of consonants to be remembered. After each consonant, they were presented with a series of digits to be processed according to the list completion paradigm. Pure lists involved either parity or magnitude judgments, whereas mixed lists required participants to alternate between parity and magnitude judgments of the digits. We predicted poorer recall in the mixed list than in the pure list conditions."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Nineteen first-year psychology students at Ghent University participated for course requirements and credit. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were righthanded, and were na\u0131\u0308ve to the purpose of the experiment.\nTasks and material. A continuous span task designed by Barrouillet et al. (2004) was used. During a continuous span task, two constituent tasks need to be coordinated. Participants were presented with series of three to six consonants to be remembered. Consonants in each series were drawn from 13 groups with low\nintergroup confusability based on their Dutch pronunciation (Vandierendonck, De Vooght, & Van der Goten, 1998). These groups were: (B, D, P, T), (C), (F, S), (G), (H, K), (J), (L), (M, N), (Q), (R), (V, W), (X), (Z). After each consonant, a series of eight digits (from 1 to 9, without 5) colored in either red or blue was sequentially displayed on screen. These series were randomly generated with the restriction that immediate stimulus repetition was avoided. When the digit was red, the participants had to decide whether it was larger or smaller than 5, by pressing a right or a left key, respectively. If it was blue, participants judged its parity by pressing the right or the left key for even and odd numbers, respectively. Previous research has shown that these response mappings are consistent with the mental representations of numbers in long-term memory, thus avoiding spurious compatibility effects (Dehaene, Bossini, & Giraux, 1993; Nuerk, Iversen, & Willmes, 2004). For both judgments the right hand had to be used.\nThree types of digit lists were created: (a) 8 lists containing only parity judgments; (b) 8 lists containing only magnitude comparisons, and (c) 16 mixed lists in which the participants had to alternate between the parity and the magnitude tasks. In this way, for each length of the letter sequence (three, four, five, or six consonants), 4 simple and 4 mixed lists were presented. This resulted in a total of 32 lists to be performed.\nProcedure. The participants were tested in groups of two by means of Pentium III personal computers with 17-inch color monitors running the Tscope experimentation software (Stevens, Lammertyn, Verbruggen, & Vandierendonck, 2006). The instructions were presented on-screen and paraphrased if necessary. A practice session of three blocks preceded the experimental sessions. In the first practice block, one letter series of each length was presented, and participants had to memorize the consonants without processing the digits presented after each consonant. In the second block, participants processed the digits without memorizing the consonants, whereas in the last block, both letter memorization and digit processing had to be performed.\nAfter these three practice blocks, the experiment proper started. The letter\u2013digit lists were presented in a random order. The course of events for each list was as follows: First, the length and the type of the list were announced in the middle of the screen (e.g., \u201c4 consonants\u2014magnitude task\u201d). Second, a consonant was presented for 1,500 ms, followed by a 300-ms blank. Next, a digit appeared for 900 ms followed by a 300-ms blank. When the eight digits were presented, the next consonant appeared, and so on. The time course of these events was fixed. Even when participants did not respond to the digits, the sequence continued. At the end of a list, participants had to recall the consonants in the correct order by typing the letters on the keyboard with their left hand. The recalled consonants were presented on a display on-screen. Whenever the participants had forgotten an item, they pressed the spacebar and a question mark appeared instead of a letter. The experiment lasted about 1 hr."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The specific impact of task switching on working memory maintenance was investigated by considering the recall performance, the quality of digit processing, and the size of the switch cost as a function of the different lists\u2019 lengths. These latter analyses focused on the last series of digits in each series of letters\nbecause it is only there that the memory load equated the length of the series of letters.\nRecall performance. We first computed the average span for the pure and the mixed lists by summing the number of correctly recalled consonants for both types of lists across all list lengths (Friedman & Miyake, 2005). The average span was higher for the pure lists (63.68 out of 72) compared with that for the mixed lists (58.32), F(1, 18) 5.07, p .05. Next, the quality of recall was considered for each list length. First, the absolute recall performance was computed. For each series the proportion of recalled consonants in absolute correct order was calculated. For instance, when presented P, Q, R, D and recalling P, Q, R, D, the score was 4 out of 4 and the recall proportion was 1. However, when P, D, Q, R was recalled, the score was 1 out of 4 (proportion .25) because only the first consonant matched its presentation position. Because this is a very strict measure of recall, we also considered relative recall quality. Following a method used by Vandierendonck, Kemps, Fastame, and Szmalec (2004) and Szmalec, Vandierendonck, and Kemps (2005), Kendall\u2019s tau rank correlation between the presented series and the recalled series was weighted with the recall performance without consideration of the correctness of the ranking.1 Both measures were separately subjected to a 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by 4 (list length) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Absolute recall was poorer for mixed lists (.82) compared with pure lists (.90), F(1, 18) 7.57, p .05, and decreased as a function of list length (.89, .92, .86, and .77), F(3, 16) 10.59, p .001 (see Table 1). These effects did not interact, F(3, 16) 1.31, p .31. The relative recall performance mirrored these findings. The relative recall was lower for the mixed lists (.88) compared with the pure lists (.92), F(1, 18) 8.88, p .01, and recall performance decreased as a function of the increasing list length (.90, .94, .89, and .87), F(3, 16) 11.75, p .001. No interaction was observed, F 1.\nDigit processing. Performance on the numerical judgment tasks can be analyzed in terms of latency and accuracy. First, we studied the average amount of time participants focused on the processing of the digits in each list. For each list, the total time spent on average on the processing of the digits between the presentation of two consecutive consonants was calculated irrespective of whether the digits\u2019 judgments were correct or not. These digit processing times were then averaged according to the type and the length of the lists. A 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by 4 (list length) MANOVA was conducted on these mean processing\ntimes (see Table 2). The digit processing times were larger (5,966 ms) for the mixed lists than for the pure lists (4,667 ms), F(1, 18) 77.91, p .001, and did not increase with list length, either for the pure list, F 1, or for the mixed list, F(1, 18) 2.08, p .17.\nThe average number of errors produced while processing the eight digits between two consecutive consonants was also subjected to a 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by 4 (list length) MANOVA (see Table 2). The mean number of errors was larger for the mixed lists (1.92) compared with the pure lists (.88), F(1, 18) 55.31, p .001, and increased with the list length (1.28, 1.37, 1.39, and 1.57), F(3, 16) 3.49, p .05. These effects did not interact, F 1.\nMemory load by task switching. In the next step, we focused on the possible influence of working memory load on task switching performance by conducting a 2 (pure list vs. mixed list) by 4 (list length) MANOVA on the average latencies of the last sequence of digits for each list length. For this analysis, trials that were incorrect, trials immediately following incorrect trials, and trials including latencies smaller than 100 ms or larger than 1,200 ms (overlapping with the next digit) were discarded from the data analyses. Also, trials following trials with latencies larger than 1,200 ms (overlaps from previous responses) were discarded. A total of 16% of the trials were removed, and the remaining latencies were free of spurious effects and provided a more pure indication of task switching performance (see Table 3). The latencies were longer for the mixed lists (708 ms) than for the pure lists (567 ms), F(1, 18) 62.86, p .001, resulting in a mixed list cost of 141 ms. The latencies also increased as a function of list length (626 ms, 629 ms, 645 ms, and 650 ms), F(3, 16) 3.58, p .05. These effects interacted, F(3, 16) 5.04, p .05. However, this interaction did not result in an increase but in a decrease of the mixed list cost with the number of letters to be maintained. This was due to the fact that only the latencies within the pure lists increased as a function of list length, F(1, 18) 29.24, p .001, whereas there was no significant effect on the latencies within the mixed lists, F 1 (see Figure 1).\nThe error rates of the last sequence of each list were also subjected to a 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by 4 (list length) MANOVA (see Table 3). The error rates were higher for the mixed lists (.18) than for the pure lists (.08), F(1, 18) 37.94, p .001,\n1 Kendall\u2019s tau is a measure of ranked correlation that measures the level of disarray for a pair of samples. The value of Kendall\u2019s tau lies between 1 (complete concordance between both samples) and \u20131 (complete disagreement). In the present study, Kendall\u2019s tau was used to calculate ranking correctness by comparing the order of the presented consonants with the order of recalled consonants. This calculation is based on the position of a consonant relative to the other consonants in the string, so it captures more of the data than an absolute determination of correct position. To avoid attenuated ranges, we subjected this rank correlation to an arcsine transformation and linearly rescaled this outcome in order to obtain an index between 0 and 1. Hence, negative values were avoided. This was of importance when multiplying this transformed tau with the free recall performance. For example, when presented P, Q, R, D and recalling P, R, Q, D, the relative recall is .73, while the absolute recall is .50. Although only the first and the last consonant matched their presentation order, relatively seen, only the R was recalled incorrectly compared with the Q.\nand they increased as function of list length (.11, .12, .12, and .16), F(3, 16) 8.21, p .001. The two factors did not interact, F 1.2"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of Experiment 1 were twofold. First, recall performance was significantly poorer for mixed lists than for pure lists. The presence of task switches thus impaired working memory maintenance. The analyses clearly indicated that participants were engaged in processing digits for a larger amount of time with mixed lists than with pure lists. Hence, the cognitive load induced by mixed-list processing was higher than the average cognitive load due to pure lists, and this resulted in a more detrimental effect on the maintenance of letter series in mixed lists.\nWe also observed an influence of the concurrent memory load on pure lists but not on mixed lists, resulting in a decrease of the global switching cost under memory load. It is possible that due to different attentional demands, mixed and pure lists were affected in a different way by the concurrent load. Because pure lists involved a single task and hence simpler processing activities, it is possible that participants were more prone to postpone the treatment of the digits while refreshing the memory traces of the letters in the pure lists than in the more complex mixed lists, in which they prioritized digit processing rather than refreshment. This kind of a strategy-related effect has already been observed in dual tasks (Camos & Barrouillet, 2004). Such a discrepancy would account for the fact that reaction times increased with memory load in pure lists but remained unchanged in mixed lists. Experiment 2 further examined this issue.\nTaken together, the results of Experiment 1 showed a neat relation between task switching and working memory by demonstrating that task switching impedes the maintenance of consonants in working memory. In the next experiment, we wanted to replicate this finding by using a more fine grained operationalization. To this end, the number of switches was varied parametrically, ranging from lists with a few switches to lists with many switches, and the task switches were made less predictable.\nExperiment 2\nIn contrast to Experiment 1, Experiment 2 used a task-cueing procedure in which participants alternate between two or more\nchoice reaction tasks according to a pattern that is unpredictable and controlled by cues (Meiran, 1996). The switch cost is defined as the difference between trials that repeat the same task as the previous trial, and trials that involve a different task from the previous trial. This methodology offers some advantages compared with the list-completion procedure. Previous research argued that the difference between pure and mixed lists does not only concern the systematic switching between two tasks, but also the maintenance of two task sets as compared with only one task set in pure lists (Rogers & Monsell, 1995), higher demands on interference control (Rubin & Meiran, 2005), and the tracking of task sequences (Bryck & Mayr, 2005). In contrast, the task-cueing procedure constitutes a different situation, since task repetitions and task switches are both performed within the context of a mixed list. Hence, as both task sets are present throughout a mixed list, the situation is more similar for repetition and switch trials. This difference in methodology could be crucial for the present research question. The difference in recall performance we observed in Experiment 1 could reflect different working memory demands of pure and mixed lists that are independent of the processes underlying task switching per se. For example, the need to keep an additional task set active in a mixed list could have disrupted the maintenance of consonants and produced poorer recall.\nIn Experiment 2, we compared recall performance on two continuous span tasks that differed only in the number of switches involved by their processing component. Both conditions contained the same series of digits, the order of which was manipu-\n2 In order to further investigate the influence of a concurrent memory load on task switching, we conducted an additional analysis in which the digit-processing task was divided into two blocks by grouping the first four and the last four trials. Switch costs in both blocks were then compared. The underlying idea was that switch costs may increase as a function of the number of concurrent consonants in only the first block and not in the second block. The reason for this is that participants would rehearse the concurrent items only when processing the first digits but not afterward. However, the interaction between list lengths, list type, and block was not significant for either the latencies, F 1, or the error rates, F 1. The absence of such interactions thus suggests that the influence of the consonants on digit processing was similar for the beginning and the end of the last processing phase.\nlated to create high- and low-switch lists in the same way as in Logan (2004; Experiment 4). If the difference in recall performance observed in Experiment 1 was only due to the maintenance of an additional task set in the mixed lists, no difference in recall performance should appear in the present experiment. By contrast, our hypothesis was that it is task switching performance that involves a cognitive cost and not the presence of an additional task set. Thus, we predicted that recall performance would be more impaired for high-switch lists compared with the low-switch lists. Second, we further investigated the influence of concurrent loads on the switch cost. If the previous results are due to the nature of the mixed lists and their induction of a higher priority for processing, the decrease in switch costs that we observed in Experiment 1 should not be replicated, because mixed lists were presented in both conditions of Experiment 2."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

The distribution of the switches along a sequence of digits was random in both types of lists, with the restriction that the occurrence of both tasks was in balance within each list.

First, recall performance was poorer for high-switch lists than for low-switch lists. Because both list types involved the same tasks and differed only in the\nnumber of task switches imposed by the task order, it can be concluded that task switching itself involves a cognitive load that leads to an impaired maintenance. The fact that the effect on recall was rather small compared with that in Experiment 1 suggests that in the previous experiment the impairment of working memory maintenance by task switching was overestimated due to the use of list completion. It should also be remembered that based on the time-based resource-sharing model, it is assumed that task switching impairs working memory maintenance because task switching occupies attention. As a consequence, the effect of this attentional occupation on maintenance cannot go beyond, and should be commensurate with, the extra time resulting from the increase in the number of switches, which was about 190 ms within a postletter interval. Thus, a large disruptive effect on recall could not be expected from so subtle a variation in attentional demand. Nonetheless, this variation proved to be sufficient to significantly impair the maintenance of the letters and impair their recall.\nIn line with the interpretation of Camos and Barrouillet (2004), switch costs remained unaffected by the concurrent memory load. Whatever the number of letters to be maintained, the switch cost remained essentially constant. This result suggests that the decrease in mixing cost associated with the increase in the number of letters to be maintained that was observed in Experiment 1 was probably due to the fact that the two conditions under comparison involved different list types, which in turn induced different strategies in our participants. The lack of effect of the concurrent memory load on the switch cost is at odds with previous studies, where it was observed that concurrent articulatory suppression affected the size of the switch cost (e.g., Liefooghe et al., 2005; Miyake et al., 2004). As a possible interpretation, this lack of effect of verbal load on task switching could be attributed to an insufficiently strong manipulation of the size of the verbal load. For example, it could be that the number of items to be concur-\n3 As in Experiment 1, an additional analysis was conducted in order to find out whether the observed load effects were similar for the beginning and the end of the last processing phase.

Moreover, it has been suggested that in a complex span task the load that is induced by the maintenance of items could be undermined by using strategies involving long-term memory storage (e.g., Saito & Miyake, 2004). In view of these possibilities, Experiment 3 employed a paradigm in which participants had to maintain a memory preload while processing a series of only eight digits and recall the preload immediately afterward. This way, the amount of time between the presentation of the preload and the recall of the preload was drastically reduced, thus minimizing the possible involvement of strategies based on long-term memory storage. At the same time, it was possible to increase the number of consonants to be maintained up to eight.\nExperiment 3\nAs in the previous experiment, we contrasted the recall performance on high- and low-switch lists, but we used preloading instead of a continuous span task design. First, participants were presented with a sequence of consonants immediately followed by a series of eight digits to be processed at a pace fixed by the computer. After processing this series, participants recalled the consonants in the correct serial order. With the aim of increasing the maintenance demands on working memory, six list lengths ranging from three to eight consonants were presented. The prediction was the same as in the previous experiments. We expected poorer recall performance for high-switch lists than for low-switch lists.

Recall performance on the high-switch lists was poorer than on the low-switch lists, and memory load did not affect the switch cost. These results offer a nice generalization of the relation between task switching and working memory maintenance that we observed in the previous experiment. In the present experiment, the delay between encoding and recall was less than 10 s, and only one series of digits had to be processed. As already mentioned, the concurrent load did not affect task switching performance. Even when the storage demands on working memory were increased to eight letters, the difference between task switching and task repetition remained unchanged. Contrary to the results of Experiment 2, there was no effect of list length on error rates. This rules out any possibility that an increase of the switch cost could be concealed by a speed\u2013accuracy trade-off. Exactly as in Experiment 2, when sufficient time pressure is induced, the frequency of switches had a detrimental effect on the maintenance of consonants, but the concurrent load did not influence the processing of the digits.\nIn a series of three experiments taken together, we have demonstrated that task switching clearly impairs working memory maintenance. According to the time-based resource-sharing model, the effect on concurrent maintenance of a given activity is proportionate to the time during which this activity occupies attention (Barrouillet et al., 2007). Experiment 4 was designed to verify this assumption concerning the effect of task switching on working memory.\nExperiment 4\nIn this final experiment, the cause of the effects observed in the previous experiments was further investigated. As mentioned in\nthe introduction, the time-based resource-sharing model assumes that the impairment that task switching has on the maintenance of information in working memory is determined by the amount of time it occupies attention. In other words, this impairment is not inherent to task switching but rather follows from general timeconsuming attentional demands. Experiment 4 tested this assumption. To this end, a variant of Experiment 3 was conducted in which not only the number of switches was manipulated but also the degradation of the stimuli to which the digit-processing tasks were applied. Stimulus degradation is known to put special demands on cognitive control, possibly through additional monitoring and adaptation mechanisms (e.g., Barch et al., 1997; Kok, 1986; Yeung & Cohen, 2006). Additionally, Rubinstein et al. (2001) demonstrated that stimulus degradation, which is especially of importance to stimulus identification processes, did not affect the size of the switch cost. If the main cause of the impairment of working memory maintenance due to task switching is the amount of time attention is occupied, then a stimulus degradation occupying attention for a similar amount of time should impair working memory maintenance to the same extent as task switching and lead to comparable recall performance."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

Absolute recall was larger for the low-switch lists with normal digits (.77) than for the remaining two lists, F(1, 24) 8.79, p .01, while the latter two lists yielded an equal recall score (.72 and .73, respectively), F 1. Recall performance decreased with list length (.91, .73, and .57), F(2, 23) 68.91, p .001. The interaction between both effects was not significant, F 1. Relative recall performance was also larger for the lists with low-switch and normal digits (.84) than for the other lists (.80 and .81, respectively), F(1, 24) 5.93, p .05, and the latter lists again yielded similar recall scores, F(1, 24) 1.31, p .24. Furthermore, the relative recall decreased as a function of list length (.93, .81, and .73), F(2, 23) 56.38, p .001. These effects did not interact, F 1.\nError rates in digit processing.

Fewer errors were made for the low-switch lists with normal digits (1.61 errors out of 8 digits) than for either other list, F(1, 24) 14.67, p .001. The high-switch lists with normal digits (1.93) and the low-switch lists with degraded stimuli showed a similar number of errors (1.91), F 1. The number of errors remained unaffected by list length, F(2, 23) 1.80, p .19, and no interaction was observed, F(4, 21) 2.19, p .11.\nMemory load by task switching. The exclusion criteria of the previous experiments were used, and 19% of the trials were removed. A 3 (list type) by 3 (list length) by 2 (task repetition vs. task switching) MANOVA was performed (see Table 12). The latencies were shorter for the low-switch lists with normal digits (685 ms) than for the high-switch list with normal stimuli (706 ms), F(1, 24) 6.15, p .05, and the latencies on this latter list were shorter than on the low-switch list with degraded stimuli (750 ms), F(1, 24) 36.49, p .001. List length did not affect the latencies, F(2, 23) 1.03, p .37, and task repetition was faster than task switching (676 ms and 751 ms, respectively, with a switch cost of 75 ms), F(1, 24) 202.92, p .001. The interaction between list type and task switching, and the interaction between list length and task switching, were not significant, Fs 1 (see Figure 5). The error rates indicated that low-switch lists with normal digits were associated with fewer errors (.18) than with the other lists, F(1, 24) 6.38, p .001, while the other lists did not differ significantly (.20 and .22, respectively), F(1, 24) 2.27, p .14. The error rates did not increase as a function of list length, F(2, 23) 1.33, p .28, and fewer errors were made on repetition trials (.17) than on switch trials (.24), F(1, 24) 31.58, p .001. Finally, the switch cost was not affected by list type or by list length, Fs 1.5"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In line with the time-based resource-sharing model, the degree of recall impairment was of a similar size for both low-switch lists with degraded stimuli and high-switch lists with normal stimuli, as was the extent to which the processing time was increased. These results confirm the prediction that the key factor underlying the impairment of working memory maintenance by a cognitive activity is the amount of time this cognitive activity occupies attention (Barrouillet et al., 2004, 2007).\nThis interpretation could be challenged in the light of many studies using the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm in which participants are asked to respond to two successive targets at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. In this paradigm, it seems that stimulus degradation affects processing stages prior to attention, the early processing steps that are slowed down by degradation being carried out in parallel with other resourcedemanding processes such as response selection. Indeed, it has been shown that increasing the difficulty of processing of the second target by stimulus degradation results in an underadditive interaction between the manipulated factor and the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) as SOA is decreased. This underadditive interaction suggests that the early stages of processing of the second target have been carried out in parallel with central-attentiondemanding stages of the first task (Pashler, 1984; Pashler & Badgio, 1985). As a consequence, stimulus degradation in our experiment could not be considered as involving attentiondemanding processes that could impair the concurrent refreshment of memory traces.\nHowever, it is worth noting that these phenomena seem to be confined to the PRP paradigm. Interestingly, the underadditivity of the interaction disappears when stimulus degradation is used in a task-switching paradigm. Oriet and Jolicoeur (2003), using an alternating runs paradigm in which participants judged digits for parity and magnitude as in our experiments, observed that the effect of stimulus degradation did not differ as a function of whether participants switched or repeated tasks. From the additive effects of task switching and degradation, the authors concluded that task switching may impose a hard bottleneck even for early stimulus processing. Now, it is important to note that in our continuous span procedure, participants must not only switch back and forth between parity and magnitude judgments but also from maintenance activities to digit processing at stimulus onset. What is demonstrated by Oriet and Jolicoeur (2003) is that early processing of digits waits until task set reconfiguration or whatever operation responsible for the task switch cost is completed. Thus, it can be assumed that stimulus degradation within our paradigm induced a prolonged occupation of attention that resulted in the predicted impairment of maintenance and recall.\nGeneral Discussion\nAlthough a close relationship between task switching and working memory has often been postulated (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003; Rubinstein et al., 2001), there was a lack of direct evidence supporting this relationship (e.g., Friedman et al., 2006; Miyake et al., 2000) and a lack of evidence indicating that task switching places additional demands on working memory (e.g., Kane et al., 2007; Logan, 2004; see also Hogan, Kelly, & Craik, 2006). The present study was designed to clarify this issue by investigating the impairment of working memory functioning due to task switching within\n5 As in the previous experiments, the additional analysis was conducted to test whether the observed load effects were similar for the beginning and the end of the processing phase. The interaction between list lengths, trial type, and block, however, failed to be significant for either the latencies, F 1, or the error rates, F 1.\ncomputer-paced continuous span tasks issuing from the time-based resource-sharing model (Barrouillet et al., 2004). All four experiments indicated that task switching impaired working memory maintenance, whereas the size of the switch cost remained unaffected by the number of consonants to be maintained. In the following sections, we first address the implications of the relationship between task switching and working memory maintenance for different accounts of task switching. Next, we discuss how different accounts of task switching and different conceptions of working memory architecture and resource sharing can account for the absence of an influence of working memory load on the size of the switch cost."}, {"heading": "Task Switching and Working Memory Maintenance", "text": "The present results suggest that task switching calls upon working memory functioning to a strong enough extent to impair the concurrent maintenance of items in working memory. Furthermore, the impairment observed is a function of the additional amount of time task switching occupies attention compared with\ntask repetition. As a consequence, the amount of time that attention could be devoted to the refreshment of decaying memory traces was shorter during task switching than during task repetition. This resulted in more deterioration of working memory maintenance when the number of task switches increased.\nOn the one hand, the present findings can be connected in a straightforward way to the research assuming that switch costs are elicited by additional task set reconfiguration processes mediated by working memory (Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003). In this perspective, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that when the number of switches increases, the total time involved in task set reconfiguration also increases. Because each change occupies attention for some time through processes of task set reconfiguration such as long-term retrieval (Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003) or task set inhibition (Mayr & Kliegl, 2000), the amount of time left to refresh the decaying memory traces is reduced when the number of switches is increased. In turn, this results in the impairment of working memory maintenance. On the other hand, our findings can be linked equally well to accounts that do not assume task set reconfiguration. For instance, on the assumption that switch costs follow from the interaction between task set priming and executive control (e.g., Gilbert & Shallice, 2002; Yeung & Monsell, 2003), our\nresults would then indicate that biasing top-down control in view of task set priming impairs working memory maintenance.\nIn a similar vein, it has been proposed that switch costs may result from facilitative priming of instructional task cues. In the task-cueing procedure, the same procedure we used in Experiments 2\u20134, switch costs are to a large extent accounted for by cue switches rather than by actual task switches (e.g., Logan & Bundesen, 2003, 2004; Mayr & Kliegl, 2003). D. W. Schneider and Logan (2005) proposed that in the task-cueing procedure, the perceptual representation of the cue must be compared with the transient representation of the possible cues in short-term memory. Although the activation of these representations decays in the interval between trials, there is some residual activation from the previous trial. Switch costs thus result from differences in residual activations that prime cue encoding. While such account discards task set reconfiguration, encoding cues and comparing their perceptual representation with transient representations in short-term memory remain processes that require attention. Accordingly, we assume that the difference between task-repetition and task-switch trials is that the former trials occupy attention for shorter periods of time because cue encoding and comparison are faster. As a consequence, even when endorsing the cue-encoding account, task switching will disrupt concurrent maintenance because it involves an attentional demand for a longer period of time.\nIn sum, our results show that processing differences related to task switching involve attention-demanding control processes. Additionally, the results of Experiment 4 even demonstrate that working memory impairment due to task switching is mediated by processes that are in fact not specific to the task-switching performance. Task switching interferes with the maintenance of items in working memory because, on task-switch trials, attention is occupied for a certain amount of time without opportunity for compensatory activities within the strictly controlled environment we used. This is in line with previous findings indicating that any task that occupies attention disrupts concurrent maintenance because it impedes, at least for short periods of time, the refreshment of the decaying memory traces (Barrouillet et al., 2004, 2007)."}, {"heading": "Working Memory Load and Switch Costs", "text": "An important finding of the present study is that switch costs remained unaffected by working memory load. In Experiments 2\u20134, increasing the number of items to be maintained concurrently during task switching did not increase the size of the switch cost. On the one hand, this finding challenges the proposal that task sets are maintained by working memory itself (e.g., Logan & Gordon, 2001; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003) and is consistent with the idea that some task elements, such as response codes, are represented in the activated part of long-term memory (e.g., Kiesel et al., 2007; Meiran & Kessler, 2008; Rubin & Meiran, 2005). It is important to note that this conclusion does not contradict our central finding that task switching taxes the maintenance of information in working memory. According to time-based resource sharing, the crucial element is the amount of time attention is occupied by task switching and not the amount of information to be maintained actively during task switching. The finding that stimulus degradation also impaired the maintenance of consonants offers a nice test of this claim, as such manipulation does require additional processing but not the maintenance of additional information. Taken\ntogether, the asymmetry we observed (i.e., task-switching impairing information maintenance, while concurrent load not affecting task switching) seems to suggest that task switching is related to working memory through simple attention-demanding processes but not through the active maintenance of task-related information.\nAlthough the focus of the present article is mainly on the relation between task switching and working memory, the absence of an effect of a concurrent load on task switching must also be considered in relation to working memory theories. For instance, on the basis of the task span procedure, Logan (2004) concluded that task switching and information maintenance in working memory call on different resources and do not compete for the same limited supply. In other words, task switching and working memory would be supported by different resources within a multiresource working memory framework.\nTrade-offs between the processing and the maintenance of information in working memory have been considered as a strong indication of a single-resource working memory system (e.g., Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Just & Carpenter, 1992; Lovett, Reder, & Lebie\u0300re, 1999), while the absence of such trade-offs has been interpreted as evidence favoring a working memory architecture consisting of multiple resources, with separate resources for the processing and for the maintenance of information (e.g., Kieras, Meyer, Mueller, & Seymour, 1999; W. Schneider & Detweiler, 1987). All the experiments in the present study revealed an impact of task switching on maintenance of information, lending strong support to the time-based resource-sharing model, which assumes that both the processing and the maintenance of information within working memory require attention, which is a single limited resource that must be shared.\nIt should be noted that, according to the classic view of the trade-off, performance on one component is inversely proportional to performance on the other component (e.g., Navon & Gopher, 1979; Sperling & Melchner, 1978). In the present study, it was observed that the number of switches had a negative impact on the maintenance of the consonants but, conversely, that the number of consonants to be maintained had no influence on task switching, a result converging with recent findings by Logan (2007; Experiment 4) suggesting that load per se does not affect switch costs. In other words, our findings do not conform to working memory theories that assume continuous sharing of a single resource between processing and storage. Indeed, these theories would expect that an increase in the number of items to be maintained would lead to a decrease in resources available for processing. Thus, they would predict slower performance under memory load (e.g., Anderson, Reder, & Lebie\u0300re, 1996; Just & Carpenter, 1992). As a consequence, an increased memory load would have some impact on task repetitions and a much larger impact on task switches, resulting in a higher switch cost (panels B and B in Figure 6). In line with this expectation, Baddeley et al. (2001) observed an effect of a concurrent verbal load on the size of the switch cost.\nHence, though the time-based resource-sharing model predicts that task switching impairs concurrent maintenance, this theory predicts no effect of memory load on task switching. Of course, at a macro level of analysis, the theory is consistent with a continuous resource sharing between competing parallel activities. Yet, at a micro level of analysis, it does not hypothesize such a continuous sharing. Indeed, a basic assumption of the time-based resourcesharing model is that the attention to be shared between processing\nand maintenance is rapidly shifted between both activities. This implies that when several things are going on at once, activities can be postponed but their duration remains unchanged because, when they are performed, they benefit from all the available attention that is not divided between concurrent activities. For example, in our experiments, participants could postpone the concurrent task in order to give priority to the refreshment of the memory traces of the letters. This postponement probably becomes longer when the number of letters to be refreshed is larger. However, when the tasks are computer-paced, such as our continuous span tasks, then postponement could in some cases become impossible, and some letters would be lost. Even in these extreme cases, however, memory load affects only the duration of the postponement but not the duration of the processing steps themselves. Indeed, the number of memory traces waiting for refreshment does not matter when attention is devoted to a given processing step. As a consequence, the duration of processing steps should remain unchanged for both repetition and switch trials, and the switch cost will remain unaffected (see panels A and A in Figure 6).\nOur results were precisely in line with these latter predictions. The reaction times of the pure lists in Experiment 1 increased when the number of consonants to be maintained increased, which is in agreement with the postponement idea, but in the subsequent experiments, the performance on the mixed lists in general remained unaffected when the number of consonants increased. More importantly, the size of the switch cost remained unaffected. Additionally, the reaction times displayed in Tables 3, 6, 9, and 12 for repetitions and switches were quite fast considering the fact that these repetitions and switches were performed in a dual-task situation. On average the reaction time when processing a digit while maintaining eight consonants was 701 ms for Experiment 3 and 720 ms for Experiment 4. In comparison, Verbruggen, Liefooghe, Vandierendonck, and Demanet (2007) used the same tasks in similar conditions (i.e., indicated by meaningless cues and supplying only a restricted amount of preparation time) but\nwithout an additional working memory load. The average speed of processing a digit under those circumstances varied from 781 ms to 825 ms. Those differences illustrate that when processing mixed lists, participants preferred to give immediate and fast responses. So, depending on the list to be performed (pure or mixed), the processing of the digits was either postponed or immediately executed. This is consistent with proposals issuing from the domain of multitasking research assuming that when individuals have to perform tasks at virtually the same time (i.e., in the context of heavy time constraints), they adopt scheduling strategies (Meyer & Kieras, 1997a, 1997b). It is even possible that the adoption of different prioritization schemes in either blocked or alternating lists led to the apparent increase in switch cost observed by Baddeley et al. (2001). However, the strict control of time parameters we adopted in the present study reveals that whatever the strategy participants use, either postponing or immediately performing the secondary task, in neither case the findings are in agreement with the view that memory load increases switch cost as predicted by the theories assuming a continuously shared resource. Thus, our results challenge the traditional single-resource conceptions of working memory but support the hypothesis of a serial attention switching as proposed by the time-based resource-sharing model."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In line with the time-based resource-sharing model, the present experiments offer neat evidence that task switching impairs the maintenance of items in working memory, offering the empirical confirmation of the widespread assumption that task switching involves working memory and consequently puts a cost on working memory functioning. Moreover, we did not observe that increasing the load on working memory modified the size of the switch cost, something accounted for by the conception of resource sharing developed within the time-based resource-sharing model. Additionally, the present study indicated that the effect of task switching on concurrent maintenance of information in working memory did not necessarily rely upon specific task set reconfiguration processes or task switching in general, but resulted from the combination of simple and more fundamental attention-demanding processes.\nReferences\nAllport, D.

Storm, Elizabeth Ligon Bjork, and Robert A. Bjork University of California, Los Angeles\nResearch on retrieval-induced forgetting has demonstrated that retrieving some information from memory can cause the forgetting of other information in memory. Here, the authors report research on the relearning of items that have been subjected to retrieval-induced forgetting. Participants studied a list of category\u2013exemplar pairs, underwent a series of retrieval-practice and relearning trials, and, finally, were tested on the initially studied pairs. The final recall of non-relearned items exhibited a cumulative effect of retrieval-induced forgetting such that the size of the effect increased with each block of retrieval practice. Of most interest, and very surprising from a common-sense standpoint, items that were relearned benefited more from that relearning if they had previously been forgotten. The results offer insights into the nature and durability of retrieval-induced forgetting and provide additional evidence that forgetting is an enabler\u2014rather than a disabler\u2014of future learning.\nKeywords: retrieval-induced forgetting, inhibition, learning, memory, forgetting\nThe adaptive and essential role of forgetting in memory is mostly unappreciated. As William James (1890) argued, however . . . \u201cIn the practical use of our intellect, forgetting is as important a function as recollecting\u201d (p. 679). Memories become irrelevant and outdated, and without some means of forgetting or setting aside such memories, learning and accessing new and relevant memories would become steadily more difficult. One way in which it appears that this form of goal-directed forgetting is accomplished is through retrieval inhibition (e.g., E. L. Bjork, Bjork, & Anderson, 1998; R. A. Bjork, 1989) or the executive control processes of inhibition (Anderson, 2003). As proposed by these researchers, in searching for a particular item in memory, other items that are related, but incorrect, can vie for access. Inhibitory control is recruited to select against and decrease the accessibility of such interfering items, facilitating access to the target item. As research on retrieval-induced forgetting has shown (e.g., Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994), this inhibition can have lasting consequences.\nRetrieval-induced forgetting is typically studied by researchers using a paradigm consisting of three phases: study, retrieval practice, and test (Anderson et al., 1994). Participants study a series of category\u2013exemplar pairs (e.g., fruit: lemon; profession: accountant; fruit: orange) and then retrieve half of the exemplars from half of the categories via guided retrieval practice (e.g., fruit: le_____). Practiced exemplars are referred to as Rp items, nonpracticed exemplars from practiced categories are referred to as Rp\u2013 items (e.g., orange), and nonpracticed exemplars from nonpracticed categories are referred to as Nrp items (e.g., accountant). Not surprisingly, Rp items are better recalled than are both Rp\u2013\nand Nrp items on a final delayed test; more important, however, Rp\u2013 items are less well recalled than are Nrp items. This impairment of Rp\u2013 items, referred to as retrieval-induced forgetting, is surprising because there are reasons to expect Rp\u2013 items to benefit, not suffer, from the retrieval of Rp items (e.g., spreading activation, covert rehearsal).\nIn the years since Anderson et al. (1994) demonstrated retrievalinduced forgetting, researchers have attempted to uncover the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. According to interference or blocking-based accounts, retrieval-induced forgetting occurs because of the strengthening of the association between the retrieval cue and practiced exemplars (Rp items), which then interfere with the later recall of nonpracticed exemplars (Rp\u2013 items) associated with the same retrieval cue. According to inhibition-based accounts, however, retrieval-induced forgetting occurs because of competition that arises during retrieval practice. While attempting to retrieve target exemplars (Rp items) during retrieval practice, other exemplars interfere with those retrieval attempts and must therefore be selected against. Intrinsic to this selection process is the inhibition of the competing items, which is then presumed to impair their later recall. Observations that retrieval-induced forgetting is cue-independent (e.g., Anderson & Spellman, 1995), interference dependent (e.g., Storm, Bjork, & Bjork, 2007), retrieval specific, and strength independent (e.g., Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 2000; Bauml, 2002) have generally supported the inhibitory account. It should be noted, however, that the debate is far from over, and many researchers remain reluctant to endorse an inhibitory explanation of retrieval-induced forgetting (see, e.g., Butler, Williams, Maki, & Zacks, 2001; MacLeod, Dodd, Sheard, Wilson, & Bibi, 2003; Perfect et al., 2004).\nLogic of the Present Study\nThere has been extensive research on the nature, generality, and boundary conditions of retrieval-induced forgetting. The focus of the present research is, instead, on the relearning of items that have\nBenjamin C. Storm, Elizabeth Ligon Bjork, and Robert A.

Intrinsic to the concept of retrieval inhibition (see R. A. Bjork, 2007) is that such inhibition entails a temporary inability to retrieve information from memory, not a permanent loss. The accessibility of potentially interfering information is reduced but in a way that maintains a representation of that information in memory and, presumably, renders it relearnable at an accelerated rate compared with the relearning of new information, should it again be needed. Thus, retrieval inhibition is an adaptive mechanism (R. A. Bjork, 1989; see also E. L. Bjork & Bjork, 1988), and, from that perspective, the impairment of Rp\u2013 items should not persist after both Rp\u2013 and Nrp items are relearned.\nBeyond that broad consideration, the present research was motivated by a counterintuitive prediction derived from the assumptions of the new theory of disuse (R. A. Bjork & Bjork, 1992), a theoretical framework that motivated, in part, the original research on retrieval-induced forgetting. According to the theory, and consistent with a distinction that a number of learning theorists of various persuasions have postulated tracing back decades (e.g., Estes, 1955; Hull, 1943), an item\u2019s representation in memory is indexed by two dissociable strengths: its storage strength, which represents how entrenched or interassociated the item is with other items in memory, and its retrieval strength, which reflects how accessible the item is at a given point in time in response to a given cue or configuration of cues. The likelihood that an item can be recalled at a given point in time is assumed to be solely a function of its current retrieval strength. Storage strength, which corresponds roughly to degree of learning, is a latent variable that acts to retard the loss of retrieval strength across a retention interval and enhances the gain of retrieval strength during relearning. Furthermore, once storage strength is accumulated, it is assumed never to be lost.\nA key assumption of the theory in the present context is that increments in retrieval strength and storage strength that result from an opportunity to recall or restudy are assumed to be a decreasing function of the item\u2019s current retrieval strength. That is, the theory assumes, counterintuitively, that the more accessible an item is at a given point in time or in a certain context, the less that item stands to benefit when it is relearned. If, in keeping with the theory, the occurrence of retrieval-induced forgetting reflects only a decrease in retrieval strength of Rp\u2013 items, not their storage strength, relearning of Rp\u2013 items should actually bring them to a higher level than that of comparable relearned Nrp items. Thus, not only might Rp\u2013 items recover from inhibition following reexposure but they might even become more recallable than items that were also reexposed but never inhibited in the first place.\nAlthough the foregoing hypothesis may seem counterintuitive, several types of evidence indicate that forgetting can enhance, rather than reduce, learning. R. A. Bjork and Allen (1970), for example, increased the forgetting of studied items by manipulating the difficulty of a number-shadowing task that was interpolated before the studied items were either tested or studied again. Difficult number shadowing produced more forgetting than did easy number shadowing, but the converse was true when another study trial was provided, and the information was tested at a delay. Cuddy and Jacoby (1982) obtained an analogous result when they manipulated the similarity of the interpolated task to the to-beremembered material. After a relearning trial, the condition pro-\nducing the most forgetting of the first study event (the similar task) produced the best recall on a delayed test.\nThe spacing effect (see, e.g., Dempster, 1996) constitutes another demonstration that forgetting can enable learning. The longer the interval between an initial study trial and a second study trial, the more forgetting that occurs of the first trial. Such spacing, however, tends to enhance, not impair, long-term recall. Finally, Smith, Glenberg, and Bjork (1978) demonstrated that changing the environmental context from a first study session to a second study session on the same material increased forgetting of the first study session but enhanced learning\u2014as measured by subsequent recall in a novel context.\nThese results and others suggest that diminishing the retrieval strength or accessibility of information in memory prior to relearning can facilitate the effectiveness of relearning. We hypothesized, therefore, that items subjected to retrieval-induced forgetting would benefit more from subsequent relearning than would items not initially forgotten\u2014perhaps even to the point of rendering such items more recallable after relearning than they would have been had they not been subjected to retrieval-induced forgetting. More specifically, although the accessibility of nonpracticed items from practiced categories (Rp\u2013 items) may have been impaired relative to baseline (Nrp items) initially, we predicted that difference would reverse after both types of items were relearned.\nMethod\nWe tested our hypothesis by having participants undergo a series of retrieval-practice and relearning cycles that were designed to induce and eliminate the effects of retrieval-induced forgetting repeatedly."}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "A total of 240 undergraduate students from the University of California, Los Angeles (73 men and 167 women) averaging 20.7 years of age participated in the experiment."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "Eight categories, each containing six exemplars of high taxonomic strength, no two of which began with the same first letter, were used in the present study. The eight experimental categories were first divided into two separate sets of four so that\u2014for any individual participant\u2014half of the categories received retrieval practice, and the other half did not. The two subsets were further divided into two sets of two such that half of the categories receiving retrieval practice and half of the categories not receiving retrieval practice were either relearned or not relearned. Thus, for any 1 participant, there were two practiced categories that were relearned and two practiced categories that were not relearned and, also, two unpracticed categories that were relearned and two unpracticed categories that were not relearned.\nDuring retrieval practice, participants were shown a series of category names and two-letter stems that began associated exemplars of relatively low taxonomic frequency. The targets of this retrieval practice were always extralist items\u2014that is, items that were not presented during the study phase of the experiment. Although this procedure differs from the typical retrieval-practice\nparadigm\u2014as Bauml (2002) and Storm, Bjork, Bjork, and Nestojko (2006) have demonstrated\u2014retrieval-induced forgetting is also obtained when participants generate extralist exemplars during retrieval practice. Thus, for a given subject, all six exemplars of a given category presented during the study phase served either as Rp\u2013 items or as Nrp items. The experiment was counterbalanced such that studied exemplars were associated with every experimental condition equally often across participants."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "The experiment was conducted in three main phases: study, retrieval practice/relearning, and test.\nStudy phase. Forty-eight category\u2013exemplar pairs were presented via computer at a rate of one pair per second. The presentation order was set randomly with the constraint that no two consecutive pairs were from the same category.\nRetrieval-practice/relearning phase. The retrieval-practice/ relearning phase immediately followed the study phase. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following five conditions, which are shown in schematic form in Figure 1: (a) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice; (b) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning; (c) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning, and then a second block of retrieval practice; (d) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning, a second block of retrieval practice, and then a second block of relearning; (e) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning, a second block of retrieval practice, a second block of relearning, and then a third block of retrieval practice. Although the same cues were provided during the retrieval-practice blocks, and the same items were relearned in subsequent relearning blocks, the order of their presentation was different in each block.\nA block of retrieval practice consisted of 24 extralist categoryplus-two-letter-stem cues (6 from each of the 4 practiced categories for that subject) appearing on the screen for 5 s each, with the participants instructed to write down the particular exemplar that completed the two-letter stem. None of the letter-stem cues began with the same letter as any item from the same category that had\nbeen presented in the study phase. Each block of relearning consisted of the re-presentations of all of the category\u2013exemplar pairs from the two practiced categories and the two unpracticed categories that were to be relearned for that subject. Each relearning block contained 24 pairs (6 from each of those 4 categories) presented in random order and for 1 s each.\nFinal testing phase. After completing the retrieval-practice/ relearning phase and a subsequent 5-min intervening task, participants were given a category-plus-one-letter-stem cued-recall test for all of the 48 originally studied category\u2013exemplar pairs. Each cue was presented for 3 s, and the participants responded out loud for the experimenter to record.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Performance During Retrieval Practice", "text": "Participants successfully generated exemplars 31% (SE 0.01), 34% (SE 0.01), and 37% (SE 0.02) of the time in the first, second, and third blocks of retrieval practice, respectively."}, {"heading": "Cued-Recall Performance", "text": "The mean correct recall proportions on the final cued-recall test for exemplars exposed during the study phase as a function of their being relearned or not relearned and being Rp\u2013 or Nrp items are presented for each of the five groups of participants in Figure 2.

All main effects and interactions, including the three-way interaction, were statistically significant (see Table 1 for ANOVA results). Given the complex nature of the design and the specific nature of our research questions, several separate analyses were conducted to explore the effects of forgetting and relearning. As can be seen in Figure 2, however, the data appear to support our predictions: Retrieval practice induced the forgetting of items from practiced categories relative to items from nonpracticed categories; these forgotten items benefited more from relearning than nonforgotten\nitems, and retrieval-induced forgetting was not only eliminated following relearning but it was reversed.1"}, {"heading": "Retrieval-Induced Forgetting for Non-Relearned Items", "text": "Recall data for non-relearned categories in all conditions were subjected to a 2 (Rp\u2013 vs. Nrp) 3 (one block of retrieval practice [Conditions 1 and 2] vs. two blocks of retrieval practice [Conditions 3 and 4] vs. three blocks of retrieval practice [Condition 5]) mixed design ANOVA, with the number of retrieval-practice blocks serving as a between-subjects variable. Overall, a significant retrieval-induced-forgetting effect was found. Recall perfor-\nmance for items from categories that received retrieval practice (Rp\u2013 items: M 0.26, SE 0.01) was significantly worse than for items from categories that did not receive retrieval practice (Nrp items: M 0.31, SE 0.01), F(1, 237) 22.50, p .001, MSE 0.315.\nAs shown in Table 2, the effect of retrieval practice on the recall of Rp\u2013 versus Nrp items interacted significantly with the number of retrieval-practice blocks, F(2, 237) 3.89, p .05, MSE 0.05.

We did so by means of a 2 (Rp\u2013 vs. Nrp) 2 (not after relearning vs. after relearning) mixed design ANOVA, with not after relearning versus after relearning serving as the betweensubjects variable. Overall, a significant main effect of relearning was found such that items were more recallable after relearning (M 0.44, SE 0.01) than they were without relearning (M 0.33, SE 0.01), F(1, 190) 28.77, p .001, MSE 0.99. More important, however, the effect of relearning was significantly larger for Rp\u2013 items than it was for Nrp items, F(1, 190) 10.49, p .001, MSE 0.15. Whereas Nrp items were recalled at a rate of 0.36 (SE 0.02) and 0.42 (SE 0.02) before and after relearning, respectively, Rp\u2013 items were recalled at a rate of 0.31 (SE 0.02) and 0.45 (SE 0.02) before and after relearning, respectively. These results strongly support our hypothesis that Rp\u2013 items benefit more from relearning than do their Nrp counterparts. Two t tests were conducted to test for effects of retrievalinduced forgetting before and after relearning.

Although this difference was not statistically significant, F(1, 94) 0.60, p .05, it is consistent with the idea that repeated cycles of inhibition and reexposure may increase the storage strength of items in memory, thereby making them more recallable once the inhibition is released. It is possible that with additional cycles, the amount of retrieval-induced facilitation would have continued to increase."}, {"heading": "Effect of Repeated Inhibition and Reexposure", "text": "A separate analysis explored recall performance of participants in Condition 5, who had engaged in three blocks of retrieval practice interpolated with two blocks of relearning.

More important, a significant interaction emerged such that a larger retrieval-induced-forgetting effect was observed for items that were never relearned (mean for Rp\u2013 items 0.22, SE 0.02 vs. mean for Nrp items 0.31, SE 0.02) than for items that were intermittently relearned (mean for Rp\u2013 items 0.44, SE 0.03 vs. mean for Nrp items 0.43, SE 0.02), F(1, 47) 8.30, p .01, MSE 0.13. We believe that relearned items did suffer from retrieval-induced forgetting but that their impairment was offset by the additional benefits accrued during previous blocks of relearning. As can be seen in Figure 2, relearned Rp\u2013 items in Condition 5 tended to be recalled less well than relearned Rp\u2013 items in Condition 4, t(94) 1.47, p .14, indicating that some retrieval-induced forgetting had occurred even after multiple blocks of retrieval practice and relearning had taken place.\nDiscussion\nIn the present research, we explored whether the relearning of items that had been the target of retrieval-induced forgetting would restore the recall of such items to a level comparable with the relearning of items never exposed to retrieval-induced forgetting. Participants studied a list of category\u2013exemplar pairs, took part in one of five between-subjects retrieval-practice/relearning conditions, and were then tested on the initially studied pairs. On the basis of assumptions of the new theory of disuse (R. A. Bjork & Bjork, 1992) and on research demonstrating the importance of forgetting in creating effective conditions for future learning, we predicted that such forgotten items would benefit more from relearning than would their nonforgotten counterparts. In fact, retrieval-induced-forgetting effects were not only eliminated after relearning but they were, if anything, reversed.\nIt may seem reasonable, or at least not totally surprising, that relearning of items subjected to retrieval-induced forgetting would override that forgetting, but that such forgetting would be more than overridden by relearning is genuinely surprising. This finding is, however, consistent with a counterintuitive prediction of the new theory of disuse (R. A. Bjork & Bjork, 1992)\u2014namely, that the extent to which an item benefits from relearning is a decreasing function of the accessibility or retrieval strength of that item at the time of relearning. Thus, owing to their being forgotten, Rp\u2013 items are predicted by the theory to benefit more from relearning than are Nrp items. Furthermore, under the assumption that retrievalinduced forgetting reflects only a decrease in retrieval strength, not storage strength, the predicted greater increment in storage strength of Rp\u2013 items over Nrp items owing to the relearning phase should render Rp\u2013 items more recallable than Nrp after a sufficient delay. This prediction follows because storage strength is assumed to retard the loss of retrieval strength\u2014that is, retard observed forgetting\u2014so access to relearned Rp\u2013 items will be lost more slowly than will access to relearned Nrp items, meaning that the\nrecall of Rp\u2013 items, relative to Nrp items, should increase with delay.\nIn certain respects, the present results are problematic for noninhibitory accounts of retrieval-induced forgetting, such as blocking. If the impairment of Rp\u2013 items at test was caused by interference from strengthened Rp items, there seems every reason to assume that this impairment would persist, even after intermittent relearning. Although relearning cycles should make both Rp\u2013 and Nrp items more accessible, only Rp\u2013 items have competing exemplars strengthened during retrieval practice\u2014and, thus, only Rp\u2013 items should be susceptible to the effects of interference at test. In other words, if retrieval-induced forgetting was caused by interference at test, that interference should also have been observed even after the relearning of Rp\u2013 and Nrp items.\nThe current results also suggest that retrieval-induced forgetting does not reflect the permanent loss of items in memory. Had this been the case, items suffering from retrieval-induced forgetting should have remained less recallable even after relearning. Rather, the current results suggest that if retrieval-induced forgetting is caused by inhibition, that inhibition reflects the temporary inability to retrieve items from memory. Given that the supposed purpose of inhibitory control is to resolve interference from competing items (Anderson, 2003; Anderson et al., 1994; E. L. Bjork et al., 1998), this distinction makes sense. It is not the storage strength of related items that determines whether they will compete during the retrieval process, it is their retrieval strength. Thus, to reduce competition during retrieval, the current accessibility of competing items (retrieval strength) needs to be reduced, not the permanent storage (storage strength) of those items, which would have nonadaptive consequences in other contexts in which those items are relevant.\nStudies of retrieval-induced forgetting have typically required participants to retrieve exemplars multiple times during retrieval practice. Anderson et al. (1994), for example, had participants undergo retrieval practice for half of the exemplars from half of the categories three times each. Although some researchers have argued that numerous retrieval-practice trials are not necessary to induce forgetting (e.g., Macrae & MacLeod, 1999), it seems reasonable that having more retrieval-practice trials should increase the number of opportunities for competing items to be inhibited. Even though items inhibited during a particular retrieval-practice phase should become less accessible\u2014and, hence, less competing\u2014during a subsequent retrieval-practice phase, other not-yetinhibited items may still compete. Basically, as long as there are competitors still accessible in memory, additional retrieval practice should continue to result in additional retrieval-induced forgetting. Consistent with this idea, the magnitude of the retrieval-inducedforgetting effect for non-relearned items in the present study increased systematically with the number of retrieval-practice blocks.\nThat additional retrieval practice leads to increased retrievalinduced forgetting has important implications for researchers who employ the retrieval-practice paradigm. Retrieval-inducedforgetting effects are often quite small. The results observed here (and recently by others, e.g., Johnson & Anderson, 2004; Levy, McVeigh, Marful, & Anderson, 2007) suggest that increasing the number of retrieval-practice trials may offer an effective means of increasing the size of the effect."}, {"heading": "Concluding Comments", "text": "It is natural to think of forgetting and learning as forces in constant competition\u2014that once some level of learning is accomplished, forgetting sets in to undo, so to speak, some or all of that learning. Most people may be able to appreciate that individuals can relearn what has been forgotten faster than individuals learning something for the first time, but most people would certainly also assume that it is best not to forget. That relearning should be enhanced by remembering, not by forgetting, seems an unassailable idea. As with many dynamics in human memory, however, common sense proves to be a poor guide. On the basis of these and other findings, it appears that rather than undoing learning, forgetting creates conditions that enhance the effectiveness of learning.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the present research, though motivated by theoretical issues, has provocative implications for a practical matter: the optimization of instruction. There exist a set of manipulations\u2014labeled desirable difficulties by R. A. Bjork (1994), such as variation, spacing, and contextual interference\u2014 that share the property that they create difficulties for the learner and appear to slow the rate of learning but then often enhance long-term retention and transfer. Perhaps retrieval-induced forgetting, incorporated in some creative way during instruction, has the potential to serve as an innovative and unintuitive desirable difficulty.\nReferences\nAnderson, M.

Berry and David R. Shanks University College London\nRichard N. A. Henson Medical Research Council (MRC) Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit\nA single-system computational model of priming and recognition was applied to studies that have looked at the relationship between priming, recognition, and fluency in continuous identification paradigms. The model was applied to 3 findings that have been interpreted as evidence for a multiple-systems account: (a) priming can occur for items not recognized; (b) the pattern of identification reaction times (RTs) to hits, misses, correct rejections, and false alarms can change as a function of recognition performance; and (c) fluency effects (shorter RTs to words judged old vs. judged new) and priming effects (shorter RTs to old vs. new words) can be observed in amnesic patients at levels comparable with healthy adults despite impaired or near-chance recognition. The authors\u2019 simulations suggest, contrary to previous interpretations, that these results are consistent with a single-system account.\nKeywords: fluency, repetition priming, recognition, computational model\nThe question of whether repetition priming and recognition are mediated by independent or related memory processes has received much attention and has played a key role in the development of theories of the organization of memory. Repetition priming is the term used to refer to a change in identification, detection, or production of an item (e.g., a word) as a result of prior exposure to the same or a similar item, whereas recognition memory typically refers to the capacity to judge whether an item has been previously presented in a particular context.\nAn influential view is that priming and recognition are mediated by functionally and neurally distinct memory systems (e.g., Gabrieli, 1998; Schacter & Tulving, 1994; Squire, 1994, 2004). Findings from patients provide compelling evidence in favor of this view: Priming is relatively intact in amnesic patients despite severely impaired, and sometimes chance, recognition performance (Hamann & Squire, 1997). Furthermore, individuals with damage to right occipital brain regions show impaired priming and spared recognition (e.g., patient M. S.; Gabrieli, Fleischman, Keane, Reminger, & Morrell, 1995), constituting a double dissociation. Findings from imaging studies also converge on this notion: In a recent example, Schott et al. (2005; see also Schott et al., 2006) found that priming and recognition were associated with distinct patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging activation. Functional dissociations in behavioral performance have also been\nreported in normal adults (see Roediger & McDermott, 1993, for a review); for example, semantic versus nonsemantic processing of stimuli at study has large benefits on recognition performance but little or no effect on priming (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981), and changes in perceptual form between study and test can have opposite effects on priming and recognition performance (Wagner, Gabrieli, & Verfaellie, 1997). Dissociations, such as these, have been interpreted as evidence for distinct memorial bases of priming and recognition (e.g., Wagner & Gabrieli, 1998; Wagner et al., 1997).\nAn alternative view is that priming and recognition are, to some extent, mediated by a common memory representation. For example, the double dissociation shown by amnesic patients and occipital lobe patients has been reproduced by the simple recurrent network (SRN), a connectionist model in which a single memory representation mediates priming and recognition (Kinder & Shanks, 2001, 2003). Other simulation studies have shown that certain types of dissociations are consistent with a single-system perspective (see, e.g., Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006; Shanks, Wilkinson, & Channon, 2003; Zaki, Nosofsky, Jessup, & Unverzagt, 2003). Similarly, and contrary to the aforementioned imaging studies, some studies have found evidence in support of the notion that priming and recognition depend on a common representation. For example, Turk-Browne, Yi, and Chun (2006) found commonalities in the neural correlates of the encoding processes leading to priming and recognition memory.\nCertain dual process theories of recognition also posit a common memory source in priming and recognition. One view is that the facilitation in processing, or fluency, from priming can give rise to a feeling of familiarity that can serve as a basis for recognition (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Mandler, 1980; Yonelinas, Regehr, & Jacoby, 1995; for a review of studies concerned with attributions of fluency, see Kelley & Rhodes, 2002). It has been shown that recognition judgments can be influenced by manipulations designed to enhance fluency or speed of processing, suggesting that fluency can indeed serve as a basis for recognition.

Presumably items presented in low levels of masking were easier to read and were processed more fluently than those presented in high masking. Whittlesea et al. argued that this enhanced fluency was misattributed to prior exposure of the word.\nStudies that look at the contribution of fluency, or priming, to recognition often use gradual clarification procedures to present each item (e.g., by presenting a stimulus for successively longer durations, Stark & McClelland, 2000; or by slowly unmasking a stimulus, Conroy, Hopkins, & Squire, 2005; see also Johnston, Dark, & Jacoby, 1985; Johnston, Hawley, & Elliot, 1991; Verfaellie & Cermak, 1999). Typically, the participant\u2019s task is to identify each item and then to make a recognition judgment to the item. Repetition priming is reflected in faster identification reaction times (RTs) to old than new items. The fluency effect is the term usually used to describe the shorter RTs to items judged old than items judged new, independent of actual old\u2013new status (Conroy et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 1985). Thus, the task permits concurrent assessment of recognition, priming, and fluency, providing a measure of each for every item. Indeed, RTs can be compared across all four possible outcomes\u2014that is, hits (old items judged old), misses (old items judged new), false alarms (new items judged old), and correct rejections (new items judged new).\nThree findings from this paradigm have been interpreted as evidence for distinct memorial bases of priming and recognition. Briefly, they are that (a) priming can occur for items not overtly recognized (Stark & McClelland, 2000), (b) RTs to false alarms are faster than RTs to misses when recognition is poor, and vice versa when recognition is relatively good (Johnston et al., 1985), and (c) amnesic patients show relatively intact fluency and priming effects despite impaired recognition performance (Conroy et al., 2005; Verfaellie & Cermak 1999).\nIn this article, we aim to consider each of these findings in turn and to account for each one using a computational model in which priming and recognition performance depend on a single source of memorial evidence but are subject to independent sources of noise. We present for the first time a formal quantitative model of priming, recognition, and fluency. It is our hope that this model may serve as a useful benchmark for evaluating multiple- versus single-system theories and, via its testable predictions, may present a falsification challenge to researchers. We regard it as important that before a multiple-systems approach is advanced, researchers can show that a single-system model is unable to account for their data patterns or has critical limitations.\nA Single-System Model of Priming and Recognition\nThe model presented here is conceptually very similar to standard signal detection models of recognition judgments and their latencies (Pike, 1973; Ratcliff & Murdock, 1976; Stretch & Wixted, 1998), and it extends previous work with this type of model (Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006; Shanks et al., 2003). It should be noted from the outset that the model is one simply of the influence of memory on performance in priming and recognition tasks rather than a detailed mechanistic account of the processes involved in these tasks. The model starts with the assumption that, at test, both old and new items are associated with a memory\nvariable called familiarity f. f is a normally distributed random variable:\nf N , f , (1)\nwhich, because of prior exposure, is assumed to have a greater mean value for old items ( old) than for new items ( new). For a given item, the same value of f contributes to both recognition and priming tasks (which is what makes it a single-system model). The judgment made during a recognition task depends on the variable Jr:\nJr f er (2)\ner N 0, r ,\nwhere er is another normally distributed random variable with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of r that represents taskspecific sources of noise in the recognition task.\nSimilar to signal detection theory of recognition (see, e.g., Macmillan & Creelman, 2005), accuracy is simulated in the recognition task by comparing the value of Jr against a criterion value (C). If the value of Jr for a given item exceeds the criterion, then the item will be judged \u201cold,\u201d otherwise it will be judged \u201cnew.\u201d In principle C is free to vary; however, for the sake of simplicity, C is set here to the midpoint between the means of the old and new familiarity distributions, that is, ( new old)/2.\nTo simulate an identification RT for the clarification task, we assume that RT is a decreasing function of f but with the addition of another independent source of noise:\nRT b sf ep (3)\nep N 0, p ,\nwhere the parameters b and s are merely scaling parameters that represent the RT intercept and slope (rate of change of RT with f), respectively. The noise associated with the priming task, ep, represents measurement error, or the influence of nonmemorial factors on performance in priming tasks (Ostergaard, 1992). This method of simulating the influence of memory on RTs is similar to previous applications of the model (Shanks & Perruchet, 2002; Shanks et al., 2003; although other linear transformations of f can be used to simulate performance in other tasks, e.g., perceptual identification accuracy\u2014see Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006). Thus, greater values of f lead to a greater likelihood of an old response and shorter RTs. In sum, the central assumption in the model is that a single familiarity signal drives priming and recognition tasks but is scaled differently and is subjected to different sources of noise for each task.\nWe now turn to the data from Stark and McClelland (2000), which was taken as evidence for multiple bases of recognition and priming. Stark and McClelland used the continuous identification with recognition (CID-R) task (Feustel, Shiffrin, & Salasoo, 1983) to investigate the relationship between priming and recognition. On a study trial of this task, an item is presented for a brief duration (e.g., 17 ms) and is then followed by a mask (####) for the remainder of a presentation block (e.g., 233 ms). The item is then re-presented, at a slightly longer duration (e.g., 34 ms), and is again replaced with the mask for the remainder of the presentation block (e.g., 216 ms). Presentation continues in this way, with the item being presented for longer and longer durations until it is identified (or until the presentation duration of the word equals the\nduration of a presentation block). The same procedure is used in a second test phase (in which some items are repeated from the study phase), except that participants make a recognition judgment following each identification.\nOf key interest for these simulations is Stark and McClelland\u2019s (2000) observation that the identification RTs for misses (old items judged new) were faster than those for correct rejections (new items judged new). In other words, even though certain items were not remembered, a priming effect still occurred for these items. Stark and McClelland argued that this result supports the notion that the sources of recognition memory and priming are independent, because if priming and recognition depend on the same memory source, then priming should not occur when recognition is absent. Furthermore, they found that performance in the two tasks was not significantly correlated, bolstering the case for independence.\nExperiment 1\nThe aim of Experiment 1 was to replicate Stark and McClelland\u2019s (2000) finding of priming for items judged new and then apply the model to the data. An experimental replication was conducted rather than simply fitting the model to Stark and McClelland\u2019s data because robust demonstrations of priming in the absence of awareness remain elusive, and independent replications of such effects are therefore important.1 We presented words at study using the CID procedure; participants pressed a button when they could identify the word and then named the word aloud. At test, we presented old and new words to participants using the CID-R procedure."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Twenty-four individuals were recruited through a University College London participant database. Their ages ranged from 19 to 38 years, with a mean of 23.3 years. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, reported English as their first language, were tested individually in sound-dampened cubicles, and were paid \u00a34 (approximately $7) in return for taking part. The experiment was fully automated, and the experimenter was not present in the room during the course of the experiment.\nMaterials. A total of 120 words were selected with similar constraints to Stark and McClelland (2000): All words had four letters, had a frequency of occurrence of 10\u2013200 per million (Kucera & Francis, 1967), and had a maximum score of 500 on the Imagability and Concreteness scales in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981). All words were presented in white 20-pt Courier font. Two 50-word lists were constructed. Each word list acted as the old or new stimuli, counterbalanced across participants.\nProcedure. At study, a single word was presented on each CID trial. At the start of each trial, a mask (a row of hash marks ####) was presented for 500 ms to orient the participant. Next, a word was presented in lowercase 20-pt Courier font for 17 ms. The mask was then presented in 26-pt Courier font for 233 ms, forming a 250-ms presentation block. The word was then immediately presented again, but this time the exposure duration was increased by 17 ms, and the mask followed for the remainder of the 250-ms presentation block. Presentation continued in this way, with the\ntotal stimulus plus mask time remaining constant in each block, until the mask duration was 0 ms (15 blocks). When a response was made (by clicking the left mouse button), the mask was immediately presented for 2,000 ms. Participants then clicked a button that was presented below the stimulus presentation area to advance to the next trial.\nThere were 70 study trials in total. The first and last 10 trials were considered primacy and recency filler trials, and none of the words from these trials appeared at test. The RTs from these filler trials were not included in any subsequent analysis. The remaining 50 trials contained the stimuli that would later appear at test. For the study phase, participants were told that a word would flash on the screen for longer and longer durations and that this would make it appear clearer over time. They were told that they must click the left mouse button when they knew the identity of the word and then read it aloud. On each trial, the time from the onset of the stimuli to the onset of the button press was recorded. The importance of speed was emphasized; however, errors were discouraged: Participants were told that they should click the mouse button only when they were confident that they could identify the word correctly. If the word had not been identified by the end of the trial, then a message appeared to the participants asking them to try to be faster on the next trial. RTs longer than 3,750 ms (the time that had elapsed by the end of the last stimulus presentation block) were not recorded. No indication of the upcoming recognition test was given.\nAfter the study phase, the instructions for the test phase were presented. We presented a single word using the CID procedure on each test trial. Participants were again instructed to press the mouse button when they could identify the word and then read the word aloud; they were additionally told that after identifying each word they would have to make a judgment about the word. After each identification, the probe \u201cold or new?\u201d appeared on the screen, and two buttons labeled \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d were also presented on the screen below this probe. Participants were instructed to click the button labeled \u201cold\u201d if they thought that the word they had just identified was one from the study phase. They were told to click the \u201cnew\u201d button if they thought that the word had not been presented in the study phase. There were 100 test trials in total (50 old and 50 new trials). The selection of a word for each trial was randomly determined. Misidentification trials at study or test were excluded from all subsequent analysis. Responses were recorded on a tape recorder and later checked for accuracy.\nAn alpha level of .05 was used for statistical tests, and t tests were two-tailed. We used the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction to correct for nonsphericity on tests involving repeated measures factors with more than two levels."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Study phase. The number of errors made was very low (M 1% errors across participants), and as a result, no further analysis of the errors was conducted. The mean RT to the study words was 1,441 ms (SEM 41 ms).\n1 Stark and McClelland\u2019s (2000) other main results of (a) repetition priming for nonwords and (b) differences in the magnitude of priming for words, nonwords, and pseudowords were not of interest for present purposes because they were not used to argue for independent memorial bases of priming and recognition.\nTest phase. Recognition accuracy, as measured by d , was significantly greater than chance overall, t(23) 18.38, p .001 (mean d 1.53, SEM 0.08; mean hit rate 0.77, SEM 0.02; mean false alarm rate 0.23, SEM 0.02).\nFor every participant, priming was calculated as the mean RT for new items minus the mean RT for old items. Priming was significantly greater than zero overall, t(23) 5.70, p .001 (M 85 ms, SEM 15), indicating that old items were identified more quickly at test than new items (new items M 1,397 ms, SEM 46; old items M 1,312 ms, SEM 40). Consistent with Stark and McClelland (2000), no significant correlation was found between this priming effect and recognition accuracy (d ), r(23) .25, p .24. As has been observed in previous studies, a significant fluency effect was also obtained (judged old mean RT 1,315 ms vs. judged new mean RT 1,392 ms), t(23) 7.77, p .001, SEM 10.\nThe RTs to correct rejections, misses, false alarms, and hits are shown in Figure 1. A repeated measures analysis of variance, comparing the RTs for these recognition outcomes, revealed a significant difference between the RTs in these four categories, F(3, 69) 11.25, p .001. Of primary interest for this experiment, RTs to misses were significantly faster than RTs to correct rejections, t(23) 3.55, p .002 (mean priming for items judged new 63 ms, SEM 18), replicating Stark and McClelland (2000). Furthermore, additional comparisons (t tests, Bonferroni corrected) revealed that the RTs to hits were faster than those to correct rejections, t(23) 7.34, p .05, and false alarms, t(23) 2.97, p .05. No other significant comparisons were found.\nIn summary, the key result from this experiment was that a priming effect for items judged new was obtained, replicating Stark and McClelland (2000). Repetition priming and recognition were also found to be at levels significantly greater than that expected by chance and not significantly correlated.\nSimulation Study 1\nFor the simulation of Experiment 1, as in a prior application of the model (Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006), the model was simplified by setting new 0, and old , with no loss of generality (i.e., represents the difference in the means of the old and new distributions). The other parameters of the model (see Equations 1\u20133) are the standard deviation of the distribution of familiarity values across items, f, the standard deviation of the noise associated with the recognition task, r, the standard deviation of the noise associated with identification, p, the RT intercept, b, and the familiarity slope, s, associated with the generation of the RTs.\nThere were some a priori constraints imposed on the parameter values to be consistent with previous applications of the model to normal adults (Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006), namely that r f 0.2.\n2,3 Also, the criterion, C, for both recognition and priming judgments was fixed as the midpoint of the old and new distribu-\n2 Models of recognition memory often allow the variance of the old item \u201cstrength\u201d distribution to be larger than that of the new distribution, but here we make a simpler assumption of equal variances. In our model, the standard deviation of recognition strength, Jr, depends on f and r . The simulations were repeated with Jr(new) 0.8 Jr(old) for all nonamnesic conditions by lowering f(new) to 0.10583. It was not possible to lower f(new) to the point where Jr(new) 0.8 Jr(old) for the hippocampal lesions and medial temporal lobe lesions groups (in Simulation Study 3), because even when f(new) 0, Jr(new) 0.8 Jr(old), therefore, these simulations were repeated with Jr(new) 0.9 Jr(old), and Jr(new) 0.95 Jr(old), respectively, by setting f(new) 0.188266 (hippocampal lesions group), and f(new) 0.355422 (medial temporal lobe lesions group). The critical predictions of the model were not qualitatively affected by these changes.\n3 The value of f can be set arbitrarily (to a nonzero value) and the other parameters rescaled accordingly. In terms of signal detection theory, the standard would have been to set Jr 1, and hence r f 1/ 2.\ntions of familiarity (i.e., C /2). This left four free parameters: , p, s, and b. There were eight degrees of freedom in the data (RT to hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections; the hit and false alarm rates for the recognition task; the mean item RT variance; and the Pearson correlation between priming and recognition).4 The values of the parameters (in this and subsequent simulations) are shown in Table 1. They were chosen by a handsearch process: First was varied to fit the recognition data, next the free parameters relating to the priming task (in Equation 3) were varied to fit the RT data.\nFor each old and new item, a single value of f was randomly sampled on each trial from the relevant distribution. The value of f was then scaled and combined with one source of noise (Equation 3) to derive an RT that formed the basis of the fluency and priming data. The same value of f was then combined with another source of noise (Equation 2) to determine the recognition response. We emphasize that the same memory signal (familiarity) contributed to priming, recognition, and fluency.\nWe simulated the data using the same number of trials as in Experiment 1 (50 old, 50 new trials) and using 10,000 simulated participants. The large number of participants means that the error bars on the simulation results are negligible. The simulation results for the RTs to hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections are shown in the right panel of Figure 1, and for recognition performance in the left panel of Figure 1. The error bars on the experimental data are 95% confidence intervals. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the model results are within these intervals for all cases.5\nTo determine whether the variability in RTs predicted by the model is realistic, we calculated the variance of each participant\u2019s RTs to items at test. This variance was fit by the model: Mean item standard deviation of RTs (within-subject) in Experiment 1 277 ms, 95% CI 302 ms, 95% CI 252 ms; mean item standard deviation of RTs (within-subject) predicted by the model 296 ms. The primary reason for fitting this variance was to ensure that RTs were generated within the appropriate intervals and to constrain the p free parameter.\nLastly, the model predicts a near zero correlation between priming and recognition, r .07, which is also within the 95% confidence interval of the correlation observed in Experiment 1 (r .25, 95% CI .17, 95% CI .68)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The single-system model predicted that priming would occur for items judged \u201cnew,\u201d suggesting that this result is not necessarily indicative of independent memorial bases of priming and recognition. In fact, the prediction of RT(misses) RT(correct rejections) falls quite naturally out of the model, which assumes a signal-detection-like process in recognition: Because an old item\u2019s value of Jr must exceed C for an old judgment to occur (see Equation 2), values of f will tend to be greater for misses than correct rejections. RTs for misses will tend to be faster than correct\n4 Correlations were simulated in a previous application of the model by drawing a value of randomly from a normal distribution for each participant, i:\ni N , , (4)\nwhere is the standard deviation of the mean familiarity across participants and is a free parameter (Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006). was not included in this simulation study to improve the ratio of free parameters to degrees of freedom in the data, and, moreover, only one correlation is being simulated here rather than several (as was the case in Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006). It should be noted that when the simulation was repeated with i included (and was set at 0.028 as in Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006), the predicted correlation was very similar to the one obtained in this simulation and was still within the 95% confidence interval (r .10 with i included vs. r .07 without).\n5 Because the parameter values were chosen by hand (for this simulation study and the subsequent ones), it is likely that better fits could have been obtained by using a more formal fitting procedure. However, our main goal in these simulations was to show that the model can produce sufficiently close qualitative and quantitative fits to the data.\nrejections simply because RTs are a decreasing function of f (see Equation 3). In fact, the model would even predict this qualitative pattern if no task-specific sources of noise were included (i.e., er ep 0 in Equations 2 and 3). Without these sources of noise f(hits) f(false alarms) f(misses) f(correct rejections) (as predicted by signal detection theory) and RTs will inversely correspond to f such that RT(correct rejections) RT(misses) RT(false alarms) RT(hits).\nYet in the simulation of Experiment 1, the inclusion of the noise parameters results in the pattern of RTs being RT(correct rejections) RT(false alarms) RT(misses) RT(hits). Consistent with this, there was a numerical trend for RT(false alarm) RT(miss) in the experimental data, but this difference was not significant. It should be noted though that this pattern has been found in some studies: Johnston et al. (1985; Experiment 1) found that RTs to false alarms were indeed significantly slower than RTs to misses (see ahead to the Simulation 2 section). Stark and McClelland (2000) also observed numerical trends for RT(false alarms) RT(misses) for word stimuli (but reported no statistical comparisons).\nWhy does the model predict, correctly, that (in some cases) RT(false alarms) RT(misses)? Consider a new item that has an \u201caverage\u201d f and is combined with a high value of er (to generate Jr in Equation 2); this item will still have the same average value of f when its RT is generated (in Equation 3), and it will be unlikely to again be combined with a large value of ep. Thus, a new item with a Jr value that exceeds C can be classified as a false alarm, but it will not necessarily have a comparably short RT, because it is unlikely that er and ep will both be large for the same item. The reverse scenario occurs for misses: An old item with an average f that is combined with a large negative value of er lowering its value of Jr below C will be classified as a miss. When that same value of f is used to predict the item\u2019s RT, it will be unlikely to again be combined with a large negative value of ep, meaning that misses will not necessarily result in comparably long RTs, and the RTs can be shorter than those of false alarms. (This property is related to the phenomenon of regression to the mean.) Thus, the inclusion of noise parameters in the model is important for it to explain this result.\nIn the next simulation study, we turn to another set of results that have been taken as evidence for distinct bases of priming and recognition. In this case, we will show how the relative sizes of RT(misses) and RT(false alarms) vary with , and again, it is the inclusion of the noise parameters that is critical in increasing the model\u2019s explanatory power.\nSimulation Study 2: Johnston et al. (1985)\nIn a classic study by Johnston et al. (1985), participants read items at study and identified ones that gradually clarified from a mask at test. In their Experiment 1, the stimuli were words, and recognition and priming were at levels greater than chance. The order of RTs was RT(correct rejections) RT(false alarms) RT(misses) RT(hits). In Experiment 2, the stimuli were nonwords, recognition and repetition priming were at levels lower than those of Experiment 1, and the order of RTs changed to RT(correct rejections) RT(misses) RT(false alarms) RT(hits). Thus, the pattern of RTs in Experiment 2 resembled that predicted by a model of priming and recognition similar to the one presented here but with no noise parameters (as discussed above). The results of\nExperiment 2 were interpreted as evidence that recognition relied primarily on a single memory signal when recognition performance was poor. However, because the pattern of RTs in Experiment 1 did not conform to the predictions of such a model, Johnston et al. (1985, 1991) interpreted the RT(false alarm) RT(miss) pattern as evidence that an additional memory factor contributed to recognition when overall recognition performance was higher. This article has been cited as evidence that priming and recognition are mediated by different memory bases.\nAs shown in the simulation of our Experiment 1, inclusion of decision noise allows the model to predict the RT(false alarm) RT(miss) pattern. However, what is not clear is whether the model predicts RT(false alarm) RT(miss) when recognition is poor. To investigate this, we applied the model to Experiments 1 and 2 of Johnston et al. (1985). The values of r, f, and p were kept from the previous simulation, leaving , s, and b as the three free parameters for Experiment 1. The parameter s was held constant across experiments, but it was necessary to change b (as well as ) between experiments, resulting in two free parameters for Experiment 2. The change in b can be justified by the generally slower RTs in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1. There were six degrees of freedom in the data for each experiment (hit rate; false alarm rate; RTs to hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections). The parameter values are shown in Table 1, and the model results for RTs are shown in Figure 2.\nIt can be seen that all of the model results for the RTs to hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections are within the empirical range. For the recognition task, the model results for the hit and false alarm rates in Experiment 1 were .83 and .17, respectively (Johnston et al.\u2019s, 1985, hit rate .70, 95% CI .04; false alarm rate .21, 95% CI .04). In Experiment 2, the model hit and false alarm rates were .58 and .42, respectively (Johnston et al.\u2019s, 1985, hit rate .57, 95% CI .04; false alarm rate .29, 95% CI .04). Although the fits for two of the four hit and false alarm rates were outside of the empirical range, the crucial aspect of these results is that the model predicted RT(false alarms) RT(miss) when recognition was high (in Experiment 1), and RT(false alarm) RT(miss) when recognition was low (in Experiment 2).\nFurthermore, Johnston et al. (1985) also reported that the fluency effect (i.e., shorter RTs for hits and false alarms vs. misses and correct rejections) was attenuated by recognition performance: In Experiment 1, the effect was 310 ms, but in Experiment 2, the effect was lower at 122 ms. The model also predicted this trend: In Experiment 1, the fluency effect was 275 ms, whereas in Experiment 2, the fluency effect was 133 ms.\nWhy does the model predict a reversal in the RTs to misses and false alarms at different levels of recognition performance? To answer this question, we distinguish between two ways in which a new item can have a value of Jr that exceeds C and be classified as a false alarm. First, an item can have a relatively high value of f that exceeds C even after being combined with er (to form Jr in Equation 2). When a false alarm occurs in this way, an item\u2019s RT will tend to be comparably short because its value of f will still be relatively high when its RT is generated (by combining it with ep in Equation 3). Second, an item\u2019s value of f may not exceed C initially, but it does exceed C when it is combined with a high value of er. As explained in the previous Discussion section, when false alarms occur in this way, an item\u2019s RT will not necessarily be comparably short because when the same (relatively average or\nlow) f is used to generate its RT, it is unlikely to again be combined with another large value of noise (ep).\nWhen is low, the distributions of f for old and new items are closer together, and there will be many more items with values of f that initially exceed C (because the mean of the new item distribution is closer to C). So when is low, the first cause of false alarms (above; i.e., high f) will dominate, and false alarms will have comparably short RTs. However, when is high, the distributions of f are further apart, and there will be a much lower number of items that have values of f that initially exceed C (because the mean of the new item distribution is further from C). Thus, when is high, false alarms will mainly arise through the second cause (above; i.e., high er), and the RTs to false alarms will not be comparably short. The reverse process occurs for old items: When is low, misses will have comparably long RTs because many more old items will have values of f that are initially below C. When is high, misses will not tend to have comparably long\nRTs because there will be relatively fewer old items that have values of f that are initially below C. Thus, when is low, RTs to false alarms can be shorter than RTs to misses and vice versa when is high. As was the case in the previous simulation study, the inclusion of the noise parameters in the model is crucial for its capacity to account for this pattern of results.\nIn sum, this simulation study showed that the model predicts that the difference between RTs to misses and false alarms changes as a function of recognition strength, as was observed by Johnston et al. (1985). Thus, this finding also does not seem to compel an account in which priming and recognition are mediated by distinct memorial bases.\nSimulation Study 3: Conroy et al. (2005)\nThe simulation studies reported above have been concerned with priming, recognition, and fluency in healthy adults. Next, we turn to some recent and seemingly compelling evidence for distinct memorial bases of priming and recognition in amnesia. Conroy et al. (2005) investigated the contribution of fluency to recognition judgments in two groups of amnesic patients: One had medial temporal lobe lesions (MTL group, n 2); the other had just hippocampal lesions (H group, n 3). In the study phase of Conroy et al.\u2019s Experiment 1, participants were told that words would be presented but too briefly for conscious perception. In fact, no words were presented. At test, words clarified from a mask, and a recognition judgment was made after every identification. A fluency effect was found for the MTL and H groups (i.e., RT[items judged old] RT[items judged new]), which was comparable in size to a control group (CON group, n 8). In addition, as an alternative method of measuring fluency, Conroy et al. took a median split of the RTs and looked at the percentage of old judgments in each half. More old judgments were made to words identified in the quick half than in the slow half, and this effect did not differ across groups. These results suggest that recognition judgments in amnesic patients and the controls were influenced by fluency of identification.\nThe study phase of Experiment 2 was genuine: Words were presented, and participants read them aloud. The test phase of Experiment 2 was the same as Experiment 1 except that the stimuli were old or new. Relative to the control group, the H group was impaired at recognition, and performance in the MTL group was very close to chance. Despite this impairment in recognition, amnesic patients showed levels of fluency and priming (faster RTs for old than new words) that were comparable with the CON group.\nTo the extent that fluency can give rise to a feeling of familiarity and act as a basis of recognition (as suggested by, e.g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Mandler, 1980), Conroy et al. (2005) reasoned that fluency from priming should contribute to recognition in amnesia, yet clearly this was not the case. In a further test of this hypothesis, Conroy et al. derived an estimate of recognition for each group, given the observed magnitude of fluency and priming. They found that the estimate of recognition was much lower than was actually observed, suggesting that fluency from priming did not contribute to recognition (see also Poldrack & Logan, 1997, for a related finding). This, coupled with the dissociation between fluency and priming on the one hand and recognition on the other in amnesia, led Conroy et al. to argue for the independence of the memorial bases of priming and recognition (see also Stark & Squire, 2000).\nIs it necessary to interpret the results from Conroy et al. (2005) with a multiple-systems view, or can they be explained by a single-system account? Accordingly we attempted to simulate their findings with the single-system model. Furthermore, one of the MTL patients in Conroy et al.\u2019s study, E. P., showed priming in the absence of recognition (e.g., Conroy et al., 2005; Hamann & Squire, 1997), presenting an additional challenge for the model.\nHow can the effects of amnesia be simulated with the model? We simulated the performance of amnesic patients in Conroy et al.\u2019s (2005) Experiments 1 and 2 by assuming that, relative to controls, there is a larger amount of noise in the encoded memory signal and also in the assessment of that signal. More specifically, the values of f and r were greater for our simulations of the amnesic groups than the control group; the values of these parameters were also associated with the severity of the amnesia such that they were greater in the more severe MTL group than the H group. In more psychological terms, the greater value of f in amnesic patients represents greater variability in the degree to which an item resonates with an underlying memory representation at test. The psychological meaning of r can be described as follows: The addition of er to f in Equation 2 is, in fact, formally equivalent to adding er to the decision criterion C.\n6 Signal detection modelers have added variability to the decision criterion as far back as Wickelgren (1968) and more recently to simulate the receiver-operating characteristic slope of remember\u2013know judgments (Wixted & Stretch, 2004). In this sense, a greater value of r in amnesia represents a greater amount of variability in the placement of the decision criterion from item-to-item, relative to controls.7\nOthers have also modeled amnesic performance by introducing greater amounts of noise into their simulations: For example, using the retrieving-effectively-from-memory modeling framework, Malmberg, Zeelenberg, and Shiffrin (2004) simulated the effects of Midazolam-induced amnesia on recognition by assuming that the storage of memory traces is noisier in a Midazolam group than a control group. By varying the parameter c (the probability that an item gets stored accurately) between groups, they were able to reproduce patterns of results that had previously been taken as evidence for a dual-process account of recognition memory.\nThe following simulations were carried out in a similar manner to Simulation Studies 1 and 2 except that for Experiment 2, f depended on whether an item was old or new, whereas in Experiment 1, all item values came from a single (new item) distribution. The CON group data from Experiment 2 were chosen as a point of departure for these simulations because these results bear the most resemblance to the previous simulation studies (i.e., normal adult participants who performed at levels greater than chance in priming and recognition). There were four free parameters for the simulation of the CON group data: p, s, , and b. The values of the parameters are shown in Table 1. Changes in p and s from the previous simulations were necessary to characterize the ensuing effects of Conroy et al.\u2019s (2005) different clarification task on RTs; that is, there is bound to be greater variability in RTs as a result of the longer clarification duration used (11 s; requiring an increase in p), and priming/fluency effects in general were larger than in the previous simulated studies (requiring an increase in s). Changes in the b parameter across groups can be justified simply by the different baseline levels of responding in each of the groups (e.g., the H group produced the fastest RTs overall, and therefore b is lowest here). The parameter values of p, s, and were then set for\nthe simulation of the MTL and H groups of this experiment. To then simulate the increased noise associated with the encoding and assessment of the memory signal in amnesia relative to the CON group, we varied f and r according to the severity of amnesia (greater for the MTL group). There were eight degrees of freedom in the data for each condition (RTs to judged old and new items, RTs to actual old and new items, percent correct in recognition, d for recognition, and the percentage of items judged old in the fast and slow identification medians).\nWe simulated the data using the same number of trials as in the experiments (40 trials per old\u2013new stimulus type in Experiments 1 and 2) and using 10,000 simulated participants. The simulation results for priming, fluency, and recognition for Experiment 2 are shown in Figure 3. The error bars for the CON data are 95% confidence intervals (estimated from Conroy et al., 2005), and those for the MTL and H data are the range of data from the patients in those groups (estimated from Conroy et al., 2005; the range was used because of the limited amount of participant data in the MTL and H groups). It can be seen from Figure 3 that the model results lie within these intervals for all data points in Experiment 2 and that the model gives very close fits to the (mean) RTs for actual old\u2013new and judged old\u2013new items as shown in Figure 4 (where error bars are unknown).\nConroy et al. (2005) also analyzed their recognition data with d . These results and those of the simulations are presented in Table 2. It can be seen that there is a very close correspondence between the data and simulation results.\nIn Experiment 2, Conroy et al. (2005) also looked at whether a fluency effect was present within the subset of items that were new (i.e., whether RT[false alarm] RT[correct rejection]). The CON group did not show this fluency effect for new items (false alarms: 8,839 ms; correct rejections: 8,831 ms), but the MTL group did (false alarms: 9,180 ms; correct rejections: 9,706 ms). Conroy et al. took this finding to mean that recognition was primarily based on declarative memory in healthy adults (i.e., that responding was not based on fluency), but that declarative memory did not affect fluency-based responding in the MTL group (because the declarative memory necessary for recognition was lacking). (Conroy et al., 2005, did not report these results for the H group.) Consistent with Conroy et al.\u2019s (2005) data, the model also predicted that there would be a large fluency effect for new items in the MTL group (false alarms: 9,182 ms; correct rejections: 9,767 ms), but contrary to Conroy et al., the model predicted that there would be a fluency effect\u2014albeit a smaller one\u2014for new items in the CON group (false alarms: 8,505 ms; correct rejections: 8,861 ms). We return to this difference between the prediction of the model and the result of Conroy et al. in the Discussion section.\nAs found by Conroy et al. (2005), the model predicted that a greater percentage of items identified quickly (items with RTs less than the median) would be judged old than items identified slowly (items with RTs greater than the median). These results are pre-\n6 We are grateful to John Dunn for pointing this out. 7 We could have equally assumed that p is greater in amnesic patients relative to controls. However, increasing p would have resulted in little quantitative change in the simulation results, and the qualitative pattern of results would not have been crucially altered. Therefore, p is kept constant across simulations of the amnesic and control groups.\nsented in Table 3, and again it can be seen that the simulation results are comparable with those of Conroy et al.\nTo estimate the role of fluency in recognition judgments, Conroy et al. (2005) asked what recognition performance would have been had all of the items from the quick median half been judged old and all of those in the slow median half been judged new. These results are presented in Table 4. The low estimates of percentage correct and d were taken as evidence that even if judgments were entirely based on RTs, the RTs could not have been a strong cue for recognition accuracy. A striking finding is that when we performed the same analysis on our simulated data, the estimates of recognition were also comparably low (see Table 4).\nConroy et al. (2005) then conducted an analysis that was intended to give an estimate of the contribution of fluency from priming to recognition. This involved calculating an estimate of percentage correct based on the magnitude of the priming and fluency effects for old and new words (for details, see Conroy et al., 2005, p. 19). The recognition percentage correct estimates for each group are presented in Table 5. These low estimates were taken to indicate that priming and fluency do not significantly contribute to recognition and that recognition must therefore be based on some other memorial source. Again, we performed the same analysis on the simulated data, the results of which are also presented in Table 5. The percentage correct estimates were also very low. Thus, the low levels of recognition accuracy estimated\nfrom the fluency effects calculated by Conroy et al. are not inconsistent with a model in which a single memory strength variable mediates priming and recognition. Because this variable is subjected to independent sources of noise for each task, it can appear as if there is a lack of relationship between priming and recognition, even though they are driven by the same memory strength signal.\nAlthough our primary concern was to simulate the results of Experiment 2, further support for the robustness of the model was sought by applying it to Experiment 1. For all groups, the same parameter values were retained from simulation of Experiment 2, except for , which was decreased from 0.37 to 0 (because there was no study phase and therefore no influence of memory at test in Experiment 1). The model results for the fluency effects in each group, and also for the RT values from which they were derived, are presented with Conroy et al.\u2019s (2005) data in Figure 5. With the exception of the fluency effect for the MTL group, all the model results lie within the range of results observed by Conroy et al.\nIn Experiment 1, Conroy et al. (2005) also found that more old judgments were made to words identified in the quick half than in the slow half, and this effect did not differ significantly across groups. These results are presented with the simulation results in Table 6. This shows that the model predicts fluency effects for all groups even when all items at test are new."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The model presented here reproduces the dissociations between priming, recognition, and fluency in amnesia reported by Conroy et al. (2005). By assuming that there is a larger degree of noise in\nthe encoding and assessment of the memory signal in amnesic patients than controls, the model predicted fluency and priming effects for the amnesic groups that were comparable with controls, despite impaired recognition in the H group relative to the CON group, and near chance recognition in the MTL group. Furthermore, as calculated by Conroy et al., the model also predicted that, even if judgments were based solely on speed of identification, recognition would be low. The same parameter values were then applied to Conroy et al.\u2019s Experiment 1, in which there was no influence of memory, and the model still predicted fluency effects in all three groups of participants.\nConroy et al. (2005) found that the RTs for false alarms were shorter than correct rejections for the MTL group in both experiments, indicating a relationship between fluency and recognition judgments; however, this was only the case for the CON group in Experiment 1, suggesting that the presence of declarative memory interferes with fluency-based responding (in Experiment 2). The model predicted an effect for the CON group in both experiments (likewise for the MTL group). The evidence regarding this discrepancy in the CON data from other studies that have used comparable study/test conditions to Conroy et al. is mixed: Verfaellie and Cermak (1999) also found no difference in RTs for false alarms and correct rejections, whereas other studies have reported a numerical trend for false alarms to be faster than correct rejections (see, e.g., Johnston et al., 1985, 1991; Stark & McClelland, 2000). Indeed, in Experiment 1 of this article, there was a numerical trend for RTs to false alarms to be shorter than those of correct rejections (1,368 ms vs. 1,406 ms) when recognition memory was good.\nIn any case, the difference between the RTs to correct rejections and false alarms in Conroy et al.\u2019s (2005) study was smaller in the CON group than the MTL group ( 8 ms vs. 526 ms). In line with this trend, the model also predicts that this difference is smaller in the CON group than the MTL group (356 ms vs. 585 ms).\nThe model predicted very slightly lower priming effects in the MTL and H groups than the CON group. This is necessarily the case because priming and recognition depend on the same memory source in the model, and variables will therefore tend to have similar effects on performance in each task. This prediction therefore conflicts with the notion that priming is intact in amnesia (e.g., Hamann & Squire, 1997), an issue that has proven controversial (see, e.g., Ostergaard, 1999). It is relevant to note, however, that Verfaellie and Cermak (1999, Experiment 2), whose study has\nmuch in common with Conroy et al. (2005), did find that priming was impaired in amnesic patients relative to controls.\nDespite the fact that priming and recognition are mediated by a common memory source in the model, it predicted a priming effect (of 530 ms) for the MTL group when recognition was, for all practical purposes, no different from chance (53.9% of the items were recognized correctly, d 0.19; see Figure 3). The severely amnesic individual E. P. is reported to perform normally in tests of priming despite chance performance in tests of recognition, and this pattern is typically regarded as compelling evidence for priming and recognition being mediated by multiple memory systems (e.g., Hamann & Squire, 1997; Stark & Squire, 2000). However, as the above simulation results show, this pattern is compatible with the single-system model (see also Kinder & Shanks, 2001): It would be difficult to achieve sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of the magnitude predicted (3.9% greater than chance). Even if it can be convincingly shown that E. P.\u2019s recognition memory has been completely eliminated by his amnesia and yet his priming performance has been untouched (as some have argued), we are still wary about drawing strong conclusions from individual cases and would ideally like to see replications of this pattern in other patients.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe main aim of these studies was to present an alternative interpretation of three results that have been taken as evidence for distinct memory bases for priming and recognition. First, in Experiment 1, we replicated Stark and McClelland\u2019s (2000) observation of priming for old items that were not overtly recognized, and then we showed that this result is predicted by a single-system\nsignal detection model in which one memory source drives priming and recognition. Second, the model was applied to the results of Johnston et al. (1985). As found by Johnston et al., the model predicted slower RTs to false alarms than misses when recognition performance was relatively good, but it predicted that RTs to false alarms would be quicker than RTs to misses when recognition was lower. Third, in Simulation Study 3, by assuming that there is a relatively large degree of noise in the encoding and assessment of the memory signal in amnesia, the model reproduced the pattern of intact fluency and priming on the one hand, and impaired recognition on the other, thus reproducing the dissociation between amnesic patients and controls reported in Conroy et al.\u2019s (2005) study. The results of these simulations suggest that these three types of finding are not necessarily indicative of multiple memory sources in priming and recognition. The simulation results suggest an alternative account to those that propose that distinct memory bases mediate repetition priming and recognition (e.g., Squire, 1994; Wagner & Gabrieli, 1998; Wagner et al., 1997), namely that a single memory source drives priming and recognition.\nThe results also have implications for dual-process accounts of recognition that propose that fluency from priming can contribute to recognition (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Johnston et al., 1991; Mandler, 1980). As shown by Conroy et al. (2005), it is difficult to obtain direct evidence for this notion when one estimates the magnitude of recognition based on the identification of RTs to old and new items. A similar conclusion was reached by Poldrack and Logan (1997): Participants in their study made lexical decision judgments to old or new items and gave a recognition judgment after each decision. Discriminability between old and new items in the lexical decision task was measured with the distance between the standardized RT distributions for old and new items (dRT). Values of dRT were significantly less than the observed values of d for the recognition task and could account for only a small proportion of recognition discrimination, suggesting that fluency (response speed) could not have been the sole factor in recognition judgments. Consistent with these findings, when we estimated recognition performance in the model in a similar manner to Conroy et al., the estimated contribution of fluency was also minimal. From the perspective of the model, the fluency from priming does not make a direct contribution to recognition, but rather a common memory source supports above-chance performance in each task (i.e., there is a common cause rather than a causal chain). Thus, although low estimates of the contribution of fluency to recognition seem to suggest a lack of a relationship between priming and recognition, this result is not inconsistent with a single-system account.\nA limitation of the model concerns the use of fluency as a heuristic in recognition: For example, Johnston et al. (1991) found that when the identification and recognition trials were blocked, rather than interleaved, fluency effects did not occur. This was taken as evidence that interleaving the identification and recognition trials encouraged a reliance on speed of identification as a heuristic. The reason the model does not predict a difference between blocked and interleaved versions of the task is because the same value of f is used to determine an item\u2019s RT and its recognition judgment; in other words, there is a relationship between an item\u2019s RT and its likelihood of being judged old (see Equations 2 and 3). There is much evidence to suggest that other manipulations can affect the probability with which fluency is used as a cue for recognition (e.g., Jacoby & Whitehouse, 1989; Kinder, Shanks, Cock, & Tunney, 2003; Whittlesea et al., 1990), though the model in its current state does not speak to the use of fluency as a heuristic. It has been suggested (e.g., by Levy, Stark, & Squire, 2004) that because manipulations designed to enhance fluency tend to increase the proportion of old judgments to old and new items, such manipulations merely influence decision bias and not recognition accuracy. If this were the case, then the model would be able to account for this quite readily by allowing the decision criterion, C, to vary.\nDissociations between priming and recognition are widely taken as support for a multiple-systems view. For example, in normal adults, levels of processing manipulations have large effects on recognition but much smaller ones on priming (Brown & Mitchell, 1994; Jacoby & Dallas, 1981), and changes in modality between study and test have been shown to produce the opposite pattern\u2014 priming is reduced, but recognition is relatively unaffected. We have already shown that the model can account for the pattern produced by levels of processing manipulations: In another article (Berry, Henson, & Shanks, 2006), the model simulated large effects of an attentional manipulation on recognition but much smaller ones on priming (in a perceptual identification task). However, dissociations\u2014such as the one produced by changes in modality\u2014are more challenging for the model, and the model in its current state does not account for this. However, from a signal detection point of view, once one starts to take into account modality, a single dimension of strength may no longer be appropriate, and a multidimensional approach may be required.\nDouble dissociations have also been reported in patients: Individuals with damage to the right-occipital lobes show impaired priming despite relatively intact recognition, thus showing the reciprocal dissociation to amnesic patients (Gabrieli et al., 1995). Although, again, it is not clear how the model would be able to\naccount for this dissociation, another single-system model, the SRN (Kinder & Shanks, 2003), has been shown to have some success at simulating this pattern. Kinder and Shanks (2003) assumed that individuals with amnesia had a generalized (rather than a specific) learning deficit, whereas individuals with rightoccipital lobe damage had a deficit in visual processing. A double dissociation emerged from the SRN solely because of the way that the assumed nature of the deficits and differences in task procedures interacted with a single underlying memory representation. Moreover, it is relevant to note here that the use of double dissociations to infer distinct systems has been criticized, and their interpretation is widely debated (see, e.g., Dunn & Kirsner, 2003; Plaut, 1995). The findings from the studies that we have looked at in this article have analyzed identification RTs according to the recognition response, and as such, they constitute evidence from a different domain that does not rely on the logic of dissociation (at least in Simulation Studies 1 and 2).\nDoes the model make other predictions to those presented in this article that can be tested? As mentioned above, in Berry, Henson, and Shanks\u2019s (2006) study, by assuming that the variance of the noise associated with the perceptual identification task is greater than that of the recognition task, we showed how the model could simulate large effects of an attentional manipulation at study on recognition while simulating much smaller ones on priming. The model also correctly predicted that the reliability of the recognition task would be consistently greater than that of the priming task (as measured by split-half correlations; cf. Buchner & Wippich, 2000). In normal adults, the model also predicts that the sensitivity of the recognition task will not exceed that of the priming task (e.g., performance on the priming task will not exceed that of the recognition task when compared on the same response metric). This prediction held for all conditions of Berry, Henson, and Shanks. Similarly, Berry, Shanks, and Henson (2006) found that even when priming and recognition tasks were completely comparable in every way except for task instructions, and recognition was at chance, the sensitivity of the priming task never exceeded that of the recognition task.\nMoreover, in unpublished simulations, we have applied the model to a modified CID-R paradigm in which, after every two identification trials, the items from those trials are re-presented for a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) recognition judgment. Because the model assumes that greater values of f will lead to faster identification RTs and also to a greater likelihood of an old judgment, it predicts that the item judged old on a 2AFC trial will also tend to have the shorter identification RT. The single-system model makes this prediction, regardless of whether the items presented on the 2AFC trial are both new, both old, or one is old and the other is new. Different predictions are made by a \u201cdual-system\u201d version of the model, which is identical in all respects to the single-system model except that after an item\u2019s identification RT has been calculated, another value of f is sampled to calculate Jr. In other words, the value of f is different for priming and recognition (albeit sampled from the same distribution). In contrast to the single-system model, this dual-system version of the model predicts that on 2AFC trials in which both items are old or both are new, the item judged old will not tend to have the shorter identification RT. However, on 2AFC trials in which one item is old and the other is new, it predicts, like the single-system model, that the\nitem judged old will also tend to have the shorter identification RT (because of priming). This highlights an advantage of the approach we are using, which is that quantitative predictions of single- and dual-system versions of the model can be tested empirically.\nFinally, another advantage of the approach that we are advocating is that it is based on signal detection theory. Signal detection theory is widely accepted as a plausible framework for theorizing about recognition, and this framework has been successful in accounting for a variety of phenomena (although there is debate as to the precise form that a signal detection model should take; e.g., Wixted, 2007, vs. Parks & Yonelinas, 2007). Many models of recognition have been proposed that also include a role for signal detection theory (e.g., Gillund & Shiffrin, 1984; Hintzman, 1984, 1988; Murdock, 1982, 1983). However, these models have not been used to also account for priming (one exception is the retrieving-effectively-frommemory modeling framework; see Schooler, Shiffrin, & Raaijmakers, 2001). Kinder and Shanks\u2019s (2001, 2003) model has been applied to priming and recognition but has never been shown to be compatible with a broad range of recognition phenomena. From a single-system perspective, a logical step is to use signal detection theory to also account for priming; we have tried to do this here by assuming that the same memory strength variable that drives recognition also drives priming. The model that we propose is simple, is based on general principles, and is relatively easy to implement.\nIn conclusion, the results from studies discussed in this article that have been taken as evidence for distinct memory bases of priming and recognition are not inconsistent with a single-system account in which one memory signal drives priming and recognition and is subjected to different nonmemorial sources of noise. We regard it as important that before a multiple-systems approach is advanced, researchers need to show that a single-system model is unable to account for their data patterns or has critical limitations. Indeed, in a future project we plan to conduct a formal comparison of single- and dual-system versions of the model. Whether or not the model stands up to further tests, we do believe it is an important step forward to have a formal, quantitative model of priming, recognition, and fluency to use as a benchmark.\nReferences\nBerry, C.

Philip Beaman University of Reading\nIan Neath and Aime\u0301e M. Surprenant Memorial University of Newfoundland\nMany models of immediate memory predict the presence or absence of various effects, but none have been tested to see whether they predict an appropriate distribution of effect sizes. The authors show that the feature model (J. S. Nairne, 1990) produces appropriate distributions of effect sizes for both the phonological confusion effect and the word-length effect. The model produces the appropriate number of reversals, when participants are more accurate with similar items or long items, and also correctly predicts that participants performing less well overall demonstrate smaller and less reliable phonological similarity and word-length effects and are more likely to show reversals. These patterns appear within the model without the need to assume a change in encoding or rehearsal strategy or the deployment of a different storage buffer. The implications of these results and the wider applicability of the distributionmodeling approach are discussed.\nKeywords: memory modeling, individual differences, immediate recall\nA number of phenomena are assumed to typify the functioning of immediate memory, including the acoustic confusion or phonological similarity effect (PSE; reduced recall levels for similar sounding items; Conrad, 1964) and the word-length effect (WLE; reduced recall for words with more syllables; Baddeley, Thomson, & Buchanan, 1975). The PSE, for example, is frequently taken to be the \u201csignature\u201d that indicates the involvement of the phonological store component of the working memory model (although, see Jones, Hughes, & Macken, 2007). The WLE is often associated with the operation of an articulatory rehearsal loop (although, see Lovatt & Avons, 2001; Neath, Bireta, & Surprenant, 2003). Among patient populations, the absence of such effects at the individual level is used as evidence for impairment of particular short-term memory functions (Silveri, Di Betta, Filippini, Leggio, & Molinari, 1998; Vallar & Shallice, 1990). Thus, a reduced PSE is often assumed to reflect the lack of a phonological storage strategy or (in neuropsychological patients) damage to the phonological store. Similarly, a reduced WLE is easily interpreted (e.g., among young children and older adults) as reflecting poor articulatory rehearsal or, again among neuropsychological patients, damage to the articulatory loop.\nAs noted by Logie and colleagues (Della Sala & Logie, 1997; Logie, Della Sala, Laiacona, Chalmers, & Wynn, 1996), both PSEs and WLEs are absent\u2014or even reversed\u2014in the recall protocols of some normally functioning participants, suggesting that although these effects occur in the aggregate or group case traditionally studied within cognitive psychology, they are not necessarily present at the individual level. One purpose of the current work is to determine the distribution of effect sizes observed when standard PSE and WLE experiment methodologies are used. A second purpose is to assess how well the feature model (Nairne, 1990) accounts for the observed interindividual variation. Although Melton (1967) noted that a theory of memory must, perforce, include a theory of individual differences in the processes specified by the theory, few models of immediate memory actually explore these processes in any detail (Lewandowsky & Heit, 2006).\nThe magnitude of some effects could vary among the population for theoretically interesting reasons, and any candidate model of the effects in question should track this variation. Both effects have been linked to particular strategies. For example, it has been suggested that the perceived difficulty of an immediate verbal memory task might result in the abandonment of a phonological code in favor of other, nonphonological, coding mechanisms (see the debate between Baddeley & Larsen, 2007, and Jones et al., 2007). Similarly, participants who more effectively use rehearsal might show both superior overall performance and a larger effect of word length than participants who do not use rehearsal, a line of argument used in the developmental literature to differentiate the performance of younger children from that of older children and adults (Hitch & Halliday, 1983).\nA previous study (Logie et al., 1996) reported reliable interindividual differences in PSEs and WLEs using a span technique to establish the incidence of variation within a normal population and\nC.

However, span scoring is less sensitive than serial recall or reconstruction, which record multiple errors per trial compared with span scoring\u2019s all-or-none system. Additionally, Logie et al. (1996) interpreted their data in terms of a variety of strategy choices among their participants, on the basis of postexperimental questioning. There are a number of reasons to question this interpretation. First, Logie et al. provided no indication of how strategies were identified and classified, nor did they provide any indication of interrater reliability in classifying strategies. Second, post hoc introspective accounts are subject to a number of biases and must be interpreted cautiously. Third, even if strategies are both reported and classified correctly, covariation of strategy and effect size constitutes a correlational, not necessarily a causal, relationship. Fourth, when span was included as a covariate, the \u201ceffect\u201d of strategies reported by Logie et al. drops considerably. A factor other than strategy choice must therefore be responsible for the majority of the variation reported. Finally, although not formally analyzed, Logie et al.\u2019s results show a distribution of effect sizes that appears normal, or close to normal, not the bimodal distribution one might expect from a mix of phonological and nonphonological encoding strategies. Given these issues, as well as more recent theoretical work questioning the role of these strategies (Hulme et al., 2006; Hulme, Surprenant, Bireta, Stuart, & Neath, 2004; Nairne, 2002), we examine whether a nonstrategy account of interindividual variation provides a viable model of the data. This approach parallels other modeling studies showing that strategy as an explanatory construct may not be required as frequently as often assumed (Brown & Hulme, 1995; Neath & Nairne, 1995).\nThe Feature Model\nSpace precludes a detailed account of the feature model; the implementation was identical to that used in other simulations (Beaman, 2006; Neath, 1999, 2000; Neath & Nairne, 1995; Neath & Surprenant, 2007). Here, we provide only an overview. The basic idea is that recall is guided by a set of cues in primary memory (PM), which are either more or less effective in identifying the target item or event from a search set defined within secondary memory (SM). Cues do not decay but are subject to interference. Anything that makes the cues less effective (e.g., similarity between the representations of to-be-recalled targets) or degrades the cues such that two or more targets could fit the profile specified by the cues renders recall less accurate.\nFormally, items in SM and cues in PM are presumed to comprise vectors of modality-independent and modality-dependent features. For simulation purposes, feature values are randomly generated. The absolute number of features is largely irrelevant in determining the major properties of the model (see, e.g., Figure 4.8 of Neath & Surprenant, 2003). The main source of interference in the model is feature overwriting: If feature x of item n 1 is the same as feature x of item n, then feature x of item n is lost, or overwritten, and returns a value of 0.\nThe relative number of accurate features available to cue the item in SM dictates recall performance. The difference between the target SM item and its PM cue is calculated according to Equation 1. The value Mk is equal to 1 if the feature at position k of PM cue i does not match the feature at the corresponding\nposition of SM representation j and 0 otherwise. The number of mismatches across the features is summed in the numerator of Equation 1. The value N is the number of features in each of the vectors, and a is a scaling parameter representing overall level of attention.\ndij a Mk N . (1)\nThe difference between the PM and SM items is transformed to provide a similarity metric (Equation 2).\ns(i,j) e dij. (2)\nThe probability that a particular secondary memory trace SMj will be \u201csampled\u201d given a particular primary memory cue PMi is given by a similarity-based choice rule (Equation 3).\nP SMj PMi s(i,j)\nl 1\nn\ns i,l\n. (3)\nThe probability of recovering a sampled item is then given by Equation 4, where c is a constant and r is the number of times the sampled item has already been recalled on this trial. This equation and the r parameter are used to reduce the likelihood of recalling the same item on multiple occasions, which participants avoid doing even when the same item is repeated within the to-berecalled list.\nPr e cr. (4)\nIn the feature model, order information is represented as a point in multidimensional space and this point can perturb (or drift) along the relevant dimension as described by Estes\u2019s (1972) equations. The probability that a cue\u2019s encoded representation will perturb along the position dimension during a particular time interval is given by the parameter (which is held constant at .05); perturbations are equally likely in either direction. The probability that an item, I, will occupy a particular position, p, during the next time interval, t 1, is given by Equation 5:\nIp,t 1 1 Ip,t 2 Ip 1,t 2 Ip 1,t . (5) For the first and last positions, a slightly different equation is used to reflect the assumption that an item cannot perturb to a position outside the list. For the first position,\nI1,t 1 1 2 I1,t 2 I2,t . (6) For the last position, n,\nIn,t 1 1 2 In,t 2 In 1,t . (7) Recall begins by determining, for each cue in PM, which was most likely in Position 1 originally. To recall the second item, the model uses the cue that was most likely in Position 2, and so on (see Neath, 1999, for more details).\nThe feature model produces PSEs primarily through Equation 3. Phonologically similar items are represented by vectors that have a higher number of features (both modality independent and modality dependent) with the same value. This has the net effect of increasing the value of the denominator and thus reducing the probability of retrieving the appropriate item (see Nairne, 1990).\nThe WLE is explained by assuming that the more complex an item, the more segments it contains, and therefore the more chance there is of an error (see Neath & Nairne, 1995). Long words are typically more complex than short words and therefore have more segments, and so there is more chance of making an error when assembling the segments for output (Caplan, Rochon, & Waters, 1992). If a segment error occurs, there is a loss of feature information, implemented by setting half of the modality-independent features to 0 values (see Neath & Nairne, 1995, for full details).\nThe feature model was chosen to model distributions of PSEs and WLEs for three reasons. First, it has been shown to account well for both the main PSE and WLE data. Second, the model as currently implemented does not include rehearsal or any other more complex strategy. Any predictions of the model must therefore be strategy independent and not reliant on the use of a particular maintenance or rehearsal strategy. Third, the model lends itself to a type of simulation previously used by Hintzman (1986, 1988) and more recently used by Cooper, Schwartz, Yule, and Shallice (2005) in which one run of the model is seen as analogous to one experimental trial for a real participant. In an experiment, the experimenter averages over a series of trials to produce the mean performance of a particular real participant. This is repeated for each participant to produce mean group performance. Similarly, a modeler can average over an equivalent number of simulation runs to produce the mean performance of what Hintzman (1986, p. 416) termed a \u201cpseudo-subject.\u201d Averaging over a group of pseudo-subjects is thus equivalent to averaging over a group of real participants and permits the same types of analyses.\nWith this type of modeling, intraindividual variability among pseudo-subjects is the result of random variation in generating the values of the feature vectors and represents randomly fluctuating variation of neural firing patterns accompanying the encoding of each item (see Nesselroade & Salthouse, 2004, for a discussion of whether intraindividual variability should be viewed as noise). In contrast, interindividual variability is the consequence of different starting parameters for each pseudo-subject and is held constant for each pseudo-subject.\nImmediate Memory Effects\nPSEs and WLEs are defined by a general diminution in performance rather than a qualitative change in results (except where they interact with other factors, e.g., Jones et al., 2007; Neath & Nairne, 1995). We report drops in performance associated with the experimental manipulations by participants and compare these to the predictions derived from running the model across a sample of pseudosubjects. Following Logie et al. (1996) and Neath, Farley, and Surprenant (2003), effects are presented in terms of the difference between the two conditions divided by performance in the control or standard condition (for further discussion, see Neath & Surprenant, 2007). For example, in what follows the PSE is given by\nPSE D S\nD , (8)\nwhere D is mean performance in the dissimilar condition and S is mean performance in the similar condition. Similarly, the WLE is given by\nWLE Sh L\nSh , (9)\nwhere Sh is mean performance in the short words condition and L is mean performance in the long words condition.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 compares recall performance of lists of phonologically similar items with recall of lists of dissimilar items. The major difference between this and other published studies is the number of participants."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. A total of 100 Purdue University undergraduates who were native speakers of American English participated in exchange for course credit.\nStimuli. The to-be-remembered items were 64 one-syllable words used by Surprenant, Neath, and LeCompte (1999) to study PSEs. An example similar list is vote, boat, goat, float, note, and coat. An example dissimilar list is break, sick, vote, greet, rat, and fun. Each word appeared in both similar and dissimilar lists (e.g., vote in the above example). Lists were randomized such that participants saw the same words but in different random orders.\nProcedure. Participants were informed that we were interested in how accurately they could remember the order in which a series of words had been presented. Each word was shown in uppercase, center justified, for 1.5 s in the middle of the screen in 20-point Helvetica font. After the final word was shown, six response buttons became active and were labeled with the six words in alphabetical order. The participants were asked to indicate the presentation order by clicking on appropriately labeled buttons using the mouse. For example, if they thought the first word was break, they should click on the button labeled break first. If they thought the third word was vote, they should click on the button labeled vote third. Participants received 20 lists, half with dissimilar and half with similar items, and were informed they could take rest breaks at any point. The order of dissimilar and similar trials was randomly determined for each participant. Participants were tested individually, and an experimenter remained in the room to ensure compliance with the instructions."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Participants\u2019 order reconstruction (calculated as mean proportion of items in the correct order) was more accurate on dissimilar (.75) than similar (.61) lists, the typical result. This pattern was confirmed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), F(1, 99) 101.89, MSE 0.052, p .05. The mean PSE was .169 (lower quartile .068; median .178; upper quartile .273; SD .195; range .833 to .625), and the distribution did not differ from normal (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Z 0.815, ns). Seven participants performed more accurately on similar than dissimilar words, and 9 showed no difference.\nSimulation results are based on 20 runs per pseudo-subject, half with dissimilar and half with similar items, just as with the real participants. Phonological similarity was modeled by setting a random subset of the features to equal values, just as in previous simulations (e.g., Nairne, 1990; Neath, 2000). A full listing of parameters is shown in the Appendix.\nTwo types of models were compared. For the \u201cmean\u201d model, all parameters were identical for all pseudo-subjects. Any variability in output is due entirely to the particular random processes within the feature model. In contrast, the \u201cvariance\u201d model reflects the observation that different participants vary in their overall level of performance. In the feature model, this is captured by the attention\u2013scaling parameter a. This parameter was initially set to the same starting value for each pseudo-subject but was then increased (or decreased) by an amount determined by sampling randomly from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of four. The resulting value was then used for all simulation runs for that particular pseudo-subject.1\nFigure 1 compares the fits of the two models to various aspects of the data.2 Although both models simulated the main effect (upper panel) and both the proportion PSE and proportion of the sample who showed a reversed effect (lower panel), the mean\nmodel shows insufficient variability (the upper panel shows standard deviation, the lower panel shows standard error), whereas the variance model shows adequate variability.\nOne way to test the extent to which the feature model is really capturing the data is to examine performance in the upper and lower quartiles (see Figure 2). Participants in the upper quartile in the dissimilar condition show the greatest PSE (.21) and the fewest reversals (.04); those in the lower quartile show the smallest PSE (.11) and the most reversals (.24). The results from the variance model (also shown in Figure 2) show the same pattern.\nFinally, it is possible to break the simulation and experimental results down still further and report the data by serial position for each group and each condition. These are shown in Figure 3. Although the ordering of the conditions and the amount of variance are appropriate, the model does not produce sufficiently bowed curves.\nThe experimental results confirm the basic finding of Logie et al. (1996) that not all apparently \u201cnormal\u201d participants show the standard PSE and also provide evidence that variation in the size of the PSE is best described by a normal distribution. This latter finding is what would be expected on the basis of nonstrategic between-participant differences; an account based on two different encoding strategies (phonological and nonphonological) would predict a bimodal distribution. The data go further, however, in indicating that interindividual variation in the size of the PSE is directly attributable to variation in immediate memory capabilities rather than the operation of chance factors. One failing of the model, however, is the insufficient curvature of the serial position curve, particularly in the phonologically similar condition for the top-performing quartile (see Figure 3).\nExperiment 2\nThe second experiment repeats the procedure adopted in Experiment 1, substituting a word length manipulation for a phonological similarity manipulation."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. A total of 100 different Purdue University undergraduates who were native speakers of American English participated in exchange for course credit.\nStimuli. The stimuli were 80 long (three to five syllables) and 80 short (one syllable) words from the study by LaPointe and Engle (1990).

Each word was\n1 The parameter a was set to 10 in the mean model and 13.5 in the variance model. The reason for this change was to keep the overall level of performance constant.\n2 As in other simulations with the feature model (e.g., Nairne, 1990; Neath, 1999, 2000; Neath & Nairne, 1995; Neath & Surprenant, 2007), there is no attempt to obtain the best possible quantitative fits. Rather, the goal is to show the correct qualitative pattern of results by changing only those parameters associated with the particular psychological processes implicated.

The list length was eight, and thus eight response buttons were used. Participants received 40 lists, half with short and half with long items.

The mean WLE was .16 (lower quartile .060; median .158; upper quartile .284; SD .162; range .30 to .55), and the distribution did not differ from normal (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Z 0.428, ns). Thirteen participants showed a reversal, and 3 showed no effect.\nPseudo-subjects were presented with the same number and structure of lists. The length manipulation was simulated as in previous work (e.g., Neath & Nairne, 1995, pp. 432\u2013433). It was assumed that short words consisted of a single segment, long words had seven segments, and the probability of a segment error was .10 for both word lengths. Individual variation was modeled as in Experiment 1. A full listing of parameters is shown in the Appendix.\nFigure 4 shows the results of separate simulation runs of sets of pseudo-subjects, using the same procedure as Experiment 1. Again, good fits were obtained for both the mean and variance models, with the latter better reproducing the amount of variability seen in the data.\nWe again examined how overall performance level affects the appearance of the WLE by once again comparing the upper and lower quartile of the human participants and pseudo-subjects. Figure 5 shows that like the PSE in the previous experiment, there is a trend toward a larger WLE (.19) and fewer reversals (.04) in the better performing group and a smaller WLE (.13) and more reversals (.16) in the lower performing group in both the data and in the predictions of the model. It is important to note that this pattern, predicted by the model, was not obvious a priori.\nSerial position curves for the two groups are shown in Figure 6. This figure demonstrates that the model again underpredicts the curvature of the serial position curve. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of PSE and WLE reversals in the experimental and simulation data from the variance model.\nThe results of this study reveal a similar pattern of effect by performance interaction with word length as appeared for phonological similarity. This relationship also held for the simulation model, despite the different loci for the two effects within the model. In Experiment 2, which made use of longer list lengths, the failure of the model to produce the appropriate degree of serial position curvature was also more noticeable, in particular the lack of primacy over the first two serial positions.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe two experiments reported here confirm that the general pattern of results within Logie et al.\u2019s (1996) span data are replicable when the procedure is changed to one more commonly used in immediate memory experiments. A sizable minority of participants either failed to show or showed reverse PSEs and WLEs. These zero and negative effects were, nonetheless, predicted by a model designed to show detrimental effects of phonological similarity and word length. Furthermore, the model successfully accounts for these data and other measures of variability within the data without any qualitative changes in its operation. Previously, it has been suggested that a diminished PSE or WLE reflects a change in strategy (e.g., lack of rehearsal; Baddeley & Larsen, 2007; Logie et al., 1996) or a move to a different form of storage (Baddeley, 2000). This line of reasoning is also used in the neuropsychological literature to relate memory processes to structure (e.g., Silveri et al., 1998). The simulations reported here demonstrate that a merely quantitative change is sufficient to produce such variation in both effect sizes, with the PSE and WSE being associated with high performance levels. However, two potential criticisms might be leveled at the current study. The first is that the simulations fit only statistical noise and, as such, are both (a) theoretically uninteresting and (b) not unique to the model we describe. The second criticism is that any model can provide a better fit to the data if another parameter is provided and that the current simulations do little more than demonstrate this fact.\nRandom Variation and Post Hoc Parameter Fitting\nIndividual differences in the size of the PSE and WLE are normally distributed. A normal distribution of effect size with a similar inci-\ndence of null and reverse effects also results if both interindividual and intraindividual variations are provided by the randomly fluctuating values generated for the feature vectors. This reinforces the central message of this study, that strategy change is not necessary to account for reduction in the PSE and the WLE. In actuality, however, one\nwould expect some reliable difference in performance between Participant A and Participant B, which requires manipulation of a parameter between pseudo-subjects, as reported for the simulations accompanying Experiments 1 and 2, to provide the necessary intraindividual consistency. There is, however, a complication.\nAs the correlation between components of a difference increases (such as when the component scores are provided by the same individual or dependent on the same parameter within a pseudosubject), the intraindividual reliability of the difference score itself decreases (Johns, 1981; Peter, Churchill, & Brown, 1993). Ironically, the observation of an association at the interindividual level between memory performance and effect size is the feature that could potentially cast doubt on the reliability of the intraindividual association. The model as reported clearly shows attenuated effects among low ability pseudo-subjects. However, because of the relatively small number of data points per individual in the experimental data it is unrealistic to test, at an intraindividual level, the reliability of the link between memory ability and PSEs and WLEs. Despite this shortcoming, and as noted earlier, a relation between memory ability and memory effects at either intraindividual or interindividual levels militates against the suggestion that reductions in the PSE and the WLE are necessarily consequences\nof altered strategy\u2014unless that strategy can be shown to be the most effective of any adopted. The feature model provides an alternative, and arguably more parsimonious, mechanism, but further research is clearly necessary to fully test the viability of this alternative mechanism.\nThe next points to consider are whether the predictions of the feature model are unique to that model, and whether it accounts for the data by something other than post hoc parameter fitting. It is possible that many models could account for variation within an experimental sample. However, no such results have yet been reported, and it is incumbent on those who wish to claim that their models produce the appropriate distributions to demonstrate that interindividual variation is within their capabilities. The more serious point is whether a model of quantitative variation accounts for the systematic relationship between memory ability and the effect sizes in any theoretically satisfying way. The simulations of the feature model show that the PSE and the WLE are expected to\nvary as a function of quantitative changes in participants\u2019 abilities, a prediction that was confirmed by examination of the experimental data. But is this a unique feature of the model or a piece of post hoc parameter fitting?\nThe fit to the mean and variance scores from our participant samples (upper panels of Figures 1 and 5) were produced by a set of parameters appropriate to the performance levels observed within the experimental data set. Crucially, the subsequent splitting of the samples into high- and low-performance quartiles was carried out only after these parameters had been determined and were not free to vary. All simulation results beyond this point (Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6 and the lower panels of Figures 1 and 4) comprise a novel, and genuine, prediction of a positive relationship between memory capability and PSEs and WLEs. The reason for this pattern, which was not obvious prior to simulation, is the specific role of the attention parameter in magnifying the distance score between mismatches and potential matches (Equation 1). The attention parameter was used to simulate interindividual vari-\nation because it is the only parameter within the model that varies over all performance levels to a significant degree and hence is the only viable source of systematic interindividual variation.3 Varying this factor between individuals is a necessary requirement to enable systematic interindividual differences, but the factor was neither new nor free to vary once an appropriate distribution of effect sizes was established. The implication for high- and lowperformance subgroups represented a real, and potentially falsifiable, prediction that was, however, confirmed when tested against experimental data. It is not clear that varying a single parameter within other models would, of necessity, produce the same pattern of results, although this can be definitively determined only by extensive simulation studies (by varying the threshold, the primacy gradient, or the level of Gaussian noise within the primacy model; e.g., see Page & Norris, 1998). It is also unclear what parameters\n3 The model used here was the variance model.\nmight provide a theoretically motivated basis for interindividual differences (as the choice of potential parameters within the primacy model example indicates) or whether it would be necessary to vary different parameters independently to replicate the memory by effect interactions for PSEs and WLEs. In experimental terms, a single quantitative variable within the model we examined necessarily alters the pattern of immediate memory effects observed and is by itself sufficient to cause a qualitative shift in the appearance of PSEs and WLEs. This observation has a number of implications.\nGenerally, it suggests that purely quantitative variations in some performance factor at either intraindividual or interindividual levels could frequently appear within the experimental data as qualitative shifts in performance characteristics. This reinforces the idea that quantitative computational simulations are a productive method for testing (often implicit) theoretical assumptions that might otherwise go unchallenged or unrecognized (Lewandowsky, 1993). More specifically, the results imply that neither a shift in rehearsal patterns nor the deployment of particular storage buffers (Baddeley & Larsen, 2007) is necessary to explain reductions in\nthe WLE and the PSE among individuals undertaking immediate memory tasks. The feature model predicts both effects using a single PM and no maintenance rehearsal. It is not possible to convincingly show an absence of strategy, so it is incumbent on those who would support the strategy shift idea to show why it is needed to account for differences in effect size. Our data, and that of Logie et al. (1996), show that most, if not all, of the variation in effect sizes can be accounted for directly on the basis of performance characteristics rather than indirectly by performance-based strategy shifts.\nReferences\nBaddeley, A.

Dodson, James Darragh, and Allison Williams University of Virginia\nWhen expectations and stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they spontaneously create distorted and illusory recollections that are consistent with these expectations. Participants studied doctor (physician)related and lawyer-related statements that were presented by 2 different people. When informed, on a subsequent source memory test, (i.e., of who presented what) that one of the study sources was actually a doctor and the other source was a lawyer, there was a strong tendency to attribute the test items in a stereotype-consistent manner. In 3 experiments, participants frequently reported recollecting specific details, such as via \u201cremember\u201d judgments, to justify their stereotype-consistent but incorrect responses. These experiments rule out explanations involving either the misattribution of strong familiarity or differences in the bias to making remember responses as accounts for the illusory source attributions. Instead, the illusory recollections are consistent with the notion that recollective experience is manufactured from both the information in the memory trace and information in the retrieval environment, such as an individual\u2019s expectations, stereotypes, and general knowledge.\nKeywords: source memory, stereotypes, remember, recollection, false memory\nOver the past 30 years, there has been much interest in the influence of stereotypes on memory. Early stereotype studies suggested that when stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they distort recollections of earlier events. For instance, when individuals were told at the time of a recognition test that a previously described character, Betty K., was now living either a heterosexual or a lesbian lifestyle, individuals were likely to incorrectly recognize novel statements that were consistent with their expectations or schema about the designated lifestyle (Snyder & Uranowitz, 1978; see also Dooling & Christiaansen, 1977; Sulin & Dooling, 1974). However, rather than stemming from distorted recollections, subsequent studies noted that the foregoing false alarm results in the Betty K. study likely arose from schema-consistent guessing or response biases (Bellezza & Bower, 1981; Clark & Woll, 1981).\nA large amount of cognitive and social psychological research suggests that when stereotypes are provided at retrieval, they affect memory performance primarily through decision or guessing processes (e.g., Bayen, Nakamura, Dupuis, & Yang, 2000; Hirt, McDonald, & Markman, 1998; Marsh, Cook & Hicks, 2006; Mather, Johnson, & De Leonardis, 1999; Sherman & Bessenoff, 1999). Consider, for example, the influence of stereotypes on source monitoring, that is, on people\u2019s ability to identify the origin of a test item. In a typical procedure, participants see two different individuals present equivalent numbers of doctor (physician)-like (e.g., how long have you had the fever?), lawyer-like (e.g., you face a fine of $500), and neutral (e.g., I love to play tennis) sentences (e.g., Bayen et al, 2000; Hicks & Cockman, 2003). When told during the memory test that one source was actually a doctor and the other source was a lawyer, participants showed\ngood source identification performance for statements that were consistent with the source\u2019s profession and poor performance for statements that were inconsistent with the source\u2019s profession. Essentially, source attributions were biased in favor of responding in a stereotype-consistent manner and against responding in a stereotype-inconsistent manner. Recently, similar patterns of biased memory performance have been observed with stereotypes involving gender, sexual orientation, and race (Marsh et al., 2006; B. K. Payne, Jacoby, & Lambert, 2004).\nThese results are consistent with Johnson, Hashtroudi, and Lindsay\u2019s (1993) source monitoring framework (SMF). The process of identifying the origin of a memory is influenced by various decision processes that are used to assess the kind, amount, and likely source of remembered information (e.g., Dodson & Johnson, 1996; Hicks & Cockman, 2003; Mather et al., 1999; Spaniol & Bayen, 2002). Stereotypes, like other background knowledge, influence how remembered information is evaluated and weighted, so that individuals are biased to respond in a stereotype-consistent manner. Building on the SMF, Bayen and colleagues proposed a probability matching account of the influence of stereotypes on performance (e.g., Spaniol & Bayen, 2002). Specifically, when participants fail to recollect source-identifying information about a test item, they guess a source by responding in a way that matches their sense of the likelihood or probability that the test item is associated with a particular source (e.g., \u201cI can\u2019t remember who presented this item, but I know that Jane\u2019s a doctor. Therefore, she likely presented this doctor-like sentence\u201d), thus producing stereotype-biased performance (Spaniol & Bayen, 2002; see Dodson & Johnson, 1996, for a related view).\nResearchers within social psychology have reached similar conclusions about the influence of stereotypes and expectations on behavior. For instance, Ross and Conway (1986) proposed that in the absence of memory for specific details about past beliefs, individuals infer a past belief on the basis of their current beliefs and their expectations about the stability of this belief across time Chad S.

Moreover, the notion that stereotypes and expectancies dominate performance when individuals fail to recollect specific details has been supported by a number of studies that have degraded people\u2019s ability to remember past events or to engage in controlled processes during retrieval (e.g., Cook, Marsh, & Hicks, 2003; Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Sherman & Bessenoff, 1999). In sum, a prominent view within cognitive and social psychology is that when expectations and stereotypes are activated at retrieval, they influence performance by altering participants\u2019 decision strategies and response biases.\nWe, however, are investigating a different hypothesis about why stereotypes influence performance. According to our retrieval expectation account, stereotypes and expectations increase the likelihood that participants falsely recollect information that is consistent with the stereotype. Our hypothesis draws on Tulving\u2019s (1983) notion of synergistic ecphory. Recollective experience, according to this view, is not just a product of information that has been activated from the memory trace. Instead, the experience of recollection is assembled from activated trace information and from information in the retrieval cue and retrieval environment. Consequently, illusory recollections may occur when information in the retrieval cue is incorporated into the recollective experience. Support for our retrieval expectation hypothesis comes from Hicks and Cockman (2003), who observed that when individuals responded incorrectly, but in a stereotype-consistent manner, they generally assigned high levels of confidence to their errors, contrary to the expectation that if individuals had been guessing, then they would have assigned low confidence to their responses.\nThe hypothesis that recollective experience is a constructive activity that is, to some degree, independent of what was encoded is consistent with the thinking of other theorists (e.g., Brainerd, Payne, Wright, & Reyna, 2003; Higham & Vokey, 2004; Johnson et al., 1993; Lindsay & Kelley, 1996; Schacter et al., 1998; Whittlesea, 2004). For example, Lindsay and Kelley (1996) proposed that \u201ca person\u2019s knowledge and beliefs are another source of thoughts and images coming fluently to mind during attempts to remember, as illustrated in numerous experiments demonstrating schema- or script-based intrusions in recall and recognition\u201d (p. 208). Similarly, Whittlesea (2004) suggested that subjective feelings of remembering or of familiarity depend in part on expectations about what should be remembered in a particular situation.\nMoreover, illusory recollections have been documented as contributing to memory errors in a variety of different paradigms (e.g., Chan & McDermott, 2006; Hannigan & Reinitz, 2001; Higham & Vokey, 2004; Johnson & Raye, 1981; Lampinen, Copeland, & Neuschatz, 2001; Roediger & McDermott, 1995; Zaragoza & Lane, 1994). In the eyewitness testimony paradigm, much evidence shows that participants can actually remember having seen an object that was only suggested to them (e.g., Frost, 2000; Lindsay, 1990; Zaragoza & Lane, 1994). In the DRM paradigm, participants will often claim to recollect specific details about encountering a nonpresented item that happens to be similar to what was studied, such as remembering whether it was presented by a woman or a man (e.g., D. G. Payne, Elie, Blackwell, & Neuschatz, 1996; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Moreover, brain imaging data indicate that true and false memories are sometimes associated with comparable amounts of activity in the same sensory areas, suggesting that they evoke similar subjective experiences (e.g., Schacter & Slotnick, 2004). The foregoing pattern\nof data is consistent with a key tenet of Johnson and colleagues\u2019 SMF that both illusory and true memories are sometimes associated with comparably vivid mental experiences (e.g., Johnson et al., 1993; Mitchell & Johnson, 2000; see also Schacter, Norman, & Koutstaal, 1998).\nThe present research extends this notion of illusory recollections and constructive processes to the question of how stereotypes and expectations influence behavior when these stereotypes/ expectations have been activated at the time of retrieval, a question that has generally been answered in terms of guessing or decision processes. It is important to note that although the retrieval expectation account provides an alternative explanation of the influence of stereotypes, it is not exclusive with respect to the guessing account. That is, we believe that stereotypes affect behavior in multiple ways by influencing decision strategies as well as by creating stereotype-consistent illusory recollections.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 used the following procedure to investigate whether stereotypes create illusory recollections of past events that are consistent with the stereotype. As in the Bayen et al. (2000) and Hicks and Cockman (2003) studies, our participants studied equal numbers of doctor-related, lawyer-related, and neutral sentences that were presented by two different male sources, Tom and Bill. At the time of the source memory test, participants were told that one source was a doctor and the other source was a lawyer. In addition, however, we manipulated the format of the source memory test across participants. Half of the participants initially made an \u201cold\u2013new\u201d judgment and, for items judged old, participants then identified whether Tom or Bill was the source of the item. This procedure is comparable to the typical source test format. For the remaining participants, however, the format of the source memory test differed after they made their initial old\u2013new judgment. For items judged old, these participants then made a source judgment about who presented it during the study phase or they responded that they could not remember the source (i.e., Tom, Bill, or don\u2019t know). Critically, these participants were directed to select Tom or Bill only if they vividly remembered the source that presented the item during the study phase. We used instructions similar to those used to guide participants to make a \u201cremember\u201d response in the remember\u2013know paradigm (e.g., Gardiner & Java, 1993; Tulving, 1985). If participants did not experience a vivid recollection, they were told to respond \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d Above all, participants were instructed not to guess the source. A similar don\u2019t know procedure has been used by others to increase the likelihood that a source attribution is based on a convincing sense of remembering and not on a guess (e.g., Gallo & Roediger, 2003; Lampinen, Neuschatz, & Payne, 1999; Macrae, Schloerscheidt, Bodenhausen, & Milne, 2002; D. G. Payne et al., 1996; Roediger, McDermott, Pisoni, & Gallo, 2004).\nWe expected the standard source test to replicate existing studies and show stereotype-biased performance. This test, however, is unable to discriminate between the guessing and illusory recollection accounts because both processes can yield the same pattern of results. Participants can select an incorrect, but stereotypeconsistent, source because they fail to recollect source information and guess in a stereotype-consistent manner. Alternatively, participants may select the incorrect source because they experience an\nillusory and false recollection. The standard test confounds both of these processes.\nThe modified source test was designed to separate the contributions of guessing and illusory recollections to performance. The guessing hypothesis predicts that there should be no subjective experience of recollection that is associated with incorrect responses. Participants should respond don\u2019t know rather than guess Tom or Bill under the modified test instructions. Responding with don\u2019t know instead of guessing a source greatly reduces or eliminates the pattern of biased source attributions, whereby correctly remembering the source is superior for the stereotype-consistent over the stereotype-inconsistent items. By contrast, the retrieval expectation hypothesis assumes that errors in this paradigm can be recollection based. When participants fail to select the correct source, they will likely choose the incorrect source rather than respond don\u2019t know. In sum, the guessing hypothesis predicts an interaction between the test condition (i.e., the standard test format vs. the modified test format) and the degree of match between the profession of the source and the content of the test statement. The retrieval expectation hypothesis, by contrast, predicts no such interaction.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Sixty-four undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment in exchange for course credit. The participants were randomly assigned to either the modified source test condition (i.e., the source test contains a don\u2019t know response option) or the standard source test condition (i.e., the source test does not contain a don\u2019t know response option)."}, {"heading": "Design and Materials", "text": "The stimulus material, adopted from Bayen et al. (2000), consisted of 192 sentences that were presented visually only. The sentences were divided into three categories on the basis of their content: 64 doctor-related items, 64 lawyer-related items, and 64 professionneutral items. Within each category, there were 32 target sentences (e.g. \u201cDo you have any food allergies?\u201d) and 32 distractor sentences that were identical to the targets, except for the modification of one or two words (e.g. \u201cDo you have any drug allergies?\u201d).\nDuring the study session, 96 items (i.e., 32 target sentences from each category) were presented simultaneously with a color photo of one of two middle-aged Caucasian male faces, labeled Bill or Tom. Each source was paired with 16 sentences from each of the three categories. An additional 6 filler items at the beginning and the end of the study phase were included so as to reduce primacy and recency effects.\nThe test phase consisted of 48 studied items intermixed with 48 distractor items (i.e., new items). Sixteen studied items were from each category, with an equal number associated with the sources Bill and Tom. Moreover, the new distractor items included 16 doctor sentences, 16 lawyer sentences, and 16 neutral sentences. There were an additional 6 practice items at the beginning of the test, which were used to demonstrate the task to participants.\nAll study and test items were presented in a random order, with the constraint that no more than 3 items of a particular type could appear consecutively. The experimental program was created with E-prime\nVersion 1.1 (2002), and the sentences and photos were presented on a 17-in. (43.2-cm) monitor. Finally, across participants, we counterbalanced (a) assignment of sentences to the target and distractor conditions and (b) assignment of sentences to both sources."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "The study items were presented in an incidental manner. Participants were told that they would see a series of sentences, and each would be associated with a person, Bill or Tom, represented by the individual\u2019s picture. They were asked to rate how easily they could imagine the source, either Bill or Tom, saying the sentence. Responses were made on a keyboard with a 5-point Likert scale to identify the difficulty of imagining the sentences. No mention was made of the subsequent memory test. Presentation proceeded at the rate of one sentence every 3.5 s, and participants were asked to make their imageability response before this time elapsed.\nAfter viewing the study items, participants were told about the surprise source memory test. However, before the test began, they were informed that it would be helpful for them to know that one speaker was, in fact, a lawyer, and the other was a doctor. Participants were told that the test would consist of studied sentences as well as new sentences that had not been encountered earlier. All test items appeared visually at the top of the screen, with either the old\u2013new question (i.e., \u201cWas this sentence presented by one of the sources earlier?\u201d) or the source question (i.e., \u201cWho originally presented this statement. Was it Bill or Tom?\u201d) appearing 3 cm below the test item. Pictures of the two sources were shown underneath the source question in the center of the screen with their name and assigned profession (e.g., \u201cBill, lawyer\u201d) below the corresponding picture.\nIn the standard source test condition, participants first determined whether the sentence was old (a previously presented item) or new. For test items receiving a response of old, participants then identified whether the sentence had been paired earlier with Bill or with Tom during the study phase. In the modified source test condition, participants also first determined whether the sentence was old or new. For items receiving a response of old, participants decided whether the item was presented earlier by Bill or by Tom or whether they could not remember (i.e., don\u2019t know). During the test instructions, participants were told that it was important for them to respond Bill or Tom only if they vividly recollected the source presenting the item during the study phase. Moreover, participants were warned not to guess and to select don\u2019t know if they could not distinctly remember who presented the item during the study phase. For every test item, the following reminder not to guess appeared at the bottom of the screen, \u201cIt\u2019s important that you don\u2019t guess. Only respond \u2018Tom\u2019 or \u2018Bill\u2019 if you specifically remember one of them presenting the statement, otherwise respond \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201d In sum, the modified source test and standard source test conditions were identical in every respect except for the don\u2019t know option and its associated instructions. In both conditions, participants progressed through the test at their own pace."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "For all of the analyses we used partial eta squared ( 2) as a measure of effect size.\nTable 1 presents the conditional source scores (CSIM) for the studied items on the modified and the standard source tests. CSIM scores were computed by determining the rate at which individuals attributed an item to the correct source when they made an attribution to Tom or Bill (e.g., Murnane & Bayen, 1996). On the modified test, this source score ignored responses of don\u2019t know and was based only on the proportion of responses of Bill or Tom that were correct. In order to verify that we replicated Bayen et al. (2000) and Hicks and Cockman (2003), we first analyzed the source scores from the standard source test condition. A 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyerlike vs. neutral) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of statement type, F(2, 62) 18.49, MSE .03, p .001, 2 .37; a significant interaction, F(2, 62) 20.52, MSE .112, p .001, 2 .40; and no significant effect of source (F 1). As in previous studies, we observed that source identification rates were higher for neutral statements than for either doctor-related or lawyer-related statements. Critically, however, we replicated the Statement Type Source interaction, whereby participants showed better source identification performance when there was a match (.75) than when there was a mismatch (.38) between the profession of the source and the statement (e.g., the doctor saying doctor-like rather than lawyer-like statements).\nMoreover, we further analyzed the data from the standard source test with the identical multinomial model that was used by Bayen et al. (2000). A four parameter, two-high-threshold model fit the data from each item type condition, G 2(2)s 2.22, G 2(2)critical 5.99. The two notable assumptions of this model are that item recognition is equivalent for items from both sources and that source memory is equal for both sources. Thus, this model explains the foregoing differences in conditional source scores in terms of different biases to guess one source over the other. The g parameter in the model refers to the probability of guessing doctor, with 1 \u2013 g referring to the probability of guessing lawyer. A value of .5, for instance, corresponds to an equivalent bias of guessing doctor or lawyer. As Bayen et al. observed, there were significant differences across the three different statement types in the bias to respond with a particular source. We found that the bias to respond doctor was significantly greater for the doctor-like statements (g .71) than for the neutral statements (g .47), which was signifi-\ncantly different from the bias for the lawyer-like statements (g .27), all G2(1)s 37.81, p\u2019s .0001. Analyses of the remaining parameter values showed no significant differences in source memory (d parameter) between the doctor-related (.26) and lawyer-related (.13) items, although each was significantly lower than source memory for the neutral items (.61), G2(1)s 9.42, ps .01. Lastly, item recognition (D parameter) of the different item types differed significantly across types, G 2(1)s 9.47, ps .01, and exhibited the following pattern: neutral (.55) doctorrelated (.37) lawyer-related (.24). Overall, we replicated Bayen et al. (2000) in nearly every respect.\nAt first glance, it may appear odd that the neutral items are better recognized than the profession statements, particularly as repeated exposure to the doctor and lawyer themes should produce strong memories for the gist of these items. However, all previous studies using these kinds of materials have observed better memory for the neutral items (Bayen et al., 2000; Hicks & Cockman, 2003). There are a variety of reasons for this effect. First, increased memory for the neutral items may reflect an atypicality effect (e.g., Lampinen et al., 2001). As most of the studied items are related to the doctor and lawyer themes, items that violate these themes may be especially salient and memorable.1 Alternatively, as Bayen et al. (2000) noted, the neutral statements may be especially memorable because of some other characteristic about these items.\nWe turn now to our central question, To what extent does the particular test format (i.e., standard vs. modified) affect source identification performance when there is either a match or a mismatch between the content of the statement and the profession of the source? To answer this question, we compared source identification performance (i.e., the proportion of attributions to Tom and Bill that are correct) on the standard and the modified source tests. Note that on the modified test, this source score ignores responses of don\u2019t know and is based only on the proportion of Bill or Tom responses that are correct. This means that on both tests, that score is computed in the same way: the proportion of correct attributions to Bill or Tom given a response of Bill or Tom. A 2 (test condition: standard vs. modified) 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the conditional source scores yielded a significant effect of test condition, F(1, 50) 9.48, MSE .11, p .01, 2 .16, indicating that performance was better overall on the modified test than on the standard test. There was also a significant effect of statement type, F(2, 100) 22.10, MSE .05, p .001, 2 .30, reflecting better source identification performance for the neutral statements than for the doctor-related or lawyer-related statements.\nFinally, there was a significant statement type by source interaction, F(2, 100) 18.70, MSE .12, p .001, 2 .27, whereby performance was superior when the profession of the source and the statement type matched than when they mismatched. Critically, however, the test condition manipulation did not interact with any of the other factors (all Fs 1.24). Thus, in contrast to the predictions of the guessing hypothesis, the opportunity to respond don\u2019t know did not significantly reduce the magnitude of the match\u2013mismatch effect in the modified source test condition as compared with the standard source test condition.\n1 We thank Chuck Brainerd for making this point.\nNote. The modified test includes the option of responding \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d whereas the standard test does not include this option. Parentheses contain the standard error of the mean.\nHowever, the data from the mismatch conditions (i.e., doctorrelated items presented by the lawyer source and lawyer-related items presented by the doctor source) across both test formats suggest that a mixture of decision processes and illusory recollections contributed to performance. Table 1 clearly shows that the conditional source scores on the standard test in the mismatch conditions (.39 and .36) were significantly below chance, where chance was 50%, i.e., t(31) 2.39, p .05. On the modified test, performance in the mismatch conditions was no different from chance. Thus, the modified test appears to have allowed participants to use the don\u2019t know option to filter out guessing biases that would otherwise produce below-chance performance. At the same time, however, chance performance in the mismatch condition on the modified test appears to have been caused by illusory recollections that are consistent with the stereotype.\nTurning to the data from the modified source test, we further investigated whether stereotype information at retrieval creates illusory recollections. The left-hand column of data in Table 2 presents the proportion of all old responses (i.e., recognized items) that were attributed to the incorrect source. Recall that we admonished participants not to guess but to respond with a particular source only when they vividly remembered this source presenting the item during the study phase. Therefore, these incorrect source attributions are presumably based on recollective experience. A 3 (statement type: doctorlike vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the rate of incorrect source attributions revealed a significant effect of statement type, F(2, 62) 8.07, MSE .038, p .01, 2 .21, and a significant statement type by source interaction, F(2, 62) 8.57, MSE .084, p .01, 2 .22. False recollections were much more frequent when there was a mismatch between the content of the statement and the profession of the source (.30) than when there was either a match (.09), t(31) 3.13, p .01, or a neutral statement (.08), t(31) 3.52, p .01. In line with the illusory recollection account, stereotypes at retrieval appear to create subjectively compelling, yet illusory, recollections that are consistent with the stereotype.\nLastly, we examined the proportion of items judged old that were then assigned a response of don\u2019t know, as shown in the right column of Table 2. A 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the proportion of don\u2019t know responses yielded no significant effects (all Fs 2.25). Participants responded don\u2019t know at nearly\nidentical rates when the lawyer-related statements were presented by either the lawyer or the doctor. Similarly, there were comparable don\u2019t know rates to doctor-related statements that were presented by the doctor and by the lawyer.\nIn sum, participants receiving the modified source test used the don\u2019t know option nearly 40% of the time for profession statements that were recognized as old and substantially improved overall source identification rates for these items\u2014relative to participants receiving the standard test\u2014by filtering out guesses. Nevertheless, participants were unable to use the don\u2019t know response to significantly reduce the magnitude of biased source identification rates to test items in which the content of the statement either matched or mismatched the profession of the source. In fact, when there was a mismatch between the statement and the profession of the source, participants were equally likely to select the correct and the incorrect source on the modified test even though they were continually warned to base source identification judgments only on the presence of recollective details. Overall, then, the foregoing results indicate that stereotypes create false recollections and also influence guessing processes.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 1 indicates that illusory recollections about the origin of a statement can be created by providing stereotype information at the time of retrieval. However, the conclusions from Experiment 1 depend on the assumption that the don\u2019t know option captures all of the guessing responses. If a participant forgets to use the don\u2019t know response and, instead, guesses a source, then this assumption is invalidated. Although participants used the don\u2019t know response roughly 40% of the time to improve source identification performance on the modified test, this is in no way proof that all guessing responses have been eradicated from contributing to source attributions on this test. Therefore, we conducted another experiment with a combined source memory and remember\u2013know procedure to examine the influence of stereotype information on illusory recollections.\nA number of studies have examined the basis of participants\u2019 source attributions by requiring them to identify whether the source judgment was based either on the conscious recollection of specific details about initially encountering the item during the study phase (i.e., a remember judgment) or on a sense of familiarity and recognition that the item was encountered before, but in the absence of remembering any specific details about this encounter (i.e., a know judgment; e.g., Dewhurst & Hitch, 1999; Hicks, Marsh, & Ritschel, 2002; Meiser & Bro\u0308der, 2002; Meiser & Sattler, 2006; Perfect, Mayes, Downes, & Van Eijk, 1996). For example, Meiser and Bro\u0308der (2002) observed that if participants correctly retrieved one attribute about a past event, such as correctly retrieving a word\u2019s location, they were much more likely to retrieve the event\u2019s other attribute (e.g., the word\u2019s particular font) for source attributions accompanied with remember states than for those accompanied with know states (see also Meiser & Sattler, 2006).\nFor our purposes, the remember\u2013know source paradigm is useful in two ways. First, in contrast to Experiment 1, where we inferred that the absence of a don\u2019t know response indicated a judgment based on recollective details, here we directly tested this inference by requiring participants to make a conscious assessment of the memorial basis of each source attribution (i.e., by providing\na remember or know response for each source attribution). Second, this paradigm allowed us to test predictions of prevailing social and cognitive psychological theory against those of the retrieval expectation account about the influence of stereotypes.\nMany social psychological theories assume an inverse relationship between the influence of stereotypes and the availability or use of individuating information (e.g., Kunda & Thagard, 1996; Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Spears & Haslam, 1997). It is thought that stereotype information is likely to influence behavior when an individual fails to use, or does not have access to, individuating information about a particular person or object. Many cognitive theories also assume that general knowledge and expectations about the world, such as stereotypes, are likely to influence behavior when individuals fail to recollect specific information about the past (e.g., Bayen et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 1993; Mather et al., 1999). Both theoretical accounts assume that the process of recollection will reduce the frequency of systematic errors that are caused by stereotypes and general knowledge.\nWith respect to the remember\u2013know source paradigm, the foregoing assumption about an inverse relationship between recollection and stereotypes means that stereotypes should have less of an effect on performance when source attributions are based on the presence of memory for specific details (remember judgments) than on their absence (know judgments). For instance, consider a situation whereby an individual does not remember specific details about who presented an item and responds exclusively on the basis of guessing the source whose profession corresponds with the statement, such as attributing all of the doctor-related statements to the source who is a doctor. Because the doctor source presented equal numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related statements, this strategy of guessing in a stereotype-consistent manner increases performance for the doctor-related items that this source presented and decreases performance for the lawyer-related items that this source presented, thus producing a large difference in performance between the match and mismatch conditions. If, however, participants respond on the basis of remembering specific details about encountering the item, then they essentially can use recollection to counteract the deleterious influence of stereotypes and boost performance in the mismatch condition.\nThere are two different sets of predictions that are made by standard cognitive and social accounts and the retrieval expectation account about the influence of stereotypes on performance. According to standard accounts if recollection accurately reflects past experience, then it should minimize differences in source identification performance between the conditions when the profession of the source either matches or mismatches the content of the statement. Put another way, source attributions that are based on know responses should be associated with larger differences in performance between the match and mismatch conditions, as compared with source attributions that are based on remember responses. By contrast, the retrieval expectation account assumes that the process of recollection cannot reliably counteract the influence of stereotypes because recollection is an imperfect process that is sometimes distorted by, and made consistent with, stereotype information. Therefore, this account predicts that stereotypes in the match and mismatch conditions will influence source attributions that are accompanied by remember judgments just as much as they influences source attributions that are accompanied by know judgments.\nMore importantly, the standard account and the retrieval expectation account make different predictions about the subjective experience that accompanies erroneous source attributions. According to the standard account, when participants fail to recollect source-identifying information, they use stereotypes to guess a particular source. Guessing is associated with an absence of recollective experience. Therefore, in terms of remember and know phenomenology, participants should give primarily know responses to incorrect source attributions, regardless of whether the attributions are stereotype consistent or stereotype inconsistent. By contrast, the retrieval expectation account predicts that participants will tend to search for and activate expectation-consistent information. This will predispose participants to experience expectation-consistent illusory recollections and, consequently, to make more false remember responses to erroneous source attributions that are stereotype consistent than to erroneous source attributions that are stereotype inconsistent. However, we acknowledge that other accounts, such as fuzzy trace theory, also predict increased false remember responses for stereotype-consistent source attributions. We distinguish between these alternative accounts in Experiment 3.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Eighteen undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment."}, {"heading": "Design and Materials", "text": "We modified the design from Experiment 1 slightly, primarily by doubling the number of test items that were encountered at encoding and by including the remember\u2013know test instructions. The stimuli were similar to those used in Experiment 1 and consisted of 144 sentences randomly divided into three sets of 48 sentences, with each set containing 16 doctor-related, 16 lawyerrelated, and 16 neutral items. The three sets of items were counterbalanced and rotated across three conditions: (a) items presented by Bill, (b) items presented by Tom, and (c) new items that were not presented during the study phase. Additionally, half of the participants were told during the test that Bill was a doctor and Tom was a lawyer, and the remaining participants were told the opposite. The study phase thus consisted of 96 sentences: one set of 48 sentences presented by Bill and the other set of 48 sentences presented by Tom. These items were presented at a 5-s rate and in a quasi-random order with no more than three consecutive items presented by the same source. Six additional filler sentences were included at the beginning and at the end of the study phase to reduce primacy and recency effects.

Participants then completed the source memory test in which they determined whether the test sentence was presented by Bill or by Tom during the encoding phase or was a new sentence that had not been encountered earlier. Following responses of Bill or Tom, participants then made a remember or a know judgment as a basis for their source attribution (e.g., Rajaram, 1993; Rotello, Macmillan, & Reeder, 2004). That is, participants were told that a remember judgment:\nshould occur when their memory of who originally presented the statement is accompanied by a conscious recollection of its prior occurrence. To remember is the ability to become consciously aware again of some aspect or aspects of what happened or what was experienced at the time the sentence was presented, such as aspects of the physical appearance of the sentence and the accompanying picture of Bill or Tom, or of what you were thinking when you saw the sentence. In other words the remembered statement should bring back to mind either a particular visual image or something more personal from the time of study or something about its appearance, or position in the study sequence.\nBy contrast, participants were told that a know judgment:\nshould occur when they recognize that the sentence was in the study phase but they cannot consciously recollect anything about its actual occurrence or what happened, or what was experienced at the time of its occurrence. To know means that you know you encountered the sentence before and it is familiar, but you have no specific recollective associations about it.\nAll participants indicated that they understood the distinction between remember and know responses."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Table 3 presents the conditional source scores for the studied items overall and broken down in terms of source scores for remember judgments and for know judgments. The overall scores replicate the basic findings from Experiment 1.

There was also a significant interaction, F(2, 34) 7.30, MSE .06, p .01, 2 .30, and no significant effect of source (F 1). As in Experiment 1, participants showed better source identification performance when there was a match (.71) than when there was a mismatch (.48) between the profession of the source and the statement (e.g., the doctor presenting doctor-like rather than lawyer-like statements).\nEvidence for the occurrence of illusory recollections comes from an examination of source identification scores that are associated with remember and know responses, as shown in Table 3. Prevailing theory predicts that if recollecting specific details about who presented the statement counteracts and minimizes the influence of stereotypes, then source identification performance that is based on remember judgments should be less influenced by whether there is a match or a mismatch between the source and the statement. In other words, this view predicts a smaller difference in source accuracy between the match and mismatch conditions when\nsource attributions are based on remember responses than when these attributions are based on know responses.\nWe performed a 2 (remember\u2013know) 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) ANOVA of the source scores, which yielded a significant effect of remember\u2014know judgment, F(1, 14) 20.80, MSE .04, p .001, 2 .60, replicating previous findings of better source identification performance for judgments accompanied by remember responses than by know response (e.g., Dewhurst & Hitch, 1999).2 The ANOVA also yielded a significant effect of statement type, F(2, 28) 16.46, MSE .06, p .001, 2 .54, and a significant interaction between statement type and source, F(2, 28) 6.63, MSE .12, p .01, 2 .32, which were qualified by a significant three-way interaction, F(2, 28) 7.47, MSE .05, p .01, 2 .35. As seen in Table 3, the three-way interaction reflects differences in source identification performance in the match and mismatch conditions when participants responded on the basis of either remember or know judgments.\nTo examine the three-way interaction, we analyzed source identification performance in the match and mismatch conditions as a function of remember and know responses. This 2 (match vs. mismatch) 2 (remember vs. know) ANOVA yielded significant effects of match\u2013mismatch, F(1, 15) 8.45, MSE .10, p .01, 2 .36, and remember\u2013know judgment, F(1, 15) 10.69, MSE .02, p .01, 2 .42, as well as a significant interaction, F(1, 15) 10.51, MSE .03, p .01, 2 .41. There are much greater differences in source accuracy between the match and mismatch conditions when source attributions are based on remember judgments than when they are based on know judgments. Contrary to the predictions of the prevailing cognitive\u2013social account, source judgments that are based on remembering specific details do not counteract the influence of stereotypes or minimize differences in performance between the match and mismatch conditions.\n2 The degrees of freedom for this ANOVA are reduced because 3 participants did not give either a remember or a know response to an item type from one of the sources."}, {"heading": "Multinomial Analysis of Source Attributions", "text": "We further analyzed the overall source attribution data with the same four-parameter, two-high-threshold multinomial model that was used by Bayen et al. (2000). This model fit the data from each item type condition, all G2(2)s 2.29, G2(2)critical 5.99. As in Experiment 1 and as observed by Bayen et al. (2000), there were significant differences across the three different statement types in the bias parameter to respond with a particular source. The bias to provide a doctor response was significantly greater for the doctorlike statements (g .64) than for the neutral statements (g .49), which was significantly different from the bias for the lawyer-like statements (g .34), all G2(1)s 8.01, ps .01. Analyses of the remaining parameter values showed no significant differences in source memory (d parameter) between the doctor-related (.25) and lawyer-related (.22) items, although each was significantly lower than source memory for the neutral items (.75), G2(1)s 40.75, ps .001. Lastly, item recognition (D parameter) of the different item types was no different for doctor-related (.56) and lawyerrelated (.58) items, and each was significantly lower than item recognition for the neutral items (.75), G2(1)s 21.88, ps .001. We replicated the basic results from Experiment 1 as well as the results of Bayen et al. (2000). Thus, there is nothing unusual either about our stimuli or about including the remember\u2013know judgment in our source memory test.\nOverall, then, the modeling analysis suggests that there is no actual difference in source memory\u2014as measured by the d parameter\u2014that would account for better source identification performance when there was a match than when there was a mismatch between the profession of the source and the statement. Instead, this analysis suggests that there were very strong biases to respond with the source that matches the content of the statement. For instance, in the absence of remembering source-identifying information, a bias to provide a doctor response to doctor-like statements would inflate source identification performance when the doctor happened to be the correct source and reduce performance when it was not the correct source.\nHowever, one problem with this foregoing modeling analysis is that it confounds the influence of guessing and illusory recollection processes because both processes can contribute to source identification errors. In other words, current multinomial models assume that source identification errors are due to guessing biases when participants fail to remember information about who presented the item. By contrast, an alternative explanation is that participants falsely recollect illusory information that then serves as the basis for their source identification error. From the standpoint of our retrieval expectation account, the observed differences in the foregoing bias (g) parameter are due to the influence of some mixture of guessing and illusory recollection processes. To distinguish between these two perspectives, it is necessary to examine the subjective state that is associated with erroneous source identifications."}, {"heading": "Subjective Experience of Correct and Incorrect Source Attributions", "text": "To answer the question about whether erroneous sourcemonitoring judgments are based on either wrong guesses or illusory recollections, we investigated participants\u2019 phenomenological\nstate when they made correct and incorrect source attributions. If all incorrect source attributions are based on guessing biases when participants fail to remember source-identifying information, then there should be similar phenomenological states that are associated with incorrect source attributions made in either a schemaconsistent manner (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to doctor-related items) or a schema-inconsistent manner (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to lawyer-related items). By contrast, if illusory recollections are the basis of erroneous but schema-consistent source attributions, then there should be higher rates of remember judgments that are given to schemaconsistent than to schema-inconsistent attributions.\nTable 4 shows the proportion of doctor and lawyer responses that were assigned remember judgments. Because all doctor and lawyer attributions must be accompanied by either a remember or a know response, the proportion of responses in Table 4, given a know judgment, is easily computed by subtracting the score from 1. Figure 1 presents the rate of remember and know judgments for correct and incorrect source attributions that are made in either a schema-consistent or a schema-inconsistent manner. What is striking about the pattern of data in Figure 1 and in Table 4 is that when participants make incorrect source attributions, they are much more likely to give remember judgments to schema-consistent than to schema-inconsistent attributions. In fact, Figure 1 shows that the phenomenological experience that is associated with incorrect attributions that are schema-consistent is nearly identical to the experience that is associated with correct source attributions that are schema-consistent.\nThis foregoing pattern of data was confirmed by a 3 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like vs. neutral) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) 2 (accuracy: correct vs. incorrect) ANOVA of the proportion of source attributions assigned remember judgments.3 This analysis yielded significant effects of statement type, F(2, 30) 7.61, MSE .084, p .01, 2 .34, and accuracy, F(1, 15) 22.73, MSE .077, p .001, 2 .60, reflecting higher rates of remember judgments to the neutral statement type and to correct responses, respectively. There was also a Statement Type Source interaction, F(2, 30) 4.24, MSE .051, p .05, 2 .22, reflecting higher rates of remember responses when the content of the statement type mismatched rather than matched the profession of the source. Most importantly, there was a three-way interaction, F(2, 30) 7.68, MSE .066, p .01, 2 .34.\nAs is clear from Figure 1, the three-way interaction is fueled by two aspects of the data. First, when participants make incorrect source attributions, they report remembering information as a basis for more than twice as many of the schema-consistent (55%) than schema-inconsistent (26%) attributions, t(15) 3.61, p .01. Second, when participants make correct source attributions, there are no differences in the rate of remember judgments to schemaconsistent (58%) and schema-inconsistent (52%) attributions, t(15) 1.57. Moreover, the subjective experience of incorrect, but schema-consistent, source attributions is nearly identical to the\n3 Two individuals did not assign remember responses to incorrect responses to an item, hence, the reduced degrees of freedom.\nsubjective experience that is associated with correct attributions that are schema-consistent. For instance, as shown in Table 3, where the boldface scores refer to correct responses, there is no significant difference in the rate of remember judgments to lawyer-\nrelated items that were either correctly (58%) or incorrectly (59%) attributed to the lawyer source, t(15) 0.5. The same pattern holds for the rate of remember judgments assigned to doctor-related items that were either correctly (59%) or incorrectly (51%) attributed to the doctor source, t(15) 1.16.\nOne potential explanation of the difference in subjective experience for the schema-consistent and schema-inconsistent incorrect source attributions is that participants use a more lenient criterion for making remember judgments to schema-consistent items than to schema-inconsistent items. If this were the case, however, then when participants falsely recognize new items as having been encountered during the study phase, they should make more remember judgments to schema-consistent attributions (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to doctor-related items) than to schema-inconsistent attributions (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to lawyer-related items). As is visible in the right-hand portion of Figure 1, this was not the case. In fact, the opposite pattern was true when making source attributions to new items: Participants gave a higher proportion of remember responses to schema-inconsistent attributions (21%) than to schema-\nconsistent attributions (13%), although this difference was not significant, t(13) 1.4 Thus, these data rule out a lenient-criterion account of why there are higher levels of remember judgments for incorrect source attributions that are made in a schema-consistent manner than for those made in a schema-inconsistent manner.\nIn sum, it is not the case that all incorrect source attributions are driven by (a) failing to remember individuating information and (b) guessing in a schema-consistent manner. Instead, a substantial amount of incorrect but stereotype-consistent source attributions are based on illusory recollections. Simply being told the profession of the two sources at the time of retrieval spontaneously creates distorted and stereotype-consistent recollections about who presented a statement. This means that recollecting specific details about past events cannot counteract or minimize the influence of stereotypes in this paradigm because these recollected details may themselves be distorted by the stereotype.\nExperiment 3\nExperiments 1 and 2 indicate that illusory recollections about the origin of a statement can be created by providing stereotype information at retrieval that draws on well-learned semantic categories about doctors and lawyers.\nThere are a variety of different explanations for the occurrence of illusory recollections. In other paradigms, misattribution of strong familiarity is a plausible explanation for illusory recollections (i.e., false remember responses). For instance, in the Deese\u2013 Roediger\u2013McDermott (DRM) paradigm, participants tend to give high rates of remember responses to new words (e.g., sleep) that appear familiar because they are semantically related to what was studied (e.g., tired, dream, pillow, rest; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). More recently, Chan and McDermott (2006) observed a similar effect when participants make pragmatic inference errors. For instance, after hearing that a \u201cflimsy shelf weakened under the weight of the books,\u201d participants later often incorrectly recognize that they had heard the word broke and give high levels of remember responses to this false recognition. Drawing on the signal detection account of Wixted and Stretch (2004; see also Donaldson, 1996), Chan and McDermott suggested that the high rates of false remember responses may be due to the misattribution of strong familiarity. According to Wixted and Stretch (2004), participants make remember and know responses on the basis of a single dimension of memory strength, which is based on the overall amount of information that is provided by separate remember and familiarity processes. Consequently, a remember response can be due to the presence of (a) a large amount of remember information and little familiarity information, (b) a large amount of familiarity information and little remember information, or (c) a large amount of both kinds of information. Thus, from this point of view, in both the DRM and pragmatic-inference paradigms, the strong familiarity that is associated with the semantically related lure items on the test may account for erroneous remember responses.\nThis misattribution of strong familiarity account, however, cannot easily explain the false remember responses in the present paradigm. In contrast to the foregoing paradigms in which participants incorrectly endorse new words as old, in our paradigm participants must attribute items that are already recognized as old to one source or the other and give a remember or know response\nas a basis for this source attribution. To explain the high levels of false remember responses to erroneous source attributions, the misattribution of familiarity account must predict that items are more familiar when participants respond in a schema-consistent manner than when they respond in a schema-inconsistent manner (e.g., higher familiarity when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the doctor-related items than when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the lawyer-related items). There was no support for this prediction. If there had been differences in familiarity between the items, then this would have produced differences in item recognition. However, recognition rates\u2014as measured by the D parameter, which is equivalent to a corrected recognition score\u2014were no different for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items when they were presented by either a mismatching or matching source. Yet, despite the absence of these memory differences, there were strong differences in the pattern of illusory recollections. Thus, there is no support for a misattribution of familiarity account of these data.\nBy contrast, fuzzy trace theory provides a compelling explanation for our results (e.g., Brainerd, Wright, Reyna, & Mojardin, 2001; 2003). According to this theory, the encoding phase produces two representations for each item: a verbatim representation captures the sensory and perceptual details about the item (e.g., visual information about the face of the source with which it is associated), whereas a gist representation captures the meaning of the item. In the present paradigm, repeated exposure to the doctorrelated and lawyer-related items will create very strong gist representations for the meaning of these two themes. Fuzzy trace theory suggests that phantom (i.e., illusory) recollections can occur in the following manner. First, the theory predicts that the rapid disintegration of verbatim traces will leave behind fragments of information that are no longer bound together, such as a memory for the picture of the doctor source that is unconnected to the statement with which it was initially paired. The second critical prediction about the construction of phantom recollections is that strong gist memories will redintegrate verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent recollective experiences. For instance, encountering a lawyer-related statement on the test will activate a strong gist memory for this theme, which will then attract and incorporate unconnected verbatim fragments about the lawyer source so as to construct a schema-consistent illusory source recollection.\nOverall, then, fuzzy trace theory easily explains the presence of false remember responses to erroneous source attributions with the mechanism that strong gist traces produce schema (i.e., gist)consistent illusory source recollections. Moreover, it explains the absence of differences in item recognition\u2014and presumably, familiarity\u2014with the assumption that the strength of the gist traces for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items is unaffected by whether they were presented by the doctor source or the lawyer source.\nExperiment 3 tests fuzzy trace theory and our retrieval expectation account. To distinguish between these two accounts, we modified the paradigm in Experiment 2 and created another ex-\n4 Given the low false alarm rate to new items, 4 individuals did not produce a false alarm to either one or both types of new item.\npectation about the likely source of the statements that is independent of the expectations associated with the gist of the statements.\nIn this experiment, we used the identical materials and procedure from Experiment 2 but manipulated the proportion of items presented by the two sources. The neutral proportion condition replicated Experiment 2 and included equal amounts of the doctorrelated and lawyer-related items from each source. By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, only 25% of the items that each source presents were stereotype consistent and 75% were stereotype inconsistent. For example, 25% of the items that the doctor source presented were doctor-related and 75% of the items were lawyer-related. Thus, in each proportion condition, participants encountered equivalent numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related items. The only difference between the proportion conditions was how these items were distributed between the two sources. Previous studies show that manipulating the proportion of items that are presented from one source or another changes participants\u2019 expectations about the origin of a memory (e.g., Cook et al., 2003; Dodson & Johnson, 1996).\nExperiment 3 allowed us to test different predictions of fuzzy trace theory and the retrieval expectation account. According to fuzzy trace theory, illusory (phantom) recollections are created when strong gist traces attract unconnected verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent illusory recollections. From our interpretation of this theory, there does not appear to be a mechanism whereby gist traces would attract verbatim fragments that are inconsistent with the meaning of the gist trace. In other words, gist-consistent illusory recollections should always be more likely than gist-inconsistent illusory recollections. Therefore, fuzzy trace theory predicts that the proportion manipulation will have no effect on the pattern of false remember responses. That is, in both the neutral proportion and conflicting proportion conditions, the pattern of false remember responses should be schema (i.e., gist)consistent and correspond to the pattern of false remember responses in Experiment 2.\nBy contrast, the retrieval expectation account predicts that false remember responses are created by any relevant expectation that is prominent during the act of retrieval. Thus, this account predicts that the conflicting proportion condition will completely reverse the pattern of false remember responses that is observed in the neutral proportion condition. Specifically, the neutral proportion condition should produce schema-consistent false remember responses\u2014as it did in Experiment 2\u2014but the conflicting proportion condition should produce schema-inconsistent false remember responses. This outcome would indicate that the illusory recollections that are stereotype-based can be completely reversed by another overriding set of expectations.\nIn short, fuzzy trace theory and the retrieval expectation account make opposite predictions about the pattern of false remember responses in the conflicting proportion condition: Fuzzy trace theory predicts that they will be schema consistent, whereas the retrieval expectation account predicts that they will be proportion consistent and, thus, schema inconsistent.\nOne remaining crucial aspect of this experiment concerns the remember instructions. The definition of remember in the instructions from Experiment 2 (which are the standard instructions in the literature) is sufficiently broad that it is possible that idiosyncratic, but non\u2013source-specifying, details might be recollected and lead to a remember response. For instance, upon seeing a particular test\nitem, participants may not remember any source-identifying details about who presented the item during the study phase, but they may vividly remember how they felt when they saw the item or that their stomach grumbled, which might then contribute to a remember response. To eliminate the possibility of these source-irrelevant and noncriterial remember judgments, we used a definition of remember that is similar to the manner in which we instructed participants to make a response of Tom or Bill in Experiment 1. We instructed participants to give remember responses only when they were aware of specific details that identified one source or the other as the origin of the test item.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Forty-eight undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment, with 24 participants in each of the two conditions."}, {"heading": "Design and Materials", "text": "Except for the noted differences, the overall design and materials were identical to those used in Experiment 2.

During the encoding phase, participants were presented with 64 statements. In the neutral proportion condition, 32 of these statements were presented by the stereotype-consistent source and 32 statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent source (e.g., the doctor source presented 16 of the doctor-related items and 16 of the lawyer-related items). By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, 48 of the profession statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent source and 16 statements were presented by the consistent source (e.g., the doctor source presented 24 of the lawyer-related items and 8 of the doctor-related items, and the lawyer source presented 24 of the doctor-related items and 8 of the lawyer-related items).

Participants were not informed of either the impending memory test or the proportion of doctor-related and lawyer-related sentences that were presented by the two sources. During the test phase, as in the previous experiments, participants were told that it might be helpful to know that one source is actually a doctor and the other source is actually a lawyer. In addition, participants in the conflicting proportion condition were informed about the proportion manipulation.

Participants responded either Tom, Bill, or new to each test item and, contingent on a response of either Tom or Bill, participants identified the basis of their source identification by giving a remember or know response. However, we changed the instructions slightly for giving a remember response. We directed participants to make remember responses in instances in which their\nmemory of who originally presented the statement is accompanied by a conscious recollection of its prior occurrence in the list of studied statements. Remember is the ability to become consciously aware again of some aspect of how the sentence was presented, such as aspects of the physical appearance of the sentence and the accompanying picture of Bill or Tom. In other words the \u201cremembered\u201d answer should bring back to mind a particular visual image or recollective details of the statement and its presenter.\nBy contrast, participants were directed to give know judgments when \u201cyou recognize that the sentence was in the study set but you cannot consciously recollect anything about its actual occurrence and how it was presented.\u201d"}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Table 5 presents the conditional source scores for the studied items overall and broken down in terms of source scores for\nremember judgments and for know judgments. We first examined the overall source scores without regard to whether they were based on remember or know responses. A 2 (statement type: doctor-like vs. lawyer-like) 2 (source: doctor vs. lawyer) 2 (proportion: neutral vs. conflicting) ANOVA revealed a significant three-way interaction, F(1, 46) 19.90, MSE .229, p .001, 2 .30, and no other significant effects (all Fs 1.25). The three-way interaction is easily visible in the left column of data in the table. The neutral proportion condition shows the standard match\u2013mismatch effect that was observed in Experiments 1 and 2: Source scores were higher when the profession of the source and the content of the statement matched (.75) than when they mismatched (.44), F(1, 46) 5.03, p .05, 2 .10. By contrast, the conflicting proportion condition showed the exact opposite pattern: Source scores were higher when there was a mismatch (.77) than when there was a match (.46) between the profession of the source and the content of the statement, F(1, 46) 4.92, p .05, 2 .10. These results show that the stereotype-based match\u2013 mismatch effect can be reversed easily by changing expectations about the likelihood that a particular source is associated with a particular kind of content.\nWe next examined source identification performance that is associated with remember and know responses when there is either a match or a mismatch between the content of the statement and the profession of the source. A 2 (remember vs. know) 2 (match vs. mismatch) 2 (proportion: neutral vs. conflicting) ANOVA of the source scores showed a significant effect of remember\u2013know, reflecting higher overall performance for remember responses than for know responses, F(1, 44) 21.03, MSE .045, p .001, 2 .32.5 There was also a significant interaction between the match\u2013mismatch and proportion manipulations, F(1, 44) 20.94, MSE .218, p .001, 2 .32, indicating, as in the prior analysis, that the match\u2013mismatch effect was reversed in the conflicting proportion condition. There were no other significant effects (all Fs 1). One key point about this analysis is that even when participants claimed to be responding on the basis of remembering specific source-identifying details, they were still just as influenced by the match\u2013mismatch manipulation as when they were responding in the absence of remembering source information (i.e., know judgments)."}, {"heading": "Multinomial Analysis of Source Attributions", "text": "As we did in the prior experiments, we also analyzed the source attribution data with multinomial models. To focus the comparison on the difference between the neutral proportion condition and the conflicting proportion condition, we constructed a single model for each proportion condition. As seen in Table 6, the best-fitting model for each proportion condition consisted of separate source bias (g) parameters and separate item recognition (D) parameters for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items. Each model also contained a single source discrimination (d) parameter, and a single false alarm guessing (b) parameter for both item types. Both models pro-\n5 Two participants in the neutral proportion condition never used either a remember or a know response for any of the items, which accounts for the reduced degrees of freedom in this analysis.\nNote. In the neutral proportion condition, each source presented equal amounts of doctor-related and lawyer-related items. In the conflicting proportion condition, each source presented 75% of the items that are stereotype inconsistent (e.g., doctor source presented 75% of the lawyerrelated items). Parentheses contain the standard error of the mean.\nvided adequate fits to the data, both G2(6)s 9.76, G2(6)critical 12.59. As in Experiment 2, within the neutral proportion condition, the bias to provide a doctor response was significantly greater for the doctor-related statements (g .67) than for the lawyer-related statements (g .28), G2(1) 134.26, p .00001. However, there was no difference in source discrimination for the two different item types (i.e., d .30 for both statement types). The conflicting condition showed a similar effect: no difference in source discrimination for the two different item types (i.e., d .36 for both statement types) but a stronger bias to give a doctor response for the lawyer-like statements (g .70) than for the doctor-like statements (g .27), G2(1) 132.49, p .00001.\nMost importantly, when comparing the neutral proportion condition against the conflicting proportion condition, the only difference occurred with the source bias (g) parameter. The tendency to respond in a schema-consistent manner in the neutral condition was completely reversed in the conflicting condition. For instance, the bias to give a doctor response to the doctor-related items was significantly stronger in the neutral proportion condition (g .67) than in the conflicting proportion condition (g .27), G2(1) 135.63, p .00001. Likewise, there was a much weaker bias to give a doctor response to the lawyer-like statements in the neutral condition (g .28) than in the conflicting condition (.70), G2(1) 142.89, p .00001. By contrast, there was no difference between the neutral and conflicting proportion conditions for any of the other parameters, all G2(1)s 1.\nOverall, then, the results are as expected. Manipulating the proportion of items that are presented by one source or the other had no effect on either item recognition or source discrimination, but it had a massive effect on the bias to respond with one source or the other. However, the key question that this analysis cannot answer is how is the proportion manipulation producing this change in the bias parameter? In other words, do the large changes in the bias parameter across the two proportion conditions reflect changes in illusory recollections, changes in strategic guessing, or some combination of these two processes?"}, {"heading": "Subjective Experience of Correct and Incorrect Source Attributions", "text": "The fundamental point of this experiment concerns the subjective experience for erroneous source attributions in the neutral proportion and conflicting proportion conditions. If illusory recollections are caused either by well-learned semantic categories or by the capacity of strong gist traces to attract gist-consistent verbatim details, then we should observe a similar pattern of false remember responses in both proportion conditions: higher rates of false remember judgments to incorrect source attributions that are schema-consistent than to those that are schema-inconsistent. By contrast, if illusory recollections are influenced by expectations about the likelihood of a particular source presenting a particular kind of item, then we should observe higher schema-consistent false remember responses in the neutral proportion condition but higher schema-inconsistent (i.e., proportion consistent) false remember responses in the conflicting proportion condition.\nA 2 (response: stereotype consistent vs. stereotype inconsistent) 2 (correct vs. incorrect) 2 (proportion: neutral vs. conflicting) ANOVA of the proportion of source attributions that were assigned remember judgments produced a significant effect of correct\u2013incorrect responses, F(1, 37) 14.69, MSE .066, p .001, 2 .28, with higher rates of remember judgments for correct than for incorrect responses.6 There was also a three-way interaction, F(1, 37) 17.03, MSE .033, p .001, 2 .32, but no other significant effects (all Fs 1.13).\nThe three-way interaction is visible in Figure 2. As seen in the top half of Figure 2, when participants make correct source attributions, there are no differences in the two proportion conditions in the subjective state of remembering that are associated with source attributions that are either schema consistent or schema inconsistent (both ts 1.74, ps .28). By contrast, as shown in the bottom half of Figure 2, when participants make incorrect source attributions, there are very different patterns of false remember responses in the two proportion conditions. In the neutral proportion condition (i.e., each source presents equal numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related items), when participants make incorrect source attributions, they are more often in a subjective state of remembering when these attributions are schema consistent (.42) than when they are schema inconsistent (.30), t(18) 3.44, p .01. However, the exact opposite pattern is visible in the conflicting proportion condition. Here, when participants make incorrect source attributions, they give higher rates of remember responses to schema-inconsistent attributions (.52) than to schemaconsistent attributions (.32), t(19) 2.23, p .05. These data exactly fit the predictions of our retrieval expectation account.\nOverall, then, the proportion manipulation selectively affects the phenomenological experience that is associated with incorrect source attributions. Critically, and consistent with the predictions of our retrieval expectation account, the false remember responses correspond to the expectations established by the proportion manipulation. For erroneous source attributions in the conflicting proportion condition, there are higher rates of false remember responses to schema-inconsistent attributions than to the schema-\n6 Four participants in the conflicting proportion condition and 5 individuals in the neutral proportion condition made either no incorrect or no correct responses for a particular item.\nNote. g_doc and g_law refer to the bias to respond \u201cdoctor\u201d for the doctorrelated and lawyer-related items, respectively; D_doc and D_law refer to the probability of correctly detecting the doctor-related and lawyer-related items, respectively; d refers to the probability of correctly discriminating the source of the item; b refers to the bias to recognize an item as old. G2 (6) values less than 12.59 indicate a good fit of the model to the data.\nconsistent attributions, whereas the opposite pattern occurs in the neutral proportion condition.\nCan a criterion account explain these differences in subjective states? For example, in the neutral proportion condition, are participants generally more likely to assign remember judgments to stereotype-consistent attributions than to stereotype-inconsistent attributions? We investigated this question, as we did in Experiment 2, by examining how often participants give remember judgments to the doctor-related new items and lawyer-related new items that are falsely recognized and are attributed to either the doctor or the lawyer source. In the neutral proportion condition, there were no significant differences in the proportion of remember judgments that were assigned to new items that were falsely attributed to either a stereotype-consistent (.32) or a stereotypeinconsistent (.47) source, t(13) 1.44.7 As in Experiment 2, the trend is in a direction that is opposite the predictions of the criterion account: Participants more often gave remember judgments to new items that were attributed to the stereotypeinconsistent source than to new items attributed to the stereotypeconsistent source. Similarly, in the conflicting proportion condition, there were no significant differences in the proportion of remember judgments that were assigned to new items that were falsely attributed to either a stereotype-consistent (.33) or a stereotype-inconsistent (.39) source, t(12) 1.8 Overall, then, as we observed in Experiment 2, there is no support for a lenientcriterion explanation of the pattern of illusory recollections.\nThere is an alternative interpretation of Experiment 3 that is consistent with fuzzy trace theory. This interpretation assumes that two different kinds of gist representations are created in this experiment. An item-gist representation refers to the meaning of the doctor-related and lawyer-related items. By contrast, a source-gist representation refers to the meaning or characteristics of the two sources that are derived from the proportion of items that each source presents. For instance, in the conflicting proportion condition, participants may develop gist representations about the fact that one source tended to present doctor-related materials and the other source tended to present lawyer-related material. If this source-gist representation is sufficiently strong to produce illusory/phantom recollections, then fuzzy trace theory may be able to explain these results. Specifically, fuzzy trace theory would argue that in the conflicting proportion condition, the source-gist representation produces phantom recollections that, in turn, contribute to a higher rate of false remember responses to the schema-inconsistent attributions than to the schema-consistent attributions. However, because there are two different kinds of gist representations that potentially produce opposite patterns of behavior, what remains to be specified in fuzzy trace theory is how it is that one kind of gist representation can dominate performance over another kind of gist representation.\nIn sum, this experiment shows that expectations that are established on the fly from noting the frequency that a kind of statement was presented from a particular person are sufficient to produce illusory recollections.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn these experiments, participants initially studied two people presenting lawyer-related (e.g., \u201cyou face a fine\u201d), doctor-related (e.g., \u201cyou have a fever\u201d), and profession-neutral sentences. When participants were told, on a subsequent memory test, that one\nperson was actually a doctor and the other was a lawyer, there was a strong tendency to remember and attribute the test items in a stereotype-consistent manner, such as incorrectly responding that the doctor presented the majority of the doctor-related sentences.\nOne of the essential questions of this article is whether guessing processes or illusory recollections are the basis for these erroneous source attributions. The standard explanation of this kind of data is that expectations and stereotypes alter an individual\u2019s strategy for evaluating remembered information so that individuals are prone to guess in a stereotype-consistent manner, particularly when they fail to recollect specific information about who initially presented the item.\nWe show that this standard account is incorrect. When stereotypes and expectations are activated at retrieval, they create illusory recollections, which make a vital contribution to source attributions. In both Experiment 2 and in the neutral proportion condition of Experiment 3, participants often reported \u201cremembering\u201d specific details to justify incorrect source attributions that were made to the stereotype-consistent source (e.g., responding with the source who is a doctor to doctor-related items). By contrast, participants in these conditions frequently used know responses to justify erroneous source attributions that were made to the stereotype-inconsistent source. It is worth noting that our studies differ from typical investigations of schemas, stereotypes, and expectations in that we only activated the profession stereotype at retrieval, whereas in most studies the stereotype, schema, or expectation is present at encoding. Thus, we have shown how retrieval conditions can produce illusory recollections.\nThese experiments rule out a number of alternative explanations for the occurrence of illusory recollections. Both Experiments 2 and 3 show that a lenient-criterion account for making false remember responses is not a viable explanation of the data. This lenient criterion account suggests that participants are more likely to make remember judgments when responding in a stereotype-consistent manner than when responding in a stereotype-inconsistent manner. Thus, this account predicts that when participants falsely recognize new items, they should give more remember judgments to stereotype-consistent attributions than to stereotype-inconsistent attributions. This was not the case. In both Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, there were no differences in the rate at which participants gave remember judgments to new items that were attributed to the stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent sources.\nAnother potential explanation of the false remember responses is that they are a byproduct of the misattribution of strong familiarity, which has served as a plausible account in other paradigms (e.g., Chan & McDermott, 2006). In the present paradigm, in order to explain the high levels of false remember responses to erroneous, but stereotype-consistent, source attributions, the misattribution of familiarity account must predict higher levels of familiarity for these items than for items that elicit erroneous but stereotypeinconsistent source attributions. Higher levels of familiarity would contribute to higher recognition rates. But, there were no differences in recognition rates for the doctor-related and lawyer-related\n7 Given the low false alarm rates to the new items, there were 10 participants who did not produce a false alarm to either the doctor-related new items or the lawyer-related new items.\n8 Given the low false alarm rates to the new items, there were 11 participants who did not produce a false alarm to either the doctor-related new items or the lawyer-related new items.\nitems when they were presented by either a stereotype-consistent or a stereotype-inconsistent source. Therefore, there is no support for an explanation of the false remember responses that is based on the misattribution of strong familiarity.\nFuzzy trace theory has successfully explained the occurrence of illusory recollections in a variety of different paradigms. This theory predicts that phantom (i.e., illusory) recollections are created when strong gist traces attract and incorporate unconnected verbatim fragments into a gist-consistent illusory recollection (e.g., Brainerd et al., 2001; 2003). This theory easily explains the stereotype-consistent false remember data from Experiments 1 and 2. Repeated exposure to the doctor-related and lawyer-related items creates strong gist memories for these two themes, which then attract stereotype-consistent contextual details about these items, thus explaining why participants report remembering details to justify erroneous source attributions.\nExperiment 3, however, suggests that illusory recollections in this paradigm may not be caused by strong gist traces or by well-learned schemas about items. This experiment created an expectation about the likely source of items by manipulating the proportion of profession items that were presented by each source. In the neutral proportion condition, each source presented equal amounts of the doctor-related and lawyer-related items, whereas in the conflicting proportion condition, each source presented 75% of the items that were stereotype inconsistent and conflicted with the profession of the source (e.g., the doctor source presented 75% of the lawyer-related items). We observed that in the neutral proportion condition, the false remember responses were primarily stereotype consistent, as in Experiment 2. By contrast, in the conflicting-proportion condition, the false remember responses were primarily stereotype inconsistent but proportion consistent. Even though participants had built up equivalently strong gist traces for the themes of the items in the two proportion conditions, there were opposite patterns of illusory recollections in these two conditions. However, our interpretation assumes that participants do not form gist representations about the proportion of items that each source presents. If they do, and if these source gist representations are sufficiently strong, then fuzzy trace theory may be able to explain these results.\nOverall, then, the data suggest that any expectation that is salient during the act of retrieval is sufficient to create illusory recollections that are consistent with this expectation. In Experiments 1 and 2, the salient expectation was established by the individual\u2019s general knowledge about doctors and lawyers. By contrast, in Experiment 3, the expectation was created by the likelihood that a particular item was associated with a particular source. More generally, these results suggest that any set of preconceptions is sufficient to make an individual vulnerable to recollecting\u2014rightly or wrongly\u2014specific details that are consistent with these expectations.\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that if expectations alone were all that mattered, then we should have observed the same pattern of results for source attributions to new items that were falsely recognized as old as we did for erroneous source attributions to old items. This was not the case. In both Experiments 2 and 3, the false remember responses for source attributions to new items were not affected by either the schema-expectations manipulation or the proportion manipulation. Consequently, the mechanism that is contributing to illusory recollections is not purely a retrieval phenomenon. Instead, a preexisting memory trace appears\nto be a requirement. Although the exact mechanism remains to be specified, we suggest that expectations during retrieval influence the specification of the retrieval cue so that participants tend to seek out and activate expectation-confirming information, which is combined with activated information from the memory trace to produce an expectation-consistent illusory recollection.\nOur account has much in common with the accessibility account of B. K. Payne et al. (2004). Using a similar paradigm, Payne et al. observed a pattern of biased memory performance involving racial stereotypes. Their participants read a list of stereotypically Black and White names. Each category of names was associated in equal amounts with either a stereotypically Black or White occupation. On a subsequent memory test, when given the name as a cue to remember the associated occupation, participants showed a clear pattern of stereotypically related memory errors: Incorrect responses were more likely to be stereotype consistent than stereotype inconsistent. Payne et al. used a multinomial model, derived from Jacoby\u2019s (1991) process dissociation approach, to explain the pattern of performance. They observed that stereotypes selectively affected the accessibility bias parameter of their model. Importantly, their bias parameter does not reflect strategic guessing but rather measures an unconscious accessibility to stereotype information. B. K. Payne et al. (2004) suggested that stereotypes increase the likelihood of information coming \u201cto mind not because of prior exposure but because it is related to other information organized within a stereotype schema\u201d (p. 55). We also suggest that stereotypes and expectations bring information to mind, which produces an illusory recollection.\nThe crucial difference between our expectation account and B. K. Payne et al. (2004) accessibility account depends, in part, on how each account characterizes the phenomenal characteristics of the expectation-consistent information that is brought to mind. Payne et al. suggested that this information is unconscious and implicitly biases performance, which, these authors suggest, is why it is difficult to consciously oppose the influence of these biases. By contrast, we suggest that this information is consciously accessible and is phenomenally similar to veridical recollections, which is why our participants had difficulty in Experiment 1 \u201cgating out\u201d incorrect responses so as to reduce the impact of stereotypes (i.e., they had trouble distinguishing correct from incorrect recollections). However, the strongest evidence for the conscious accessibility of this expectation-consistent information is that it causes participants to justify erroneous source attributions on the basis of a conscious recollection (e.g., in Experiments 2 and 3, the higher false remember responses for incorrect, but schema-consistent, source attributions than for schema-inconsistent source attributions).\nThe occurrence of stereotype-provoked illusory recollections shows that there is not always an inverse relationship between the influence of stereotypes and the process of recollecting specific individuating information, contrary to many social psychological theories (e.g., Kunda & Thagard, 1996; Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Spears & Haslam, 1997). In other words, recollection cannot always combat the influence of stereotypes when recollection itself is a process that is vulnerable to distortion.\nA full accounting of the effects of stereotypes, expectations, and general knowledge on performance requires the roles of both illusory recollections and strategic guessing processes. Although Experiments 2 and 3 indicate that there is not an inverse relationship between the influences of stereotypes and recollection (i.e.,\nrecollection did not counteract the influence of stereotypes), there is much evidence documenting an inverse relationship between recollection and strategic guessing processes (e.g., Collins, Warnock, Aiello & Miller, 1975; Dodson & Schacter, 2002; Hicks & Marsh, 1999; Johnson, Raye, Foley, & Foley, 1981; Schacter, Israel, & Racine, 1999). For instance, individuals can use a decision strategy\u2014the distinctiveness heuristic\u2014to reject false memories when they fail to recollect expected information about a test item (e.g., Dodson & Schacter, 2002; Gallo, Weiss, & Schacter, 2004; Schacter et al., 1999). Stereotypes can fuel a similar inferential decision process so that participants guess in a stereotypeconsistent manner when they fail to remember specific information. The SMF is perhaps the best model of the interplay between decision processes and recollective experience (e.g., Johnson et al., 1993). According to this framework, individuals can flexibly weight recollective information and other decision processes depending on the rememberer\u2019s goals and knowledge (e.g., if we happened to be participants in the paradigm in this article, then we would be hesitant to weight heavily recollective information given the occurrence of illusory recollections). In other words, the SMF predicts that although there is often an inverse relationship between recollective experience and the use of strategic guessing processes\u2014given the typically higher diagnostic value of the former than the latter\u2014this will not always be the case, particularly in situations where individuals are made aware of the unreliability of their recollections.\nOne final implication of these results concerns multinomial models of source monitoring (e.g., Batchelder & Riefer, 1990, 1999). All multinomial models of source monitoring, including those of one of the present study authors (e.g., Dodson, Holland, & Shimamura, 1998; Dodson & Shimamura, 2000), assume that erroneous source attributions are based entirely on the influence of guessing biases when participants fail to recollect source information. We have shown that this assumption is incorrect. Thus, a question of paramount importance for multinomial modelers of source memory is whether it is possible to develop a model that can separate the influence of illusory recollections from guessing processes.\nConclusion\nThese experiments show that we are trapped by our experiences and expectations so that we tend to falsely recollect details that support our preconceptions. As long as we are prone to misremembering the past on the basis of the perspective of the present, then there are problematic implications for minimizing the influence of stereotypes. When presented with new information at retrieval about who was a doctor and who was a lawyer, participants spontaneously misrecollected that the wrong person presented a statement when the statement was consistent with expectations about what a doctor or a lawyer would say. These results suggest that other stereotypes, such as those about race and gender, also will create subjectively compelling and yet illusory recollections that are consistent with the stereotype. However, the difficulty of distinguishing true recollections from false recollections will serve to maintain the influence of stereotypes. In other words, the influence of illusory recollections cannot be easily combated by using counter stereotypical decision processes, as we naturally\u2014and sometimes wrongly\u2014infer that what we are recollecting is a faithful reflection of the past.\nReferences\nBatchelder, W.

Participants were Arabic speakers, who used 2 sets of numerical symbols\u2014Arabic and Indian. They were presented with number pairs in the same notation (Arabic or Indian) or in different ones (Arabic and Indian). In the size comparison paradigm, 2 digits differing both numerically and physically were compared on the physical dimension. Nevertheless, there was evidence that participants automatically processed the irrelevant numerical dimension in different notation pairs. In the same\u2013different paradigm, 2 digits were presented either in the same or in different notations. Participants had to indicate whether the 2 digits were physically the same. The results again showed evidence for the automatic processing of numerical magnitude for pairs in different notations. Findings of both experiments suggest that numbers in different notations are automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in line with M. McCloskey\u2019s (1992) abstract representation model.\nKeywords: automaticity, numerical processing, numerical notations\nNumerical information appears in different formats, such as Arabic digits (e.g., 34), words (e.g., thirty-four), and Roman numerals (e.g., IV). Yet there is evidence that when humans perform a numerical task, the effects of differences in notations are minimal. The comparative distance effect (CDE), that is, faster responses in a numerical comparison task the larger the intrapair numerical difference, was found for both digits and number words (Foltz, Poltrock, & Potts, 1984). Similarly, the priming distance effect reflected in faster parity decisions to a target preceded by a numerically close compared with a numerically far prime was found to be similar in size when the prime and target were in the same or in different notations (Reynvoet & Brysbaert, 2004; Reynvoet, Brysbaert, & Fias, 2002; Reynvoet, Caessens, & Brysbaert, 2002). These findings are usually taken as indicating that numerical symbols are mentally represented by a common code that is notation independent. Yet the above results were mostly obtained when participants deliberately conducted numerical processing. Therefore, it could be argued that they reflect mainly the task requirement and not the features of internal mental representation.\nWe believe that analyzing automatic processing provides a better way to learn about the nature of stored representations (Ganor-Stern, Tzelgov, & Ellenbogen, 2007). In particular, following Bargh (1992), we refer to a process as automatic when it runs to completion without monitoring (Tzelgov, 1997). This\napproach to automaticity postulates that to diagnose a process as automatic, it is necessary to show that it can take place when it is not part of the task requirement.\nThere is ample evidence for an automatic access to the numerical magnitude of Arabic digits (see Tzelgov & Ganor-Stern, 2005, for a review). The main question in the present context is whether there is an automatic access to the numbers magnitudes when the numbers are presented in different notations.\nDifferent predictions can be drawn from the different models on the representation of numerical magnitude. McCloskey\u2019s (1992) model postulates that numerical information in whatever original form is converted to an abstract internal representation of magnitude. Thus, on the basis of this model, there should be evidence for automaticity in both same- and different-notation pairs. In contrast, Noel and Seron (1993) have argued that each individual has a preferred code to which all numerals are initially transcoded. If one of the codes is preferred, the access to the numerical meaning via the nonpreferred code should be slower, leading to a weaker indication for automatic processing. As a result, there should be evidence for automatic processing mainly in the preferred code.\nPrevious research addressing this issue mainly focusing on the processing of numbers in Arabic and verbal notations has yielded inconsistent results. In a study by LeFevre, Bisanz, and Mrkonjic (1988), participants were required to verify the presence of a probe number in a previously presented number pair. Items for which the probe was the sum of the initial pair were rejected more slowly than items for which the probe was unrelated, thus suggesting that the numbers\u2019 sum was automatically retrieved. Important for the present context, the same effect was found when the prime numbers were in verbal or in Arabic notation.\nIn contrast, the evidence for an automatic activation of numerical magnitude, as indicated by the spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect, was found to be weaker for number words compared with Arabic numbers (Dehaene, Bossini,\nDana Ganor-Stern, Achva Academic College, Israel; Joseph Tzelgov, Achva Academic College, and Department of Psychology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.\nThis research was supported by Israeli Science Foundation Grant 662/06 to Dana Ganor-Stern.

Finally, Dehaene and Akhavein (1995) explored the same issue using a same\u2013different task with number pairs presented in the same notation (verbal or Arabic) or in different ones (verbal and Arabic).\nIn the numerical same\u2013different task, where participants indicated whether the numbers had the same numerical value, \u201cdifferent\u201d responses were faster for pairs with large compared with small intrapair numerical difference, indicating a CDE similar in magnitude for both same- and different-notation pairs. More relevant for the issue of automaticity was participants\u2019 performance in the physical same\u2013different task, where they indicated whether the numbers presented were physically identical. The CDE was found only for same-notation pairs and not for different-notation pairs, thus suggesting that numbers in different notations are not automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in contrast with the findings of LeFevre et al. (1988).\nPresent Study\nThe present study broadens the existing research in two ways. First, previous studies on the effects of notation on numerical processing looked mainly at Arabic compared with verbal notations. The main problem with such a comparison is that numerical information is very seldom presented in verbal notation. In the present study, we examine the processing of two systems of numerical notations. We take advantage of the fact that the Arabic language uses a unique set of numerical symbols, which are referred to as Indian numbers (see Figure 1). Israeli Arabs are first introduced to the Indian digits, and only in the middle of third grade are they introduced to the Arabic numerals. From then on they use the Arabic numbers exclusively for mathematics, whereas the Indian numerals continue to be used mainly in written Arabic materials (e.g., newspapers, books). Thus, the participants included in the present study are familiar with the Arabic as well as with the Indian symbols, although they are more experienced with the former (Ibrahim, Eviatar, & Aharon-Peretz, 2002).\nSecond, in addition to the same\u2013different task, we investigate the issue of across-notation automatic numerical processing using a widely known paradigm in automaticity research\u2014the size comparison paradigm. The use of two experimental paradigms, the size comparison (Experiment 1) and the same\u2013different task (Experiment 2), enhances the generality of our results.\nIn both paradigms participants are directed to process physical aspects of the numbers. Of most interest is participants\u2019 performance with different-notation pairs; evidence for an automatic numerical processing in these trials will support the idea of auto-\nmatic numerical translation to a common representation of magnitude.\nAs mentioned earlier, on the basis of McCloskey\u2019s (1992) model, we would predict that the indications for automaticity will be similar for same- and different-notation pairs. In contrast, on the basis of Noel and Seron\u2019s (1993) model, if numerical information is first translated to a preferred code, then the evidence for automaticity should be weaker for number pairs in different notations compared with number pairs in the same preferred notation. In the present study, we assume that the Arabic notation is the preferred one, because of participants\u2019 longer exposure to this notation. This assumption is supported by a study by Ibrahim et al. (2002), conducted on the same population, which found that the speed at which the participants serially connected randomly scattered numerals was faster with Arabic digits than with Indian digits and that it was faster for same-notation compared with differentnotation numbers.\nExperiment 1\nIn the size comparison paradigm, pairs of digits varying in physical and numerical magnitudes are presented on a computer screen. In the physical comparison task, participants are asked to choose the physically larger digit while ignoring numerical magnitude. Automaticity of processing of numerical magnitude is indicated by the size congruency effect (SiCE), which is indicated in poorer performance in the incongruent condition (when the physically larger digit is numerically smaller) than in the congruent condition (when the physically larger digit is also numerically larger; e.g., Henik & Tzelgov, 1982; Pansky & Algom, 1999; Tzelgov, Meyer, & Henik, 1992).\nThe SiCE is viewed as indicating that the numerical magnitudes of the two presented digits were automatically processed and compared with each other. Some studies (e.g., Ganor-Stern et al., 2007) found that the SiCE increased with larger intrapair numerical difference, thus suggesting also the activation of the whole number line (see Tzelgov & Ganor-Stern, 2005, for a discussion of this point). However, this interaction of the SiCE and numerical difference was not always obtained (e.g., Rubinsten, Henik, Berger, & Shahar-Shalev, 2002). In the present study, we look at the SiCE (i.e., the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent conditions) and at its interaction with numerical difference for both same- and different-notation pairs.\nFinally, participants also performed the numerical comparison task in which they had to select the numerically larger digit. The analysis of this task mainly focused on the CDE with same- and different-notation pairs."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Twenty students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. All of them were native speakers of Arabic, who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. They participated either for course credits or payment.\nStimuli. The stimuli set was composed by all the possible 28 pairs created from two different numbers in the range of 1\u20139, excluding 5. There were thus eight numerical differences, ranging from 1\u20138. Each number pair appeared in the following three\nnotations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic\u2013Indian pairs and Indian\u2013Arabic pairs). Each of the pairs appeared twice, once with the larger number on the left side and the other with the smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 224 trials. Each number was about 15 mm high and 10 mm wide, and the distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm.\nIn the physical comparison task, the numbers presented were in one of two physical sizes: large (18 11 mm) and small (12 8 mm). Each number pair appeared four times: twice in the congruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically larger size) and twice in the incongruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically smaller size). In addition, within each congruency condition, each pair appeared once with the numerically larger number on the left side and once with the numerically smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 448 trials.\nApparatus. The experiment was conducted on a Pentium IBM clone personal computer with a 14-in. [35.56-cm] monitor screen. The experiment was programmed in E-Prime software (Schneider, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2002)\nProcedure. The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the physical and the numerical comparison tasks. The order of tasks was counterbalanced across participants. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials.\nThe participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then two numbers appeared, each was 3 cm apart from the screen center. In the numerical comparison task, participants were required to select the numerically larger digit. In the physical comparison task, they had to select the physically larger digit while ignoring numerical magnitudes. Participants responded by pressing either the \u201cL\u201d key for the right number or the \u201cA\u201d key for the left one. In both tasks, participants were\nrequired to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. The numbers remained on the screen until the participant\u2019s response."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In both experiments, the numerical and the physical tasks were analyzed separately. Responses to both tasks were analyzed in terms of response time (RT) and error rate (ER).\nNumerical comparison task. Means of RT of correct responses and of ER were submitted separately for two two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), with notation (Arabic, Indian, Mixed) and numerical difference (1\u20138) as within-participants variables, and order of task as an across-participants variable. In each task, we excluded from the analyses trials with RT shorter than 200 ms or longer than 2,500 ms (1.1% of the trials).\nNumerical difference affected both RT, F(7, 126) 30.26, MSE 8,035, p .001, and ER, F(7, 126) 12.06, MSE 0.004, p .001. Planned contrasts revealed that RT, F(1, 18) 103.45, MSE 15,818, p .001, and ER, F(1, 18) 22.89, MSE 0.01, p .001, decreased linearly the larger the intrapair numerical difference, indicating a CDE (see Figures 2A and 2B). The CDE was modulated by notation as reflected in both RT, F(14, 252) 1.75, MSE 4,823, p .05, and ER, F(14, 252) 2.09, MSE 0.002, p .05, as the slope of the linear trend varied across notations.\nPhysical comparison task. Means of RT of correct responses and of ER were submitted separately for two three-way ANOVAs with notation (Arabic, Indian, Mixed) and size congruency as within-participants variables, and order of task as an acrossparticipants variable. As can be seen in Figures 3A and 3B, performance was poorer in incongruent compared with congruent trials in both RT, F(1, 18) 58.35, MSE 2,395, p .001, and ER, F(1, 18) 6.67, MSE 0.004, p .05, indicating a SiCE. RT and ER were also affected by notation as RT was longer, F(2, 36) 112.18, MSE 3,805, p .001, and ER was higher, F(2,\n36) 9.46, MSE 0.003, p .001, for numbers in the Indian notation.\nTo verify that the SiCE was not a product of the Digits 1 and 9, which as can be seen in Figure 1 are highly similar in the Indian and the Arabic notations, we reran the same analyses excluding those digits. A SiCE was present in all notations, both in RT, F(1, 18) 36.88, MSE 3,615, p .001, and in ER, F(1, 18) 6.66, MSE 0.004, p .05, even when Digits 1 and 9 were excluded. In addition, to check that the SiCE was not a carry-over effect from the numerical comparison task, we looked at the participants that performed the physical comparison task first and found a significant SiCE in the RT, F(1, 9) 40.50, MSE 2,050, p .001, and ER of this group also, F(1, 9) 7.46, MSE 0.003, p .05. This finding, coupled with the fact that the interaction between the SiCE and order of task for the whole group was insignificant, enabled us to rule out the explanation of the SiCE as a carry-over effect.\nTo check for a modulation of the SiCE by numerical difference, we ran a three-way ANOVA with notation, congruency, and numerical difference as within-participants variables. Similar to Dehaene and Akhavein (1995), we included in the analysis pairs with a small numerical difference (i.e., 1) versus pairs with a large numerical difference (6, 7, and 8).\nThe analysis of RT revealed in addition to the SiCE, F(1, 18) 36.11, MSE 6,342, p .001, a significant triple interaction between notation, numerical difference, and congruency, F(2, 36) 10.85, MSE 4,245, p .001, indicating that the SiCE increased with large numerical difference only in Mixed notations, F(1, 18) 26.82, MSE 3,077, p .001. The analysis of ER revealed a significant SiCE, F(1, 18) 11.16, MSE 0.01, p .001, which increased with larger numerical difference, F(1, 18) 15.35, MSE 0.002, p .001."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The presence of the CDE in the numerical comparison task with different-notation pairs suggests that participants translated the\nnumbers into a common representation of magnitude on the same number line. Results from the physical comparison task, showing a SiCE for both same- and different-notation pairs, indicate that such a translation was conducted automatically, even when no numerical processing was required by the task. Moreover, in some cases the SiCE increased with numerical difference, suggesting that it reflects, in addition to an automatic pairwise comparison of magnitudes, some activation of the number line also. Note that the SiCE was present even when the Numbers 1 and 9, which are similar in the Arabic and Indian notations, were excluded from the analysis.\nThere was also a consistent pattern of poorer performance for Indian notation pairs in the physical comparison task that seems to be attributable to a somewhat smaller perceptual discriminability in the physical sizes of the Indian numbers and, as such, has no theoretical importance.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, we corroborated the results of Experiment 1 by using the same\u2013different task with numbers in Arabic and Indian notations. As mentioned earlier, a CDE was found in the physical same\u2013different task of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995) only for same-notation pairs and not for different-notation pairs. As acknowledged by the authors, the absence of a CDE for the latter might be explained at least in part by the fact that an Arabic number and a number word are highly dissimilar perceptually, and this enabled participants to respond quickly to the task, leaving little opportunity for the irrelevant numerical value to affect performance. The use of two sets of numerical symbols in Experiment 2 was expected to make the physical same\u2013different task harder and to enable exploring the presence of a CDE under less speeded conditions.\nIt should be noted that the same\u2013different and the comparisons tasks, although similar, each provide a unique piece of informa-\ntion, as the latter provides information on the numbers cardinality, whereas the former provides information about the numbers ordinality.\nThere was a procedural difference between these tasks. In the former, the stimuli were presented on the screen until the participant\u2019s response, whereas in latter task, used by Dehaene and Akhavein (1995), the stimuli were presented for 200 ms. To test the effect of exposure duration, we presented the number pairs on the screen for 200 ms for half of the participants in Experiment 2, whereas for the other half, we presented the numbers pairs on the screen until the participant\u2019s response. All participants performed both the numerical and the physical same\u2013different tasks."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Thirty-two students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. All of them were native speakers of Arabic who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. They participated either for course credits or payment.\nStimuli. The stimuli set was created following the method of Experiments 1 and 2 of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995). The 12 experimental pairs were composed of the Digits 1, 2, 8, and 9. There were three categories of numerical difference in this set: pairs with zero numerical difference (11, 22, 88, 99), pairs with a numerical difference of 1 (12, 21, 89, 98), and pairs with a numerical difference of 6 and larger (18, 19, 28, 29, 81, 91, 82, 92). In the numerical same\u2013different task, to equalize the frequency of trials from each difference category, the pairs with the numerical difference of 0 were presented four times each, the pairs with the numerical difference of 1 were presented four times each, and the pairs with the large numerical difference were presented twice each, thus creating a block of 48 trials. Each number was about 13 mm high and 9 mm wide. The distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm. Each number in each pair could be presented in either Arabic or Indian notation. There were thus three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic\u2013Indian and Indian\u2013Arabic pairs), creating an experimental set of 48 4 192 trials. Following Dehaene and Akhavein, to prevent participants from focusing exclusively on the Numbers 1, 2, 8, and 9, we added 72 distracting trials using the Digits 3\u20137. The distracting trials were not analyzed. Please note that the frequency of \u201csame\u201d responses in the numerical same\u2013 different task was 33% in the experimental set, but it was 48% in the whole set (including the fillers).\nIn the physical same\u2013different task, the four pairs with a numerical distance of 0 in both the Arabic and Indian notations appeared eight times because of a programming error instead of four times as in the numerical comparison task. Thus, the experimental set included 224 instead of 192 trials, with 29% being \u201csame\u201d responses. With the additional 106 filler trials, the frequency of \u201csame\u201d responses was 40%. In any case, the critical comparison was always within the \u201cdifferent\u201d trials, thus making the difference in the percentage of \u201csame\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d responses less important.\nApparatus. The apparatus was identical to that of Experiment 1. Procedure. The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the numerical and the physical same\u2013 different tasks, with the order of tasks counterbalanced across\nparticipants. The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms.\nIn the numerical same\u2013different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were the same in terms of their values, irrespective of notations. In the physical same\u2013 different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were physically identical. In both tasks, they had to press the \u201cA\u201d key for a \u201csame\u201d response and the \u201cL\u201d key for a \u201cdifferent\u201d response. A few examples of same-notation and different-notation pairs were presented following the instructions for each task along with the correct responses. Participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials. For 16 participants, the numbers in both tasks were flashed for 200 ms, and for the rest, they remained on the screen until the participant\u2019s response."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Numerical same\u2013different task. Means of RT of correct responses and of ER for \u201cdifferent\u201d trials were submitted separately for two two-way ANOVAs, with notation (Arabic, Indian, Mixed) and numerical difference (small, large) as within-participants variables, and order of task (first vs. second) and exposure duration (200 ms vs. unlimited) as across-participants variables. Less than 0.1% of the trials were excluded from the RT analyses because of RT being shorter than 200 ms or longer than 2,500 ms.\nAs can be seen in Figures 4A and 4B, performance was enhanced in pairs with large compared with small intrapair numerical difference in both RT, F(1, 28) 26.69, MSE 5,845, p .001, and ER, F(1, 28) 8.69, MSE 0.001, p .01, revealing a CDE consistent with the one found in Experiment 1. In the analysis of ER, the CDE was present for Arabic and Mixed notations pairs but was absent for Indian notation pairs, F(2, 56) 4.09, MSE 0.002, p .05. Finally, responses were faster when the exposure duration was 200 ms compared with when it was unlimited, F(1, 28) 5.95, MSE 11,763, p .05.\nPhysical same\u2013different task. Two analyses were conducted on participants\u2019 responses to \u201cdifferent\u201d trials. The first was limited to different-notation trials, and it tested the prediction that processing the numbers\u2019 numerical value should impair participants\u2019 \u201cdifferent\u201d responses to different-notation pairs with the same numerical values compared with those with different numerical values. This effect is referred to as the value interference effect. The results of an ANOVA with numerical difference (0, small, large) as a within-participants variable and exposure duration and task order as between-participants variables confirmed this prediction. Responses for pairs with numerical difference of 0 were slower, F(1, 28) 13.08, MSE 8,124, p .005, and less accurate, F(2, 56) 33.40, MSE 0.006, p .001, than those for pairs with a small or large numerical difference, indicating the presence of the value interference effect (see Figures 5A and 5B).\nTo verify that this effect was not a product of the across-notation similarity of the Digits 1 and 9, we analyzed the different-notation pairs within the filler trials that included the Digits 3\u20137. Responses for pairs with numerical difference of 0 were again slower, F(1, 28) 12.23, MSE 4,581, p .005, than those for pairs with a small or large numerical difference (549 ms vs. 489 ms), demon-\nstrating the generality of the value interference effect. In addition, to rule out the idea that the value interference effect was a carryover effect from the numerical same\u2013different task, we analyzed the responses of the participants that performed the physical same\u2013 different task first and found a significant value interference effect in the RT, F(1, 14) 5.66, MSE 22,276, p .05, and ER of this group also, F(1, 14) 16.66, MSE 0.01, p .001.\nThe second ANOVA looked for a CDE, with notation and numerical difference as within-participants variables, and order of task and exposure duration as across-participants variables. Responses were faster when exposure duration was limited than when\nit was not, F(1, 28) 14.03, MSE 66,171, p .001. Performance was also faster when the physical task was conducted second rather than first, F(1, 28) 5.05, MSE 66,171, p .05. Importantly, there was no significant CDE. Finally, there were no significant effects in the analysis of ER (see Figure 5B)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "When the task required numerical matching, there was evidence for a translation of numbers presented in different notations into a common magnitude representation, as indicated by the CDE\npresent for different-notation pairs in measures of RT and ER. Essentially, identical results were obtained in Experiment 1 of the current study and by Dehaene and Akhavein (1995).\nWhen the task required physical matching, participants were slower and made more errors in responding \u201cdifferent\u201d for different-notation pairs with the same numerical values. This value interference effect suggests that participants processed the values of the numbers appearing in different notations, even when this was not required by the task. Interestingly, there was no evidence for a CDE.\nWe believe that the presence of the value interference effect together with the SiCE in Experiment 1 suggest that automatic numerical processing was taking place in the physical task and that the absence of a CDE is attributable to the sensitivity of our measures. The value interference effect reflects a difference in performance between congruent (different numbers in different notations) and incongruent (same number in different notations) trials. In the latter, the numerical and physical dimensions activate contrasting responses, which impair performance, relative to the congruent trials where the two dimensions activate the same response and therefore facilitate performance. In contrast, the CDE reflects a difference between two congruent conditions and therefore no activation of contrasting responses occurs, causing the effect to be weaker and less reliable. In addition, it has been shown in recent works that the distance effect depends on task demands and is not a mandatory product of conducting a numerical task (Goldfarb & Henik, 2007; Pinchas, Henik, & Tzelgov, 2007).\nGeneral Discussion\nThe main question posed by the present study was whether people automatically translate numerical information presented in different notations into a common representation of magnitude. On the basis of participants\u2019 responses to different\u2013notation pairs in both the physical comparison and same\u2013different tasks, we conclude that the answer to this question is positive.\nThe strongest evidence comes from the size comparison task (Experiment 1), showing a SiCE similar in magnitude for sameand different-notation pairs. In most cases, the SiCE increased with numerical difference, thus suggesting the activation of a number line. The results from the physical same\u2013different task (Experiment 2) showed a similar pattern, as performance was poorer in trials in which numbers with the same numerical values appeared in different notations compared with different numbers in different-notation trials. Note that whereas the former provides evidence for the automatic activation of ordinal information, the latter provides information for the activation of cardinality. Together, they suggest that a complete representation of numerical magnitude is created from numbers in different notations when such a representation is not required by the task.\nParticipants\u2019 performance in tasks requiring numerical processing, showing a CDE in both same-notation and different-notation pairs in the numerical comparison task (Experiment 1) and in the same\u2013different task (Experiment 2), is entirely consistent with the above conclusion and with the previous findings of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995) and Foltz et al. (1984).\nThe present results have implications for models of the representation of numerical information. As mentioned earlier, the preferred code model would predict stronger evidence for automa-\nticity in the Arabic than in the Indian notation, as participants are more skilled with this notation. This prediction is not born out by the current results, as there is no difference between performance in any of the tasks between Arabic and Indian notations.\nIn contrast, the abstract representation model of McCloskey that postulates the existence of an abstract numerical representation (e.g., McCloskey, 1992; McCloskey & Macaruso, 1995) would predict no difference in the indications for automaticity between same- and different-notation pairs. The present results, showing similar indications for automatic processing in all notations, are clearly in line with this prediction and, therefore, provide support for this model.\nThe current results can also be discussed in the context of the triple code model of Dehaene (1992), arguing for the existence of an analogue representation of numerical magnitude together with auditory and visual codes, with task requirement as an important factor determining which representation will be used. To accommodate for the present results, the model should be revised to have room for more than one visual code and should specify an automatic access to the analogue representation from all visual codes.\nFinally, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to look at the use of two sets of numerical notations, and specifically at the Indian notation. Such research opens up interesting issues for future investigation, such as bilingualism in numerical cognition and the effect of language characteristics on number processing.\nReferences\nBargh, J.

Magnuson University of Connecticut\nThe authors investigated semantic neighborhood density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of activation and competition among semantic representations. Experiment 1 validated featurebased semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.\nKeywords: semantics, neighborhood density, word recognition, attractor networks\nSemantic processing is a crucial, yet poorly understood, aspect of language processing. For example, there is general agreement that as a word is processed, related words and/or words with similar meanings are partially accessed or activated. However, the term similar meanings refers to very different relationships in different theories of semantic representation. The similarity structure of semantic representations goes to the very heart of knowledge and meaning\u2014how knowledge is organized determines which concepts are similar or related and which ones are not. There are at least five approaches to semantic representation that propose strikingly different bases for semantic representations and consequently for the similarity relations among concepts. Category-based hierarchical approaches (e.g., Anderson, 1991; Collins & Loftus, 1975) define similarity in terms of category membership and location in a hierarchy. Embodied cognition approaches (e.g., Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg & Robertson, 2000) define similarity in terms of perceptual or action-based overlap. Association-based semantic network approaches define similarity in terms of connections defined by subject report (e.g., empirically collected association norms; Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 2004) or expert opinion (e.g., Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, Jarmasz & Szpakowicz, 2003; Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005). Textual co-\noccurrence-based vector representations (e.g., Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Lund & Burgess, 1996; Rohde, Gonnerman, & Plaut, 2004) define similarity in terms of cross-correlations of word co-occurrence. Semantic microfeature-based representations (e.g., McRae, Cree, Seidenberg, & McNorgan, 2005; Rogers & McClelland, 2004; Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, & Garrett, 2004) define similarity in terms of empirically determined feature overlap.\nDespite concerted efforts over the last few decades, there is surprisingly little empirical basis for claiming that any one of these approaches captures the nature of human semantic representations. In part, this is because most studies of the structure of semantic knowledge have examined pairwise semantic similarity relations using paradigms such as priming, similarity ratings, and cued recall. This approach provides a measure of the similarity between any two concepts but risks missing the forest for the trees. An alternative, larger scope approach is to examine the effects of semantic neighborhood density (SND) or size\u2014the number and/or proximity of neighboring representations\u2014on word recognition. Analysis of neighborhood effects shifts the focus from the effect of a single related word on processing of the target word to the effect of the set of all similar words. Recent studies (Buchanan, Westbury, & Burgess, 2001; Siakaluk, Buchanan, & Westbury, 2003; Yates, Locker, & Simpson, 2003) taking this approach found that visually presented words in large or dense semantic neighborhoods were recognized faster than words in small or sparse neighborhoods.\nExaminations of the effects of phonological and orthographic neighborhoods have a longer history. Written words with many orthographic neighbors (e.g., Sears, Hino, & Lupker, 1995) or phonological neighbors (Yates, 2005; Yates, Locker, & Simpson, 2004) are identified more quickly than words with few neighbors. In contrast, spoken words in dense phonological neighborhoods are identified more slowly than words in sparse neighborhoods (e.g., Luce, 1986; Luce & Pisoni, 1998). This contrast suggests that neighbors can have both facilitative and inhibitory effects, reflecting two opposing principles: Perceptual familiarity facilitates word recognition (i.e., items with many neighbors are more\nDaniel Mirman and James S.

Because spoken words are ambiguous at onset (e.g., /k\u00e6/ could be the beginning of nearly 800 different words), competitor words with similar onsets can become active and compete for activation, thus (potentially) accentuating the competitive aspects of neighborhoods. In contrast, a visual word is presented all at once, so disambiguating information is available from the beginning, thus (potentially) reducing competition and accentuating the facilitative aspects of neighborhoods. Preliminary evidence from a study that forces subjects to read words letter-byletter suggests that the difference between neighborhood effects in visual and spoken words results from parallel versus serial experience of words in the two domains (Magnuson, Mirman, & Strauss, 2007).\nFor orthographic and phonological neighborhoods, although individual metrics differ, there is an intuitive consensus that neighbors should be defined in terms of similarity of letters or phonemes (e.g., Luce & Pisoni, 1998; Sears et al., 1995). In contrast, the different approaches to semantics cited above give rise to radically different sets of primitives over which semantic distance can be defined. As a step toward developing a definition of semantic distance, Buchanan et al. (2001) compared two different measures of SND: one based on number of associates (derived from human participant generation of single associates to each target word; Nelson et al., 2004) and one based on mean distance to the 10 nearest neighbors according to the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model (derived from co-occurrence statistics extracted from a large corpus of text, such that words that occur in similar contexts have similar representations and are close in semantic space; Lund & Burgess, 1996). Buchanan et al. found that the HAL-based measure was a better predictor of word recognition than the association-based measure and that the effect of SND was weaker for high frequency words. These results suggest that co-occurrence statistics capture neighborhood effects more accurately than semantic associates do (Balota, Cortese, SergentMarshall, Spieler, & Yap, 2004, also found weak effects of number of semantic associates). However, although association-based and co-occurrence-based approaches to semantic representation both tell us what concepts are similar (i.e., neighbors) and provide a measure of similarity, neither reveals why particular concepts are similar. For example, the associates of car include exemplars (e.g., Toyota), superordinate terms (e.g., transportation), other vehicles (truck, train, etc.), interaction-related words (drive, ride), and various descriptive words (fast, expensive, etc.). It is intuitively clear that these are all related to car, so association norms are capturing relatedness (in fact, association norms and co-occurrence statistics provide excellent fits to behavioral word-pair similarity ratings; e.g., Rohde et al., 2004), but the various associates have radically different relationships to the target word, and therefore, the underlying similarity structure remains opaque.\nIn contrast to the opacity of association norms and cooccurrence statistics, representations based on semantic features explicitly encode the microstructure of semantic representations. Although feature norms do not capture the full complexity of semantic knowledge, they do capture a portion of that space at a level of detail that has a more transparent relationship to underlying similarity structure. Feature-based semantic representations are\ndeveloped by asking human participants to generate features of a target concept (e.g., McRae et al., 2005, had subjects generate up to 10 features for many concepts; see also McRae, de Sa, & Seidenberg, 1997; Vigliocco et al., 2004). Models that represent semantic knowledge in terms of features provide powerful accounts of semantic priming (e.g., Cree, McRae, & McNorgan, 1999; Vigliocco et al., 2004), category-specific impairments (e.g., Cree & McRae, 2003), deterioration of semantic knowledge in progressive semantic dementia (Rogers et al., 2004), and speech errors and picture\u2013word interference (Vigliocco et al., 2004). In general, feature-based models of semantic knowledge provide a coherent framework for understanding a very large set of phenomena (Rogers & McClelland, 2004). Crucially, with feature-based representations, similarity is defined by feature overlap, thus making the reasons for similarity explicitly available for analysis.\nWith respect to exploring neighborhood effects, feature-based measures of SND are potentially limited because the semantic neighborhood is strongly constrained to the items for which feature norms have been collected.1 Association-based semantic neighborhoods do not have this limitation because an associate need not have been normed to be part of the target\u2019s semantic neighborhood (e.g., type can be an associate of print if a participant produces it, regardless of whether associates were collected for type; in a feature-based system, type and print could be neighbors only if feature norms have been collected for both). Co-occurrence-based semantic neighborhoods are limited by the size of the corpus, but because the corpus is typically very large (e.g., over 1 billion words), this is a very weak constraint. Thus, feature-based measures allow a finer-grain analysis of a smaller set of words relative to association-based and co-occurrence-based measures.\nThe present work addresses three questions: (a). How well do feature-based, association-based, and co-occurrence-based measures of SND capture semantic neighborhood effects? (b). Are SND effects facilitative (as previously demonstrated), inhibitory, or both? (c). Does a simple attractor model of semantic access capture patterns of neighborhood inhibition and facilitation consistent with the behavioral data?\nIn Experiment 1 we tested a large set of words in two wordrecognition tasks and evaluated several measures of SND derived from feature-based, association-based, and co-occurrence-based semantic representations. The results suggested that, despite their limitations, SND measures based on feature representations are as good as those based on association norms and co-occurrence statistics at capturing the effects of semantic neighborhoods. Further, the results of Experiment 1 suggested a more complex story than simple facilitative or inhibitory effects. In Experiment 2 we specifically examined the independent effects of near and distant neighbors on semantic access and found that distant neighbors tend to have facilitative effects on semantic access and near neighbors tend to have inhibitory effects on semantic access. Finally, analyses of settling rates in a simple attractor model of semantic access (Cree, McNorgan, & McRae, 2006) revealed that distant neighbors have early and transient facilitative effects and near neighbors have lasting inhibitory effects on settling, consistent with the\n1 Collecting and coding feature norms is a time-consuming task; the 541 item McRae et al. (2005) corpus is the result of a massive multiyear project and is the largest publicly available feature norm corpus.\nhuman data. These results suggest that neighborhood effects can be understood by considering the specific impact of neighbors on attractor dynamics.\nExperiment 1\nThe central goal of Experiment 1 was to examine the effects of SND in a relatively global manner. Specifically, we compared measures of SND derived from feature-based semantic representations to previously used measures derived from co-occurrenceand association-based representations. To provide the best basis for examining SND effects, we tested the 532 unique words from McRae et al. (2005) in lexical decision and semantic categorization (living thing judgment) tasks. In the following sections we first describe the six measures of SND that we tested and provide simple comparisons of the measures, then we describe the experimental methods and results, and finally we discuss how the results match and conflict with previous studies of SND and the implications of these results."}, {"heading": "Measures of SND", "text": "Measures based on feature norms. The McRae et al. (2005) feature norm corpus contains 541 concepts (532 unique names) covering a broad range of living and nonliving concepts used in studies of semantic memory. Thirty participants from McGill University and/or the University of Western Ontario produced features for each concept. There were 2,526 unique features listed. Thus, each concept can be represented by a 2,526-element binary vector in which the elements code whether or not each feature was produced for each concept. These vectors are very sparse, ranging from 6 to 26 features for each concept (M 13.4, SD 3.52).\nMeasures 1\u20133 comprise our basic set of feature-based measures of SND. The first two measures are feature-based versions of a discrete number of neighbors measure (like number of associates) and a graded distance measure (like distance to neighbors in HAL); the third measure has been previously found to index the tightness of concept clusters (e.g., Cree & McRae, 2003). We also tested several embellishments of these basic measures (such as word frequency weighting, feature production frequency weighting, and feature distinctiveness weighting), but these embellishments did not improve the amount of variance captured by the measures.\n1. Number of Near Neighbors (NumNear) is the number of concepts that have more than half of the target\u2019s features. The 50% threshold was chosen to balance between lower thresholds\u2019 tendency to eliminate the distinction between similar concepts and near neighbors and higher thresholds\u2019 tendency to eliminate all neighbors.2 Note that this measure is asymmetric: If Concept A is a near neighbor to Concept B, Concept B is not necessarily a near neighbor of Concept A (i.e., if A has many features and B has few, and A and B overlap on half of B\u2019s features, the proportion of overlap will be high for B but lower for A). It is possible that semantic neighborhood relations are in fact asymmetric, which would be captured by this metric; symmetric similarity would be captured by another of our measures of SND.\n2. Mean Cosine (MeanCos) is the mean cosine between target\u2019s feature vector and the feature vectors for every other item in the corpus. Cosine is a nonlinear measure of similarity that varies (for\nbinary vectors) from 0 (no shared features) to 1 (identical feature vectors) and provides a symmetric measure of distance that reflects the similarity between active features in the target and neighbor.\n3. Proportion of significantly correlated feature pairs (PropCorrPairs) is the proportion of feature pairs in the object\u2019s representation that tend to co-occur in the corpus (i.e., they share at least 6.5% of their variance; see McRae et al., 2005, for details). Objects with a greater proportion of co-occurring features should have nearer neighbors because their features tend to come in groups (i.e., they co-occur), and thus their feature overlap will tend to be greater. These correlations were based on vectors containing production frequency values (i.e., number of participants [maximum of 30] that produced this feature for this concept) rather than on binary feature vectors, which were used to compute NumNear and MeanCos. Production frequency feature vector versions of NumNear and MeanCos produced virtually identical results, so the simpler measures are reported here.\nMeasures based on association norms. The University of South Florida free association norms (Nelson et al., 2004) contain associates produced for each of 5,019 target words. For each word, an average of 149 participants were asked to write the first word that came to mind that was meaningfully related or strongly associated to the presented word. As in previous studies (Balota et al., 2004; Buchanan et al., 2001; Yates et al., 2003), we defined the set of associates generated for each target as its semantic neighborhood.\n4. Number of Associates (NumAssoc) is the number of associates for each target in the University of South Florida association norms. Previous studies found that words with more semantic associates were recognized more quickly (Balota et al., 2004; Buchanan et al., 2001; Yates et al., 2003). Because 125 of the McRae et al. (2005) items were missing from the University of South Florida association corpus, we excluded them from these analyses. Excluding these items from all analyses did not change the pattern of results, so we included all the McRae et al. items for all other analyses.\nMeasures based on co-occurrences. Recently, Rohde et al. (2004) proposed a semantic representation called the Correlated Occurrence Analogue to Lexical Semantic (COALS) that is similar to HAL (Lund & Burgess, 1996) in that it is also based on co-occurrence statistics from a very large corpus (1.2 billion word tokens representing 2.1 million word types taken from Usenet). COALS differs from HAL primarily in implementing a normalization technique to reduce the impact of high frequency closed class and function words and in ignoring negative correlation values when computing representation vectors (on the intuition that a target word\u2019s meaning is not informed by words that occur in very different contexts). COALS provides a better fit to behavioral word-pair similarity ratings and multiple-choice vocabulary\n2 Because concepts typically have few features, a low threshold will count merely similar items as near neighbors. For example, cheetah has 13 features; at a threshold of 30% shared features, it has 28 near neighbors\u2014a set that includes most of the mammals in the corpus, but at a threshold of 50% shared features, the near neighbor set is reduced to just the large predators. In general, as the threshold increases, the distribution of semantic neighborhood densities collapses towards 0 (i.e., at a sufficiently high threshold all concepts have no near neighbors).\ntests (see Rohde et al., 2004), so we used COALS rather than HAL. We calculated semantic distance based on 500-element vectors (Rohde et al. used singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors) using the Rohde et al. method: square root of the correlation between semantic vectors.3\n5. Mean Distance Within Set (COALS) is the mean semantic distance to nearest 10 neighbors (cf. Buchanan et al., 2001) within the McRae et al. (2005) item set. A measure based on mean distance to all items in the McRae et al. set produced the same results, so we report the statistic most similar to the one used by Buchanan et al., who found that words with closer near neighbors (i.e., denser semantic neighborhoods) were recognized more quickly. One item (dunebuggy) was missing from the COALS corpus and was excluded from these analyses.\n6. Mean Distance Among All Items (COALS_all) is the mean distance to nearest 10 neighbors within the 100,000 most common words in the COALS corpus.\nInitial comparisons of SND measures. Before testing the SND measures, we explored two related questions about the measures themselves. (a). Were the neighbors identified by the different measures the same or different? (b). Was there evidence that the limited size of the feature-norm corpus limits semantic neighborhoods? Table 1 shows partial correlations among measures of SND after controlling for word frequency (HAL [Lund & Burgess, 1996] frequency norms, which Balota et al., 2004, found to be the best word frequency predictor of word recognition in young adults), length (in letters, phonemes, and syllables), bigram frequency, Coltheart\u2019s N (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, & Besner, 1977), and number of features. Computing partial correlations removes correlations among SND measures caused by control variables (e.g., two SND measures might be correlated because they are both correlated with word frequency) and allows the similarity between semantic neighborhood measures qua semantic neighborhoods to emerge. Not surprisingly, SND measures tend to cluster with measures based on the same underlying representations. One interesting deviation from this pattern is the strong negative correlation between MeanCos and PropCorrPairs, though both are positively correlated with NumNear. We examined more closely the neighborhoods formed by the different measures, separately for distance-based measures (MeanCos and COALS) and number-based measures (NumNear and NumAssoc).\nSemantic neighborhoods defined by COALS_all were very different from semantic neighborhoods defined by MeanCos: These mea-\nsures shared on average less than 1 of the 10 nearest neighbors. Semantic distance increased more rapidly across the nearest neighbors for MeanCos than for COALS_all. That is, according to the COALS_all measure, the second nearest neighbor was about 8.5% less similar to the target than the nearest neighbor; this decrease was 16% for MeanCos. For the 10th nearest neighbor (the farthest item included in the COALS_all neighborhood), this decrease was still only 25% for COALS_all but was 44% for MeanCos. For example, for sheep, the 10 nearest neighbors according to MeanCos are (with semantic distance in parentheses) as follows: lamb (0.60), cow (0.47), goat (0.44), skunk (0.32), squirrel (0.31), fawn (0.30), donkey (0.29), otter (0.29), moose (0.28), and pig (0.28); according the COALS_all the 10 nearest neighbors are as follows: bleating (0.78), goats (0.75), cows (0.71), cattle (0.71), herds (0.65), herders (0.64), oxen (0.61), goat (0.60), herd (0.59), and ruminants (0.59). As this example demonstrates, the faster drop-off in similarity for feature-based measures could be due simply to neighbors that are missing from the feature norm corpus (e.g., about half of the COALS_all neighbors for sheep are not in the feature norm corpus); nonetheless, it demonstrates that feature-based representations are much more sensitive to differences in semantic similarity than co-occurrence-based measures. The very high positive correlation between COALS and COALS_all (r .6) suggests that this is not merely an effect of the constraints of the McRae et al. (2005) corpus: When a COALS-based SND measure is computed from just the McRae et al. results, it produces nearly the same result as one computed based on the 100,000 most frequent words. Rather, it seems that feature-based representations are intrinsically more sensitive to semantic distance (we discuss possible reasons below).\nThe number of near neighbors (NumNear: M 0.9, SD 2.3) was consistently smaller than the number of associates (NumAssoc: M 13.5, SD 5.0). Only 8 of the items had more near neighbors than associates, and 273 items had 0 near neighbors (this large proportion of concepts with 0 \u201cnear neighbors\u201d severely limits the variability of this measure and puts it at a predictive disadvantage; however, as described below, this measure reveals an interesting and unique effect of near neighbors, thus validating the use of the relatively strict criterion). Of the 143 items that had\n3 Correlation and cosine vector distance measures are equivalent, though the square root makes this distance measure different from the one used to compute MeanCos.\nTable 1 Partial Correlations Among Measures of SND\nSND measure NumNear PropCorrPairs MeanCos NumAssoc COALS COALS_all\nNumNear \u2014 .39*** .30*** .11** .06 .06 PropCorrPairs .39*** \u2014 .23*** .02 .19*** .17*** MeanCos .30*** .23*** \u2014 .04 .11** .21*** NumAssoc .11** .02 .04 \u2014 .12** .03 COALS .06 .19*** .11** .12** \u2014 .60*** COALS_all .06 .17*** .21*** .03 .60*** \u2014\nNote.

In sum, it seems that for some items, feature-based semantic neighborhoods are very similar to associate-based semantic neighborhoods, but for other items the two semantic representations yield very different semantic neighborhoods. As with the distance-based measures, the smaller number of feature-based neighbors than associates could be due to neighbors that are missing from the feature-norm corpus and/or to feature-based measures\u2019 greater sensitivity to semantic similarity.\nIn addition to corpus size, feature norms also differ in terms of the corpus contents. The McRae et al. (2005) feature norm database contains only basic-level concepts, such as \u201cdog\u201d and \u201cchair\u201d; thus the potential neighborhood is limited to other basic-level concepts, such as \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ctable,\u201d respectively. In contrast, association norms and co-occurrence measures can, and do, produce neighborhoods that include parts (e.g., \u201clegs\u201d for table), features (e.g., \u201cgreen\u201d for grass), and categories (e.g., \u201cpet\u201d for cat) as neighbors. If semantic representations are structured such that basic-level terms have substantially different representations than features, parts, and so forth, then these different concepts would be distant neighbors, not near neighbors. This is another way in which feature-based representations may allow a distinction between near and distant neighbors that is obscured or missing from association-based and co-occurrence-based semantic representations.\nThese analyses comprise a preliminary comparison of the semantic neighborhoods defined by different representations of lexical semantics. They show that association-based, co-occurrencebased, and feature-based representations produce quite different semantic neighborhoods and that the limitations of feature-norm corpora may underestimate semantic neighborhood size and may reflect greater sensitivity to semantic similarity. Experiment 1 was designed in part to test whether the corpus size limitation undermines the ability of feature-based representations to capture SND effects."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. All participants were native English speakers and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The semantic categorization task was completed by 17 participants, and the lexical decision task was completed by 44 participants (22 participants randomly assigned to each half of the words). All participants were undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut who received course credit for participating.\nStimuli. The critical stimuli were the 532 unique orthographic forms in the McRae et al. (2005) feature norm database. These items were chosen to present the strongest test of feature-based representations. For the lexical decision test, 532 pronounceable nonwords were created that were matched in length to the words, and the items were divided into two lists of 532 items each (266 words, 266 nonwords) to keep the overall number of trials per participant equal for the two tasks and avoid fatigue effects.\nProcedure. Stimuli were presented visually in 18-point black Courier font on a white computer screen background using E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). We used a 17 in. (43.18 cm) cathode ray tube monitor with\na refresh rate of 100 Hz and a resolution set to 800 600 pixels. Each trial began with a central fixation cross on screen for 1 s, then the stimulus was presented centered horizontally and vertically and remained on screen until the participant responded (or until 5 s had elapsed). Each participant completed either the lexical decision version of the experiment or the semantic categorization version. These tasks were chosen to examine basic word-recognition accuracy and latency in one task that requires semantic access (semantic categorization) and one task that, in principle, does not (lexical decision). The experiment was completed in one session lasting approximately 20 min. Before beginning the critical block, participants completed a 20-trial practice session. In the lexical decision task, participants were asked to indicate whether each item was a word; in the semantic categorization task, the participants were asked to indicate whether each word referred to a living thing or a nonliving thing."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "None of the participants correctly identified budgie as a living thing, and only 13% correctly identified it as a word,4 so this item was excluded from analyses. In addition, trials on which reaction time (RT) was more than two standard deviations away from the overall mean were excluded from analyses (3.6% of lexical decision trials and 3.9% of semantic categorization trials). Overall accuracy was high in both tasks (lexical decision, 95.1% correct; semantic categorization, 94.0% correct), and mean RTs were 655 ms for lexical decision and 763 ms for semantic categorization. In the lexical decision task all critical items received \u201cyes\u201d responses, but in the semantic categorization task critical items included both \u201cyes\u201d (living) and \u201cno\u201d (nonliving) responses; however, there was no difference in RT between \u201cyes\u201d (living) and \u201cno\u201d (nonliving) responses, Mliving 761 ms, SDliving 140 ms; Mnonliving 764 ms, SDnonliving 112 ms; t(530) 0.3, p .76; thus, the two types of items were combined in semantic categorization analyses (separate analyses are reported in Appendix A). Only trials on which a correct response was provided were included in the RT analyses.\nThe left section of Table 2 shows independent correlations between error rate and mean RT and control variables5 (top section) and measures of SND (bottom section). Not surprisingly, word frequency and length had strong correlations with both error rate and RT, particularly for the lexical decision task. Number of features (words with more features tend to be recognized more\n4 Budgie is a nickname for budgerigar, a small parrot that is a popular pet in Canada, where the feature norms were collected, but apparently unknown to University of Connecticut undergraduates.\n5 Two other control variables were examined: age of acquisition (AoA) and semantic congruency of orthographic neighbors (Pecher, Zeelenberg, & Wagenmakers, 2005; Rodd, 2004). Semantic congruency had no significant correlation with any dependent measures after word frequency was controlled, so it is omitted from analyses reported here. AoA captured unique variance, but it did not affect the variance captured by measures of SND. AoA measures (Gilhooly & Logie, 1980; Stadthagen-Gonzalez & Davis, 2006) are available for less than half of the McRae et al. (2005) words, thus including AoA as a control variable in the analyses would undermine the effort to provide a large-scale examination of SND effects. Because including AoA as a control variable did not affect the amount of variance captured by measures of SND, those analyses are not reported here.\nquickly, presumably because they have more robust semantic representations; see Pexman, Holyk, & Monfils, 2003) was also strongly correlated with error rate and RT in both tasks.\nWhen the effects of word frequency, length, and number of features were partialled out, orthographic neighborhood (Coltheart\u2019s N) no longer had significant correlations with error rate or RT for either task, and orthographic familiarity (bigram frequency) was significantly correlated only with lexical decision RT. Measures of SND also had significant correlations in one or both tasks (Table 3). This finding suggests that when the effects of word frequency and length are controlled, semantic neighborhoods play at least as large a role in visual word processing as orthographic neighborhoods do, and semantic neighborhoods are especially important when the task explicitly requires semantic access (semantic categorization relative to lexical decision). This conclusion must be tempered by the unique composition of our stimulus set, though weak or nonsignificant effects of orthographic neighborhood were also found in experiments testing a very large set of words (Balota et al., 2004).\nThe bottom right section of Table 2 shows partial correlations (controlled for word frequency, number of letters, number of phonemes, number of syllables, bigram frequency, orthographic neighborhood, and number of features) between error rate and RT and the measures of SND (analogous semipartial correlation results were virtually identical to partial correlation results). For the lexical decision task, NumAssoc and NumNear had marginal partial correlations with accuracy, and NumNear and COALS had reliable correlations with RT. The COALS correlation was negative, indicating faster word recognition in denser semantic neighborhoods, which is consistent with previous findings (Balota et al.,\n2004; Buchanan et al., 2001; Siakaluk et al., 2003; Yates et al., 2003). In contrast, the NumNear correlation was positive, indicating slower RT in denser semantic neighborhoods, a result that has not been found previously. For the semantic categorization task, MeanCos and COALS_all were significantly correlated with RT.\nNote.

Feature-based measures of SND captured as much RT variance in both lexical decision and semantic categorization tasks as association-based and co-occurrence-based SND measures did. Note also that in the case of ambiguous words (e.g., homophones) feature norms were collected on disambiguated words (e.g., bat\u2014baseball), but association norms and co-occurrence measures do not make this distinction, just as the tasks used in this experiment did not disambiguate the stimulus words. Featurebased SND measures predicted unique variance in lexical decision and semantic categorization data despite this disadvantage and the limitations of the corpus. In general, the results indicate that feature-based measures of SND are at least as good as previously used association-based and co-occurrence-based measures of SND.\nIn general, SND effects emerged more clearly in RT than in accuracy measures, which is consistent with the high accuracy and consequently low error rate variability in both tasks. There was more variability in accuracy for semantic categorization than for lexical decision, though this variability was largely due to ambiguous items, such as foods. That is, many foods are ambiguous with respect to their status as a living thing (e.g., corn, potato), although even relatively unambiguously not-alive foods (e.g., pickle, raisin, bread) and some nonliving but highly living-related concepts (e.g., beehive, shell are natural kinds that house living things) also had low semantic categorization accuracy scores. These low semantic categorization accuracy items did not have systematic SND biases (the low-accuracy item set SND was less than 0.5 standard deviations from the overall mean SND according to all SND measures), but these task effects call for caution in interpreting our semantic categorization results. However, the qualitative similarity between semantic categorization and lexical decision results (e.g., significant partial correlations were all in the same direction for each measure) suggests that the semantic categorization results are not due to possible \u201cliving thing\u201d task artifacts.\nOur results replicate and extend previous studies of semantic neighborhood effects. Two of our SND measures (COALS and MeanCos) replicate previous findings of facilitative SND effects (Balota et al., 2004; Buchanan et al., 2001; Siakaluk et al., 2003; Yates et al., 2003). The COALS semantic representations are based on the same principles as HAL (which has previously been used to show facilitative SND effects), so this replication indicates that peculiarities of the items, tasks, or participants we tested cannot account for differences between our findings and previous studies. Specifically, the inhibitory effects of SND as measured by NumNear and COALS_all must be due to what those measures index, that is, differences with regard to which aspects of semantic neighborhoods are captured by the different measures. The inhibitory/facilitative difference also cannot be due strictly to underlying semantic representations because the feature-based MeanCos measure showed facilitative effects, unlike NumNear (COALS and\nCOALS_all show a similar reversal). One possible explanation for this reversal is that the NumNear measure captures a different aspect of semantic neighborhood structure than is captured by MeanCos.\nOne way that measures of neighborhood density may differ is in the impact of near neighbors versus distant neighbors. Semantic similarity distributions generally exhibit power law distributions, that is, concepts tend to have a few very near neighbors and many distant neighbors. One way to examine whether near or distant neighbors are the primary contributors to a particular measure of SND is to examine correlations between the measure of SND and number of neighbors according to the most liberal definition of semantic neighbor possible: items sharing at least one semantic feature. Because of the overwhelming number of distant neighbors, this liberal \u201cnumber of neighbors\u201d (different from NumNear, which is number of near neighbors) measure primarily reflects the number of distant neighbors. There was a strong positive correlation between number of neighbors and MeanCos (r .88, p .001), suggesting that the latter primarily reflects the number of distant neighbors. Because MeanCos is computed over the entire corpus, a concept with many additional (say, 100 more) distant neighbors (which will have low but nonzero cosine distances) will have a higher neighborhood density than a concept with a few additional near neighbors (which would have cosine distances of say, .75).\nIn contrast, a threshold-based measure such as number of near neighbors (NumNear) is not influenced by distant neighbors (the correlation with number of concepts sharing at least one feature was not significant, r .003, p .95); by definition, NumNear is most sensitive to the near neighbor structure. In sum, these analyses suggest that MeanCos and NumNear capture different aspects of semantic neighborhoods; specifically, NumNear reflects near neighbors, and MeanCos reflects distant neighbors. We found facilitative effects of MeanCos and inhibitory effects of NumNear, suggesting that near neighbors inhibit processing and distant neighbors facilitate processing.\nFor the COALS-based measures the near\u2013distant distinction may also explain the paradoxical pattern of results. Co-occurrence vectors are defined over a very large corpus, and the McRae et al. (2005) corpus reflects only a very small sample of that space. Thus, it is possible that because the COALS measure was restricted to just the 10 nearest neighbors within the McRae et al. corpus, it captured the effect of relatively distant neighbors (in co-occurrence vector space), but the COALS_all measure captured the distance to the 10 nearest neighbors in the entire co-occurrence vector space and was thus more sensitive to near neighbors.\nOne way to test the hypothesis that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects is to examine correlations between semantic categorization and lexical decision RT data and number of near and distant neighbors. This type of analysis requires a continuous measure of similarity, so we used cosine distance between feature vectors. Defining \u201cnear\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d neighbors requires a threshold, such that near neighbors would be those with cosine greater than the threshold, and distant neighbors would be those with cosine lower than the threshold but greater than zero (i.e., sharing some, but not many, features). We tested the correlations between RT in the two tasks, and near and distant neighborhood size was defined by three thresholds (.25, .5, and .75). Figure 1 shows that the results were consistent with an inhibitory effect of near neigh-\nbors (positive correlations) and a facilitative effect of distant neighbors (negative correlations, statistically reliable only in the semantic categorization task). We designed Experiment 2 to test the hypothesis suggested by these correlational results using a matched experimental manipulation of near and distant neighborhood size and a semantic task that avoids the pitfalls of living thing judgments.\nExperiment 2\nThis experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that near semantic neighbors have an inhibitory effect and distant semantic neighbors have a facilitative effect on visual word processing. To test this hypothesis, we selected four sets of items and indepen-\ndently manipulated the number of near and distant neighbors while matching the items on all other criteria."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Procedure. Experiment 1 results suggested that SND effects would emerge more strongly in a semantic task than in a lexical decision task but that items such as foods are ambiguous with respect to their status as a living thing. To avoid this problem while still using a semantic task, we used a concreteness judgment task in Experiment 2 (participants were instructed to indicate whether or not it was possible to touch the thing named on the screen). This task is less susceptible to ambiguity than the living thing task and all of the critical words referred to concrete things (see Table 4 for mean concreteness values for each condition; these values are on a 100\u2013700 scale taken from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database; Wilson, 1988). In addition, there is some evidence that the use of a broad category makes for a more difficult semantic decision, thus encouraging more semantic processing and allowing semantic effects to emerge more clearly (Hino, Pexman, & Lupker, 2006). Consistent with this claim, in Experiment 1 we found stronger SND effects in the living thing judgment task relative to the lexical decision task, though the convergent results in the two tasks suggest that semantic neighborhood effects are relatively robust across tasks. The experiment began with 30 practice trials (with feedback; 15 concrete, 15 abstract trials) to familiarize participants with this task. Stimulus presentation details were the same as Experiment 1.\nMaterials. Twenty-five critical items were selected for each of four conditions: 2 (Many or Few Near Neighbors) 2 (Many or Few Distant Neighbors). Near neighbors were defined as having cosine greater than 0.5, distant neighbors were defined as having cosine less than .25 and greater than 0.0. For near neighbors, \u201cmany\u201d was defined as at least 2, and \u201cfew\u201d was defined as 0 or\n1; for distant neighbors, \u201cmany\u201d was defined as more than 200, and \u201cfew\u201d was defined as less than 150. These thresholds were chosen because they divided the corpus of words into four relatively equal groups with very different neighborhood properties, and each of the groups was big enough to allow selection of a subset for matching on various control variables. This manipulation produced items with different near and distant neighborhood sizes as measured by cosine distance but equivalent semantic neighborhoods as measured by number of associates and mean COALS semantic density (see Table 4). In addition, conditions were matched on word frequency, familiarity, AoA (AoA data [Gilhooly & Logie, 1980; Stadthagen-Gonzalez & Davis, 2006] were available for only 30% of the words), length (in terms of letters, phonemes, and syllables), orthographic neighborhood (Coltheart\u2019s N), number of semantically congruent orthographic neighbors, and number of semantic features, with approximately equal numbers of creatures, fruits and vegetables, and nonliving things in each condition. Control variables (including number of associates and COALS SND) did not differ reliably between conditions either in terms of analysis of variance main effects or interactions or in terms of pairwise comparisons. Condition means for critical and control variables are in Table 4, and the 25 words in each critical condition are in Appendix B. To balance the critical \u201cyes\u201d trials, we chose 100 filler words (\u201cno\u201d trials) from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Wilson, 1988) based on low (less than 400, values range from 100 to 700) concreteness and imageability scores (Mconcreteness 295; Mimageability 346) and matched to the critical words on length and frequency.\nParticipants. Twenty-two undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut completed the experiment for course credit. All participants were native speakers of English and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The word level (few near, few distant neighbors) was judged by all participants not to be concrete, so it was excluded from analyses.6 Accuracy was high, and there were no significant effects of number of near and distant neighbors (means and standard errors are in Table 5; all ps .25). Only trials on which a correct response was provided were included in the RT analyses. In addition, trials on which RT was more than two standard deviations away from the overall mean were excluded from analyses (4.1% of trials).\nFigure 2 shows the RT results for the four critical conditions. As predicted, words with many near neighbors were categorized more slowly than words with few near neighbors (24 ms), F1(1, 21) 17.3, p .001, partial 2 0.45; F2(1, 95) 4.6, p .05, partial\n2 0.05, and words with many distant neighbors were categorized more quickly than words with few distant neighbors (11 ms), F1(1, 21) 5.2, p .05, partial\n2 0.20; F2 1.

The condition effects are within-subjects but between-items, and thus the items analyses have less power. We found no apparent outlier items (item means are in Appendix B), suggesting that the subjects effects (F1) were not driven by a few outlier items and that the weaker effects by items (F2) were indeed due to differences in statistical power."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "As in Experiment 1, our results replicate previous findings of facilitative effects of SND and provide new data casting those findings as part of a more complex pattern of SND effects. Our results suggest that previous findings of facilitative SND effects were primarily driven by distant neighbors. The fine grain of feature-based semantic representations revealed a novel finding: Near neighbors exert inhibitory effects on semantic access.\nTraditional views of neighborhood density effects cannot account for these results because these results do not simply reflect competition (inhibitory effects) or familiarity (facilitative effects). Rather, the results reveal a complex interplay of neighbor distance and number such that inhibitory and facilitative effects occur simultaneously. We interpret these results in terms of an attractor model of semantic processing. The results suggest that distant\n6 In the McRae et al. (2005) feature norm collection study, all target items were concrete objects, which would encourage participants to list features for the concrete meaning of level. In the context of our concreteness judgment task, the abstract meaning, which is perhaps more common for college students, was activated. Because all participants responded that level was not concrete, including it in the analyses would merely distort the accuracy data, it would have no effect on the RT data because only correct response RTs are included. We also note that the conditions are equally well-matched on control variables (frequency, length, etc.) if level is removed from the list. Level was included in model analyses because this ambiguity does not affect model performance, though excluding it had no qualitative effect on model behavior.\nneighbors create a gradient or gravitational force for faster settling into attractor basins, and near neighbors create conflicting subbasins and increase the likelihood of hitting a saddle point, which slows the completion of the settling process. In the following section we analyze an attractor-based computational model to test whether inhibitory effects of near neighbors and facilitative effects of distant neighbors could indeed be due to attractor dynamics.\nAnalysis of a Computational Model\nTo test the hypothesis that the inhibitory effects of near neighbors and the facilitative effects of distant neighbors could be due to attractor dynamics, we examined the settling patterns in an attractor model of semantic access (settling patterns were from the model reported by O\u2019Connor, McRae, & Cree, 2006; see Cree et al., 2006, for model architecture and training details). O\u2019Connor et al. (2006) trained the model to activate the appropriate semantic features for each of the 541 basic level concepts in the McRae et al. (2005) norms and for 20 superordinate category names (see O\u2019Connor et al., 2006, for details). The input layer represented arbitrary \u201corthographic\u201d input patterns (3 random units turned on among the 30 input units) and was fully connected to a semantic layer. The semantic layer consisted of one unit for each semantic feature, and each of the semantic units was connected to all other semantic units (with no self-connections). To compute a word\u2019s meaning, its word form was presented at the input layer, and activation propagated to the semantic layer for 20 ticks. To put the network in a neutral starting state that is generally consistent with most units being turned off (on average only 0.5% of feature units should be active), before a word form was presented, semantic unit activations were set to a random value between 0.15 and 0.25. At each tick, error was computed using the cross-entropy measure.\nWe tested the effect of near and distant neighbors on settling by examining the correlations between number of near and distant neighbors and cross-entropy error (CEE) at each tick. Model settling corresponds to decreasing error, thus, at every tick a positive correlation with neighborhood indicates that the neighbors are having an inhibitory effect (i.e., having more neighbors is associated with higher error), and a negative correlation indicates a facilitative effect of neighborhood (i.e., having more neighbors is associated with lower error). We computed correlations between normalized CEE7 and number of distant and near neighbors across all 541 concepts (similar to the analysis of Experiment 1 data, see Figure 1) at each tick. As for the behavioral data in Experiment 1, we used three definitions of \u201cnear\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d neighbors based on cosine similarity thresholds. Near neighbors were defined as having minimum cosine thresholds .25, .5, or .75; distant neighbors were defined as having nonzero cosine less than .25, .5, or .75.\nThe results (Figure 3) showed a strong positive correlation with number of near neighbors that tends to increase over processing, consistent with an inhibitory effect of near neighbors (more near neighbors was associated with higher CEE). The correlation with distant neighbors was generally around 0 and not reliable, except for a clear dip to the negative side around tick 10 (reliable only with the stricter .25 maximum cosine threshold, which was used in Experiment 2). This dip is consistent with a transient facilitative effect of distant neighbors (more distant neighbors was associated with lower CEE) at an intermediate point in processing.\nAs a second test of the model, we examined model RTs for the words tested in Experiment 2. For behavioral tests it was critical to match the words on a variety of control variables such as word frequency, length, and so forth. However, this basic model is not sensitive to those properties, so we also tested the full set of words divided into the four design cells according to the thresholds used in Experiment 2 to define near versus distant neighbors and many versus few neighbors. The four sets of items were matched on the two factors that would impact model performance: number of features and concept familiarity. This approach produced 39 words with many near and many distant neighbors, 60 words with many near and few distant neighbors, 60 words with few near and many distant neighbors, and 92 words with few near and few distant neighbors, thus increasing the critical item set from 100 words to 251 words. Because the model analyses are restricted to the weaker by-items analysis (in Experiment 2 by-subjects analyses were stronger than by-items analyses), this increase in number of items is an important increase in power.\nWe assume that behavioral response probability is some monotonic function of cognitive states related to cross-entropy error, that is, that participants respond when they have come sufficiently close in semantic space to the representation of the presented word. This was operationalized by setting a CEE response threshold and computing the number of ticks required for the model to come within the threshold normalized CEE level (this approach is typical for measuring RTs in attractor models [e.g., Cree et al., 1999], and more dynamic measures, such as minimum CEE reached and number of ticks required to reach minimum CEE, produced exactly the same pattern of results). We set the threshold at 0.2, but the model behavior is quite orderly, and a relatively large range of\n7 Normalization (dividing raw CEE by the maximum CEE for each item) removes the effects of model starting state. Conceptually, normalized CEE corresponds to proportion of the distance from the target state (activation of all and only the correct features) to the starting state of the model.\nthresholds would produce the same qualitative pattern. The results for the Experiment 2 items are shown in the left panel of Figure 4 and the results for the full set of words are shown in the right panel of Figure 4. The model was consistent with the behavioral data: The model responded faster to words with fewer near neighbors (triangles lower than squares), Experiment 2 set, F(1, 96) 2.3, p .13; full set, F(1, 247) 25.8, p .001, partial 2 0.094; and to words with more distant neighbors (lines angle up from left to right), Experiment 2 set, F(1, 96) 1.9, p .17; full set, F(1, 247) 4.1, p .05, partial 2 0.016. There was no interaction (both Fs 1) between number of near and distant neighbors in the model data.\nIn sum, the model results demonstrate that an attractor model exhibits the contrasting inhibitory effect of near neighbors and facilitative effect of distant neighbors. These results suggest that the effect of neighbors on processing depends on their specific influence on an attractor surface that must be traversed in order to reach the target attractor, providing further support to attractorbased models as a promising approach to understanding semantic processing.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn Experiment 1 we found that feature-based SND measures capture unique variance (i.e., beyond seven control factors such as word frequency and length) in lexical decision and semantic categorization accuracy and latency. Despite the comparatively limited corpus for which feature norms are available, our featurebased measures performed as well as measures based on association norms and co-occurrence statistics did. Although each of the three approaches to semantic representation has strengths and weaknesses, feature-based representations provide a set of primitives, namely semantic microfeatures, for further exploration of the structure of semantic knowledge and the most transparent (albeit limited) theoretical link to the basis of semantic similarity.\nThe results of Experiment 1 showed an intriguing partial conflict with previous studies of SND: Some measures captured a facilitative effect of SND, consistent with previous results, but other measures captured an inhibitory effect of SND. Post-hoc\ncorrelational analyses suggested inhibitory effects of near neighbors and facilitative effects of distant neighbors. We tested this hypothesis directly in Experiment 2, in which near and distant neighborhood sizes were manipulated independently. The results of Experiment 2 confirmed that near neighbors tend to slow word processing and distant neighbors tend to speed word processing. We proposed that this complex pattern arises due to the consequences of near and distant neighbors on attractor dynamics: Distant neighbors create a gradient that facilitates settling to the correct attractor, and near neighbors are competitor attractors that delay word recognition.\nAs a test of this proposal, we analyzed the settling patterns of a simple attractor model of semantics trained on the 541 concept feature norm corpus. The results showed a relatively early transient facilitative effect of distant neighbors and a persistent and increasing inhibitory effect of near neighbors. This is precisely the pattern that would be predicted from the general attractor dynamics perspective that we proposed. Independent manipulation of near and distant neighborhood size revealed that the model does exhibit the inhibitory effect of near neighbors and the facilitative effect of distant neighbors. These results suggest that attractor dynamics are a promising approach to understanding how neighborhood structure impacts word recognition because they capture the opposite effects of near and distant neighbors.\nThe opposite effects of near and distant neighbors mirror the opposing forces of familiarity facilitation and competitor inhibition and should apply to phonological and orthographic processing in addition to semantic processing. In speech perception researchers have also found both types of effects (Luce & Large, 2001), but they have attributed them to different processes or levels (Vitevitch & Luce 1999; see also Lipinski & Gupta, 2005). Specifically, Vitevitch and Luce (1999; also Luce & Large, 2001) argued that the inhibitory lexical neighborhood effects are due to competition at the lexical level and the facilitative phonotactic effects are due to sublexical benefits of familiarity. Both lexical neighborhood density and phonotactic probability capture aspects of phonological neighborhood density, but the measures are slightly different (though highly correlated) and seem to capture opposite effects, much like our different SND measures. Our analyses of semantic neighborhood effects suggest that both facilitative and inhibitory effects may arise from the same level depending on how distant and near neighbors impact attractor structure. Based on these results, we hypothesize that phonotactic probability measures may be capturing a facilitative influence of distant phonological neighbors, and lexical neighborhood density may be capturing an inhibitory influence of near phonological neighbors.\nOrthographic neighborhood effects are generally thought to be facilitative (e.g., Sears et al., 1995), but there is at least one example of inhibitory orthographic neighbor effects: inhibition due to transposed-letter neighbors (e.g., Andrews, 1996). Words such as salt, which have a transposed-letter neighbor (slat) are processed more slowly than carefully matched words (sand). The standard definition of an orthographic neighbor is a word that differs from the target word by a single letter (e.g., Sears et al., 1995). The contrasting effects of transposed-letter neighbors and replaced-letter neighbors are consistent with the near/distant neighbor distinction under the hypothesis that transposed-letter neighbors (e.g., salt\u2014slat) are nearer in orthographic representa-\ntional space than replaced-letter neighbors (e.g., salt\u2014sale). Future research will test this hypothesis directly.\nThe feature norm corpus used in the present experiments contained only concrete basic-level concepts, but the feature-based approach to semantic representation is not limited to just these types of words. For example, Vigliocco et al. (2004) developed a single feature-based semantic representational space for objects and actions, including both action verbs (e.g., to scream) and action nouns (e.g., the trade). Their key assumption was that the semantic representations of even relatively abstract words are grounded in our interactions with the environment and in partly modality-specific representations (see also Barsalou, 1999, for a comprehensive theory of grounding semantic knowledge in perceptual processes). Abstraction is correlated with a variety of semantic factors that affect neighborhood structure (e.g., number of features [Pexman et al., 2003], hierarchical structure [e.g., Breedin, Saffran, & Schwartz, 1998], and cross-correlation of feature pairs). These factors suggest that abstract concept representations are more sparsely distributed in semantic space, suggesting that facilitative distant neighbor effects should dominate. However, it is possible that because abstract concepts have vaguer representations (fewer features, possibly broader attractors), there is more potential for near neighbor interactions. Behavioral and computational tests are required to adjudicate between these conflicting hypotheses.\nIn sum, our results support two related points. First, among the different theories of semantic processing, those that can be cast as nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by attractor dynamics will be best able to capture the effects of neighborhood density, particularly the opposite effects of near and distant neighbors. In attractor models such as the one we analyzed (Cree et al., 2006; O\u2019Connor et al., 2006), these effects emerge naturally in the course of the settling process. It may also be possible to build the opposite effects of near and distant neighbors into models that do not have intrinsic nonlinear dynamic attractor properties (e.g., semantic networks based on association norms or categorical hierarchies), though we see this approach as ad-hoc and less parsimonious. Our results suggest that inhibitory effects of near neighbors and facilitative effects of distant neighbors are a property of attractor dynamics and would emerge in attractor-based models regardless of the underlying representation. Thus, we do not rule out association norms (or other semantic representations) as possible characterizations of semantic knowledge; rather we argue that these representations must be recast in attractor-dynamic terms in order to account for the present data. Second, traditional formulations of neighborhood effects\u2014be they phonological, orthographic, or semantic\u2014must be reconsidered in terms of nonlinear dynamic attractors, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative neighborhood effects to emerge without assigning them to different levels of processing.\nReferences\nAnderson, J.

The pattern of results closely corresponds to the overall data (see Table 2), but SND effects are much stronger for living things than for nonliving things (note also that statistical power is reduced by choosing smaller subsets of items; thus, some correlations that were reliable in the overall analysis are not reliable here). The difference in SND effects between living and nonliving things is generally not due to differences in SND variability\u2014the standard deviation for each SND measure is very similar ( 30%) for living and nonliving things (the one exception is NumNear [number of near neighbors], for which the standard deviation is more than five times greater for nonliving things than for living things). Critically, the opposing pattern of facilitative SND effects based on some measures (MeanCos [mean cosine] and COALS [Correlated Occurrence Analogue to Lexical Semantic, mean distance within set]) and inhibitory SND effects based on other measures (NumNear and COALS_all [mean distance among all items]) emerges here as well, although these effects appear to be largely driven by the living things.\nTable A1 Error Rate and Mean RT Partial Correlations for the Six SND Measures in Lexical Decision (LD) and Living-Thing Semantic Categorization (SC) Separately for Living Things and Nonliving Things\nVariable\nLiving things Nonliving things\nError RT Error RT\nLD SC LD SC LD SC LD SC\nBasic feature-based measures of SND NumNear .11 .06 .13* .02 .17*** .02 .13** .04 MeanCos .04 .28*** .13* .21*** .05 .07 .04 .02 PropCorrPairs .08 .12* .06 .14* .02 .02 .01 .00 Association-based measure of SND NumAssoc .03 .11 .17* .11 .17*** .10 .05 .07 Co-occurrence-based measures of SND COALS .09 .31*** .27*** .06 .03 .02 .02 .04 COALS_all .03 .39*** .09 .20*** .07 .10* .00 .04\nNote.

Schmidt and Derek Besner University of Waterloo\nThe item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) effect refers to the observation that the Stroop effect is larger for words that are presented mostly in congruent colors (e.g., BLUE presented 75% of the time in blue) and smaller for words that are presented mostly in a given incongruent color (e.g., YELLOW presented 75% of the time in orange). One account of the ISPC effect, the modulation hypothesis, is that participants modulate attention based on the identity of the word (i.e., participants allow the word to influence responding when it is presented mostly in its congruent color). Another account, the contingency hypothesis, is that participants use the word to predict the response that they will need to make (e.g., if the word is YELLOW, then the response is probably \u201corange\u201d). Reanalyses of data from L. L. Jacoby, D. S. Lindsay, and S. Hessels (2003), along with results from new experiments, are inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis but entirely consistent with the contingency hypothesis. A response threshold mechanism that uses contingency information provides a sufficient account of the data.\nKeywords: contingency learning, Stroop, proportion congruent, ISPC, attention\nResearch on contingency learning has deep roots in both the animal learning and cognitive psychology literatures (e.g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972; Shanks, 2007). One popular domain for this approach in cognitive psychology is the Stroop paradigm. The standard Stroop effect refers to the well-replicated finding that participants take longer to identify the print color of an incongruent color word (e.g., the word GREEN printed in red; GREENred) relative to a congruent color word (REDred; Stroop, 1935; see MacLeod, 1991, for a review). The magnitude of the Stroop effect changes when the proportion of congruent items is manipulated (Lowe & Mitterer, 1982). In particular, the magnitude of the Stroop effect increases as the proportion of congruent trials increases. The standard account of the influence of proportion congruent trials is that the detection of these proportions allows participants to modulate attention to the word, thereby changing the size of the Stroop effect (e.g., Cheesman & Merikle, 1986; Lindsay & Jacoby, 1994; Lowe & Mitterer, 1982). However, Schmidt, Crump, Cheesman, and Besner (2007) have suggested that contingency learning provides a sufficient account of the proportion congruency effect. In this article, we first provide a reanalysis of data from Jacoby, Lindsay, and Hessels (2003). We then report new experiments from our own laboratory whose\nresults are consistent with the contingency hypothesis of Schmidt et al. but are very problematic for the long-standing modulation hypothesis. Possible mechanisms by which participants use contingency information to control responding are considered, and one of them is tested. Both the response time and error data are consistent with this proposed mechanism. We suggest that the modulation account of the proportion congruency effect, dominant for over 20 years, has run its course. Instead, we argue that the data are better understood in terms of contingency learning.\nProportion Congruency and the Modulation Hypothesis\nA number of experiments (Cheesman & Merikle, 1986; Lindsay & Jacoby, 1994; Lowe & Mitterer, 1982) have shown that the magnitude of the Stroop effect can be modulated by varying the proportion of congruent trials. Specifically, the Stroop effect is larger when most of the trials in the experiment are congruent (high proportion congruent) than when most of the trials are incongruent (low proportion congruent). The standard explanation of this effect (Cheesman & Merikle, 1986; Lindsay & Jacoby, 1994; Lowe & Mitterer, 1982), here termed the modulation hypothesis, is that participants strategically modulate attention to the word depending on the proportion of congruent items. For instance, when the word and color match most of the time (high proportion congruent), participants attend to the word more than usual. This will speed up responses on congruent trials (increased facilitation) and slow down responses on incongruent trials (increased interference), making for a larger Stroop effect. In contrast, when the word and the color mismatch most of the time (low proportion congruent), participants make a greater effort to ignore the word. This serves to decrease both facilitation from congruent words and interference from incongruent words, making for a smaller Stroop effect. Thus, the modulation account holds that participants use information about proportion congruency to drive James R.

For instance, Lowe and Mitterer (1982) concluded that their findings \u201cdemonstrate the strategic modulation of selective attention\u201d (p. 698), and Lindsay and Jacoby (1994) stated that the effect \u201csuggests that when most items are incongruent, subjects somehow inhibit the influence of word-reading processes, relative to when most items are congruent\u201d (p. 225).\nAlthough intuitively appealing, the modulation hypothesis has difficulty explaining some findings. Given the assumption that participants modulate attention to the word, it would be expected that this modulation would be experiment-wide. That is, words should be ignored throughout a low proportion congruent block and attended to throughout a high proportion congruent block. However, Jacoby et al. (2003) manipulated proportion congruency for each item (i.e., each color word) such that some words were presented most often in their congruent color (e.g., BLUEblue) and other words were presented most often in a particular incongruent color (e.g., ORANGEyellow). A proportion congruent effect was still observed, even though high and low proportion congruent stimuli were intermixed in the same block of trials. Jacoby et al. labeled this finding the item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) effect. As Jacoby et al. point out, this finding is difficult to accommodate within the modulation hypothesis framework, because it would have to be assumed that participants are modulating attention to the word on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the identity of the word (e.g., if the word is BLUE, then the word is attended, but if the word is ORANGE, then the word is ignored). In essence, to defend the modulation account it would have to be maintained that participants decide whether to attend to the word after they have already read it.\nResponse Prediction and the Contingency Hypothesis\nA different account of the ISPC effect, here termed the contingency hypothesis, is that participants implicitly learn contingencies (i.e., correlations) between words and responses and then use these contingencies to predict the specific response associated with each distracting word (Schmidt et al., 2007). For instance, if the word ORANGE is presented most often in yellow, then upon processing the word ORANGE participants will (unconsciously) predict that the correct response is \u201cyellow.\u201d This response prediction allows participants to shortcut some processing (thus speeding responding) when the predicted response is the correct one. When a word accurately predicts the correct response (e.g., BLUEblue, where BLUE is presented most often in blue), we call this a high contin-\ngency trial. When the word predicts the wrong response (e.g., BLUEgreen), we call this a low contingency trial. When the word does not predict a specific response (e.g., PINKbrown, where PINK is presented equally often in all colors), we call this a medium contingency trial.\nWe are not, of course, the first to point to a role for contingency in the Stroop task. Dishon-Berkovits and Algom (2000; see also Melara & Algom, 2003; Sabri, Melara, & Algom, 2001) have argued that when words and colors are correlated, participants will pick up on this cue, attend to the content of the word, and use that content to aid responding. For instance, in three experiments using a word\u2013word version of the Stroop task, Dishon-Berkovits and Algom demonstrated that a Stroop effect is observed only when the correlation between words and colors is nonchance. According to these authors, when the correlation is chance, participants do not attend to the content of the distracting word. Although their account is not as specified as the current account (indeed, their argument could even be construed as a variant of the modulation hypothesis), their work is important because it highlights the importance of correlated events on responding.\nAlthough the modulation hypothesis has difficulty explaining the ISPC effect, the contingency hypothesis does not. According to the contingency hypothesis, in the high proportion congruent condition responses to congruent trials will be faster than usual, because participants can use the word to successfully predict the response (e.g., BLUEblue; high contingency). The same advantage does not occur for incongruent trials in this condition because, for instance, BLUE does not accurately predict an incongruent \u201cgreen\u201d response (low contingency). Thus, by speeding congruent but not incongruent trials, the difference between incongruent and congruent trials (the Stroop effect) will be larger (i.e., relative to a condition where words are not predictive of responses). Similarly, in the low proportion congruent condition responses will be faster for incongruent items because participants can use the word to successfully predict the response (e.g., ORANGEyellow; high contingency). The same advantage does not occur for congruent trials in this condition because, for instance, ORANGE predicts a \u201cyellow,\u201d not an \u201corange,\u201d response (low contingency). Thus, by speeding incongruent but not congruent trials, the overall Stroop effect will be smaller.\nAccording to the contingency hypothesis, then, proportion congruency manipulations are confounded with contingency. Specifically, as demonstrated in Table 1, in the high proportion congruent condition the magnitude of the Stroop effect is inflated due to confounding higher word-response contingencies for the congruent (.75) relative to incongruent (.25) items. Similarly, in the low proportion congruent condition the Stroop effect is reduced due to\nconfounding higher word-response contingencies for the incongruent (.75) relative to congruent (.25) items. Fixing this confound is as simple as rearranging the cells in the design. Rather than comparing high contingency congruent trials with low contingency incongruent trials (the high proportion congruent condition), we can compare high contingency congruent trials (from the high proportion congruent condition) with high contingency incongruent trials (from the low proportion congruent condition). Similarly, rather than comparing low contingency congruent trials with high contingency incongruent trials (the low proportion congruent condition), we can compare low contingency congruent trials (from the low proportion congruent condition) with low contingency incongruent trials (from the high proportion congruent condition). After making this adjustment, the contingency hypothesis predicts a main effect of Stroop trial type (congruent, incongruent), a main effect of contingency (high, medium, low), and, more critically, no interaction between the two (given that we assume Stroop and contingency affect different processes). In contrast, the modulation hypothesis predicts an interaction because incongruent trials should be more affected by attention, given that the majority of the Stroop effect is interference, with little or no facilitation from congruent trials (see MacLeod, 1991, for a review).\nFacilitation and Interference\nThe contingency hypothesis claims that participants use response prediction to speed responses on high contingency trials. There are undoubtedly many mechanisms that could be proposed to explain how this occurs. For the purpose of this article, we test the a priori hypothesis that participants prepare for a response by simply lowering the threshold for the expected response and do not alter the threshold for any other. As shown in Figure 1, for instance, if the word ORANGE is presented most often in yellow, then presentation of the word ORANGE will lead the participant to reduce the threshold for a \u201cyellow\u201d response. Consequently, it will take less activation of this potential response for it to be made. This mechanism therefore predicts response time facilitation on high contingency trials (where the predicted response is correct) relative to medium contingency trials (where no prediction is made). However, no interference for response time is expected on low\ncontingency trials (where the predicted response is incorrect) relative to medium contingency trials, because on both low and medium contingency trials the response threshold for the correct response is maintained at the same level. For instance, if BLUE is presented most often in blue, then when participants are given the low contingency trial BLUEgreen they will see the word BLUE and expect a \u201cblue\u201d response. As such, the response threshold for the (incorrect) \u201cblue\u201d response will be lowered, but the threshold for the (correct) \u201cgreen\u201d response will not be changed. As a result, it will take just as long to make a correct \u201cgreen\u201d response as it would if no prediction were made. Critically, then, the contingency hypothesis predicts response facilitation, but not response interference for response times.\nIt is important to emphasize the reason that this account does not predict interference on low contingency trials. On a low contingency trial (e.g., BLUEgreen), the distracting word is predictive of a specific response (i.e., BLUE predicts a \u201cblue\u201d key response). Thus, the threshold for this predicted response will be lowered. However, the response threshold for the remaining colors (green, yellow, and orange) will be unaltered. Because the correct response (\u201cgreen\u201d) is not the predicted response (\u201cblue\u201d), correct response latencies will not be speeded.\nSummary\nThe first goal of the present investigation is to reanalyze the Jacoby et al. (2003) ISPC Stroop experiment to test predictions derived from the contingency hypothesis. Specifically, it is expected that the contingency effect and the Stroop effect reflect the action of distinct processes whose joint effects are additive on response time. Therefore (and contrary to the modulation account), there should be no interaction between Stroop trial type (congruent vs. incongruent) and contingency. That is, the size of the Stroop effect should be the same for words with .75 contingencies (i.e., high-proportion-congruent congruent words vs. low-proportioncongruent incongruent words) as it is for words with .25 contingencies (i.e., low-proportion-congruent congruent words vs. highproportion-congruent incongruent words) or any other contingency. Both congruent and incongruent trials should be faster in the high contingency condition, but the difference between congruent and incongruent trials should not vary with contingency. In a final analysis, high contingency and low contingency trials are compared to medium (chance) contingency trials to assess, respectively, facilitation and interference. On the basis of the response prediction mechanism, the expectation is that the contingency effect will be solely facilitative for response latencies. In other words, although there is a benefit in responding to items where the words have greater than chance contingencies, there is no cost in responding to items where the words have lower than chance contingencies.\nReanalysis 1: Jacoby et al.

Individual words were presented 75%, 50%, or 25% of the time in their congruent color, and in a selected incongruent color the\nremaining trials (i.e., each word appeared in two colors only). Further details on the method of this experiment can be found in the original article by Jacoby et al. (2003). For the purpose of these analyses, the means for congruent and incongruent trials in Experiment 2A of Jacoby et al. were rearranged as a function of word-response contingency: high (.75), medium (.50), and low (.25). Thus, the high contingency condition consists of congruent trials with high proportion congruent words and incongruent trials with low proportion congruent words, the medium contingency condition consists of congruent and incongruent trials with medium proportion congruent words, and the low contingency condition consists of congruent trials with low proportion congruent words and incongruent trials with high proportion congruent words."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The response latency data (along with the original organization of the data) are presented in Figure 2. A 3 (contingency; high, medium, low) 2 (Stroop trial type; congruent, incongruent) analysis of variance (ANOVA) for response latencies revealed a main effect for contingency, F(2, 30) 3.848, MSE 1,513, p\n.033, p 2 .204, and a main effect for Stroop trial type, F(1, 15) 35.235, MSE 4,902, p .001, p 2 .701. Critically, and as predicted, no interaction was observed between contingency and Stroop trial type, F(2, 30) .284, MSE 668, p .755, p\n2 .019. Although Type II error is always a concern when interpreting a null finding, the measure of effect size ( p\n2) indicates that the interaction term explains less than 2% of the variance in the results,1 thus reinforcing the claim that this is a true null (or at least very small) interaction.\nCongruent and incongruent trials for each contingency level were then averaged and planned comparisons were conducted to test the hypothesis that the entire contingency effect is driven by response facilitation on high contingency trials. As expected, there was a significant 24 ms advantage for high contingency trials (609 ms) relative to medium (chance) contingency trials (636), t(15) 2.293, SEdiff 11, p .036, p\n2 .260. The 1 ms numerical difference between medium contingency (636) and low contingency trials (635) was not significant, t(15) 0.180, SEdiff 10, p .859, p 2 .002."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of this reanalysis confirm the two hypotheses that follow from the version of the contingency hypothesis assumed here. First, the contingency effect and the Stroop effect (the difference between congruent and incongruent trials) act separately, in that these factors produce no interaction. Second, as predicted by the response threshold model, the contingency effect is entirely facilitative for response latencies. As discussed in the introduction, these findings provide further empirical support for this version of the contingency hypothesis, which holds that participants use distracter words to predict particular responses, thereby shortcutting some processing when this prediction is successful (high contingency trials) relative to when response prediction is unsuccessful (low contingency trials) or not attempted (medium contingency trials).\nThese findings undermine the modulation hypothesis, which asserts that participants modulate attention to the word on the basis of the proportion congruency of the distracter words. Of particular importance, if it is assumed that participants increase attention to the word on high proportion congruent trials, then not only should congruent trials (high contingency) be speeded relative to the chance condition due to increased facilitation (observed), but incongruent trials (low contingency) should be slowed relative to the chance condition due to increased interference (which was not observed). Similarly, if participants suppress the word on low proportion congruent trials, then not only should incongruent trials (high contingency) be speeded relative to the chance condition due to decreased interference (observed), but congruent trials (low contingency) should be slowed relative to the chance condition due to decreased facilitation (which was not observed). Further, because interference is substantially larger than facilitation in the Stroop task, incongruent trials should have been more influenced by attention than congruent trials, resulting in an interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type (which was also not\n1 Note that even a true random factor will explain some proportion of variance with a partial eta squared ( p\n2) due to maximization on random error. This is true of all measures of effect size, such as R squared (R2).\nobserved). Thus, these data support the contingency hypothesis, but are in important ways inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis.\nConsistent with our findings, Logan, Zbrodoff, and Williamson (1984; Experiment 3) reported a null interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type for a four-choice Stroop task with a standard experiment-wide proportion congruent manipulation. In that experiment, the difference in response latencies between high and low contingency congruent trials was the same as the difference between high and low contingency incongruent trials. Logan et al. also reported a pair of two-choice experiments (Experiments 1 and 2) in which an interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type was observed. This could be regarded as a potential problem for the contingency hypothesis described here. However, it is important to note that experiment-wide proportion congruency manipulations (two-choice especially) are subject to confounding sequential effects (i.e., trial-to-trial modulations of word reading). For instance, if the word on the previous trial was congruent, then the Stroop effect will be larger on the current trial (probably due to increased attention to the word; Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1992; see Schmidt et al., 2007, for a similar finding regarding sequential contingency effects). Given that more trials are preceded by a congruent trial in a high proportion congruent block than in a low proportion congruent block, it would seem that simple proportion congruency experiments are ill suited to test the present hypotheses.2 The ISPC paradigm used here, on the other hand, is able to rule out the sequential trial confounds, because each trial type is preceded by the same proportion of every type of trial (i.e., there are no systematic sequential confounds).\nReanalysis 2: Jacoby et al. (2003) Percentage Error\nThe above reanalysis of the response latency data demonstrates that when the proportion of congruent items is manipulated, the resultant variations in the size of the Stroop effect can be explained by a confound between contingencies and proportion congruency condition. Specifically, in the high and low proportion congruency conditions, congruent and incongruent trials are not matched for contingencies (as explained in the introduction). In the current section, we expand on the contingency hypothesis used to generate the predictions for the first analysis and test some novel predictions that fall out of this account. In particular, whereas the response threshold mechanism described earlier predicts only facilitation in response latencies, it predicts both facilitation and interference in errors. The reason that facilitation is predicted on high contingency trials for errors is the same as that for response times: The threshold for the correct (predicted) response is lower. Consequently, it takes less time to make a correct response, and it is highly unlikely that participants will make another (incorrect) response because of the relatively lower threshold for the correct response compared to the incorrect responses.\nHowever, unlike for latencies, where no response interference was expected, response interference is predicted for errors because the threshold for one of the competing (incorrect) responses is lowered relative to the correct response and to the other incorrect responses. For instance, for the stimulus BLUEgreen (where BLUE is presented most often in blue), the threshold for the \u201cblue\u201d response is lowered. However, the \u201cblue\u201d response is not the correct response. Thus, there is an increased probability that par-\nticipants will make an error and select this predicted incorrect response (\u201cblue\u201d) over the unpredicted correct response (\u201cgreen\u201d)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "There were 16 participants in Jacoby et al.\u2019s (2003) Experiment 2B. This experiment was identical in all respects to Experiment 2A, except that participants had only 550 ms (rather than 2,000 ms as in Experiment 1) to respond. This deadline procedure increases the number of errors, which increases the power to detect effects in the error data. For the purpose of these analyses, the means for congruent and incongruent trials in Jacoby et al.\u2019s Experiment 2B were rearranged as a function of word-response contingency: high (.75), medium (.50), and low (.25)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The percentage error data (along with the original organization of the data) are presented in Figure 3.

As expected, there was a significant 4.4% advantage for high contingency trials (32.3%) relative to medium (chance) contingency trials (36.6%), t(15) 1.854, SEdiff 2.4, p .042 (one-tailed), p\n2 .106, and a significant 5.2% disadvantage for low contingency trials (41.9%) relative to medium contingency trials, t(15) 2.315, SEdiff 2.3, p .035, p\n2 .156."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of the second reanalysis provide further support for the response threshold mechanism of the contingency hypothesis. Specifically, whereas only facilitation was observed in response latencies, both facilitation on high contingency trials and interference on low contingency trials were observed in the error data. It is atypical for an account to make differential predictions for response latencies and errors, so the present findings constitute strong and consistent support for the contingency hypothesis. The experiments that follow test even more fine-grained hypotheses generated from the contingency hypothesis.\n2 The issue of sequential trial confounds can become even more complicated given that all congruent trials have high contingencies and all incongruent trials have low contingencies in the high proportion congruent block, whereas the reverse is true in the low proportion congruent block.\nExperiment 1\nThe contingency hypothesis presented here holds that participants implicitly learn contingencies and implicitly use them to aid responding. Further, we proposed a mechanism whereby participants use contingency information to reduce the response threshold for the predicted response. This account predicts facilitation with no corresponding interference when response latency is the dependent variable but both facilitation and interference when errors are the dependent variable. Both of these predictions were borne out. Further, contingency effects operate separately from the Stroop effect, a finding supported by the null interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type. To further test the contingency hypothesis, in Experiments 1 and 2 we investigate contingency effects in the contingency learning paradigm developed by Schmidt et al. (2007) using color-unrelated words.\nIt could be argued that the size of the Stroop effect is only incidentally equivalent in the high, medium, and low contingency conditions. It could also be claimed that the failure to find increased interference in the high proportion congruent condition and decreased facilitation in the low proportion congruent condition is merely a Type II error. But the modulation hypothesis rests on the critical assumption that the reason for variations in the size\nof the Stroop effect is that participants detect the proportion of congruent items. The contingency hypothesis, on the other hand, makes no such claim. According to the contingency hypothesis, words and responses merely have to be correlated; color-related words are not necessary to observe contingency effects.\nIn that vein, Schmidt et al. (2007; see also Musen & Squire, 1993) have reported several experiments that provide further support for the contingency hypothesis interpretation of the ISPC effect by showing that contingency effects can be observed in the absence of a Stroop effect. In their experiments, color-unrelated words (e.g., MOVE) were presented most often in a given color (e.g., MOVE 75% of the time in blue, SENT 75% of the time in green, etc.). Key press responses were faster to high contingency trials (e.g., MOVEblue) than low contingency trials (e.g., MOVEgreen). Thus, the results of these experiments confirm that participants are able to use words (even when they are colorunrelated) to predict what response to make. This is a critical result, because the modulation hypothesis cannot accommodate these findings given that the words and colors have no congruency relation that can be used to decide whether or not to attend to the word.\nExperiments 1 and 2 use the Schmidt et al. (2007) paradigm to demonstrate contingency effects in the absence of any congruency relations. These experiments include a medium contingency condition (not used by Schmidt et al.) to demonstrate a facilitationonly pattern in the response latencies (Experiment 1) and facilitation and interference in errors (Experiment 2) to mirror the main effects observed in our reanalyses of Jacoby et al. (2003).\nExperiment 1 was a two-choice, rather than a four-choice, task (in part to ensure that the interactions observed by Logan et al., 1984, were not attributable to something more than sequential confounds). In Experiment 1, several color-unrelated words were presented most often in a randomly assigned color. For instance, SEVEN might be presented 75% percent of the time in blue and 25% of the time in green. Other words, for instance CHAIR, were presented in blue and green equally often. This type of manipulation creates high contingency (.75; e.g., SEVENblue), medium contingency (.50; e.g., CHAIRblue), and low contingency (.25; e.g., SEVENgreen) trials. Experiment 1 focuses primarily on response latencies, with the goal of replicating the facilitation-only pattern of results observed in Reanalysis 1.\nExperiment 2 uses the response deadline procedure used by Jacoby et al. (2003), in which participants are given a very short amount of time to respond so as to maximize errors, and thus the analysis focuses on the error data. Experiment 2 attempts to replicate the findings observed in Reanalysis 2 and tests new predictions from the response threshold model.

In addition, Experiment 2 tested a novel prediction from the contingency hypothesis. The argument for the presence of response interference on low contingency trials for errors is that because the threshold for the (incorrect) predicted response is lowered, participants will be more likely to erroneously select this predicted response rather than the correct response for the color. For instance, for the stimulus MEETgreen, where MEET is presented most often in blue, participants will predict a blue key response based on the word. This will result in the threshold for the \u201cblue\u201d response being lowered and will therefore increase participants\u2019 tendency to incorrectly make this response (i.e., because lowering a response threshold can be likened to loosening the trigger for this response to fire). An observation of response interference in errors supports the notion of a response threshold mechanism, but this account further predicts that the inflation of errors in the low contingency condition is due solely to an increase in the specific predicted response rather than a general increase in errors. For instance, in a four-choice task, we should expect increased blue key errors for the stimulus MEETgreen, but no increased yellow or orange key errors. Although yellow and orange would also be incorrect responses, they are not the predicted incorrect response. Thus, it should be expected that more than a chance number of errors in the low contingency condition (33% of incorrect responses) should be the predicted response.

To broadly characterize the data, although we were able to induce an adequately high rate of errors, contingency effects were small in this experiment. This may have been due to the relatively weaker contingency manipulation (.17\u2013.50 rather than .25\u2013.75) or\ndue to difficulty learning contingencies with such a brief response window.

Additionally, these analyses support the prediction of the contingency hypothesis that the interference effect in errors is due solely to the increase in errors for the predicted response: Participants made more of the predicted errors than expected by chance, and when this increase was controlled for there was no difference in errors for medium and low contingency trials. This is inconsistent with any version of the modulation hypothesis that we can think of and provides further support for the notion that participants use the contingencies between words and responses to reduce the response threshold for the predicted response.\nGeneral Discussion\nTwo new analyses of the data from Jacoby et al.\u2019s (2003) experiments along with the results of two new experiments converge with the results of other recent investigations (e.g., Schmidt et al., 2007) to confirm a simple contingency account of the ISPC effect (and probably the majority of the proportion congruent effect). When Stroop effects are analyzed as a function of the predictability of the words (i.e., contingency), Stroop trial type (congruent, incongruent) does not interact with contingency in either response time or error data. This finding confirms the view that the entire ISPC effect (i.e., the highly replicated interaction between proportion congruency and Stroop trial type) can be accounted for by a main effect of Stroop trial type and a main effect of contingency.\nReanalysis 1 and Experiment 1 also demonstrated that contingency effects are solely facilitative in response times. That is, high contingency trials are speeded relative to medium (chance) contingency trials, but there is no disadvantage for low contingency trials relative to medium contingency. These results are inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis, but are entirely as predicted by the contingency hypothesis. According to the contingency hypothesis, response time facilitation occurs because participants are able to successfully predict the correct response based on the word on these trials and shortcut processing by reducing the response threshold for the predicted response. This same mechanism further predicts facilitation for high contingency trials and interference for low contingency trials in errors. These predicted results for errors were observed in Reanalysis 2 of Jacoby et al.\u2019s (2003) data, as well as in Experiment 2. Error facilitation is predicted according to this account because the threshold for the correct response is lowered when it is predictable (i.e., on high contingency trials), and it is therefore less likely that participants will make any other response. Error interference is also predicted, because the response threshold for one of the incorrect responses is lowered when it is predictable (i.e., on low contingency trials), and it is therefore more likely that participants will make this particular error. Further analyses in Experiment 2 confirmed that the increase in errors in the low contingency condition is due solely to the increase in the specific predicted incorrect response."}, {"heading": "Conflict Monitoring", "text": "These findings have important implications for the conflict monitoring framework of Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, and Cohen (2001). Botvinick et al. propose that many of the effects observed in Stroop and Stroop-like paradigms can be explained by a conflict monitoring mechanism thought to lie in the anterior cingulate cortex. According to their account, the anterior cingulate cortex detects conflict when it occurs (e.g., when a word and display color indicate two different potential responses). After detecting conflict, attention is more stringently focused on the target. Through simulation work, Botvinick et al. have demonstrated that conflict monitoring can explain sequential Stroop effects (because attention to the target is increased following an incongruent trial) and the standard proportion congruent effect (because the greater number of incongruent trials in the low proportion congruent condition leads to more attention to the target dimension of color block-wide).\nClearly, the conflict monitoring account of the proportion congruent effect is a variant of the modulation hypothesis and suffers from the same shortcomings. In particular, the modulation hypothesis is unable to explain the ISPC effect, because the amount of conflict experienced prior to high and low proportion congruent trials is the same (i.e., because they are mixed within the same block). However, Blais, Robidoux, Risko, and Besner (2007) have presented a variant of the conflict monitoring account in which conflict is monitored separately for each item. For instance, each time YELLOW is presented as the distracter word, the level of conflict will be monitored. If YELLOW is presented most often in an incongruent color, then overall conflict will be high. As such, when YELLOW is again encountered, attention to the color will be highly focused, thus minimizing the impact of the word on performance. However, within the same block, BLUE may be pre-\nsented most often in its congruent color, resulting in low overall conflict for this word. As such, when the word BLUE is presented, attention to the color will not be as focused, thus allowing the word to impact performance relatively more. Blais et al.\u2019s variant of the conflict monitoring account can therefore explain the variations in the size of the Stroop effect when the proportion of congruent items is manipulated across items. But Blais et al.\u2019s account simulates only the interaction between proportion congruency and Stroop trial type, and not the various other characteristics of the data (e.g., the fact that the effect is driven by the speeding of congruent trials in the high proportion congruent condition and incongruent trials in the low proportion congruent condition). More critically, their account cannot explain why contingency effects are still observed with color-unrelated words: There is simply no differential conflict to monitor between the various conditions.\nAnother way the conflict monitoring model could be altered in an attempt to explain the ISPC effect is to turn learning back on and allow the system to learn contingencies by forming stimulus\u2013 response associations between words and colors. However, this change in the conflict monitoring model will still fail to simulate many of the results presented here. In particular, such a model would produce interference on low contingency trials in the response latencies, because the distracting word would activate an incorrect response (the \u201cpredicted\u201d response), which would compete with the correct response. For that matter, we see no way for this version of the conflict monitoring hypothesis to return qualitatively different results for response times and errors.\nIn summary, although the conflict monitoring model of Botvinick et al. (2001) provides a compelling explanation for sequential Stroop effects (which undoubtedly contribute to the simple proportion congruent effect), the weight of the evidence to date suggests that the ISPC effect is better explained by contingency learning. Further, although sequential (Trial n 1) effects contribute to the simple proportion congruent effect, it is our suggestion that the remainder (and bulk) of the effect is explained by contingency."}, {"heading": "Implications for Future Stroop Research", "text": "These results, successfully predicted by the contingency hypothesis, illuminate an error in the currently received conceptualization of proportion congruency manipulations. For instance, in the high proportion congruent condition of a two-choice task, congruent words with high contingencies (e.g., BLUEblue) are being compared to incongruent words with low contingencies (e.g., BLUEgreen). That is, words are 75% predictive of the correct response in the congruent condition, but only 25% predictive of the correct response in the incongruent condition. The reverse is true in the low proportion congruent condition, where congruent words with low contingencies (e.g., ORANGEorange) are being compared to incongruent words with high contingencies (e.g., ORANGEyellow). It is in this sense that Stroop effects (i.e., facilitation and interference resulting from conflict in meaning between related concepts) are confounded with contingency effects (i.e., prediction of responses based on word-response correlations).\nGiven that the contingency hypothesis explanation of the proportion congruent effect appears sufficient, it would be prudent to question the \u201cpurity\u201d of all Stroop effects emerging from method-\nologies with nonchance contingencies. Algom and colleagues have reached a similar conclusion (Dishon-Berkovits & Algom, 2000; Melara & Algom, 2003; Sabri, Melara, & Algom, 2001). The main methodological point is that, although nonchance contingencies may \u201cmaximize\u201d the size of the Stroop effect (and thus its detectability), the said Stroop effect measure is confounded with contingency effects. Thus, any data collected with such a design may not be applicable to the standard effect with chance contingencies. For instance, in a four-color Stroop task, each word should be presented in each color 25% of the time (which is typically not the case). Any deviation from such contingencies will necessarily confound Stroop effects with contingency learning effects. This methodological point applies to all paradigms in which contingency information may aid responding."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The results of two new analyses of work by Jacoby et al. (2003) along with the results of two new experiments disconfirm the generally accepted and intuitively appealing modulation hypothesis, which explains the proportion congruent effect in terms of control over attention allocated to processing the word. On the other hand, these analyses provide consistent support for the contingency hypothesis, which explains the proportion congruent effect in terms of the predictability of words (i.e., contingency). Specifically, the results are consistent with the proposed response mechanism in which participants decrease the threshold for the expected (high contingency) response. Of particular note, the contingency hypothesis successfully predicted differential results for response latencies and error rates.\nConfirmation of the contingency hypothesis will likely be associated with both frustration and excitement by researchers in cognitive psychology. The results may seem frustrating because they disconfirm the highly appealing modulation hypothesis and consequently bring into question the proper interpretation of the experiments that have made use of the paradigm over the last 25 years. On the other hand, these same results can be seen as exciting because they demonstrate the processing power, speed, and control of implicit processes.\nReferences\nBlais, C., Robidoux, S., Risko, E.

In Experiments 1 and 2, participants decided whether a probe matched a list item specified by its spatial location. Items presented at study in a different location (intrusion probes) had to be rejected. Serial position curves of positive, new, and intrusion probes over the probed location\u2019s position were mostly parallel. Serial position curves of intrusion probes over their position of origin were again parallel to those of positive probes. Experiment 3 showed largely parallel serial position effects for positive probes and for intrusion probes plotted over positions in a relevant and an irrelevant list, respectively. The results support a dual-process theory in which recognition is based on familiarity and recollection, and recollection uses 2 retrieval routes, from context to item and from item to context.\nKeywords: recognition, working memory, serial position curves, recollection, familiarity\nThe purpose of the research reported on in this article was to test two families of theories of recognition, single-process (SP) theories and dual-process (DP) theories, and to help specify in more detail the process or processes that lead to recognition decisions. In this research, I focused on short-term recognition as tested with immediate memory tasks such as the Sternberg paradigm (Sternberg, 1969). In this paradigm, participants are presented with a short list of items that are followed by a recognition probe after a delay of a few seconds at best.\nHere I use two variants of that paradigm called local recognition (Oberauer, 2003) and the modified Sternberg task (Oberauer, 2001). In local recognition, each list item was presented in a different frame on the screen. Recognition probes were then presented in individual frames, and participants decided whether each probe matched the item presented before in the same frame. The recognition decision therefore was local to the frame in which the probe appeared\u2014if the probe matched a list item in a different frame, it had to be rejected. In the modified Sternberg task, participants encoded two lists distinguished by their print color, and one of them was then declared as irrelevant. Recognition probes had to be compared with the relevant list, excluding the irrelevant list (see Figure 1).\nThese two experimental paradigms have two advantages. One is that they allow the researcher to separate item recognition from recognition of an item\u2019s relation to its context. To this end I distinguished three kinds of probes. Positive probes were list items that should be accepted. In local recognition, these were the list items that reoccurred in their old frames, and in the modified\nSternberg task, these were items from the relevant list. New probes were items that had not been presented in the current trial at all. Intrusion probes were list items that had been presented in the current trial but in the wrong context\u2014in a different frame in local recognition, or as part of the irrelevant list in the modified Sternberg task. Although they matched an item of the set currently held in working memory, they had to be rejected because of a mismatch in the relation between item and context.\nItem recognition is the ability to distinguish between positive probes and new probes; relational recognition is the ability to distinguish between positive probes and intrusion probes. In the local recognition paradigm and the modified Sternberg task (Oberauer, 2003, 2005), as in many other recognition paradigms (Gronlund, Edwards, & Ohrt, 1997; Gronlund & Ratcliff, 1989; McElree, Dolan, & Jacoby, 1999), relational recognition has proven to be harder than item recognition. This is reflected in intrusion costs: more false alarms are made to intrusion probes than to new probes, and correct rejections of intrusion probes are slower than those of new probes. The two theories investigated here address this fact in different ways.\nA second advantage of local recognition and of the modified Sternberg task is that accuracy and reaction times (RTs) can be analyzed by serial position in the list not only for positive probes but also for intrusion probes and, in the case of local recognition, even for new probes. In global recognition paradigms such as the traditional Sternberg task, negative (i.e., to be rejected) probes have no serial position because they bear no relation to any item on the list. In the local recognition task, however, new probes and intrusion probes can be analyzed by the serial position of the frame in which they are presented. For instance, let a list be A(1), B(2), C(3), with the letter representing the item and the digit in parentheses representing its frame. The probe D(2) would then be a new probe in serial position 2. In the modified Sternberg task, intrusion probes have a serial position in the irrelevant list. In this article I show that the two theories investigated here differ in their predictions for serial position effects on negative probes.

Their SP theory explains intrusion costs in experiments using negative probes closely similar to list items (e.g., the singular of a plural noun), and therefore it provides a potential explanation for intrusion costs in the two paradigms used here as well. The SP theory assumes that each item is represented as a conjunction of features, which I call an episode. Applied to the local recognition paradigm, the\nitem\u2019s identity can be regarded as one such feature, and its context (i.e., the frame in which it was presented) as another feature. The same holds for the modified Sternberg task, in which the color of each item can be regarded as a context feature.\nRecognition decisions are based on a global match value, which is computed as the summed similarity between the probe and all list episodes, weighted by a term for the memory strength of each episode that depends on its serial position:\nm i 1\nn\nSisimprobe,i (1)\nThe strength term Si in this equation depends on the experimental paradigm and will be unpacked below when I derive predictions for serial position effects for each paradigm.

For simplicity, I coded D as 0 for a match and as 1 for a mismatch between the probe and an episode on the relevant dimension.1 The free parameter u represents the weight of item matches relative to context matches, and the free parameter c represents the steepness by which similarity falls off with distance.\nTo compute predictions for accuracy and RTs, I used a simplified version of the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978; Wagenmakers, van der Maas, & Grasman, 2007). Details of my application of the diffusion model are given in the Appendix."}, {"heading": "Dual-Process Theory", "text": "DP theories assume that recognition decisions are based on two sources of information: familiarity and recollection (Atkinson, Herrmann, & Wescourt, 1974; Diana, Reder, Arndt, & Park, 2006; Mandler, 1980; Yonelinas, 2002). The terms familiarity and recollection are often used to describe subjective experiences associated with a recognition decision\u2014familiarity referring to a feeling of knowing the probe stimulus, and recollection referring to a memory of the episode when one has previously encountered that stimulus. Here I instead use these terms to refer to hypothetical mechanisms involved in generating recognition decisions, without making assumptions about accompanying subjective states or metamemorial judgments. Familiarity is a unidimensional quantity that is automatically assessed for each stimulus and that reflects the degree to which the same or a similar stimulus has been encountered recently. Recollection is the retrieval of an episode in which the present stimulus, or a similar one, has been encountered before. Whereas familiarity reflects memory only for the stimulus itself, recollection reflects memory for the stimulus in a specific context that defines the retrieved episode.\nApplied to the local recognition task and the modified Sternberg task, familiarity reflects the degree to which the probe matches one or several items represented in working memory: All probes matching a list item of the current trial can be assumed to be highly familiar, regardless of their context. For example, in the local recognition task, probes matching an item in the probed frame and probes matching an item in another frame are equally familiar. Recollection provides information about the context of a recently encountered probe\u2014for example, in which frame it was seen. Familiarity is sufficient for item recognition (i.e., for distinguishing between positive probes and new probes), but recollection is necessary for relational recognition (i.e., for distinguishing between positive probes and intrusion probes). Intrusion probes are more difficult to reject than new probes, according to DP theories, because in response to an intrusion probe, familiarity and recollection drive the decision tendency in opposite directions, whereas with new and with positive probes they cooperate toward the same response.\nFamiliarity could be assumed to vary with serial position\u2014for example, the strength of an item\u2019s representation might decay over\ntime (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), or the items at the beginning of a list might be encoded more strongly (Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002), but for simplicity I assume that familiarity has a constant value of 1 for all probes matching any list item (i.e., for all positive and intrusion probes), and 0 for all new probes. All serial-position effects therefore are assumed to arise from the recollection process.\nRecollection can use two directions of retrieval. Recollection1 functions by using the relevant context as a retrieval cue to recall the item or items associated to it. The recalled item or items are then compared with the probe. In the local recognition task, the relevant context is the probed frame, and recollection retrieves the item that has been presented in that frame. In the modified Sternberg task, the relevant context is a representation of the relevant list, and recollection is an attempt to recall all relevant list items. This process is modeled after theories of serial recall in which a representation of the list position to be recalled acts as a cue for the associated item (Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Henson, 1998).\nRecollection2 is the reverse process. The probe itself is used as a cue to retrieve the context to which it has been associated in the current trial, if it has been presented in that trial at all. If the retrieved context is not the relevant context, or if no context can be retrieved at all, the probe is rejected. For example, in the local recognition task, recollection would consist of retrieving the frame in which the probed item has been presented, and if that frame is not the frame that is presently probed, the item is rejected. Recollection2 is inspired by the recognition model of Sikstro\u0308m (2004), which is a SP model in which recognition decisions rely in part on the degree to which a list context can be retrieved from the probe as cue.\nTo formalize Recollection1, I assume that the probe is compared with each element of the set I of all items retrieved from the relevant context. The process returns a value of M 1 whenever the probe matches one item in that set, and of M 1 otherwise. This value is weighted by the strength SI of the item or items that determine the outcome\u2014in the case of a match, SI equals the strength of the matching item, and in case of no match, SI equals the average strength of all items in I:\nrec1 SIM probe,I . (3)\nRecollection2 is formalized in a similar way. The context retrieved using the probe as a cue is compared to the set C of all relevant contexts (i.e., the probed frame in local recognition, and the set of all serial positions of the relevant list in the modified Sternberg task). In case of a match, M 1, and in case of no match, M 1. If a context of origin can be retrieved for the probe, the strength term equals the strength of that context. If no context of origin can be retrieved, Recollection2 returns M 1 with strength SC 1:\nrec2 SCM probecontext,C . (4)\nThe outcomes of the two recollection processes are combined into a weighted sum to obtain an overall recollection value:\n1 In a more realistic model, Ditem would be graded by the similarity between the probe and each item, and Dctx would be graded by the temporal or ordinal distance between the probed serial position and the item\u2019s position, but this level of detail is not necessary for deriving the shape of the serial position function predicted by the SP model.\nrec d rec1 1 d rec2. (5)\nParameter d controls the relative weight of the two recollection directions. A special version DP1 can be derived by setting d 1, thereby using only the context-to-item route; a special version DP2 is derived by setting d 0, thereby using only the item-to-context route.\nFinally, the overall recognition signal is computed as a weighted sum of familiarity and recollection (see Go\u0308the & Oberauer, in press, for a detailed discussion of ways to integrate familiarity and recollection information):\nm f fam 1 f rec. (6)\nParameter f controls the relative weight of familiarity and recollection. Predictions for RTs and accuracies are derived by feeding m into the diffusion model, as explained in the Appendix.\nPredictions for Serial Position Curves in Local Recognition\nExperiments 1 and 2 used the local recognition paradigm, and in this section I address the derivations of predictions from the theories under investigation for this paradigm. Derivations for the predictions for the modified Sternberg task are addressed in the introduction to Experiment 3.\nIn the experiments with the local recognition task, each list was followed by six probes. There were two presentation conditions. In the serial condition, items were presented from left to right, and probes appeared in the same left\u2013right order. In the random condition, items were presented in random order across the frames, and probes were displayed in a new random order. Thus, in the random condition, serial position of presentation is deconfounded from serial position of test. I focus here on serial position of presentation\u2014that is, the order in which items are presented.\nWith one exception (position of origin of intrusion probes; see below), serial position is defined as the position of the probed frame in the presentation order. For example, in the random condition a list might be A(3), B(1), C(4), D(2). Frame 3 would then be assigned serial position 1; frame 1 would receive serial position 2; frame 4, position 3; and frame 2, position 4. Performance on a probe presented in frame 3 would contribute to accuracy and latency measures for serial position 1, performance on a probe in frame 1 would count toward measures for position 2, and so on.\nI assume that serial position affects the strength of a memory representation, denoted S in the preceding equations. The purpose of the present article is not to explain serial position effects (see Oberauer, 2003, for a discussion of explanations of serial position effects), so the models capture them in a purely descriptive way. I assume that after encoding a list, each item\u2019s strength is determined by a primacy gradient falling off exponentially from the start and a recency gradient falling off exponentially from the end. An additional factor to be taken into consideration is output interference. In the random condition of the present experiments, test position is uncorrelated with list position, so output interference is averaged out in the serial position curves. However, in the serial presentation condition, test position is perfectly correlated with list position, and this implies that items toward the end of the\nlist suffer more output interference. I model output interference as a linear decline in strength over test position. Taken together, the strength of the item in serial position i, tested at test position t, is\nS i,t P i 1 Rn i tN, (7)\nwhere n is the list length, P and R are free parameters for the steepness of the primacy and the recency gradient, respectively, and N is a free parameter for output interference. Thus, representations at the beginning or the end of the list are stronger than those in the middle of the list, and items become weaker when they are probed later in the test sequence."}, {"heading": "Predictions From the Single-Process Model", "text": "The mathematical expressions for the predictions from the two models are provided in the Appendix; here I give a verbal explanation. Positive probes match exactly one episode with regard to both content and position, returning a similarity value of 1. Similarity to all other episodes is fairly low, so global match will be largely determined by the matching item. That item\u2019s strength is determined by its serial position, with higher strength values in the primacy and recency portions than in the middle. Therefore, accuracies should show a U-shaped serial position curve, and RTs an inverse U-shaped curve.\nNew probes match one episode on the position dimension\u2014 namely, the episode involving the probed position, but they do not match that episode on the item dimension, so similarity to that episode will be substantially below 1. Similarity to all other episodes is again fairly small. The global match value will thus be low, but it will be somewhat higher in the primacy and recency portions than in the middle of the list, because the partially matching episode has more strength in the primacy and recency positions.\nIntrusion probes match the episode in the probed position p on the position dimension and the episode in the probe\u2019s position of origin o on the item identity dimension. Thus, the overall match of an intrusion probe includes the similarity on the item dimension multiplied by the strength term for o, and the similarity on the position dimension multiplied by the strength term for p. As a consequence, the global match value will be determined by the strength of the probed position as well as by the strength of the position of origin of the probe. The relative contribution of these two strength components depends on the relative weight of the two dimensions of similarity, governed by parameter u in Equation 2.\nTo summarize, the global match values of all three probe types will be larger in the primacy and recency positions than in the middle positions. All probe types are therefore more likely to be accepted when a primacy or a recency position is probed. This leads to primacy and recency advantages for positive probes. Accepting new and intrusion probes, however, is incorrect, and therefore serial position curves of accuracy for these probes will show the inverse shape of those for positive probes, with lower accuracy in primacy and recency positions. A similar expectation can be formulated for RTs of correct responses. Positive probes in the strong primacy and recency positions will be accepted more easily and therefore faster; negative probes in the strong primacy and recency positions will be more difficult to reject and therefore will elicit longer RTs for correct rejections.\nConsider, for example, a list A(1), B(2), C(3). A positive probe A(1) matches the episode in the strong primacy position on both dimensions and therefore generates a high match value, leading with high likelihood to a fast hit. A new probe presented in the same frame, D(1), would match the strong primacy position on the context dimension, again leading to a (for new probes) relatively high match value, which results in a high chance of a false alarm or a slow rejection. Finally, an intrusion probe in the same frame, B(1), would receive a relatively high contribution to its match value from the context dimension, but a comparatively low contribution from the item dimension, because its position of origin is the weak middle position. This last example shows that the match values of intrusion probes, and therefore the difficulty of rejecting them, is a function of their list position p (i.e., the position of the probed frame) and their position of origin o. In both cases, stronger serial positions\u2014that is, primacy and recency positions\u2014should lead to more false alarms and slower rejections.\nThese intuitive predictions are borne out when the model is run. The predictions of the SP model are shown in the left column of Figure 2 (for accuracies) and of Figure 3 (for latencies). These predictions were generated with parameters given in Table 1. The parameters for this and the other model predictions in this article were chosen to provide approximate fits to the serial position curves of accuracies and RTs of positive probes, and to the overall level of negative probes. Thus, the parameter settings were informed only by aspects of the data that are not the main focus of investigation in the present article; the shapes of the serial position curves for new and intrusion probes can be regarded as real predictions.\nThe first two panels in each column of Figures 2 and 3 show predictions for serial position curves, with serial position defined as list position (i.e., the position of the probed frame in the presentation order of the list). Predictions for the serial condition are in the top panel. The contribution of output interference is\nnoticeable in the asymmetry of the curve, with weaker performance toward the end of the list. The middle panel shows predictions for the random condition, in which differences of test order are averaged out; consequently, the curves are symmetrical. In both cases, the serial position curves for new and intrusion probes bow in the direction opposite to that for the positive probe. The curvature is much less pronounced for the two kinds of negative probes than for the positive probes because the match values of negative probes have a smaller relative contribution from the strength of the probed position, as their similarity to that episode is lower.\nThe bottom panel shows predictions for intrusion probes plotted by their position of origin (averaging over probe position). There is again a slight curvature opposite to that for positive probes, this time arising from the strength of the position of origin, which contributes to the match values of intrusion probes."}, {"heading": "Predictions From the Dual-Process Model", "text": "In the DP model, serial position effects come about entirely through recollection. Recollection1 consists of retrieving the item or items associated with the relevant context. In the case of a positive probe, this process will return a match, the strength of which is determined by the strength of the probed position. In the case of a negative or an intrusion probe, Recollection1 will return a mismatch, the strength of which again reflects the strength of the probed position. Therefore, to the degree that Recollection1 contributes to overall recollection, probes in strong list positions can be expected to elicit high hit rates and high rates of correct rejections, both with relatively short latencies.\nRecollection2 consists of trying to retrieve a list context from the probe as cue. In local recognition that is the frame in which the probe has been presented, if it has been a list item at all. In the case of a positive probe this is the frame in the probed position, and the strength of the match value is determined again by the probed position. In the case of a negative probe, no frame is retrieved. The strength of the resulting mismatch value cannot depend on serial position and thus is assumed to be 1; therefore, Recollection2 does not generate serial-position effects for new probes. For intrusion probes, however, the position of origin can be retrieved as a context, and this information would help to reject that probe. The mismatch value returned by Recollection2 for intrusion probes therefore is weighted by the strength of the position of origin of the probe. As a consequence, Recollection2 should produce serialposition effects for intrusion probes when plotted over their position of origin. Again, strong positions lead to larger mismatch values, which translate into faster and more accurate rejection of intrusion probes. Therefore, the predicted serial position curves for intrusion probes over position of origin bend in the same direction as the serial position curves for positive probes.\nTo summarize, the DP model predicts that serial position curves of accuracies and latencies will bow in the same direction for all three probe types. The predictions based on parameters given in Table 1 can be seen in the right column of Figures 2 and 3. Predicted serial position curves for new probes are shallower than those for positive and intrusion probes because recollection plays a smaller role in the decisions on new probes, which can be rejected on their lack of familiarity, than on the other two probe types, which must recruit recollection to distinguish between them. An additional prediction is that success in rejecting intrusion probes should increase with the strength of those probes\u2019 positions of origin. Again, strong positions of origin would lead to better performance. This prediction is illustrated in the bottom right panels of Figures 2 and 3.\nThe predictions for serial position effects on new and intrusion probes, as plotted in Figures 2 and 3, hold only if both directions of recollection contribute to the overall recognition signal. This is the case for the value of parameter d 0.5 used to generate the plotted predictions. The model\u2019s behavior changes when d assumes more extreme values. With d 1.0, the model uses only Recollection1, and as a consequence, the serial position curve of intrusion probes over their position of origin becomes flat. Conversely, for d 0.0, the model uses only Recollection2, and the serial position curve for new probes and intrusion probes over the probed list position becomes flat (the predictions for positive probes do not change because for them, probed position and\nposition of origin is identical, rendering d ineffective). Therefore, we can use the serial position curves of new and intrusion probes not only to adjudicate between DP and SP but also to diagnose the role of the two retrieval directions within a viable DP model.\nExperiments 1 and 2\nThe predictions are tested with data from two experiments.2 The only difference between these experiments is that Experiment 1 had about equal numbers of new and intrusion probes among its negative probes, whereas Experiment 2 had only positive and intrusion probes.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "In each experiment 30 psychology undergraduates at the University of Potsdam, Germany, participated in partial fulfillment of obligations of a lab course or in exchange for 5 euros (\u20ac)."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "Each trial started with the presentation of a row of six square frames in the middle of a computer screen in white on a black background. After 500 ms, six consonants were presented in white, one in each frame, with a presentation time of 400 ms followed by an interstimulus interval of 100 ms for each letter. The two conditions of presentation order, serial and random, were realized in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. In the serial condition, the consonants were presented from left to right; in the random condition, their presentation order was determined at random for each trial and participant. Lists were built by randomly selecting from the 20 consonants (excluding Y) without repetitions. The first probe appeared 600 ms after offset of the last list item in one of the frames (for an illustration, see Figure 1). Participants judged whether the probe matched the letter presented in that frame by pressing the left or the right arrow key; the assignment of the arrow keys to \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d was chosen by each participant at the beginning of the experiment. The next probe followed 200 ms after the response, for a total of six probes. In the serial presentation condition, the probes were presented in left-to-right order, thereby matching the order of list presentation across the frames. In the random condition presentation of probes followed a new random order independent of list presentation order. Serial position is defined as position in the presentation order.\nIn Experiment 1, across all trials 50% of probes were positive and the remaining ones were negative, with 24% new and 26% intrusion probes. In Experiment 2, each probe corresponded to a different letter of the list; half of them were positive and half were intrusion probes. In both experiments, positive probes were evenly distributed over serial positions across all trials of the experiment in a randomized order, whereas serial positions of negative probes were determined at random without constraints.\nEach participant completed 12 practice trials followed by 156 test trials (each with six probes) in a 1-hr session. At the end of\n2 Data for the first 20 participants of Experiment 2 came from the local recognition experiment in Oberauer (2003).

In Experiment 1, some participants did not produce a single correct response for one\nor a few design cells; these missing values, 14 in total, were replaced by the group means for the affected design cell.\nFigure 4 shows accuracies of the three probe types in Experiment 1, and Figure 5 shows the corresponding response latencies. Figure 6 shows accuracies of positive probes and of intrusion probes in Experiment 2, and Figure 7 displays the corresponding latencies. All four figures show that serial position curves of intrusion probes tracked those of positive probes remarkably well. The serial position curves of new probes in Experiment 1 tended to be shallower, but where they were bent, they were bent in the same direction as positive probes. This pattern is incompatible with SP, but it matches the predictions of DP very well.\nThis impression was confirmed by analyses of variance (ANOVAs) in which serial position was coded by linear and quadratic contrasts to capture trends in the curves. In one case\u2014 latencies in the serial presentation condition\u2014the cubic rather than the quadratic trend was considered because a cubic trend was strongly implied by the data. Out of 24 analyses of interactions between serial position and probe type3 only 5 became significant at the conventional .05 alpha level. Three of those concerned the comparison of positive and new probes in Experiment 1: In the serial condition, positive versus new probes interacted with the quadratic trend of serial position effects on accuracies, F(1, 29) 9.2, p .005, p\n2 .24. This interaction reflects the fact that new probes do not show the one-item recency effect observed for positive probes. In the random condition, positive versus new probes interacted with the quadratic trend on both accuracies and RTs, F(1, 29) 9.2, p .005, p\n2 .24 for accuracies, and F(1, 29) 5.8, p .023, p\n2 .17 for RTs. These two interactions reflect the fact that serial position curves for new probes were essentially flat in the random condition, whereas positive probes displayed primacy and recency effects.\nOne of the two remaining interactions signals the lack of the one-item recency effect in accuracies of intrusion probes in the serial-presentation condition of Experiment 2, F(1, 29) 4.6, p .041, p\n2 .14. The other reflects the different shape of the accuracy position curves of positive and intrusion probes in Experiment 1, random condition, F(1, 29) 4.3, p .047, p\n2 .13. Primacy and recency effects extended further into the middle of the list for intrusion probes than for positive probes. These two effects were small and appear to be unsystematic, so I do not discuss them further.\nIn those cases where the interactions were not significant, it is important to show that this was not due to small serial position effects or to a lack of power. To this end I tested for serial position effects of individual probe types; the results are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. Out of 10 significant serial position effects for positive probes, 6 were replicated in the data from intrusion probes. Those not replicated were, in both experiments, the quadratic trends on accuracy in the serial condition, and the quadratic trends on latencies in the random condition. The same two effects were also not reproduced in the data from new probes (Experiment\n3 Experiment 1: Two probe-type contrasts (new vs. positive and intrusion vs. positive), two serial position contrasts (linear and quadratic, in one case linear and cubic), two presentation conditions (serial and random), two dependent variables (accuracies and latencies). Experiment 2: One probe-type contrast (intrusion vs. positive), two serial position contrasts, two presentation conditions, two dependent variables.\nSerial Presentation Order\n1 only). In addition, one more effect that was significant with positive probes failed to be significant with new probes (quadratic trend on accuracies in random condition), such that in total the data from new probes reproduced only two of the five effects found on positive probes in Experiment 1.\nFigure 8 plots accuracies on intrusion probes by their position of origin. Taking as example the list A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), followed by intrusion probe A(2), performance on this probe would be\nassigned to original position 1, because the probed item A was presented in list position 1. Only data from Experiment 2 are analyzed because there were twice as many intrusion probes in that experiment as in Experiment 1.\nThe position of origin had significant effects on the accuracy of rejecting intrusion probes, and these effects match those found for positive probes.

In the random condition, the quadratic trend was again significant, F(1, 29) 15.4, p .001, p\n2 .35, reflecting the same pattern of primacy and recency effects. In addition there was a significant linear trend, F(1, 29) 15.9, p .001, p\n2 .35, reflecting higher accuracy for probes coming from the recency part of the list compared with the primacy part.

The SP model predicts that serial position curves for negative probes (i.e., new and intrusion probes) bow in the direction opposite from those for positive probes. The DP model predicts that they bow in the same direction, with relatively shallow curvature for new probes and more pronounced curvature for positive and intrusion probes. The predictions of the DP were further modulated by the assumed direction of retrieval involved in recollection. Context-to-item retrieval predicts bowed serial position curves of negative probes plotted over the list position of the probed frame, whereas item-to-context retrieval predicts bowed serial position curves for intrusion probes when plotted over their position of origin.\nSerial Presentation Order\nThe results contradict the predictions of SP but are in good agreement with those of DP. Support for DP comes from the paucity of interactions between probe type and serial position and the finding of a number of significant serial-position effects on negative probes that had the same shape as those of positive probes in the same conditions. Where positive and negative position curves were not parallel, the interactions mostly came from the fact that new probes displayed shallower position curves, and this is predicted by the DP model (see Figures 2 and 3). The predictions of both retrieval directions within DP were supported, suggesting that both retrieval routes contribute with substantial weight to recollection. This result implies that the serial position effects on\nintrusion probes in the random condition are split between an effect of the probed position and an effect of the position of origin. As a consequence, serial position effects on intrusion probes are predicted to be less pronounced than those for positive probes in the random condition, a prediction also visible in Figures 2 and 3. This could explain why, in the random condition, not all position effects observed for positive probes were replicated in the intrusion probes.\nThere was one conspicuous discrepancy between the predictions of DP and the data, namely the cubic rather than quadratic trend in the serial position curves of latencies for the serial presentation condition. The cubic trend can be interpreted as a combination of an inverse U-shaped curve, which is predicted by the DP model, with a substantial time added to the first list item. The same pattern of latencies has been observed for forward serial recall\u2014the time for recalling the first item is much longer than the times for recalling successive items (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Maybery, Parmentier, & Jones, 2002). This long latency on the first item has nothing to do with its strength, because the first list item is typically recalled best, and it showed best recognition accuracy in the present experiments. A plausible interpretation is that, when a forward test order is anticipated, participants take time for preparing retrieval of the whole list in order before responding to the first item. The DP model could easily be amended by a further free parameter to capture this additional preparation time.\nExperiment 3\nExperiment 3 tests the SP model and the DP model with the modified Sternberg task (Oberauer, 2001). On each trial, participants encoded a series of six words, subdivided into two lists by their color\u2014one list was displayed in red and the other in blue. One list contained two words and the other list contained four words. Following the last word, a color cue indicated which of the two lists was relevant for the recognition decision. Participants then decided for a single probe whether it was in the relevant list. Serial position can be determined for positive probes as well as for the serial position of origin for intrusion probes (i.e., probes coming from the irrelevant list)."}, {"heading": "Model Predictions for the Modified Sternberg Task", "text": ""}, {"heading": "The Single-Process Model", "text": "The SP model computes global match from the similarities of the probe to all six memory episodes. Similarity is computed from the distance on the item dimension and the context dimension (i.e., color). Similarity is weighted by the strength of each episode, which depends on its serial position.

The equations resulting from the application of the SP model to the modified Sternberg task are given in the Appendix. The predictions are illustrated on the left side of Figure 9 (for accuracies) and Figure 10 (for latencies). These predictions, and those for the DP model described below, were generated with the same parameters as those for the local recognition tasks (see Table 1), with one exception: Because the global match values were higher in the case\nof the modified Sternberg task due to more matches of all probes on the context dimension, the acceptance criterion in Equation A1 had to be raised to avoid a strong bias toward accepting probes.

The SP model also predicts that intrusion probes are more difficult to reject than new probes because intrusion probes gain in match value from their similarity to an irrelevant-list item. In addition, the model predicts that new probes and intrusion probes are harder to reject when the relevant list is long, because these probes match more memory episodes on the context dimension, thereby generating larger match values (note that intrusion probes from long lists correspond to shorter relevant lists).

In case of a match, M is multiplied with the strength of the matching item, and in case of no match, M is multiplied with the average strength of all items on the relevant list.

Therefore, strength is reduced with increasing list length of the relevant list; this reduction is governed by a free parameter C (see Equation A15 in the Appendix). For Recollection2, strength is computed as in local recognition, because in both tasks item-to-context retrieval involves retrieval of a single context from a single probe as cue.4\nThe predictions of the DP model are shown on the right side of Figures 9 and 10. As before, the model predicts largely parallel serial position curves for positive and intrusion probes. Intrusion probes are predicted to be more difficult than new probes because familiarity is added to the recognition signal. In addition, DP predicts list length effects in favor of short relevant lists for positive and for new probes. Positive probes are accepted more easily when the relevant list is short because memory traces have more strength, making it easier for Recollection1 to find the matching item in the relevant list. New probes are easier to reject when the relevant list is short for the same reason: It is easier for Recollection1 to determine that the probe does not match any of the relevant-list items. The predictions for intrusion probes are not straightforward: The list length effect on strength makes intrusion probes easier to reject through Recollection1 when the relevant list is short, for the same reasons as with new probes. At the same time, these intrusion probes originate from the long list, which renders strength for Recollection2 smaller on average, due to the trough in the serial position curve.\nOnce again, certain features of the predictions of DP enable identification of the effects of context-to-item recollection and of item-to-context recollection. When d is set to 0, eliminating\ncontext-to-item retrieval, the list length effect for new probes disappears. When d is set to 1, eliminating item-to-context retrieval, serial position effects for intrusion probes disappear.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 32 students in the last 2 years of high school, recruited from schools in Potsdam, Germany.

In each trial, six nouns were selected at random from this pool, with the constraint that the nouns have not been used as memory items in any previous trial of the same block. The six selected words were assigned at random to the six serial positions. The set of six words was subdivided into two lists. For participants in the long\u2013short group, the first four words formed the first list, and the remaining two words formed the second list. For the short\u2013long group, the first two words formed the first list and the other four words formed the second list.\nEach of the two sessions consisted of eight blocks of 32 trials each. In each trial, the six words were presented centrally one by one for 700 ms, followed by a 100-ms blank interval. The first list of two or four words (depending on group) was displayed in red, and the second list was displayed in blue on a black background. Half a second following the offset of the last word, a red or blue frame appeared centrally; its color indicated which list should be regarded as relevant. The probe appeared in the frame 100 ms later in the same color as the frame. Participants were instructed to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether the probe was contained in the relevant list. They gave their responses by pressing on the left or the right arrow key. Immediate feedback followed a key press in the form of a brief high tone for correct responses and a low tone for incorrect responses.

At least part of it is implicitly modeled by the fact that with longer lists, the primacy and recency parameters decline further, leaving the middle list positions weaker than with shorter lists. Data from Monsell (1978) and McElree and Dosher (1989), who varied list length and serial position in the Sternberg task, show that serial position effects account for a large part, but not all, of the list length effects in that task.\nirrelevant list. Positive probes and intrusion probes were drawn in equal proportions from all serial positions of the relevant or the irrelevant list, respectively."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Reaction times for incorrect responses (13.1%) and those exceeding 3 s (0.2%) were discarded. Mean accuracies on positive and intrusion probes are presented by serial position for the two groups in Figure 11, and Figure 12 shows the corresponding RT data. Data points connected by lines reflect serial positions within the same list. The figures also show the data for new probes by the length of the relevant list.\nThe first set of analyses focuses on serial position curves. The SP model predicts that these curves bow in opposite directions for positive and intrusion probes, whereas the DP model predicts that their shapes are parallel. I tested these hypotheses separately for the two groups because serial position effects differed between groups, but there was no hypothesis concerning the interaction of serial position effects with group. I conducted an ANOVA for each group, each dependent measure, and each list, with probe type (positive vs. intrusion) and serial position as independent variables. For long lists, I tested for interactions of linear and of quadratic trends over serial position with probe type.\nOf the 12 interactions (2 for long lists and 1 for short lists 2 dependent variables and 2 groups), 4 were significant. For accuracies, these involved the quadratic trend of serial position in the short\u2013long group, F(1, 15) 6.4, p .02, p\n2 .30, and the linear trend in the long\u2013short group, F(1, 15) 10.4, p .006, p\n2 .41. As can be seen in Figure 11, both of these interactions are derived from the fact that intrusion probes were responded to less accurately on the serial positions where the irrelevant list bordered the relevant list (i.e., the first position in the short\u2013long group, and the last two positions in the long\u2013short group). For RTs, the significant interactions involved the linear trend in the short\u2013long group, F(1, 15) 8.0, p .013, p\n2 .35, and the quadratic trend in the long\u2013short group, F(1, 15) 11.7, p .004, p\n2 .44. The first of these interactions reflects a more pronounced recency advantage for positive than for intrusion probes when the long list came last. The second interaction is driven mainly by the pronounced increase in RTs for intrusion probes at the last position of the long list, which borders the short list following it, whereas no such increase was found for positive probes.\nFor 8 of 12 analyses there was no significant interaction of serial position with probe type, but that does not imply that the two probe types show parallel effects of serial position. To test whether they do, I analyzed serial position effects for positive and for intrusion probes separately; the results of these analyses are summarized in Table 4. In 6 of the 12 comparisons, there were significant effects in the same direction for positive and for intrusion probes.\nThe second analysis tests the hypothesis, shared by the two models, that intrusion probes were responded to less quickly and accurately than new probes. ANOVAs with probe type (new vs. intrusion), length of the relevant list (2 vs. 4), and group as independent variables yielded significant main effects of probe type for both accuracy and RT as dependent variable, F(1, 31) 92.3, p .001, p 2 .76, and F(1, 31) 145.7, p .001, p 2 .83, respectively.\nA final set of analyses concerned list length effects of the relevant list. The SP model predicts that list length affects negative probes and positive probes in opposite ways, whereas the DP model predicts that positive and new probes are easier when the relevant list is short and makes no firm predictions for intrusion probes. An ANOVA with probe type (3) and list length of the relevant list (2) as variables revealed a significant effect of list length on accuracies, F(1, 31) 18.7, p .001, p\n2 .38, which did not interact with probe type, F 1. For all three probe types,\nGroup Short-Long\naccuracies were lower with longer relevant lists. For RTs, there was again a main effect of list length, F(1, 31) 51.8, p .001, p\n2 .63, but it interacted with probe type, F(1, 31) 6.8, p .009, p\n2 .18. Longer relevant lists led to slower responses to positive and new probes, but list length had no effect on intrusion probes.\nThe list length effect on new probes is particularly relevant for diagnosing the context-to-item retrieval route, and therefore I investigated it separately. As predicted from the assumption of\ncontext-to-item retrieval, RTs to new probes were significantly longer when the relevant list was long, F(1, 31) 24.2, p .001, p\n2 .45. Accuracies on new probes were significantly lower for long lists, F(1, 31) 14.2, p .001, p\n2 .31. Neither effect interacted with group."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of Experiment 3 are inconsistent with the SP model on two accounts: Serial position curves for positive and for intrusion probes were mostly parallel, and list length effects of positive and new probes went in the same direction, with better performance on trials with short relevant lists. Both these patterns were predicted by the DP model. The third prediction of the DP model, better performance on new than on intrusion probes, was also confirmed. Moreover, the experiment yielded support for both retrieval directions within the DP model. Item-to-context retrieval was demonstrated by the effect of the serial position of origin on intrusion probes. Context-to-item retrieval was demonstrated by the list length effect on new probes.\nThere were four deviations between serial position curves of positive and intrusion probes, which are not predicted by DP. Three of them reflect a specific difficulty with intrusion probes coming from positions close to the relevant list. These effects can be understood as arising from a difficulty in discriminating between the two lists. If representations of adjacent serial positions overlap, as is assumed in contemporary models of serial-order memory (e.g., Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Henson, 1998), recall of the list context from a probe as cue will lead to ambiguous results if the list context lies at the boundary between the two lists. This is true for both positive and intrusion probes but, whereas for positive probes information from familiarity converges with information from recollection, thereby rendering accurate recollection of the probe\u2019s list context somewhat redundant, discriminating between relevant and irrelevant list is crucial for decisions on intrusion probes. This explains why performance on intrusion probes suffers more than that on positive probes at serial positions close to the list boundary. The DP model in its current form does not include a parameter for discriminability between contexts, but including one would be a straightforward extension.\nThe fourth point of deviation between serial position effects of positive and intrusion probes was the larger recency effect in RTs to positive probes in the short\u2013long group. One tentative explanation for this effect is that, in addition to serial position effects on recollection, there is also a recency effect on the degree of familiarity, which helps acceptance of recent positive probes but impairs rejection of recent intrusion probes. The fact that there was nevertheless a recency advantage even for intrusion probes, and the interaction of probe type and serial position was not found for the short list in the long\u2013short group, shows that this effect cannot be very strong. A strong recency effect on familiarity would have driven the observed recency effects on positive and on intrusion probes in opposite directions, and this was not the case.\nGeneral Discussion\nI tested two models of short\u2013term recognition\u2014a single-process model and a dual-process model. The models were tested with two experimental paradigms that made it possible to distinguish be-\nGroup Short-Long\ntween item recognition and relational recognition. Both models incorporated the distinction between item information and contextual information and therefore could handle the fact that relational recognition was more difficult than item recognition. The two models could be distinguished by their predictions for serial position effects on negative, to-be-rejected probes, and (in Experiment 3) by their predictions for list length effects. The DP model predicted largely parallel serial position curves for all probe types and parallel list length effects for positive and new probes, whereas the SP model predicted that both of these effects go in opposite directions for positive and negative probes. The results of all three experiments clearly favor the DP model. In addition, the results provide support for two assumed directions of retrieval in the recollection component of the DP model. Recollection is based on context-to-item retrieval and on item-to-context retrieval."}, {"heading": "Necessary Features of a Theory of Short-Term Recognition", "text": "Which characteristics of the models are responsible for the success of the DP model and the failure of the SP model? Two critical features can be identified. First, the SP model uses a signal that reflects only positive evidence for a match, whereas a mismatch is simply represented by a relative lack of match evidence. As a consequence, strong representations elicit stronger evidence for a match with a positive probe, thereby making hits easier, but they do not elicit stronger evidence for a mismatch with a negative probe. Thus, the SP model has no mechanism to generate better performance on negative probes presented in stronger serial positions. The recollection process in the DP model, in contrast, provides evidence for a match (positive values of M) as well as for a mismatch (negative values of M). Therefore, stronger items yield stronger evidence for a match when compared with a positive probe and stronger evidence for a mismatch when compared with a negative probe.\nThe second critical feature is that the SP model compares each probe to all episodes in memory, whereas the DP model has one process, familiarity, that compares the probe to all memory items, and another process, recollection, that is limited to the relevant item or items. The importance of this second feature can be\ndemonstrated by investigating a variant of the SP model that introduces the first feature, positive evidence for a mismatch. To do so, we can subtract from the similarity between the probe and each episode a neutral baseline B that represents the value on the similarity scale at which the evidence is inconclusive. Similarity values above B would be regarded as evidence for accepting a probe, and values below B would be regarded as evidence for a rejection. Thus, Equation 1 would be modified to\nm i 1\nn\nSi simprobe,i B (8)\nWith this modification, mismatches of a probe with an episode in a strong position would yield negative values multiplied with a large value Si, thereby providing stronger evidence for rejection, compared with mismatches of a probe with an episode in a weak position. Nonetheless, this modified SP model still predicts serial position curves for negative probes that mirror those for positive probes, rather than being parallel. This is so because the evidence for a probe\u2019s match or mismatch is summed across all memory episodes, rather than being confined to the relevant set of episodes. Consider two new probes in the local recognition task, one in the strong serial position 1 and one in the weaker serial position 3. For both of them there will be positive evidence for a mismatch coming from all six memory episodes on the item dimension, and from five memory episodes on the context dimension. Both of them, however, also receive one piece of evidence for a match, namely a match on the context dimension with the episode on the probed position. For the probe in the strong position 1 this evidence for a match is stronger than for the probe in the weak position 3, and therefore the global match of a new probe in position 1 is larger, making it more difficult to reject that probe.\nThere is a way of formulating an SP model that comes very close to realizing both critical features. In this version of SP, memory episodes are encoded by values between 0 and 1 on each feature dimension, with a neutral value of 0.5. Values greater than 0.5 represent the presence of a feature, and values less than 0.5 represent its absence. An interpretation of these values is that they represent the conditional probability of a feature, given the pres-\nTable 4 Results of Analyses of Variance for Experiment 3\nEffect\nAccuracy Reaction times\nPositive Intrusion Positive Intrusion\nF p 2 F p 2 F p 2 F p 2\nGroup: Short\u2013long Long: linear 43.1* .74 20.4* .58 118.2* .89 4.6* .24 Long: quadratic 7.2* .32 1.3 .08 29.6* .66 8.7* .37 Short 11.4* .43 1.9 .11 16.2* .52 9.9* .40 Group: Long\u2013short Long: linear 0.8 .05 11.1* .43 1.7 .10 5.1* .25 Long: quadratic 0.0 .00 1.0 .06 1.2 .08 6.4* .30 Short 10.9* .42 24.8* .62 23.7* .61 8.4* .36\nNote.

McClelland and Chappell (1998) built their subjective-likelihood model on this representation assumption; the SP model considered next is a much simplified version of that model, designed to investigate how far an SP model can be pushed in explaining the present data.\nThe strength of a memory episode determines how much a feature value deviates from the neutral value 0.5:\nfi,d 0.5 0.5 1 exp( cSi ], (9)\nwith fi,d for the feature value of episode i on dimension d, Si the strength of episode i, and c a free parameter governing how quickly f deviates from 0.5 with increasing strength. As strength Si increases, the term in the square bracket increases, and the feature value fi,d deviates more from the neutral value of 0.5. The match between a probe and a memory episode is computed as\nmprobe,i 1 Ditem probe,i u 1 Dctx probe,i 1 u. (10)\nIn this expression, D represents the distance between the probe and the memory episode i, defined as the absolute difference between the probe\u2019s feature value (0 or 1) and the episode\u2019s feature value fi,d on the respective dimension. Parameter u determines the relative contributions of item and context dimension. The global match is computed by adding up the matches of a probe to all memory episodes.\nThis version of the SP model creates positive evidence for a mismatch, which increases with strength: The more fi,d deviates from 0.5, the smaller D becomes in case of a match, and the larger D becomes in case of a mismatch, thereby generating stronger evidence for accepting positive probes and stronger evidence for rejecting negative probes. Therefore, the model meets the first requirement for a successful model: symmetric evidence for matches and mismatches. Importantly, the model also has the second critical feature, the ability to limit comparison to relevant contexts. Due to the multiplicative combination of the match values on the two dimensions, the model implies to some degree the exclusion of items in irrelevant contexts. Items associated to irrelevant contexts (i.e., items in different frames than the probed one in local recognition, and items from the irrelevant list in the modified Sternberg task) mismatch the probe on the context dimension, thereby returning a low value of [1 \u2013 Dctx]. Whatever the match of that episode on the item dimension, [1 \u2013 Ditem], it carries little weight because it is multiplied with the low value on the context dimension before being added to the global match signal.\nThis modified SP model predicts the serial position curves of the two experiments much better than the original SP model. Illustrative predictions, with parameter settings tuned to the serial position curves of positive probes, are presented on the left side of Figure 13 for local recognition and on the right side for the modified Sternberg task.\nThere is one noticeable qualitative deviation of the predictions from the data, however: For the modified Sternberg task the new SP model predicts that performance on positive probes increases with longer relevant lists. The opposite was found in Experiment 3. The reason for this misprediction is that with a short relevant list, positive probes accumulate evidence for mismatch on the context dimension from twice as many memory episodes\u2014 namely, all four irrelevant-list items\u2014than with a long relevant list. Despite its relative success, the modified SP model makes this one wrong prediction because it does not fully exclude the epi-\nsodes from the irrelevant list from the comparison process. Specifically, whereas information from different dimensions within an episode is integrated multiplicatively\u2014thereby discounting evidence from one dimension when there is a mismatch on the other\u2014the matching signals across episodes are integrated additively, such that mismatch evidence grows linearly with the length of the irrelevant list.\nThere is no obvious way to solve this problem within the framework of SP models that base recognition decisions on a global match value between the probe and all memory episodes. One way out is to abandon global matching in favor of local matching\u2014that is, to compute a probe\u2019s match only over the relevant set of episodes. This is essentially what the recollection process of the DP model does. A single-process model based only on local matching could explain list-length and serial-position effects, but it could not explain intrusion costs: When irrelevant episodes are completely excluded from the comparison process, intrusion probes are not harder to reject than new probes. I concluded that, although there is room within the general framework of SP models for improving on the SP model I considered initially, accounting for the whole pattern of data from both paradigms is a challenge not easily met by any model from that family.\nThe two features identified as necessary to account for the present data are the same as those identified as necessary to explain another set of findings on short-term recognition (Oberauer & Lange, 2007). In that work we applied a version of the present DP model to data from the modified Sternberg task with nonwords as items. Memory was tested with a number of probe types designed to distinguish memory for individual letters and memory for their bindings. The ability of the DP model to exclude irrelevant-list items from recollection, while at the same time being sensitive to the familiarity arising from them, and the ability to garner positive evidence for a mismatch as well as for a match, proved critical for the DP model\u2019s success in accounting for those data. Thus, there is converging evidence from two sets of experiments for the two critical features of a successful model."}, {"heading": "Three Sources of Recognition Information", "text": "The present findings not only help to identify challenges for SP models of short-term recognition, they also place constraints on DP models. The successful DP model I propose uses three sources of information for a recognition decision: familiarity and the two retrieval routes of recollection. Can we reduce this account to two sources of information?\nOne possibility to consider is that item-to-context retrieval is unnecessary to explain the data. The evidence for this process is the serial position curve for intrusion probes when plotted by position of origin, displaying primacy and recency effects. In principle, such a serial position curve could arise from position effects of familiarity. If, for some reason, items at the beginning and the end of a list are less familiar than those in the middle, then it would be more difficult to overcome the misleading familiarity of intrusion probes stemming from middle list position than that of intrusion probes from the primacy and the recency part of the list. There is, however, no reason to assume that items in the primacy and recency part of a list elicit a weaker familiarity signal. If anything, the primacy and recency effects on acceptance of positive probes suggest the opposite. The item-to-context retrieval\nhypothesis, in contrast, affords an explanation that can be applied equally to all serial position curves reported in this article: Bindings between items and their contexts are stronger at the beginning and end of a list than in the middle, and this strength is symmetrical for item-to-context retrieval and for context-to-item retrieval. The same explanation would also apply for cued recall, which generates similar serial position curves (Oberauer, 2003). Why bindings are stronger in the primacy and recency portion is a question for future research.\nA second possibility to reduce the DP model to just two sources of information would be to eliminate familiarity assessment as a separate process and explain intrusion costs through item-to-context retrieval instead, as follows: Successful retrieval of a context for a probe would result in high familiarity, whereas failure would result in low familiarity. Positive and intrusion probes would both be highly familiar because they are associated with a context in the current list. New probes could at best serve to retrieve older contexts (e.g., previous lists in the experiment or extra-experimental contexts), and the associations to these contexts can be assumed to have weakened over time,\nso that retrieving the context of a new probe results in lower familiarity. This account of intrusion costs, however, faces the same problem as the SP theory. It predicts that intrusion costs should be larger for probes that are strongly associated to their contexts than for probes weakly associated to their contexts, because strongly associated probes generate more misleading familiarity. The U-shaped serial position curves over position of origin would then imply that intrusion probes from the middle of the list are more strongly bound to their contexts than are probes from the primacy or recency portion. This assumption cannot be ruled out, but it makes it difficult to explain why serial position curves for positive probes show higher hit rates in the primacy and recency portion. If familiarity is stronger for items in the middle position by virtue of stronger item-to-context associations, the only way that primacy and recency items could attract higher hit rates is for them to have much stronger context-to-item associations than those in the middle. This would mean that the strength of context-to-item associations is inversely related across serial positions to the strength of item-to-context associations. I think this is a very implausible assumption.\nThe present DP model is tailored to short-term recognition tasks in which typically short lists are presented, for which recollection of the complete list is feasible. Recollection1 relied on the ability to retrieve all items associated with the relevant list context\u2014 which in most paradigms is the whole list presented for the current trial\u2014to ascertain for negative probes that they do not match any of them. Researchers interested in recognition from long-term memory usually ask people to learn much longer lists than those used in the present experiments, and learning is often separated from the test phase by a filled delay. I assume that with increasing length of the relevant list and increasing delay between study and test, people rely less on context-to-item recollection. In the limit, recollection should consist entirely of item-to-context recollection (i.e., Recollection2). One prediction arising from this assumption is that list-length effects should flatten out in the longer range, because the contribution of the list-length parameter C, which is mediated through Recollection1, diminishes with increasing list length. In fact, the slope of RTs over list length flattens out as list length is increased from 2 to 20 (Burrows & Okada, 1975; Okada & Burrows, 1978)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, the present data provide strong evidence for a dual-process theory of recognition over short time intervals. This conclusion converges with a wealth of research using primarily recognition over longer intervals, which also points toward two processes of recognition (Diana et al., 2006). In addition, the present experiments identified two retrieval routes that contribute to recollection. One route retrieves the item or items associated to the probed context, and the other route retrieves the context associated to the probe item.\nReferences\nAnderson, J. R., & Lebiere, C. (1998).

Delaney, and Emily R. Waldum University of North Carolina, Greensboro\nThree experiments evaluated whether the magnitude of the list-method directed forgetting effect is strength dependent. Throughout these studies, items were strengthened via operations thought to increase context strength (spaced presentations) or manipulations thought to increment the item strength without affecting the context strength (processing time and processing depth). The assumptions regarding which operations enhance item and context strength were based on the \u201cone-shot\u201d hypothesis of context storage (K. J. Malmberg & R. M. Shiffrin, 2005). The results revealed greater directed forgetting of strong items compared with weak items, but only when strength was varied via spaced presentations (Experiment 3). Equivalent directed forgetting was observed for strong and weak items when strengthening operations increased item strength without affecting the context strength (Experiments 1 and 2). These results supported the context hypothesis of directed forgetting (L. Sahakyan & C. M. Kelley, 2002).\nKeywords: directed forgetting, context change, list-strength effect, spacing effect\nAre some things easier to deliberately forget than others? We will propose that the answer to this question is yes and that the kinds of things easier to forget may provide important clues as to how intentional forgetting occurs. Such efforts are timely because there has been increasing interest in directed forgetting as part of a broader trend toward investigating inhibitory abilities. To date, published research has not addressed how recallability of an item influences the magnitude of directed forgetting\u2014that is, if some things are easier to remember, how does the ease of remembering influence the magnitude of deliberate forgetting?\nThe current article seeks to explore the theoretical mechanisms of one of the two most frequently-used directed forgetting paradigms: list-method directed forgetting (invented by R. A. Bjork, LaBerge, & LeGrand, 1968). In the list method, participants encode two lists of items. Between the lists, some participants are told to try to forget everything up to that point. Typically, directed forgetting has a dual effect on memory; compared with a remember control group that is not told to forget anything, the forget group shows impaired recall of List 1 items (known as the costs) but enhanced recall of List 2 items (known as the benefits).\nDirected forgetting is not caused merely by withholding responses in the forget group, because monetary incentives to recall\nadditional information do not elicit better recall (MacLeod, 1999), nor does the procedure completely erase the items from memory, because recognition tests and indirect memory tests do not show directed forgetting, suggesting that the items are available in memory but are simply inaccessible (Basden et al., 1993; E. L. Bjork & Bjork, 1996). Directed forgetting has also been observed in incidental learning (Geiselman, Bjork, & Fishman, 1983; Sahakyan & Delaney, 2005), suggesting that pure rehearsal-based explanations are insufficient to explain the phenomenon. Consequently, some researchers proposed that directed forgetting involves an inhibitory process (E. L. Bjork & Bjork, 1996; R. A. Bjork, 1989). According to this view, an inhibitory mechanism is invoked at the time of retrieval that reduces access to unwanted memories, producing lower recall of List 1 items (the costs of directed forgetting). Because List 1 items are less accessible, they are correspondingly less likely to interfere with List 2 items, producing the benefits of directed forgetting (e.g., E. L. Bjork & Bjork, 1996).\nAn alternative account suggests that directed forgetting is a context effect (Sahakyan, 2004; Sahakyan & Kelley, 2002). Our interpretation of the directed forgetting effect was inspired by the search of associative memory (SAM)/retrieving effectively from memory (REM) memory models (e.g., Gillund & Shiffrin, 1984; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997) and their variants (e.g., Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1988). Like many memory theories, these models distinguish between item information and context information. They assume that processing an item constructs an image in memory, which is an interconnected set of features that represents information about the item content (such as its lexical/semantic representation) and the context in which that item was learned. Typically, item content information is the focus of attention during study, whereas context information is more peripheral information referring to the physical, spatial\u2013temporal, environmental, physiological, or emotional states in which the item was experienced (Murnane, Phelps, & Malmberg, 1999).

The model samples images, and whenever an image is sampled, a separate recovery process attempts to retrieve information out of that image. Successful sampling does not necessarily guarantee successful recovery. In free recall, the first sampling attempt relies strictly on context cues. If an item is successfully recovered, then that item serves as an additional retrieval cue (along with the context cues) to guide subsequent retrieval attempts. However, if the attempt to recall was unsuccessful, then context cues alone continue to guide search. The success of the context cue when accessing relevant images in long-term memory depends on the overlap between context at the time of storage and the test context.\nGiven the importance of context cues in free recall, Sahakyan and Kelley (2002) proposed a context-based explanation for directed forgetting. They suggested that forget instructions encourage establishing a new mental context for List 2 encoding. One strategy for deliberately forgetting List 1 would be to stop maintaining the contextual elements that were present at the time of List 1 encoding and instead sample new contextual cues for List 2. For example, the forget instruction may induce some people to deliberately think of something unrelated to the experiment, leading to changes in mental context between the two lists. At the time of final recall, the context cues will match the List 2 learning context better than the List 1 context, producing forgetting of List 1 items. Recall is poorer when there is a low correspondence between the context at the time of the study and test (see Smith & Vela, 2001, for a meta-analysis of experimental findings on context-dependent forgetting). Empirical support for the context-based explanation of directed forgetting came from studies that produced effects similar to directed forgetting without instructing people to forget but, instead, by engaging participants in a diversionary thought intended to change their mental context between the two lists (Sahakyan & Delaney, 2003; Sahakyan & Kelley, 2002).\nIf directed forgetting costs arise from a context mismatch between study and test, then items that are more strongly linked to List 1 context should be more forgettable when context changes (as in the Forget condition). Imagine two events (A and B) that were experienced in the same context, but Event A was more strongly linked to that context than was Event B. When context is used as a retrieval cue during recall, it will be a better cue for A than for B. However, if context changed between the study and test, it should impair retrieval of A more than that of B. Therefore, directed forgetting should hurt items that were more strongly linked to List 1 context more than items that were weakly linked to List 1 context.\nTo examine this hypothesis, one needs to know what strengthens the relationship between an item and its context as well as what simply increases item strength without enhancing context storage. Malmberg and Shiffrin (2005), building on SAM/REM, suggested that a fixed amount of context information is stored when an item is first studied. Extra study time and/or deeper processing do not substantially enhance the storage of context information; they merely increment the item strength. In contrast, spaced presentations of the study items strengthen both item information and context information. Their conclusions were based on the presence or absence of the list-strength effect (LSE) in memory. While a list of strong items is recalled better than a list of weak items, the recall difference between strong and weak items is even larger when they appear on the same list\u2014known as the LSE (Ratcliff, Clark, &\nShiffrin, 1990; Tulving & Hastie, 1972). In SAM/REM, the LSE in free recall is attributed to a sampling advantage of items with more context storage. When context is used as a retrieval cue at the time of recall, images containing strong context become activated to a greater extent than images with weak context and are therefore sampled preferentially. Thus, on mixed lists there is a tendency to sample the strong images at the expense of sampling weaker images. The sampling difference is the cause of LSE in these models. Once an image is sampled, the item content features contained in that image determine the success of the recovery process. For example, on pure lists, the memory advantage of strong items over weak items is attributed to differences in the recovery process because the sampling of all images is approximately equivalent on pure lists.\nTo summarize, in models like REM/SAM, the observation of the significant LSE implies that the study conditions must have enhanced the context strength, whereas the absence of LSE (despite the overall item strength effect on both mixed and pure lists) implies that context strength was not incremented by the study condition. Malmberg and Shiffrin (2005) found an LSE only for spaced repetitions, but not for other strengthening operations such as depth of processing or lengthening the study time. They concluded that each spaced presentation of the item leads to the storage of an additional \u201cshot\u201d of context, but other varieties of strengthening, such as additional processing time or depth of processing, do not enhance the context storage but merely increment the item strength. They termed this the one-shot hypothesis of context storage. For a full description and the formal account of the one-shot hypothesis and the REM/SAM model, refer to Malmberg and Shiffrin (2005).\nGiven the assumptions of the one-shot hypothesis, the context account of directed forgetting predicts that greater directed forgetting should be observed for strong items than for weak items when items are strengthened by an operation that produces an LSE (e.g., spacing). In contrast, strengthening manipulations that do not enhance context storage should lead to equivalent amounts of directed forgetting from strong and weak items. Therefore, in three experiments, we used different strengthening manipulations in conjunction with the listmethod directed forgetting design, where List 1 words consisted of strong items and weak items for each participant.\nParticipants were instructed to perform judgments on two word lists and were told that their judgments would help create materials for a future study. Thus, words were encoded incidentally rather than intentionally. Incidental learning allows better experimental control over encoding manipulations because it circumvents rehearsal, which could redistribute study time inequitably across strong and weak items (e.g., Rundus, 1971). Additionally, some authors have suggested that directed forgetting costs arise partly from rehearsal differences between the forget and remember conditions (e.g., Benjamin, 2006; Sheard & MacLeod, 2005). Therefore obtaining directed forgetting with incidental learning would strengthen the argument that processes beyond selective encoding underlie directed forgetting.\nElsewhere we have argued that the main cause of directed forgetting benefits in intentional learning is that participants in the forget group adopt more elaborate encoding strategies during List 2 learning compared with participants in the remember group (Sahakyan & Delaney, 2003). Given incidental learning procedures, we did not expect to observe the benefits because incidental\nencoding prevents encoding strategy changes between the lists and produces no benefits (Sahakyan & Delaney, 2005).\nExperiment 1: Depth of Processing\nIn Experiment 1, we manipulated strength by varying the depth of processing; that is, strong words were encoded with an orienting task involving a pleasantness judgment, whereas weak words were encoded with an orienting task that involved determining whether the word contained letter E."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

List 1 was split into two blocks of 8 items that were encoded with the same orienting task (either pleasantness judgment or letter E). Blocked presentation was employed to avoid frequent task switching and floor recall of List 1 weak items. The presentation order of the strong versus weak blocks was counterbalanced. Also, each word was assigned to the pleasantness task or the letter E task equally often. On List 2, half of the words rhymed with the word seven and half did not. All List 2 items were encoded with the same orienting task involving rhyming.\nProcedure. Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to design word norms for materials for a later experiment (cover stories are available on request). They were told that if a smiley-face icon appeared under a word, they were to indicate if it was pleasant or not (strong items), and if the letter E appeared under a word, they were to indicate if the word contained an E (weak items). Items were presented once at a rate of 4 s per word.\nAfter the first list, half of the participants were told that they would need to rate one more list (further termed the control\ngroup).

They were told,\nThe list of words you just rated was the first list that we need to collect ratings for. Could you please rate one more list of words? However, it is really important that you not be influenced by your prior ratings. Therefore, please make an effort to try and forget those words and pretend you did not rate anything. Try not to think of the earlier words in order not to contaminate the judgments on these new items.\nThen the second list of 16 items was presented. List 2 words were judged for whether or not they rhymed with the word seven. The choice of the rhyming task was based on pilot testing because when both lists were processed with the same orienting task, the recall of the List 1 weak items was at floor.

Finally, there were no significant differences in List 2 recall (F 1; .27 in forget and .26 in control).\nGeneral Discussion\nIn three experiments, we evaluated the magnitude of directed forgetting following different strengthening manipulations. In each experiment, strong items were better recalled than weak items. Furthermore, while we obtained significant directed forgetting in all three experiments, we observed more forgetting of strong items than weak items only when strength was varied by spacing of presentations (Experiment 3). Depth of processing and longer study time led to equivalent amounts of directed forgetting (Experiments 1 and 2). Given the assumptions of the one-shot hypothesis, these results provide support for the context hypothesis of directed forgetting (Sahakyan & Kelley, 2002).\nThe one-shot hypothesis of Malmberg and Shiffrin (2005) was motivated by differences in the LSE across various strengthening manipulations. As stated previously, SAM/REM memory models attribute LSE to context effects. An alternative explanation for the LSE was proposed by Ba\u0308uml (1997), who argued that the LSE arises from output order biases. Recalling strong items earlier in the output sequence leads to output interference, reducing recall of weak items. When Ba\u0308uml (1997) controlled output order in cued recall, LSE was eliminated, but when recall order was unrestricted an LSE emerged. Although the present studies used free recall rather than cued recall, we examined the output order because the results of Ba\u0308uml (1997) implied that output order could contribute to the LSE.\nExperiment 3: Spacing\nWe rank ordered the recall of strong and weak items in our experiments and calculated the average output percentile following the procedure recommended by R. A. Bjork and Whitten (1974). Smaller values of output percentile indicate earlier output in the recall sequence. For Experiment 3, we found that the control group recalled strong items earlier (.49) than weak items (.62), t(45) 3.25, p .01. However, in the forget group there was no significant difference in the output position of strong (.53) and weak items (.57; t 1), implying that directed forgetting reduced the output order bias. This could be partly due to greater forgetting of strong items than weak items in the forget group in Experiment 3. Compared with the control condition, in the forget condition fewer strong items were available at the time of recall to cause output interference on weak items. Unlike in Experiment 3, in Experiment 2, there were no significant output order differences in the forget group (.58 for strong and .59 for weak) or in the control group (.57 for strong and .59 for weak; both ts 1). Similarly, in Experiment 1, there were also no significant differences in the output order in either group, with the highest t value being 1.1.\nIn Experiment 3\u2014where the task manipulation enhanced the context strength\u2014we observed an output bias favoring strong items in the control group. Otherwise, we observed no preference in output order in the remaining studies (despite having higher recall rates for strong items). If output order was mainly driven by the item strength, we should have observed a similar pattern of output order across all experiments, regardless of the item strengthening operation. However, this was not the case in the current studies. These results suggest that the bias in output order may be driven by context strength, such that items with more context storage tend to be recalled earlier. Although output biases could contribute to the LSE, the current results suggest that output biases may be driven by context strength.\nThe results of these experiments have implications for the theoretical mechanisms of directed forgetting. Our position has been that the mechanism behind List 1 costs in directed forgetting involves mental contextual change. When participants receive the forget instruction, they stop maintaining List 1 context and instead encode List 2 items with new context cues. The context hypothesis of directed forgetting predicts that items that are strongly linked to their context will suffer more than items that are weakly linked to their context when context changes at the time of test. On the other hand, differences in the item strength alone would be insufficient to create differential amounts of directed forgetting for weak and strong items. The results of our experiments were fully consistent with these predictions.\nIf different strengthening operations differentially influenced the magnitude of directed forgetting across strong and weak items, then we should expect a three-way interaction when Experiment is included as a variable in the analyses. However, only Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 utilized the same materials and orienting tasks, and they were also run in the same semester. Therefore, it was more appropriate to compare the results across these two studies, especially because the same items (massed items) acted as the strong items in Experiment 2 and as the weak items in Experiment 3. In Experiment 2, they were strong relative to once-presented items because of their greater item strength; in Experiment 3, they were weak relative to spaced items because of their lower context strength and item strength. A Cue (forget vs. control) Item Strength (strong vs. weak) Experiment (processing time vs.\nspacing) ANOVA on proportion List 1 recall revealed that the three-way interaction was approaching significance, F(1, 156) 3.55, p .06, suggesting that directed forgetting was driven by context strength.\nThroughout three experiments, we failed to observe enhanced List 2 recall in the forget condition (i.e., no benefits of directed forgetting). Because the reported studies utilized incidental learning, this null effect is consistent with Sahakyan and Delaney\u2019s (2005) finding that incidental learning did not lead to improved memory of post-cue items. In line with our previous research, the costs and the benefits of directed forgetting can be observed independently, suggesting that they likely have different underlying mechanisms.\nThe results from the reported directed forgetting experiments paralleled the findings obtained with the LSE paradigm. Strengthening operations that produced LSE effects also produced differences in the magnitude of directed forgetting. In contrast, strengthening operations that produced null LSE produced no differences in the magnitude of directed forgetting across the manipulations of strength. Taken together, these findings suggest that context mediates directed forgetting. Furthermore, given the parallels between the LSE and directed forgetting, the list-method paradigm could provide a new tool for investigating the effects of context on memory.\nReferences\nBasden, B.

Pedigo University of Washington\nAn T. Oskarsson University of Colorado at Boulder\nResults from 2 relational-priming experiments suggest the existence of an automatic analogical coordination between semantic and arithmetic relations. Word pairs denoting object sets served as primes in a task that elicits \u201cobligatory\u201d activation of addition facts (5 3 activates 8; J. LeFevre, J. Bisanz, & L. Mrkonjic, 1988). Semantic relations between the priming words were either aligned or misaligned with the structure of addition (M. Bassok, V. M. Chase, & S. A. Martin, 1998). Obligatory activation of addition facts occurred when the digits were primed by categorically related words (tulips\u2013daisies), which are aligned with addition, but did not occur when the digits were primed by unrelated words (hens\u2013radios, Experiment 1) or by functionally related words (records\u2013songs, Experiment 2), which are misaligned with addition. These findings lend support to the viability of automatic analogical priming (B. A. Spellman, K. J. Holyoak, & R. G. Morrison, 2001) and highlight the relevance of arithmetic applications to theoretical accounts of mental arithmetic.\nKeywords: analogy, relational priming, cognitive arithmetic, mathematical reasoning, conceptual integration\nArithmetic competence is considered to be a highly specialized subarea of human cognition. An impressive body of work has examined the origins and the development of arithmetic competence, the computational strategies used by children and adults, and the way people represent numbers and arithmetic facts (for an edited volume of review chapters, see Campbell, 2005). Most theoretical accounts of arithmetic competence hold that adults retrieve well-practiced arithmetic facts from long-term memory (e.g., Ashcraft & Battaglia, 1978; Campbell, 1987; Dehaene & Cohen, 1995; Geary & Widaman, 1987; McCloskey, 1992; Siegler, 1987). These accounts assume that arithmetic facts are retrieved from a specialized memory network of interrelated number concepts, which is analogous to the semantic memory network\n(Ashcraft, 1992; Campbell, 1995). Just as words spread activation to semantically related concepts (e.g., nurse primes doctor; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971), so do digits spread activation to arithmetically related facts (e.g., 5 3 activates 8; LeFevre, Bisanz, & Mrkonjic, 1988).\nThere are many good conceptual and pragmatic reasons for investigating the unique aspects of arithmetic knowledge and skill. However, this line of research has not taken account of the fact that, by and large, people use arithmetic knowledge in the context of solving real-life problems. In the applied context, people coordinate their knowledge of arithmetic operations with their knowledge about the entities in the target situations (e.g., 4 girls 2 boys 6 children; 12 cookies/6 children 2 cookies per child). As we elaborate later, prior work of Bassok, Chase, and Martin (1998) suggests that this coordination involves analogical alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations, or semantic alignment. In the above example, the categorical relation between girls and boys is aligned with addition, and the functional relation between cookies and children is aligned with division.\nBassok and her colleagues found that people adhere to semantic alignments when they reason about mathematical word problems (for a review, see Bassok, 2001). In the next section, we present some illustrative examples from this prior work. Then, we report results from two relational priming experiments in which pairs of word primes that were semantically aligned and misaligned with addition modulated automatic activation of addition facts. In the General Discussion section, we suggest that the semantic and the arithmetic memory networks do not just share analogous representations of interrelated concepts but are actually coordinated with each other via analogous semantic and arithmetic relations.\nSemantic Alignments in Mathematical Word Problems\nPeople have extensive experience with mathematical applications, whether they are solving problems in their everyday life (e.g., Carraher & Schliemann, 2000; Saxe, 1988) or solving math-\nEditor\u2019s Note.

In both contexts, people use their mathematical knowledge to model quantitative relations between various entities and, therefore, have to draw on their world knowledge to constrain problem formulation, solution, and verification (e.g., English & Halford, 1995; Greeno, 1987; Hegarty, Mayer, & Monk, 1995; Hinsley, Hayes, & Simon, 1977; Kintsch, 1988; Koedinger & Nathan, 2004). In doing so, people\u2019s world knowledge sometimes conflicts with the formal properties of mathematics, leading to systematic errors (e.g., Bassok, Wu, & Olseth, 1995). However, the very existence of such errors demonstrates people\u2019s strong tendency to coordinate their mathematical knowledge with the rest of their conceptual knowledge (e.g., De Corte & Verschaffel, 1996; Fischbein, Deri, Nello, & Marino, 1985).\nBassok and her colleagues found that people coordinate their semantic and arithmetic knowledge by aligning semantic relations between the objects that appear in word problems with analogous mathematical relations (for a review, see Bassok, 2001).1 The work that is most directly relevant to the studies reported here pertains to semantic alignments for the arithmetic operations of addition and division (Bassok et al., 1998). According to Bassok et al. (1998), people align categorical semantic relations with the operation of addition because categorically related objects play identical roles with respect to their joint superset (e.g., both tulips and daisies are flowers), just as the addends play identical (commutative) roles with respect to their sum (a b b a c). In a complementary way, people align functionally asymmetric object relations, such as \u201ccontain\u201d (e.g., flowers are contained in vases rather than vice versa), with the noncommutative relation between the dividend and the divisor (a/b b/a).\nBassok et al. (1998) found that college students, who have extensive experience with the application of arithmetic operations, adhere to semantic alignments when they construct arithmetic word problems. In one experimental condition, participants received word pairs denoting object sets and were asked to construct simple addition word problems involving these sets. When presented with categorically related sets (e.g., plums and peaches), which are aligned with addition, participants mainly constructed problems in which the sets were directly added to each other (e.g., 5 plums 4 peaches 9 pieces of fruit). However, when they were presented with functionally related sets (e.g., plums and baskets), which are misaligned with addition, participants refrained from constructing such direct-addition problems. Instead, they used a variety of \u201csemantic escape\u201d strategies, such as inventing a third object set (e.g., pears) and constructing more complex word problems that preserved semantic alignment (e.g., [5 plums 3 pears]/2 baskets 4 pieces of fruit per basket). The complementary pattern was obtained when the task was to construct division rather than addition problems, whereby participants constructed more direct-division problems for functionally related than for categorically related sets.\nA similar pattern of semantic alignments was found when college students solved unfamiliar permutation word problems (Bassok et al., 1995), and when middle school, high school, and college students solved division word problems (Martin & Bassok, 2005). Such effects are consistent with people\u2019s extensive experience with problems involving arithmetic applications. Although we do not have empirical data about the frequency of semantic alignments in every-day problems, Bassok et al. (1998) provided such\ndata for a large corpus of textbook word problems. They found that, in all cases, the arguments of addition were categorically related objects (e.g., red and blue marbles; toads and frogs). At the same time, in 96% of the cases, the arguments of division were objects related by functionally asymmetric relations (e.g., marbles and boxes; frogs and ponds).\nOverview of the Present Experiments\nPeople\u2019s extensive experience with semantically aligned applications of arithmetic operations, and the robustness of semantic alignments in people\u2019s reasoning about word problems, strongly suggest that such alignments are highly automatic. The present study was designed to examine this possibility for the most basic and most practiced arithmetic operation of addition. To this end, we conducted two experiments in which we examined whether pairs of word primes, which are either semantically aligned (e.g., tulips\u2013daisies) or semantically misaligned with addition (e.g., birds\u2013cages), can modulate automatic activation of addition facts (e.g., 3 4 7).2\nFor our experiments, we adapted the number-matching task that LeFevre and colleagues used to demonstrate that pairs of digits lead to \u201cobligatory\u201d (unintentional) activation of simple addition facts (LeFevre et al., 1988; LeFevre & Kulak, 1994). In one version of their number-matching task, people see a pair of cue digits that are related by the plus sign (e.g., \u201c5 3\u201d). They then see a single digit target and have to decide whether the target matched one of the cue digits. When rejecting nonmatching targets (i.e., when the correct answer is \u201cno\u201d), people take longer to reject \u201csum\u201d targets (in this case, an \u201c8\u201d) than to reject nonsum or \u201cneutral\u201d targets (e.g., \u201c9\u201d). Henceforth, we refer to this pattern of results as the sum effect.\nWe preceded the pairs of cue digits with pairs of priming words that were either semantically aligned or semantically misaligned with addition. The aligned primes denoted categorically related sets (e.g., tulips\u2013daisies). The misaligned primes denoted unrelated sets (e.g., hens\u2013radios) in Experiment 1 and denoted functionally related sets (e.g., birds\u2013cages) in Experiment 2. Because categorical primes provide an appropriate relational context for the application of addition, they should support automatic activation of addition facts and lead to the typical sum effect. The unrelated and functionally related primes, by contrast, provide an inappropriate relational context for the application of addition. We therefore reasoned that these primes should reduce or block automatic activation of addition facts and, therefore, diminish or eliminate the typical sum effect.\nOn the basis of the above logic, we predicted that the sum effect would be more pronounced in the semantically aligned than in the semantically misaligned priming condition. That is, we predicted\n1 For a review of a different but related line of work on analogical coordination of semantic and arithmetic knowledge, see Dixon (2005).\n2 As we explain below, our experimental manipulation builds upon prior work in cognitive arithmetic that has established automatic activation of addition facts. At present, there is no evidence that documents similar effects for division. We therefore restricted our initial investigation to the operation of addition. In light of our findings, it seems worthwhile to extend the present investigation to the operation of division. We return to this point in the General Discussion section.\nthat the difference between response latencies to sum and neutral targets (e.g., between 8 and 9, respectively, for cue digits 5 3) would be larger when the cue digits are primed with categorical primes (tulips\u2013daisies) than when they are primed with unrelated primes (hens\u2013radios) or with functionally related primes (birds\u2013 cages).\nIt is important to note that the logic of our experimental design presupposes the viability of relational priming. Spellman, Holyoak, and Morrison (2001) found that, under an appropriate strategic set, semantic relations prime analogous semantic relations. In the General Discussion section, we compare the present findings with those of Spellman et al. We propose that the process that mediates the coordination between the semantic and the arithmetic memory networks is similar to the process that mediates analogical access (Forbus, Gentner, & Law, 1995; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997).\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, we compared the magnitude of the sum effect for cue digits (e.g., 3 4) that were primed by aligned categorically related word pairs (e.g., ants\u2013beetles) and by misaligned unrelated word pairs (e.g., hens\u2013radios). According to Bassok et al. (1998), unlike categorically related sets that preserve a one-toone mapping with the structure of addition (e.g., 4 ants 3 beetles 7 insects), semantically unrelated sets are misaligned with addition. This misalignment arises because one would need to traverse many links in the semantic network to find the superset that corresponds to their sum (e.g., 4 hens 3 radios 7 things). Such intermediate links (e.g., hens are farm birds, which are animate creatures, which are things) introduce relational mismatches with the operation of addition, in which the addends are directly related to their sum.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred fifty-four University of Washington introductory psychology students, 91 women and 63 men, participated for course extra credit. All were native English speakers with normal or corrected vision."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "The trial stimuli were random combinations of 80 word triplets and 48 digit triplets. Each trial consisted of a priming word pair (e.g., tulips\u2013daisies) with its word target (e.g., tulips) and a pair of cue digits (e.g., 2 3) with its digit target (e.g., 5). Below, we first describe the word and the digit triplets and then explain how the word and the digit triplets were combined.\nWord triplets. All word stimuli were plural nouns that could serve as referents of object sets (e.g., birds, coats, thieves, stories). We first selected a set of candidate singular nouns from wordnorms databases (Battig & Montague, 1969; Coltheart, 1981). The candidate words were in the upper 10% of word frequency, familiarity, and concreteness. Their syllable count was restricted to be between one and five. From this candidate word set, we constructed 80 word triplets in which the nouns were transformed from singulars to plurals (e.g., from stain to stains ). Half of the\ntriplets consisted of categorically related nouns, which we refer to as aligned-categorical, or AC, triplets (e.g., oaks, elms, and maples).3 The other half consisted of unrelated nouns, which we refer to as misaligned-unrelated, or MU, triplets (e.g., marbles, guards, and ponds). The two sets of AC and MU triplets were matched for word frequency, familiarity, concreteness, and syllable count. The AC and MU word triplets appear, respectively, in Table 1 and Table 2.\nIn each word triplet, two words were designated to serve as the priming word pair and the third as the target. In order to balance the number of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses, half of the target words matched one of the priming words (correct response is \u201cyes\u201d) and the other half did not (correct response is \u201cno\u201d). Specifically, of the 40 AC triplets, 20 had a matching target (e.g., horses, donkeys, and horses) and 20 a nonmatching AC target (e.g., ants, beetles, and spiders). Similarly, of the 40 MU triplets, 20 had a matching target (e.g., gowns, bridges, and bridges) and 20 a nonmatching MU target (e.g., napkins, cats, and authors). Half of the matching targets matched the left, and the other half matched the right words of the priming pairs.\nRelatedness ratings for all the priming word pairs used in Experiment 1 were obtained from a subset of participants (n 33) after they had completed all the experimental trials of the worddigit matching task. These participants rated the extent to which the priming word pairs were related to each other on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating that the words were completely unrelated and 7 indicating that the words were highly related. Each participant provided ratings to 60 word pairs that were selected at random from the 80 priming pairs used in the experiment. AC pairs (M 5.97, SD 0.73) received significantly higher relatedness ratings than the MU pairs (M 1.42, SD 0.42), t(32) 37.60, p .001.\nDigit triplets. Forty-eight digit triplets were adapted from the \u201cstandard\u201d stimuli cues used by Lefevre and Kulak (1994). Each digit triplet consisted of a pair of cue digits and a digit target. The cue digits (m n) were of the form m 1, n 1, and m n (e.g., 3 2). Half of the digit targets matched one of the cue digits and half did not. Half of the matching targets matched the left and half matched the right cue digit. The complete set of digit stimuli used in Experiment 1 appears in Table 3.\nHalf of the triplets had matching targets (correct response \u201cyes\u201d), and the other half had targets that did not match either one of the cue digits (correct response \u201cno\u201d). Only triplets with nonmatching digit targets are relevant for assessing the sum effect (24 triplets total). The cue digits of these triplets appear in the leftmost column of Table 3. The target digits ranged from 5 to 9 and, depending on the cue digits, served as either sum or neutral targets. Twelve triplets consisted of the cue digits and their sum target\n3 The decision that certain priming pairs are categorically related was based solely on the authors\u2019 judgment. After the studies were completed, we realized that some of the AC word pairs had a set\u2013subset relation (e.g., a kayak is a kind of a canoe). We therefore asked participants from a similar population to rate the degree to which the AC word pairs were categorically related. As we describe in the Method section of Experiment 2, these ratings were consistent with our original classification. More important, the set\u2013subset pairs received categorical ratings similar to those of the purely categorical pairs.\n(e.g., 5, for the cue digits 3 2), and 12 consisted of the cue digits and a neutral target (e.g., 7).\nIn the other 24 triplets, the targets matched one of the cue digits (correct answer is \u201cyes\u201d). Half of the matching target triplets served as cue controls. In these 12 triplets, the cue digits were the same as those used in the nonmatching sum and neutral triplets (e.g., 3 2; see the leftmost column of Table 3) and were in the 2\u20136 digit range. The other half of the matching target triplets served as target controls. These 12 triplets were constructed to ensure that the matching targets (\u201cyes\u201d response) covered the same\ndigit range (5\u20139) as the nonmatching targets (\u201cno\u201d response). Accordingly, the cue digits in the target control triplets (e.g., 8 4; see the rightmost column of Table 3) had sums larger than 10.\nApparatus. Written instructions and the experimental trials were presented on 17-in. (43-cm) monitors controlled by PC computers. Responses to digit and word targets (yes and no) and response latencies were recorded with the use of Inquisit software Version 1.31 software (Inquisit, 2000), which is accurate to 0.08 ms. All stimuli presentation times were multiples of the screen refresh rate of 16.7 ms."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "In order to ensure that people attend to both the priming words and the cue digits, on each experimental trial, participants had to make two matching decisions (\u201cDid you see X? yes/no\u201d): one to a word target (e.g., X ants; X spiders) and one to a digit target (e.g., X 3; X 9). To discourage dual-tasking strategies, on half of the trials, the digit target appeared first and was followed by the word target, and on the other half, the word target appeared first. Although participants responded to both word and digit targets, only trials in which the digit targets appeared first (i.e., immediately after the cue digits) preserved the structure of the original number-matching task (LeFevre et al., 1988). These trials provide the cleanest test of whether semantically aligned or misaligned word pairs would prime the sum effect. Hence, we only report the results pertaining to the latencies and error rates of the relevant digit targets in the digit-first condition, comparing the trials in which these digits were primed by the semantically aligned and the semantically misaligned word pairs.\nParticipants were tested in small groups of 4\u201313. They received verbal and written instructions explaining that they would see pairs of words and digits and, subsequently, see word and digit probes. Their task was to respond \u201cyes\u201d if the probe was one of the items that were just presented and \u201cno\u201d if it was not. Participants were instructed to place the index finger of their preferred hand on the 2 key on the numerical keypad of the keyboard. They had to indicate their \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses by pressing the 1 and 3 (or\nNote.

They were instructed to respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Participants were also told that they would be taking a memory recognition test at the end of the word-digit matching task to test their memory for the words seen during the experiment. This instruction was intended to encourage semantic processing of the words (Schreuder, Giovanni, & Glazenborg, 1984), but we did not administer the memory test.\nFigure 1 depicts the sequence of events on each experimental trial. Each trial began with an asterisk prompt in the middle of the screen. The prompt remained on the screen until the participant pressed the 2 key on the numeric keypad of the keyboard. At this keypress, a randomly selected pair of priming words appeared on the screen. The words were presented in line-drawn boxes, one box on the left and the other on the right side of the screen\u2019s center. After 480 ms of this words display, a pair of randomly selected cue digits appeared in the boxes above the words, and a plus sign appeared between the two boxes. The priming words and the cue digits remained on the screen for an additional 135 ms, at which point the stimuli were erased and masked for 16.7 ms. The computer then randomly selected either a digit or a word target and displayed it at the center of the screen. This target remained on the screen until the participant responded, or for a maximum of 2 s.\nParticipants pressed the designated yes or no keys to indicate whether the target digit or word was presented in that trial. They received written feedback, either \u201cRIGHT\u201d in green letters or \u201cWRONG\u201d in red letters, which remained on the screen for 500 ms. Lack of response within 2 s also received the feedback \u201cWRONG.\u201d After the feedback to the first target disappeared, the second target was presented at the center of the screen. In the digit-first condition, the second target was a word; in the word-first condition, the second target was a digit. Participants responded to the second target in the same manner they responded to the first. Consecutive trials were separated by a forced 2-s delay.\nEach participant received a unique randomized sequence of 160 trials that had a balanced 4 (word triplet) 4 (digit triplet) 2\n(target order) factorial design, with five trials in each experimental cell. The four word-triplet conditions were AC prime/matching target, AC prime/nonmatching target, MU prime/matching target, and MU prime/nonmatching target. The four digit-triplet conditions were sum, neutral, cue control, and target control. The two target-order conditions were digit first and word first. The word triplets were selected at random without replacement until all 80 triplets were exhausted and then sampled again for a total of 160 trials. The digit triplets were selected at random without replacement until all 48 triplets were exhausted, and this sampling was repeated for a total of 160 trials. The constraints on the random draw of the word and digit combinations were such that there were no more than two consecutive identical trial types and no more than four identical consecutive correct responses (e.g., \u201cno\u201d).\nParticipants received 20 practice trials that were similar to the experimental trials. Although we wanted participants to get familiar with the matching task, we did not want them to think about the relation between the words and the digits. Accordingly, all the word triplets in the practice trials were unrelated (e.g., notes, cords, and tubes). These word triplets were not used in the subsequent experimental trials. The practice trials were followed by a brief clarification break during which the experimenter verified that the participants understood the task. The participants then proceeded to perform the 160 experimental trials. They took approximately 12 min to complete this task."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "As we have mentioned earlier, the data relevant for testing the hypothesis that semantic alignments modulate obligatory activation of addition facts is restricted to the 40 experimental trials in which the nonmatching sum (n 20) and neutral (n 20) digit targets appeared first.

Latencies were computed on correct responses to sum and neutral targets, excluding responses of trials in which participants responded incorrectly to the subsequently presented word targets (thus ensuring that the digit latencies pertained only to trials in which we had evidence that the participants processed the relevant priming words). The mean number of responses per cell that met these correctness criteria was 7.2 (SD 1.8). Geometric means were computed because they are less susceptible to outliers (Alf & Grossberg, 1979; cf. Lu, Morrison, Hummel, & Holyoak, 2006); arithmetic means yield the same rank order of conditions.\nAs in previous studies documenting obligatory activation of addition facts (e.g., LeFevre et al., 1988), participants took signif-\nicantly longer to reject the sum (909 ms) than the neutral digit targets (878 ms), F(1, 152) 20.93, MSE 7,173, p .001.

Yet, as can be seen in Table 4, the latencies of the sum and the neutral targets in the MU condition (896 ms and 895 ms, respectively) fell between the values of the sum and the neutral latencies in the AC condition (923 ms and 861 ms, respectively). Planned comparisons revealed that sum latencies were significantly longer in the AC than in the MU condition (27 ms), t(152) 2.76, p .007, whereas neutral latencies were significantly shorter in the AC condition than in the MU condition (34 ms), t(152) 4.13, p .001.

Categorically related word primes, which are aligned with addition, led to a significant sum effect. At the same time, semantically unrelated word primes, which are misaligned with addition, did not elicit the sum effect.\nAs we have explained earlier, the categorical primes provide an appropriate and highly practiced relational context for performing the addition operation. The highly significant sum effect obtained in the AC condition suggests that this context supported automatic activation of addition facts (LeFevre et al., 1988). The lack of sum effects in the MU condition is consistent with our entering conjecture that unrelated primes provide a semantic context that is incongruent with performing the addition operation and, therefore, block automatic activation of addition facts.6\nDespite the consistency of the present results with our entering semantic alignment hypothesis, it is possible that the difference in the relative impact of AC and MU primes on the activation of addition facts was mediated by factors other than the alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations. In particular, because the words in the AC primes were highly related to each other, whereas the words in the MU primes were not, it is possible that differences in the activation of addition facts in the two priming conditions were somehow modulated by the degree of relatedness between the\n4 In research on semantic priming, such a pattern of response latencies to targets (sum) and their alternatives (here neutral) is explained in terms of \u201ccenter-surround inhibition,\u201d whereby it is assumed that suppression of the alternatives assists in retrieval of the relevant targets (e.g., Dagenbach, Carr, & Barnhardt, 1990; Herd, Banich, & O\u2019Reilly, 2006; but see Kahan, 2000, for a different interpretation of such latency patterns). Note, however, that it is impossible to determine whether the present pattern of results reflects center-surround inhibition. This is because, in the present paradigm, there is no baseline level of activation to which one could compare the sum and neutral latencies (Jonides & Mack, 1984).\n5 The error rates in our word\u2013digit coordination experiments were quite high (25%\u201330%, see Tables 4 and 6). A significant proportion of these errors (about 30%) were responses to word targets that followed the digit targets. Even so, these error rates were much higher than those obtained in prior digits-only studies (e.g., 3%\u20135% for similar digits in LeFevre & Kulak, 1994). These high error rates attest to the relative difficulty of the coordination task, which required attention to both digits and words.\n6 We use the terms support and block quite loosely, as the present study cannot illuminate the mechanism by which the semantic context modulates the spread of activation in the arithmetic network. The reader may refer to Mathis (2002) for a thorough discussion of three possible accounts (blocking, slowing, and inhibition) of similar context effects that were obtained in a task involving object identification.\npriming words. Experiment 2 was designed to eliminate this potential confounding between relatedness strength and analogical alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 replicated the design of Experiment 1, except that we replaced the MU primes used in Experiment 1 (e.g., clowns\u2013 ovens) with misaligned functionally (MF) related primes (e.g., ships\u2013sailors). Unlike the MU primes, the words in the MF primes were highly related; however, the MF sets were also misaligned with addition. In fact, they were aligned with the alternative arithmetic operation of division (Bassok et al., 1998). By contrasting the magnitude of the sum effect for AC and MF primes, we eliminated the confounding in Experiment 2 between the effects of relatedness per se and the effects of semantic alignment. If the high relatedness of the AC primes was responsible for the activation of addition facts in Experiment 1, then we should observe similarly high sum effects in both the AC and the MF priming conditions of Experiment 2. But if, as we believe, the results of Experiment 1 were modulated by semantic alignment, then we should observe a more pronounced sum effect in the AC than in the MF priming condition of Experiment 2.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred nineteen University of Washington introductory psychology students, 69 women and 50 men, participated for course extra credit.

MU word triplets were replaced with MF triplets, which we constructed using the databases and the selection criteria described in Experiment 1. The priming word pairs in the MF triplets were plural nouns referring to objects known to be related by many-to-one semantic relations, such as contain (e.g., birds\u2013cages) or consume (e.g., squirrels\u2013nuts). Half of the MF triplets had matching targets (e.g., harps, strings, and harps), and the other half had mismatching but thematically related targets (e.g., babies, cribs, and diapers). The MF word triplets used in Experiment 2 appear in Table 5.\nThe word and the digit triplets were combined to form 160 experimental trials by the same randomized process used in Experiment 1. As in Experiment 1, relatedness ratings for all the priming word pairs used in Experiment 2 were obtained from a subset of participants (n 87) after they had completed all the experimental trials of the matching task. When analyzing these relatedness ratings, we discovered that 2 of the 40 primes that participants saw in the MF condition were, in fact, AC primes. We excluded these 2 triplets from all data analyses.

Moreover, a separate group of participants from a similar population made a clear distinction between categorical and thematic relations. Hence, in addition to replicating the findings of Experiment 1, the results of Experiment 2 showed that obligatory activation of addition facts is modulated by the congruence of the priming semantic relation with addition and not just by the degree of relatedness between the priming words.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe experiments reported in the present article show that semantic relations in word primes provide a context that modulates automatic activation of addition facts. Categorically related word primes, which provide a relational context that is appropriate for addition, led to obligatory (involuntary) activation of addition facts, replicating the pattern of latencies (sum effect) found in studies of cognitive arithmetic (LeFevre et al., 1988). Unrelated word primes (Experiment 1) and functionally related word primes (Experiment 2), which provide a relational context that is inappropriate for addition, blocked such automatic activation of addition facts.\nThe fluent coordination between semantic and arithmetic relations found in the present study is consistent with people\u2019s extensive experience with applications of addition to real-life problems. Obviously, people are capable of adding unrelated or functionally related objects\u2014and in some contexts, people are even asked to do so (e.g., adding flowers, vases, and milk cartons when choosing the express checkout in a supermarket). Yet, both in and out of school, people mainly add highly similar or categorically related objects. The present results indicate that such semantic \u201capplicability conditions\u201d modulate people\u2019s spontaneous access to addition facts, thereby highlighting the importance of arithmetic applications to theoretical accounts of mental arithmetic. In particular, the fluency with which people integrate categorical object relations with their knowledge of addition facts should be incorporated into models of arithmetic competence that, to date, separate people\u2019s arithmetic knowledge from the rest of their conceptual knowledge (for a review, see Campbell & Epp, 2005).\nThe finding that an incongruent semantic context blocks obligatory activation of addition facts may be viewed as quite surprising, as it \u201cflies in the face of any automaticity account in which the specified processes cannot be prevented from being set in motion\u201d (Besner, Stolz, & Boutilier, 1997, p. 221). Yet, a growing body of evidence shows similar modulation effects, be it in word recognition (e.g., Besner & Stolz, 1999), object recognition (Mathis, 2002), or even in cognitive arithmetic (Rusconi, Galfano, Speriani, & Umilta\u0300, 2004). Our results seem to support the conclusions of Besner and colleagues, who, in discussing automatic access to\nword meanings, have suggested that processes that are considered as obligatory or \u201cballistic\u201d should, instead, be treated as a \u201cdefault\u201d that can be overridden by context. In cognitive arithmetic, this overriding context could be an incongruent spatial configuration, as shown by Ruscani et al. (2004), or, as in the present study, semantically incongruent applicability conditions.\nAccording to Bassok et al. (1998), the congruity between arithmetic operations and their application context is determined by semantic alignment. For the operation of addition, this entails analogical mapping between the semantic roles of categorically related objects with respect to their joint superset, and the mathematical roles of the addends with respect to their sum. Bassok and her colleagues found that people are guided by such alignments when they solve or construct mathematical word problems (Bassok, 2001). The results of the present experiments extend this prior work by showing that, for the operation of addition, aligned semantic relations prime access to analogous arithmetic relations, whereas misaligned semantic relations block such access.\nThe priming results reported here are consistent with prior work that has established the viability of analogical priming (Spellman et al., 2001). Using lexical decision and word-naming tasks, Spellman et al. (2001) found that word pairs (e.g., bear\u2013cave) were processed faster when they were primed by word pairs that shared the same semantic relation (e.g., bird\u2013nest) than when they were primed by word pairs that had a different semantic relation (e.g., window\u2013glass). Such relational facilitation, however, was not completely automatic\u2014it occurred only when the participants were explicitly directed to attend to and use the shared semantic relations in the priming and the target word pairs.\nIn the experiments reported here, unlike the study of Spellman et al. (2001), the alignment of the categorical semantic relation (e.g., tulips and daisies are flowers) with addition (e.g., 2 3 5) appears to be highly automatic.7 One reason for this difference could be that Spellman et al. assessed analogical priming using a different methodology. In particular, our experimental task juxtaposed word and digit pairs (see Figure 1) in a manner that was likely to evoke the context of arithmetic applications. It is therefore possible that this juxtaposition alleviated the need for explicit instructions that focus people\u2019s attention on relational similarities. Of course, it is also possible that access to semantically aligned arithmetic operations is, in fact, more automatic than is access to semantic analogies. This possibility would be consistent with people\u2019s extensive experience in using the same arithmetic operation (e.g., addition) to solve problems involving a variety of semantically aligned object sets (e.g., blue and red marbles; cars and trucks, cupcakes and brownies). Such an experience should lead to abstraction of operation-relevant relational commonalities (Hummel & Holyoak, 2003) and, in turn, increase the probability of spontaneous analogical access (Forbus et al., 1995; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997).\nAlthough the present findings are consistent with prior work on relational priming (Spellman et al., 2001) and on semantic alignments in word problems (Bassok et al., 1998), they are restricted to the correspondence between categorical relations and the operation of addition. It remains to be established whether the present pattern of priming results can be extended to other combinations of semantic and arithmetic relations. In particular, to preclude the possibility that these findings were mediated by the unique properties of categorical relations, one would want to determine\nwhether functionally related sets, but not categorically related sets, prime division facts. The generality of our findings and the validity of our relational-priming interpretation have to await future research.\nIn conclusion, the present studies show that the semantic conditions for applying the arithmetic operation of addition modulate automatic access to digit sums. These findings have direct bearing on researchers\u2019 understanding of mental arithmetic. In particular, to the extent that addition facts are represented in a specialized arithmetic memory network, the present findings show that this network is seamlessly coordinated with people\u2019s semantic knowledge. Because the semantic conditions for applying arithmetic operations are relational in nature, the present findings probably reflect automatic analogical alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations. Further research is needed to validate this processing conjecture and determine the generality of our findings.\n7 In line with the earlier discussion of automaticity, we do not mean to imply that this process is obligatory and cannot be prevented from being set in motion.\nReferences\nAlf, E.

An important goal, therefore, is to identify the conditions that lead to changes in how a phonological code is computed. Five experiments are reported that examine whether phonological processes change as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis when reading aloud words and nonwords. Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials. The results of the present experiments are argued to be consistent with the pathway control hypothesis.\nKeywords: pathway control hypothesis, reading aloud, exogenous control, executive control, phonology\nAccounts of skilled reading often describe the process of translating print into sound as the flow of activation through a series of distinct process-specific modules (e.g., Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001; Morton, 1969; Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2007; Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996; Zorzi, Houghton, & Butterworth, 1998). The role of each process-specific module is context independent. That is, currently implemented computational models simulate skilled reading with little consideration of how these process-specific modules may vary in response to context. Processing in these accounts is structurally determined in the sense that the same computations are always performed in the same way on a stimulus (Underwood, 1978). For this reason, it is sometimes argued that computational models of reading meet all of the requirements for automatic processing (e.g., McCann, Remington, & Van Selst, 2000).\nAlthough computational models of reading are often structurally determined, this assumption is not without controversy. Indeed, a number of researchers have also proposed dynamic accounts of word and nonword reading (e.g., Balota & Yap, 2006; Baluch & Besner, 1991; Coltheart & Rastle, 1994; Havelka & Rastle, 2005; Kello & Plaut, 2003; Monsell, Patterson, Graham, Hughes, & Milroy, 1992; Rastle & Coltheart, 1999; Reynolds & Besner, 2005a; 2005b; Tabossi & Laghi, 1992; Zevin & Balota, 2000). Much of this research has been couched in terms of localist dual-route models of reading (e.g., Coltheart et al., 2001). We therefore begin by considering the characteristics of Coltheart et al.\u2019s (2001) dual-route cascaded (DRC) model.1\nThe DRC Model\nThe DRC model of visual word recognition and reading aloud generates a phonological code from print using two different pathways (see Figure 1). The nonlexical pathway (Pathway B in Figure 1) assembles a phonological code using sublexical grapheme to phoneme correspondences. This pathway generates a correct pronunciation for regular words (e.g., hint) and nonwords (e.g., zint) but regularizes exception words (e.g., pint is read so as to rhyme with hint). The lexical pathway (Pathway A in Figure 1) addresses a lexical-phonological code from a lexical-orthographic code. This pathway generates a correct pronunciation for regular words (e.g., hint) and exception words (e.g., pint). The lexical pathway does not generate a correct pronunciation for nonwords (e.g., zint) because their spellings are not represented in the orthographic input lexicon. Thus, although both routes are always active, the correct pronunciation of a nonword requires the nonlexical pathway, and the correct pronunciation of an exception word requires the lexical pathway.\nAlthough DRC currently simulates reading aloud with a static processing architecture, processing can be rendered dynamic by changing parameters so as to be responsive to the context in which the items are being read. However, without a theory to guide such parameter changes, this would be an incredibly laborious process. This is because although DRC has a transparent structural architecture (e.g., lexical and nonlexical pathways for translating print into sound, separate orthographic and phonological lexicons), its functional architecture is surprisingly opaque (see Reynolds & Besner, 2002, for one such illustration). DRC not only has more than 30 parameters, but it also has serial and parallel processing components (the nonlexical and lexical pathways, respectively),\n1 Perry et al.\u2019s (2007) connectionist dual-process (CDP ) model is similar to Coltheart et al.\u2019s (2001) DRC model in that it contains lexical and nonlexical pathways for generating a phonological code. Indeed, the lexical route is taken from the DRC model. The nonlexical pathway differs in some respects. The most notable difference is that that the grapheme to phoneme rules used in DRC were replaced by an orthography to phonology network that is sensitive to the consistency of the spelling\u2013sound correspondences in the CDP model.\nMichael Reynolds, Department of Psychology, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada; Derek Besner, Department of Psychology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\nThis work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Grant A0998 to Derek Besner and a doctoral fellowship to Michael Reynolds.\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Michael Reynolds, Department of Psychology, Trent University, 1600 West Bank Drive, Peterborough, Ontario K8J 7B8, Canada.

Transforming DRC into a dynamic account of reading aloud therefore requires specification of when processing changes, what processes are affected, and what types of processing changes occur. We do not claim to provide all the relevant information on the basis of the results of the present experiments. However, these results are relevant to such modeling.\nThe Pathway Control Hypothesis\nOne dynamic account of reading aloud that has been proposed on the basis of the localist dual-route framework is the pathway control hypothesis (Baluch & Besner, 1991; Coltheart & Rastle, 1994; Havelka & Rastle, 2005; Monsell et al., 1992; Rastle & Coltheart, 1999; Reynolds & Besner, 2005b; Tabossi & Laghi, 1992; Zevin & Balota, 2000). This account postulates that the relative contribution of a particular pathway for translating print into sound will be emphasized or deemphasized in response to the type of stimuli being read aloud. In particular, the relative contribution of a pathway will be increased when it is required to read a class of stimuli correctly and decreased when it cannot generate a correct pronunciation for that class of stimuli.\nThe pathway control hypothesis makes a number of straightforward predictions in the context of DRC. Namely, the nonlexical pathway will be emphasized when nonwords are read aloud because it is required to generate a correct pronunciation for items not represented in the orthographic and phonological lexicons. Similarly, the lexical pathway will be emphasized when exception words are read aloud because it is required to generate a correct pronunciation for words that do not follow the model\u2019s grapheme\u2013 phoneme conversion rules.\nThe hypothesis that control over reading aloud is intimately associated with the distinction between lexical and nonlexical procedures for translating print into sound has been the focus of a\nnumber of studies (e.g., Baluch & Besner 1991; Monsell et al., 1992; Reynolds & Besner, 2005b; Tabossi & Laghi, 1992; Zevin & Balota, 2000). For instance, Monsell et al. (1992) examined whether skilled readers would change how they generate a phonological code by changing the context in which words were read. They had participants read aloud either a pure list of exception words or these same exception words intermixed with nonwords. They hypothesized that the nonlexical route would be deemphasized when the pure list of exception words was read aloud but not when the exception words were mixed with nonwords. Consistent with the pathway control hypothesis, they reported that highfrequency exception words were read aloud faster in the pure list context than in the mixed list context.\nResponse Time (RT) Homogenization\nAlthough the results from Monsell et al. (1992) and other studies are consistent with the claim that the process of generating a phonological code changes across contexts, such data have also been argued to be consistent with a very different interpretation. Lupker and colleagues (Chateau & Lupker, 2003; Kinoshita & Lupker, 2002; 2003; Lupker, Brown, & Colombo, 1997; Taylor & Lupker, 2001) have proposed that these same data are better understood in terms of changes outside the reading system. According to their RT homogenization account, skilled readers use a time criterion to determine when they will make an overt response. This time criterion for responding is adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis in response to the relative speed of the previous trial and is influenced by how long it takes, on average, to respond in a particular context (e.g., over a block of trials). Thus, the time criterion is set earlier following a fast trial and later following a slow trial. The consequence of these adjustments is that mixing fast and slow stimuli in a single block results in slower responses to the fast stimuli and faster responses to the slow stimuli. Critically, RT homogenization is not influenced by the nature of the stimuli (e.g., whether the stimulus is a word or a nonword).\nCompelling support for the claim that participants do homogenize their responses has been reported in a number of studies (e.g., Chateau & Lupker, 2003; Kinoshita & Lupker, 2002; 2003; Lupker et al., 1997; Raman, Baluch, & Besner, 2004; Taylor & Lupker, 2001). The results of these and other studies led Kinoshita and Lupker (2003, p. 414) to conclude that, \u201cthere is still no compelling evidence that target naming latency is affected by the qualitative nature of the context stimuli in the way proposed by the pathway control hypothesis.\u201d\nIt is important to note that the RT homogenization account and the pathway control hypothesis need not be mutually exclusive. It may well be that contextual changes in reading aloud performance are a consequence of both RT homogenization and changes in pathway emphasis. At present, it seems clear that reading performance is affected by RT homogenization; it is less clear whether there is also strong evidence for contextual changes in how a phonological code is generated as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis (but see Balota & Yap, 2006; Reynolds & Besner, 2005b; Zevin & Balota, 2000).\nReynolds and Besner (2005b) suggested that the probability of observing changes in how a phonological code is generated may be influenced by the predictability of events in a given context. If there is substantial uncertainty about the nature of an upcoming\nitem (as is the case in mixed list contexts, where the probability that the next item could be a word or a nonword is often equal), then it is unlikely that skilled readers will change how they generate a phonological code. Thus, even if a correct pronunciation for an exception word is dependent on the lexical pathway and a correct pronunciation for a nonword is dependent on the nonlexical pathway, there is little point in emphasizing one pathway over the other on a trial-by-trial basis if the reader cannot predict what type of stimulus appears on the next trial. Skilled reading performance therefore needs to be examined as a function of stimulus characteristics in a predictable context to assess whether the process of generating phonological code is static or dynamic.\nReynolds and Besner (2005b) proposed that Rogers and Monsell\u2019s (1995) alternating runs paradigm could be used to create such context. In this procedure, participants perform two tasks in a predictable AABB sequence. The alternating runs paradigm has traditionally been used to examine how processing is affected when switching between different tasks by comparing RTs on switch (A3B, B3A) and stay trials (A3A, B3B). According to Rogers and Monsell\u2019s logic, if (a) the mental processes used to complete each task change on a trial-by-trial basis, (b) adjusting these processes takes time, and (c) at least part of this reconfiguration cost is driven by the presence of the stimulus, then it should take longer to respond on switch trials (A3B or B3A) than on stay trials (A3A, B3B). Thus, an increase in RT on switch trials relative to stay trials (a switch cost) is evidence that switching from one task to another requires reconfiguring the mental processes used to complete a task.\nSwitch Costs\nIt is important to note that there is considerable debate concerning whether the increase in RT on switch trials compared with stay trials indexes a reconfiguration cost (e.g., Rogers & Monsell, 1995; see also Monsell, 2003), carryover from the previous trial (proactive interference; see Allport, Styles, & Hsieh, 1994; Allport & Wylie, 2000; Waszak, Hommel, & Allport, 2003; 2004), or both. The important point here is that both of these accounts are consistent with the interpretation that mental processing is changing in response to changes in task demands (see Pashler, 2000, for a review).\nThe alternating runs procedure has also been used to examine whether processing changes even when the task is held constant. For instance, von Studnitz and Green (1997) adapted Rogers and Monsell\u2019s (1995) procedure to examine the control processes operating when bilingual participants perform lexical decision to letter strings from different languages. Consistent with different parameter settings being used to recognize words displayed in English and German, performance was slower on switch trials (A3B, B3A) compared with stay trials (A3A, B3B). Similarly, Shafiullah and Monsell (1999) adapted Rogers and Monsell\u2019s (1995) procedure to examine whether different mechanisms were involved when words from the different Japanese orthographies were read aloud. Consistent with different scripts using different processing mechanisms, Shafiullah and Monsell (1999) found slower performance on switch trials (A3B, B3A) compared with stay trials (A3A, B3B) when participants switched between reading aloud items written in Kana (the Japanese syllabic script) and Kanji (the Japanese ideographic script).\nReynolds and Besner (2005b) used the alternating runs procedure to examine whether contextual changes within a script (English) lead to changes in how a phonological code is computed as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis. Participants read aloud low-frequency exception words and nonwords in an AABB sequence. If the process(es) used to generate a phonological code change as a function of stimulus characteristics as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis and if (a) adjusting the relative contribution from the lexical and the nonlexical pathways takes time and (b) at least part of this reconfiguration is driven by the presence of a letter string, then it should take longer to respond on switch trials (A3B or B3A) than on stay trials (A3A, B3B). Consistent with the relative contributions from lexical and nonlexical pathways changing when skilled readers generated a phonological code, Reynolds and Besner (2005b) reported switch costs both for the low-frequency exception words and for nonwords.\nHere, we report five new experiments that use Reynolds and Besner\u2019s (2005b) procedure to further examine whether the process of generating a phonological code is dynamic in the way predicted by the pathway control hypothesis. These experiments are organized into two sections. The first three experiments examine whether trial-by-trial control is observed. The remaining two experiments examine whether there are circumstances in which skilled readers use a single experiment-wide set. Overall, the results of these experiments are consistent with the pathway control hypothesis.\nPart 1: Trial-by-Trial Changes in Pathway Emphasis\nWe first report three experiments that explore the conditions that result in skilled readers changing their reading style within a block of trials as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis. Following Reynolds and Besner\u2019s (2005b) procedures, participants read aloud two classes of stimuli in an alternating AABB sequence. Whether participants are adapting their reading style on a trial-by-trial basis in response to the type of stimuli is inferred from the presence or absence of a switch cost.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 examined a simple prediction of the pathway control hypothesis by having participants read aloud highfrequency exception words and nonwords in a predictable AABB sequence. If exception words are read aloud by emphasizing the lexical route and nonwords are read aloud by emphasizing the nonlexical route, then switch costs should be observed when switching between lexical categories.2\n2 There are, of course, alternative accounts of visual word recognition and reading aloud, most notably the parallel distributed processing framework (e.g., Plaut et al., 1996). In these accounts, it is possible for highfrequency exception words and nonwords to be read aloud by recourse to a single process (orthography hidden units phonology). In the context of such an account, the pathway control hypothesis would not, a priori, predict trial-by-trial control over how a phonological code is being generated. In contrast, it would predict the switch costs observed by Reynolds and Besner when low-frequency exception words and nonwords were read aloud (see Reynolds and Besner, 2005b)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Sixteen undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada were each paid $4.00 to participate in the present experiment. All individuals had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were native English speakers.\nStimuli. Experiment 1 used 50 high-frequency exception words (as defined by DRC; mean frequency 311 according the Celex database; Baayen, Piepenbrock, & van Rijn, 1993) and 50 nonwords (see Appendix A). The nonwords were generated by rotating the onsets and bodies in the exception words where possible. Therefore, 97% of the unique orthographic bodies from the exception words were repeated in the nonwords.\nApparatus. Stimulus presentation was controlled by a Pentium IV 1.8 GHz computer running Eprime 1.1 software (Schneider, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2001). Vocal responses were collected using a Plantronics LS1 microphone headset (Santa Cruz, CA) and a voice-key assembly. Stimuli were displayed on a 17-inch (43.18- cm) ADI Microscan monitor (Taipei, Taiwan).\nProcedure. The type of stimulus used on the initial trial (e.g., exception word or nonword) and whether a particular item would occur in a switch or stay context were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were assigned to one of four counterbalance conditions on the basis of the order in which they arrived in the lab.\nParticipants were tested individually and were seated approximately 50 cm from the computer monitor. A practice block consisted of eight trials to familiarize participants with the procedure. At the end of the practice session, participants were given limited feedback about their performance. Feedback about accuracy was limited to the regularizations of the exception words, lexicalizations of the nonwords, hesitations, and the addition or subtraction of phonemes.\nThe experimental block consisted of 100 trials. Each trial began with a fixation marker (\u201c \u201d) displayed at the center of the screen. The fixation marker remained on the screen for 1,000 ms, followed by a blank screen for 250 ms, and then the target, which remained on the screen until a vocal response was made. Once the stimulus disappeared, the screen remained blank for 1,000 ms before the next trial began. Thus, the response\u2013stimulus interval was 2,250 ms.\nResponses were classified by the experimenter during the response\u2013stimulus interval as correct, incorrect, or voice-key failure. A pronunciation error was defined as an utterance that represented a clear mispronunciation of the word or nonword (i.e., an extra or deleted phoneme, hesitation or pause, stutter, regularization of the exception words, or lexicalization of the nonwords).\nParticipants were asked to read the letter strings aloud quickly and accurately. Exception words were described as words that do not sound like they look. Nonwords were described as stimuli that could be words but were not. Participants were told that the type of stimulus followed a predictable AABB sequence but were not given any explicit instructions about how to read the nonwords."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Participant data were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with stimulus type (e.g., words\u2013 nonwords) and switch condition (switch\u2013stay) as factors.

The RT data were converted into z scores for the item analysis to reduce the impact of participant variability. We computed z scores for each participant by collapsing across conditions.\nTrials on which there was an incorrect pronunciation (6.2%) or a voice-key failure (4.1%) were removed prior to the RT analysis. RTs to correct responses were subjected to a recursive trimming procedure in which the criterion cutoff for outlier removal was established independently for each condition for each participant by reference to the sample size in that cell (Van Selst & Jolicoeur, 1994).

As such, the present data suggest that phonological discordance due to ubiquitous orthographic overlap at the level of rimes is not a necessary condition for changes in phonological processing to be observed. That said, this outcome does not rule out the possibility that skilled readers can exploit orthographic overlap at the level of rimes across conditions to generate a phonological code.\nExperiment 3\nIn Experiment 1, and, to a lesser degree, Experiment 2, the nonwords were inconsistent (e.g., Glushko, 1979; Jared, 1997). Inconsistent nonwords are those for which there are alternative pronunciations for the rime (e.g., the rime in zint can be assigned the pronunciation as in pint or the pronunciation /Int/ as in hint). It is therefore possible that participants are adapting how they generate a phonological code on a trial-by-trial basis in response to ambiguity in the pronunciations of these nonwords. According to such an account, it is not that a particular pathway is required to read an item correctly that leads skilled readers to adapt how they generate a phonological code, but rather it is the ambiguous lexical contribution to phonology.\nIf the changes in phonological processing observed in Experiments 1 and 2 were due to nonword consistency, then the switch costs should be eliminated if the nonwords are consistent (as well as not sharing rimes with the exception words). In contrast, if the changes in how a phonological code is computed arise as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis, then switch costs will still be observed."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

According to this account, skilled readers will emphasize the lexical pathway when reading exception words aloud because it is required to generate a correct pronunciation and will emphasize the nonlexical pathway when reading nonwords aloud because it is required to generate a correct pronunciation.\nThere are now four demonstrations (Experiments 1\u20133 reported here and the experiment reported by Reynolds & Besner, 2005b) that skilled readers do change how they generate a phonological\ncode from print when reading aloud exception words and nonwords in a predictable sequence. Pathway emphasis (defined here by the presence of a switch cost) occurs (a) regardless of how frequently the exception words are encountered in print, (b) regardless of the orthographic overlap between the exception words and nonwords, and (c) regardless of the consistency of the nonwords. The pathway control hypothesis therefore provides a good account of these data.\nPart 2: Experiment-wide Control\nThe data from Experiments 1\u20133 and those reported by Reynolds and Benser (2005b) can be accounted for by a straightforward version of the pathway control hypothesis in which a pathway will only be emphasized if it is required to generate a correct pronunciation. This simple version of the pathway control hypothesis predicts that a trial-by-trial control over how a phonological code is generated will only be observed if the stimuli being read aloud require different pathways for correct pronunciation (e.g., exception words and nonwords). In contrast, if one set of stimuli requires the use of a particular pathway and the other set of stimuli does not require the use of a different pathway, then no switch cost need be observed.\nAccording to the DRC model, regular words differ from exception words and nonwords in that a correct phonological code can be generated by both the lexical pathway and the nonlexical pathway. Therefore, if participants read aloud regular words and exception words in a predictable sequence, then the presence of exception words should result in the regular words being read aloud with the lexical pathway emphasized. If participants read aloud regular words and nonwords in a predictable sequence, then the presence of nonwords should result in the regular words being read aloud with the nonlexical pathway emphasized. A switch cost would therefore not be expected in either of these cases.\nExperiment 4\nException words and regular words were read aloud together in Experiment 4.

The expectation is that the effect of word frequency should be larger for the regular words in Experiment 4 than in Experiment 5 because in the former case, the lexical pathway is emphasized, whereas in the latter case, the nonlexical pathway is emphasized.\nAs noted above, the regular words were selected from the entire frequency spectrum. The effect of word frequency was therefore examined by calculating the slope relating log10[(word frequency / million) 1] and RT separately for each participant. These slopes were then analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA with switch condition as the repeated factor and experiment as the independent factor. An average slope of zero would imply that there is no effect of word frequency. As can be seen Table 6, there was a significant frequency effect in both Experiment 4, F(1, 15) 40.0, p .001, MSE 1,041, and Experiment 5, F(1, 15) 7.0, p .05, MSE 493.

No other effects approached significance (Fs 1). Consistent with the pathway control hypothesis, this outcome implies that there was a larger contribution from the lexical route when the regular words were read with exception words compared with when they were read with nonwords.\nPart 3: Exogenous and/or Endogenous Control\nThe switch costs observed in the present studies indicate that the processes responsible for generating a phonological code from print are dynamic, but they do not inform us about the control processes responsible for implementing these changes. Fortunately, some insight into these control processes can be gained by considering accounts of residual switch costs in the task-switching literature. A common finding in such experiments is that a residual switch cost is observed despite sufficient time to prepare for the new task (e.g., 2,250 ms, as in the present studies). One account of this cost is that it reflects exogenous control driven by the presentation of the task-relevant stimulus. For instance, Rogers and Monsell (1995; see also Monsell, 2003) have suggested that residual switch costs index the time taken for an exogenous component of the task-set reconfiguration process, and Allport et al. (1994) have suggested that the residual switch cost is due to passive carryover from the inappropriate task set. Critically, both of these accounts of the residual switch costs suggest that processing changes are not finalized until after the stimulus is presented. An alternative account is that the residual switch cost is due to\nendogenous control. For instance, De Jong (2000) suggested that on a subset of trials participants wait until the stimulus appears to implement the necessary changes. According to this account, the residual switch cost arises not because reconfiguration requires an external stimulus for completion, but rather because people sometimes fail to engage the new task set prior to the stimulus.\nAlthough a switch cost, by itself, does not discriminate between exogenous and endogenous control, the pattern of switch costs across experiments is instructive. For instance, switch costs are observed when exception words and nonwords are read aloud in alternating sequence, irrespective of the words\u2019 printed word frequency and across a number of different nonword contexts. If it is the case that the parameter settings are always adjusted when alternating between exception words and nonwords, then endogenous control operating on a trial-by-trial basis is not necessary to explain these findings; exogenous control driven by the stimulus itself would be sufficient to engage the appropriate parameter changes.\nA more formal approach to distinguishing between exogenous and endogenous accounts of control in the task-switching literature consists of examining the cumulative RT distributions for switch and stay trials (De Jong, 2000; Nieuwenhuis & Monsell, 2002). According to De Jong (2000), if the difference between switch and stay trials is due to exogenous control linked to the presentation of the stimulus, then the cumulative RT distributions for switch trials will be shifted along the abscissas relative to the stay distribution but both distributions should be identical in shape; in other words, additive effects of switch condition across the cumulative RT distribution. In contrast, if the difference between switch and stay trials is due to endogenous control that is linked to the stimulus on a subset of trials, then the response distribution for switch trials will be composed of trials on which there was no change in processing associated with the presentation of the stimulus and trials on which the change in processing is tied to the presentation of the stimulus. When the change in processing on switch trials is linked to the presentation of the stimulus, RTs will be longer as compared with when the change occurs prior to the stimulus presentation. As a consequence, the fastest RTs will mostly consist of switch trials on which there is no change in processing associated with the presentation of the stimulus, and the slowest RTs mostly consist of trials on which the change is associated with the presentation of the stimulus. As noted by De Jong, this predicts that the switch and stay distributions should converge at fast RTs and diverge at slow RTs. Thus, endogenous control predicts that the cumulative RT distributions for switch and stay trials will differ in shape; as RT increases, the difference between the distributions will increase. We use these predictions here to assess whether the switch costs observed in the present experiments are due to exogenous control, endogenous control, or both, depending on the experiment.\nThe cumulative RT distributions for switch and stay trials were calculated individually for each participant in Experiments 1\u20135, collapsing across lexicality. The distributions were created by rank ordering the correct RT in the switch and stay conditions and then splitting the data into deciles (see De Jong, 2000). An average RT was calculated for each decile for each participant.\nThe analysis of switch costs reported earlier suggests that (a) the trial-by-trial control observed in Experiments 1\u20133 is due to exogenous control and (b) the trial-by-trial control is not occurring in\nExperiments 4 and 5. The data from these experiments were therefore analyzed separately. However, to improve power, Experiments 1\u20133 were analyzed together, as were Experiments 4 and 5. The data were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA with switch and decile as factors. Given that endogenous control predicts that the difference between the switch and stay distributions will increase with RT, only the linear component of the interaction will be examined to increase power. The data can be seen in Figure 2.\nExperiments 1\u20133\nThe observation that switch costs are found across a range of contexts is sufficiently explained by exogenous control. This account predicts that the cumulative response distributions for switch and stay should be separated by a constant. Thus, exogenous control predicts a main effect of switch condition and no interaction. As can be seen in the left panel of Figure 2, when exception words and nonwords were read aloud in an alternating sequence in Experiments 1\u20133, a 14-ms main effect of switch condition was observed, F(1, 47) 30.7, p .001, MSE 1,571. However, there was no evidence of an interaction with decile, F(1, 47) 1. A sufficient account, therefore, is that the switch costs observed when alternating between exception words and nonwords are due to exogenous control.\nExperiments 4 and 5\nIn Experiments 4 and 5, it was possible for a single experimentwide parameter set to be used. It was therefore hypothesized that\ntrial-by-trial control would not be observed. Consistent with this prediction, a main effect of switch condition was not observed. If trial by-trial control does not occur, then the cumulative RT distributions for switch and stay trials should not differ. Such an outcome would provide converging evidence for the claim that trial-by-trial control was not occurring in these experiments. As can be seen in the right panel of Figure 2, there was no effect of switch condition and no interaction between switch condition and decile (Fs 1)."}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "The RT distribution data are consistent with the central premise of dual-route theory, namely that (a) the lexical pathway must dominate performance for exception words to be read aloud correctly, (b) the nonlexical pathway must dominate performance for nonwords to be read aloud correctly, and (c) regular words can be read correctly with either the lexical pathway or the nonlexical pathway dominating performance. The data are also compatible with the pathway control hypothesis; when the stimuli require different pathways to dominate, as is the case when alternating between exception words (that require the lexical route) and nonwords (that require the nonlexical route), the appropriate pathway is emphasized.\nThe RT distribution data are also consistent with the dynamics of the reading system being controlled exogenously, linked to the presentation of the target stimulus. At first blush, it may appear as though it is necessary to invoke endogenous control to explain why trial-by-trial control was observed in Experiments 1\u20133 but not in\nExperiments 4 and 5. However, the data from all of the present experiments can be explained by two simple context insensitive rules: (a) If a stimulus (e.g., an exception word) is incompatible with the nonlexical pathway (leaving aside the issue of how this is computed), then emphasize the lexical route, and (b) if a stimulus (e.g., a nonword) is incompatible with the lexical route (again leaving aside the issue of how this is computed), then emphasize the nonlexical route. Neither of these rules applies to regular words, so these stimuli will not elicit a change in pathway emphasis. Consequently, when both rules are used in an experiment, trial-by-trial control will be observed (e.g., Experiments 1\u20133). If only one rule is used, then trial-by-trial control will not be observed (e.g., Experiments 4 and 5) because a single pathway will be emphasized for both classes of stimuli (i.e., the lexical pathway in Experiment 4 and the nonlexical pathway in Experiment 5). If the rules that govern the dynamics of the reading system are context insensitive, then the most efficient implementation is to have the stimulus itself engage the appropriate parameter set (i.e., under exogenous control). This raises an important question for future research: Is there a role for endogenous control over the process of generating a phonological code?"}, {"heading": "Switch Costs: Reconfiguration or Interference?", "text": "The effect of predictable changes in lexicality as reported here and by Reynolds and Besner (2005b) can be attributed to either the time it takes to reconfigure the processing system online (reconfiguration cost) or to proactive interference from attempting to read using a nonoptimal configuration from the previous trial. According to the reconfiguration account, slower RTs are observed on switch trials because reconfiguration of the reading system finishes after the stimulus appears but before a response is made. Here, the RT difference between switch and stay trials is a measure of the time necessary to reconfigure the system to optimally read a stimulus (e.g., Rogers & Monsell, 1995). One problem with this account in the present context is that it is unclear what analysis of the stimulus takes place online that would result in online reconfiguration and does not interact with the online computation of a phonological code.\nAccording to the proactive interference account, slower RTs are observed on switch trials because the system parameters from the previous trial are used (e.g., Allport et al., 1994). According to this interpretation of a switch cost, the processing system is reconfigured after a stimulus is read using the inappropriate parameter settings (e.g., because of the magnitude of the discrepancy between the outputs of the two routes). Thus, on switch trials, an exception word would be read using the parameters optimized for the previous nonword and vice versa. (Note that this does not imply that the exception words will be regularized, only that the nonlexical route will have a larger impact on switch trials compared with stay trials.) Here, faster RTs for stay trials (A3A, B3B) reflect a benefit from having successfully reconfigured the processing system.\nAlthough the present studies do not address whether differences in RT between switch and stay trials are a consequence of reconfiguration time or proactive interference, one can imagine an experiment that does. For instance, a powerful test of the proactive interference account would come from a within-subjects comparison of the effect of a psycholinguistic variable (e.g., word fre-\nquency) across switch and stay trials. Consider an experiment in which participants read aloud exception words that vary on word frequency and nonwords in an AABB sequence. If the switch cost arises because the system parameters from the previous trial are being used, then this implies that the exception words are being read with the nonlexical pathway emphasized on switch trials and with the lexical pathway emphasized on stay trials. This suggests that the effect of word frequency should be smaller for exception words on switch trials as compared with stay trials in the context of an experiment that produces a main effect of switch condition. In contrast, we see no reason for the online reconfiguration account to predict any change in the size of the word frequency effect across switch and stay trials.\nAdditional insight may come from comparing the pronunciations made with items on switch and stay trials. Variability in the pronunciations assigned to nonwords has been used to make inferences about the underlying structure of the reading system (e.g., Andrews & Scarrett, 1998). Similarly, some of the earliest evidence for the pathway control hypothesis comes from errors made during reading aloud (Midgley-West, 1979; Monsell et al., 1992). In the present context, such an analysis could provide important insight into the dynamic structure of the reading system while simultaneously providing evidence for the interference account. For example, if an irregular pronunciation of a nonword (e.g., zint read so as to rhyme with pint) is more likely on a switch trial compared with a stay trial, then this would provide compelling evidence that the contribution from the lexical pathway is changing across switch and stay trials. Unfortunately, such an analysis is impossible with the present studies because we did not record participants\u2019 pronunciations."}, {"heading": "Control and Optimization", "text": "A core assumption of the pathway control hypothesis is that changes are made to the reading system to optimize the reading process. An important question, then, is how to assess whether the reading system is being optimized under conditions where trialby-trial control is observed, such as Experiments 1\u20133. If one considers the stay trials to be an appropriate baseline for optimized performance, then slower responses on switch trials represent a failure of the system to optimize performance. Similarly, if the switch trial is viewed as an appropriate baseline, then the benefit from the optimization process is quite small (14 ms, on average, in Experiments 1\u20133), implying that the optimization process is inefficient. Although both baselines suggest that the reading system is attempting to optimize performance, their validity remains to be verified. Indeed, there are at least two other baselines that will likely provide more appropriate insight into the optimization of the reading process and the true costs of control.\nTo assess whether trial-by-trial changes in parameter values optimize performance when two intermixed classes of stimuli (e.g., exception words and nonwords) appear in a predictable alternating sequence (as in the present studies), performance should to be compared with a baseline in which the same stimuli are randomly intermixed. Faster overall RTs in the alternating runs condition would suggest that performance is being optimized. This is clearly a useful direction for future research.\nAdditional insight into the nature of the control processes and their costs can be gained by comparing performance in an alter-\nnating runs context with a baseline condition in which participants read aloud a single class of items. Evidence from the taskswitching literature suggests that task performance is substantially slower on stay trials in an alternating runs context compared with when only a single task is performed. This cost is often attributed to having to maintain two task sets in memory (see Monsell, 2003; Pashler, 2000). Switching between tasks, however, requires a greater number of parameter changes than switching between stimuli when the task and script remain the same. It remains to be seen whether similar performance differences will be observed when alternating between different stimulus categories, as in the present studies.\nGeneral Discussion\nAccording to the basic version of the pathway control hypothesis considered here, (a) there are two pathways for generating a phonological code from print and (b) changes to the relative emphasis of these pathways arise when a specific pathway is required to generate a correct pronunciation. In this account, exception words require the lexical pathway to generate a correct pronunciation, nonwords require the nonlexical pathway to generate a correct pronunciation, and a correct pronunciation can be generated by either pathway for regular words.\nThe results of the present experiments are consistent with this simple version of the pathway control hypothesis. In Experiments 1\u20133, the process of generating a phonological code changed as a function of stimulus category (exception words vs. nonwords) when the stimuli required different pathways. Furthermore, these changes in pathway emphasis appear to be initiated by an exogenous control process time linked to the onset of the stimulus. Within Experiments 4 and 5, the process of generating a phonological code did not change as a function of stimulus category but it did change across experiments. This result suggests that both classes of items were read using a single parameter set in which a particular pathway is emphasized."}, {"heading": "RT Homogenization", "text": "The results of the present experiments also suggest that contextual changes in reading performance are not solely a consequence of RT homogenization, in contrast to the conclusion offered by Lupker et al. (1997; Kinoshita & Lupker, 2003; Taylor & Lupker, 2001). According to RT homogenization, the point in time for responding is adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis based on the relative speed of the previous trial. This account therefore predicts that there should be a cost when switching from a slow item to a fast item but a benefit when switching from a fast item to a slow item because the time criterion is set earlier following a fast trial and later following a slow trial. This pattern was not reliably observed in any of the experiments reported here.\nAlthough the pattern predicted by RT homogenization was not reliably observed in any single experiment, there was a nonsignificant trend for the switch costs to be smaller when switching from a fast item to a slow item compared with when switching from a slow item to a fast item in each of the experiments. This is consistent with RT homogenization having a small but consistent effect on overall performance in addition to the changes in pathway emphasis.\nThe absence of a reliable pattern of RT homogenization in any one particular experiment may be due to the predictive nature of the present context. The predictable alternating pattern contained reliable information about the difficulty of the current item being read. The presence of this information may have allowed skilled readers to use one of two approaches. They may have simply reduced their reliance on a time criterion for responding. Alternatively, the time criterion may have been predominantly based on the time it took to read aloud a previous item at that position of the alternating sequence."}, {"heading": "Lexical Checking", "text": "Lexical checking refers to the process of consulting the phonological output lexicon for a lexical entry that matches a phonological code (Kinoshita & Lupker, 2003; Lupker et al., 1997). According to Kinoshita and Lupker (2003), lexical checking is an extra process that occurs after a phonological code has been computed. It is argued to be beneficial when reading words\u2014it may yield a small time cost, but responses will be more accurate. In contrast, lexical checking is argued to be counterproductive in the case of nonwords because of how long it takes to conduct an unsuccessful check of the lexicon (Kinoshita & Lupker, 2003).3\nIt is possible to explain the observation of a switch cost when fast words and slow nonwords are read aloud together, as in Experiments 1\u20133, by combining RT homogenization and lexical checking. According to this account, the switch cost for fast words following slow nonwords is a consequence of RT homogenization. The switch cost for slow items can be attributed to lexical checking if it is assumed that participants are likely to accidentally conduct a lexical check on the first nonword trial (Reynolds & Besner, 2005b).\nOne problem with this account is that lexical checking has only been invoked to account for an increase in the time to read aloud nonwords when intermixed with low-frequency exception words compared with the time it takes to read aloud nonwords in a pure block of trials. This increase in the time to read aloud nonwords is typically not seen when nonwords are mixed with high-frequency exception words (e.g., Kinoshita & Lupker, 2003, Experiments 1 and 2). Thus, it is unclear why lexical checking would be invoked in the present experiments, given that they do not contain any low-frequency exception words.\nTo provide a viable account of the present data then, the RT homogenization\u2013lexical checking account needs to further articulate the contextual factors that determine when these processes will occur.

For instance, the primary focus of the present studies was changes that arise because of the compatibility of stimuli with the lexical and nonlexical pathways as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis operating in the context of a localist dual-route model with a nonlexical route that uses grapheme to phoneme correspondences. This raises two areas for future research. First, do the reading system parameters change in response to other factors, such as orthographic overlap or consistency? The data from Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that these are not necessary conditions for control, but this does not rule out the possibility that they are sufficient for processing changes to take place. Second, examining the conditions in which control is observed may allow us to discriminate between different models. For instance, the nonlexical pathway in Perry et al.\u2019s (2007) CDP can read exception words with consistent bodies nonlexically. As a consequence, the pathway control hypothesis operating in the context of this model predicts that consistent exception words and nonwords can be read by using a single experiment-wide set in which the nonlexical route is emphasized."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The results of the present experiments are inconsistent with models of reading aloud that explain performance as automatic in Underwood\u2019s (1978) sense of being structurally determined. Instead, the present results suggest that how a phonological code is generated changes across contexts in response to the changing demands placed on it by different stimuli (here, exception words and nonwords).

Yap and David A. Balota Washington University\nChi-Shing Tse University at Albany, State University of New York\nDerek Besner University of Waterloo\nThe joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in lexical decision were examined in 4 experiments as a function of nonword type (legal nonwords, e.g., BRONE, vs. pseudohomophones, e.g., BRANE). When familiarity was a viable dimension for word\u2013nonword discrimination, as when legal nonwords were used, additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were observed in both means and distributional characteristics of the response-time distributions. In contrast, when the utility of familiarity was undermined by using pseudohomophones, additivity was observed in the means but not in distributional characteristics. Specifically, opposing interactive effects in the underlying distribution were observed, producing apparent additivity in means. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that, when familiarity is deemphasized in lexical decision, cascaded processing between letter and word levels is in play, whereas, when familiarity is a viable dimension for word\u2013nonword discrimination, processing is discrete.\nKeywords: additive effects, distributional analysis, stimulus quality, word frequency, lexical decision\nOne of the most robust and intriguing findings in the visual word recognition literature is the observation that stimulus quality and word frequency produce additive effects in lexical decision performance (Balota & Abrams, 1995; Becker & Killion, 1977; Plourde & Besner, 1997; Stanners, Jastrzembski, & Westbrook, 1975; Yap & Balota, 2007). When discriminating between words and nonwords, participants respond faster to frequently encountered, compared to rarely encountered, words; they also respond faster to visually clear, compared to visually degraded, words.\nHowever, these two factors are strongly additive, that is, two main effects with no interaction. Using Sternberg\u2019s (1969a) additivefactors logic, Yap and Balota (2007) argued that the additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency can be interpreted as being consistent with an early encoding stage where stimuli are perceptually normalized and a later stage where lexical retrieval takes place. Perceptual normalization here is defined as a process that refines a degraded representation sufficiently to allow subsequent lexical retrieval processes to work equally efficiently for clear and degraded stimuli (Sternberg, 1969b). In the context of lexical decision, this allows degraded words that have been normalized to be matched to representations stored in memory.\nAlthough separate stages imply additive effects, additive effects do not necessarily imply separate stages. For example, in a cascade model (McClelland, 1979), all processes are operating continuously, with the partial output of one process immediately available as an input for the next process. Importantly, the cascade model does not assume separate stages, and yet is able to produce approximately additive effects. However, we suggest that the additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency are easier to reconcile with a stage than a cascade architecture. Specifically, Roberts and Sternberg (1993) evaluated the predictions of these two classes of models across a variety of experimental domains (e.g., detection, identification, and classification), and concluded that the stage model provided a better account of empirical additive effects and that the cascade model incorrectly predicted the relations between means and variances (see Roberts & Sternberg, 1993, and Yap & Balota, 2007, for more in-depth discussion).\nMelvin Yap, and David Balota Department of Psychology, Washington University, Chi-Shing Tse Department of Psychology, University at Albany, State University of New York; Derek Besner, Department of Psychology, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\nMelvin Yap is now at the Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore; Chi-Shing Tse is now at the Department of Psychology, Washington University.\nThis research was supported by National Institute on Aging Grant AG03991 and National Science Foundation Grant BCS0001801 to D.

For example, the classic logogen model (Morton, 1969) predicts an interaction between the two variables, with larger stimulus quality effects for low-frequency words. In order to illustrate this prediction, consider a high-frequency word that is 10 cycles away from recognition threshold and a low-frequency word that is 20 cycles away from threshold, that is, a word frequency effect of 10 cycles. If one degrades the input such that the input on each cycle decreases by half in the degraded condition (compared to the clear condition), then it should take twice as many cycles for the low-frequency word to reach threshold. Specifically, the high-frequency word will be recognized in 20 (2 10) cycles, whereas its low frequency counterpart will only be recognized in 40 (2 20) cycles. Hence, the original word frequency effect of 10 cycles now yields a word frequency effect of 20 cycles in the degraded condition, producing a stimulus quality word frequency interaction.\nTherefore, additivity seems incompatible with influential computational models that are built on the logogen framework, such as the interactive activation model (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981), the computational dual route cascaded model of word recognition (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001), the multiple read-out model (Grainger & Jacobs, 1996), and the CDP model (Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2007). Indeed, simulations of the dual route cascaded model confirm our intuitions; stimulus quality and word frequency interacted in pronunciation performance, with larger stimulus quality effects for low-frequency words (Reynolds & Besner, 2004). The connectionist framework of lexical processing (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996), the major alternative to the dual route approach, also appears to yield the same interaction. Specifically, Plaut (personal communication, January 18, 2005), using the attractor network model described in Simulation 3 of Plaut et al., demonstrated that word frequency effects in pronunciation were larger for degraded items than for clear items. In summary, it appears that well-studied computational models of word recognition produce evidence for interactive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency, a finding that is difficult to reconcile with the empirical observation of additivity.\nIt is also unclear if additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency can be accommodated by models that specifically target lexical decision performance. For example, the diffusion model (Ratcliff, Gomez, & McKoon, 2004) proposes that lexical decisions are driven by the accumulation of noisy information from a stimulus over time and that variations in performance can be modeled by a small number of parameters, such as drift rate (rate at which information accumulates) and boundary separation (the criterion that must be reached before a decision is made). It is not easy to envision how the diffusion model would handle strongly additive effects. For example, if we assume that stimulus degradation decreases drift rates for both high- and low-frequency words, this would predict larger stimulus quality effects for low-frequency words, given that they take longer to reach the word boundary. In fact, the geometry of the diffusion process ensures that the same change in drift rate for slow and fast response times (RTs) will lead to larger effects for the slow RTs\ncompared to the fast RTs (Ratcliff & Rouder, 1998). Of course, the diffusion model fits a large number of parameters from data sets, including mean RTs for correct and error responses, the relative speeds of correct and error responses, the distribution of RTs, and error rates. Ultimately, whether the diffusion model can handle these effects is an empirical question that can only be answered by running the appropriate simulations on the actual model. Interestingly, when lexical decision data from a study investigating stimulus quality and frequency effects (Yap & Balota, 2007) were fitted to the diffusion model, the model parameters indicated that degradation had multiple effects. Specifically, drift rates went down, stimulus encoding took longer, and participants set more conservative response criteria (R. Ratcliff, personal communication, December 30, 2005). However, the model\u2019s fit for degraded words compared to clear words was associated with a much larger chi-square statistic, suggesting that it had difficulty capturing the empirical pattern.\nAre Additive Effects Task-Specific?\nThe work examining the combined effects of stimulus quality and word frequency have almost always been based on the lexical decision task (LDT). Balota and Chumbley (1984) have argued that the LDT reflects both word identification processes and the word\u2013 nonword discrimination processes specific to that task. Specifically, to carry out a lexical decision, participants can use familiarity-based information to discriminate between words, which are familiar, and nonwords, which are unfamiliar. Familiarity-based information, in this context, refers to a global multidimensional quantity that reflects the orthographic and phonological similarity of a letter string to real words and is associated with labels such as familiarity/meaningfulness (Balota & Chumbley) and wordness (Ratcliff et al., 2004). With respect to extant models of visual word recognition, familiarity maps most obviously onto global lexical activity. Specifically, in both the dual route cascaded model (Coltheart et al., 2001) and the multiple read-out model (Grainger & Jacobs, 1996), word lexical decisions are produced when either local lexical activity (activation level of a single lexical representation) or global lexical activity (summed activation levels of all lexical representations) exceeds their respective thresholds. Because words will typically produce more global lexical activity than nonwords, global activity/familiarity is clearly a useful dimension for the word\u2013nonword discrimination.\nIt is possible that the additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency observed in the LDT are a by-product of lexical decision\u2019s emphasis on familiarity-based information (Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Besner, 1983). That is, because visual degradation undermines the familiarity-based information of a stimulus, participants may be compelled to perceptually normalize degraded stimuli in an additional early encoding stage, allowing familiarity-based information to be recovered and then used to discriminate familiar words from unfamiliar nonwords. If this hypothesis is correct, then additive effects should not be observed in lexical processing tasks that do not place such a high degree of emphasis on familiarity-based information. These tasks include speeded pronunciation, where participants read aloud visually presented words, and semantic classification, where participants decide whether items are exemplars of some category (e.g., Is BIRD animate?). Indeed, Yap and Balota (2007) have recently reported that for the same set of words that produces clear additive effects in lexical decision performance, speeded pronunciation and semantic classification yielded interactive effects of these two\nfactors, with larger stimulus quality effects for low-frequency words. Interestingly, using the same stimuli but a different degradation manipulation, O\u2019Malley, Reynolds, and Besner (2007) obtained precisely the same pattern in speeded pronunciation. This is noteworthy because it confirms that the interaction is not an artifact of the degradation manipulation, which was contrast reduction in O\u2019Malley et al. and rapid alternation of a letter string and a mask in Yap and Balota.\nThese findings suggest that the additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency and the attendant implication of an early normalization stage are specific to lexical decision. Interestingly, in Sternberg\u2019s (1967) short-term memory scanning task, where participants decide whether a probe digit appeared in a previously presented set, additive effects of stimulus quality and set size are also realized. In this classic work, Sternberg interpreted these additive effects as being consistent with a stage model of memory search, where stimulus quality influences an early encoding stage and set size influences a subsequent serial comparison stage. This comparison is particularly germane because memory scanning can be viewed as conceptually very similar to lexical decision in that it also involves a binary decision that can be driven by familiarity-based information (Atkinson & Juola, 1974). In fact, Yap and Balota (2007) speculated that, in experimental contexts where familiarity is useful for driving binary decisions, normalization is necessary for recovering the familiaritybased information.\nIt is important to recognize, however, that the LDT is not a unitary task, but may recruit different types of information for performing the word\u2013nonword discrimination, depending on the nature of the nonword foils used (e.g., Shulman, Hornak, & Sanders, 1978). Interestingly, all studies that have examined the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in lexical decision (Balota & Abrams, 1995; Becker & Killion, 1977; Borowsky & Besner, 1993; O\u2019Malley et al., 2007; Plourde & Besner, 1997; Stanners et al., 1975; Yap & Balota, 2007) have used orthographically legal nonwords, like FLIRP. Such nonwords are orthographically similar to but phonologically distinct from real words, making familiarity a viable dimension for word\u2013nonword discrimination. The question addressed in the present study is what happens when the discrimination is made more difficult, via the inclusion of pseudohomophones (i.e., nonwords that sound like real words, e.g., BRANE) as the nonword foil items. In this situation, because of the increased word\u2013nonword overlap, familiarity or global lexical activity becomes a less reliable metric for lexical decisions, and participants may be compelled to individuate the letter strings in a more fine-grained manner, as they appear to do in speeded pronunciation and semantic classification. For example, within the dual route model, the decision making mechanism may now weight local lexical activity more heavily than global lexical activity during lexical decision. More importantly, because the utility of familiarity is undermined, the perceptual normalization stage, which is used to recover familiarity-based information, may now be diminished in lexical decision. This implies that when pseudohomophones are used, one may no longer observe the signature additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency.\nIn addition to examining the influence of stimulus quality and word frequency in the context of pseudohomophones (nonwords that sound like real words, e.g., BRANE), we also analyzed RT performance at the level of distributional characteristics. It is becoming increasingly clear that the analysis of mean RTs alone is not only inadequate but can sometimes be misleading (Andrews & Heathcote, 2001; Balota & Spieler, 1999; Heathcote, Popiel, & Mewhort, 1991; Plourde &\nBesner, 1997; Spieler, Balota & Faust, 1996; Yap, Balota, Cortese, & Watson, 2006). In particular, failing to take the shape of the distribution into account may obscure more subtle aspects of performance. In their seminal article, Heathcote and colleagues (1991) investigated Stroop color-naming performance. Examining mean RTs, they observed no difference between the congruent (RED displayed in red) and baseline (XXX displayed in red) conditions. However, distributional analyses revealed that congruency shifted the leading edge of the RT distribution leftwards while simultaneously increasing its skew and that these opposing effects cancelled each other out, spuriously producing a null effect (see Spieler et al., 1996, for a replication of this pattern).\nDistributional shifting and skewing were quantified using exGaussian analyses, which characterize RT distributions by fitting RT data to an explicit model, the ex-Gaussian distribution. The exGaussian distribution is a convolution of the normal (Gaussian) and exponential distributions, and contains three parameters: , the mean of the normal distribution; 2, the variance of the normal distribution; and , the mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution (mathematically, the mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution are identical). Fitting data to the ex-Gaussian yields parameter estimates ( , , ) for the data of interest and involves iteratively searching for a set of parameters that maximizes the goodness of fit between the empirical data and the theoretical ex-Gaussian distribution (see Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, & Vetterling, 1988, pp. 274\u2013334, for more information). One interesting property of exGaussian analyses is that the mean is the algebraic sum of and , allowing differences in means to be partitioned into (distributional shifting) and (distributional skewing).\nIn this article, we explore RT distributional characteristics using ex-Gaussian analyses and a nonparametric technique called vincentizing. Vincentizing creates composite RT distributions by averaging RT distributions across participants and involves computing a predefined number of vincentiles as a function of participant and experimental condition, where a vincentile is defined as the mean of observations between neighboring percentiles. For example, to obtain 10 vincentiles, the RT data within each condition for a participant is first sorted (from fastest to slowest responses), and the first 10% of the data are then averaged, followed by the second 10%, and so on. Individual vincentiles are then averaged across participants. Importantly, unlike ex-Gaussian fitting, vincentizing represents raw data directly and makes no assumptions about the shape of the underlying RT distribution. Plots of mean vincentiles are useful for investigating how different variables influence different regions of the RT distribution and provide an important graphical complement to exGaussian analyses (see Balota, Yap, Cortese, & Watson, in press, for further discussion of the relation between vincentile plots and exGaussian parameters).\nMost relevant for the purposes of this study, Plourde and Besner (1997) and Yap and Balota (2007) observed additivity in the means, higher order cumulants1 (i.e., variance and the third cumulant), and the ex-Gaussian parameters in their distributional analyses of lexical\n1 Cumulants are statistics that describe the characteristics of a distribution and are closely related to its moments. The first cumulant is the mean, the second the variance, and the third estimates the skew of a distribution. The third cumulant is zero for symmetric distributions, is negative for negatively skewed distributions, and is positive for positively skewed distributions.\ndecision performance. In the present study, we evaluate whether the predicted additivity persists when the utility of familiarity is undermined via a pseudohomophone nonword context. Indeed, it is even possible that one may observe trade-off effects in the underlying distributional characteristics that are not apparent at the level of the mean, like those reported by Heathcote et al. (1991) in Stroop performance. It is also useful to examine higher order cumulants because additivity in these estimates provides additional support for separate and independent processes (Roberts & Sternberg, 1993). It is important to point out, however, that estimates for higher order cumulants are associated with extremely large variances and are also very sensitive to outliers (Ratcliff, 1979). For example, Ratcliff estimated that 10,000 observations were necessary before the standard deviation of the fourth cumulant could be brought down to 10% of the size of the fourth cumulant. Given the relatively modest cell sizes used in this study (n 50), it is likely that estimates of the variance and the third cumulant will be highly variable and unstable. However, if interactivity is still observed in these very noisy estimates, this provides compelling evidence against independent stages.\nOverview of Experiments\nThe joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were assessed in four lexical decision experiments. Legal pronounceable nonwords (e.g., FLIRP) were used in Experiment 1 whereas all the nonwords in Experiments 2, 3, and 4 consisted of pseudohomophones (e.g., BRANE). We expected to see additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in Experiment 1 in both means and distributional characteristics, given the prior work by Yap and Balota (2007) and Plourde and Besner (1997).2\nIn Experiment 2, the presence of pseudohomophones should increase the size of the word frequency effect, because it has been demonstrated that as word\u2013nonword discrimination difficulty increases, word frequency effects increase in magnitude. The interaction between nonword type and word frequency can be accommodated within the random-walk framework, which, like the diffusion model described earlier, assumes that lexical decision involves the accumulation of noisy information over time (Stone & Van Orden, 1993; Yap et al., 2006). Like the diffusion model, the random-walk model produces larger effects in RT latencies when signal strength (the analogue of drift rate) is low. Broadly speaking, when pseudohomophones are used, discrimination difficulty is high and evidence accumulates less rapidly. This translates to a lower signal strength and larger effects. The critical question is whether we now obtain evidence for additivity in means and RT distributional characteristics when word\u2013nonword discrimination is more difficult. Because of the intriguing distributional results obtained in Experiment 2, we attempted to replicate this pattern in two additional pools of participants from two different universities, who have different profiles of performance in the LDT. Because the experiments are very similar, we provide a single overall General Method section, and report the results separately for each experiment.\nGeneral Method"}, {"heading": "Sample and Procedures", "text": "Participants. A total of 144 participants participated in the four experiments for course credit or $10 (see Table 1 for a summary of participant characteristics). All participants had normal or corrected-\nto-normal vision and were recruited from the Washington University (Experiments 1 and 2); the University at Albany, State University of New York (Experiment 3); and the University of Waterloo (Experiment 4) participant pools.\nApparatus. An IBM-compatible computer running E-prime software (Schneider, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2001) was used to control stimulus presentation and to collect data. The stimuli were displayed on a 17-in. Super VGA monitor, and participants\u2019 responses were made on a computer keyboard.3\nStimuli. The stimuli for the LDT consisted of 200 words, 200 length-matched pronounceable nonwords (Experiment 1), and 200 length-matched pseudohomophones (Experiments 2, 3, and 4; see Appendix for a full list of stimuli). One hundred words were designated high frequency (mean counts per million 1,227) and 100 words low frequency (mean counts per million 44; Lund & Burgess, 1996). For high-frequency words, the mean length was 4.73 letters (SD .96), and the mean orthographic neighborhood size (N) (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, & Besner, 1977) was 4.77. For lowfrequency words, the mean length was 4.78 letters (SD .85), and the mean N was 4.82. There was no significant difference between highand low-frequency words with respect to length (t 1) and orthographic neighborhood size (t 1). For the legal nonwords and pseudohomophones, the mean Ns were 3.38 and 4.66, respectively, p .002.4 For the pseudohomophones, the mean baseword fre-\n2 The purpose of Experiment 1 was to provide a necessary baseline, specifically a within-subjects experiment utilizing the degradation manipulation (rapid interleaving of mask and target) described in Yap and Balota (2007). Yap and Balota used a between-participants manipulation; and, although Plourde and Besner (1997) had a within-subjects design, their degradation manipulation was based on contrast reduction.\n3 One reviewer was concerned that collecting response latencies from the keyboard may not be as accurate as using the PST serial response box. According to the timing simulations described in Schneider et al. (2001), E-prime programs running on appropriately tuned desktop Pentium class machines running at 120MHz or faster can collect millisecond precise real-time input from either a keyboard or the PST response box.\n4 The fact that the pseudohomophones and legal nonwords were not matched on orthographic N suggests that any observed nonword type effects cannot be unambiguously attributed to pseudohomophony; it is quite possible that orthographic N is also making a contribution. However, in Experiments 2\u20134, we are not claiming that pseudohomophony per se is responsible for the observed effects. Rather, we are primarily interested in manipulating the familiarity of the nonword context and examining how foils that are more similar to targets (i.e., pseudohomophones) influence the response to words. Clearly, familiarity in this instance is a multidimensional quantity that could encompass pseudohomophony and/or orthographic neighborhood size.\nquency (i.e., the frequency of the word BRAIN for the nonword BRANE) was 647 counts per million.\nProcedure. Participants were tested individually in soundattenuated cubicles under standard lighting conditions, sitting about 60 cm from the computer screen. After completing a computeradministered 40-item Shipley (1940) vocabulary task, participants were told that letter strings would be presented at the center of the screen and that they were to indicate as quickly and accurately as possible via a button press on the keyboard whether the letter string spelled a word they knew or not. Twenty practice trials were then presented, followed by five experimental blocks of 80 trials, with mandatory breaks between blocks. The order in which stimuli were presented was randomized anew for each participant, with clear and degraded trials randomly intermixed within each block. All stimuli were uppercase and were presented in the 14-point Courier font. For the degradation condition, letter strings were rapidly alternated with a randomly generated mask of the same length. For example, the mask &?# was presented for 14 ms, followed by DOG for 28 ms; and the two were repeatedly alternated until the participant responded. The mask was generated from random permutations of the symbols @, #, $, %, &, ?, and *, with the proviso that the mask be the same length as the string and that symbols not be repeated within a mask. Each trial consisted of the following order of events: (a) a fixation point ( ) at the center of the monitor for 400 ms, (b) a blank screen for 200 ms, and (c) a stimulus centered at the fixation point\u2019s location. The stimulus remained on the screen until a keyboard response was made. Participants pressed the apostrophe key for words and the A key for nonwords. Each correct response was followed by a 1,600 ms delay. If a response was incorrect, a 170 ms tone was presented simultaneously with the onset of a 450 ms presentation of the word \u201cIncorrect\u201d (displayed slightly below the fixation point). In order to keep the delay between the response to a stimulus and the presentation of the next stimulus constant across correct and incorrect trials, each incorrect response was followed by a 1,150-ms delay.\nDesign. A 2 2 factorial design was used: both stimulus quality and word frequency were manipulated within participants. The stimulus quality of each item was also counterbalanced across participants, so that there were 50 observations for each of the four experimental conditions."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "For all experiments, errors and response latencies faster than 200 ms or slower than 3,000 ms were first excluded, and the overall mean and standard deviation of each participant\u2019s word and nonword latencies were then computed. Of the remaining latencies, any latencies 2.5 standard deviations above or below each participant\u2019s respective mean (across all conditions) were removed. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were then carried out on the mean response latencies, accuracy, cumulants, and exGaussian parameters of the RT data. For RT means and accuracy, ANOVAs by participants and items were conducted. For the cumulants and ex-Gaussian parameters, only ANOVAs by participants were conducted.\nExperiment 1"}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In Experiment 1, the overall error rate was 6.6%, and data trimming eliminated an additional 2.4% of the trials.

The interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was not significant (Fp and Fi 1).\nVariance and third cumulant. For variance, only the main effect of stimulus quality was significant, F(1, 27) 11.02, p .003,\nMSE 1.50E 09, 2 .29; the variance was larger for degraded words. The main effect of frequency and the interaction were not significant, Fs 1. For the third cumulant, only the main effect of stimulus quality was significant, F(1, 27) 5.20, p .031, MSE 2.03E 15, 2 .16; the third cumulant was larger for degraded words. The main effect of frequency and the interaction did not approach significance, Fs 1. As noted earlier, because of the high degree of variability in higher order cumulants, the lack of a reliable interaction cannot be taken as definitive support for additive stages, but it is consistent with this perspective.\nEx-Gaussian analyses. Using the quantile maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) procedure in the QMPE v2.18 program (Cousineau, Brown, & Heathcote, 2004; Heathcote, Brown, & Mewhort, 2002), ex-Gaussian parameters ( , , ) were obtained for each participant across the different experimental conditions. QMLE provides unbiased parameter estimates and has been demonstrated to be more effective than continuous maximum likelihood estimation for small samples (Heathcote & Brown, 2004; Speckman & Rouder, 2004). All fits successfully converged within 250 iterations.\nFor , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 27) 45.61, p .001, MSE 753.38, 2 .63, and word frequency, F(1, 27) 80.83, p .001, MSE 336.74, 2 .75, were significant. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was not significant (F 1). Turning to , only the main effect of word frequency approached significance, F(1, 27) 3.49, p .073, MSE 480.11, 2 .11.

The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was not significant (F 1). The ex-Gaussian analysis is very clear; all parameters (except ) produced main effects, but none of the parameters produced interactions.\nVincentile analyses. The mean vincentiles5 for the different experimental conditions are plotted in the top two panels of Figure 1, whereas the bottom panel of Figure 1 presents the mean frequency effect as a function of stimulus quality and vincentiles. For the top two panels, the empirical mean vincentiles are represented by data points and standard error bars, and the estimated vincentiles for the respective best-fitting ex-Gaussian distribution are represented by lines. As the error bars indicate, each vincentile represents a different range of RTs for each participant. Presenting the data in this manner allows one to visually assess the goodness of fit between empirical and estimated vincentiles. Clearly, the data are fitted well by the ex-Gaussian distribution, and the divergence between mean vincentiles and theoretical ex-Gaussian vincentiles is typically smaller than one standard error in most cases. Note that the bottom panel, which presents difference scores, depicts only empirical vincentiles.\nAs one can see, although the frequency effect increases across vincentiles for both the clear and degraded conditions, word frequency effects are not different for clear and degraded items at any of the vincentiles. In summary, when legal nonwords are used in lexical decision, stimulus quality and word frequency produce robust additive effects in RT means and distributional characteristics, along with accuracy, a pattern that is consistent with the available literature. We now turn to experiments that explore this interaction in the context of pseudohomophones.\n5 In preliminary analyses, we plotted the vincentiles using 7, 10, and 15 vincentiles. The same trends emerged regardless of the number of vincentiles. We decided to use 7 vincentiles to maximize the reliability of each vincentile. For each participant, this allows each vincentile to be based on approximately 6 RT trials (after eliminating error and outlier trials), given that there are 50 trials per condition.\nExperiment 2"}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In Experiment 2, the overall error rate was 7.7%, and data trimming eliminated an additional 2.6% of the trials. The mean response latencies, accuracy, ex-Gaussian parameters, variances, and third cumulants for Experiment 2 are presented in Table 3.\nMean response latencies and accuracy.

The interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was not significant, either by participants ( p .30) or by items ( p .23).\nVariance and third cumulant. For variance, the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 55) 38.17, p .001, MSE 2.20E 09, 2 .41, and word frequency, F(1, 55) 10.19, p .002, MSE 6.54E 08, 2 .16, were significant; the variance was larger for degraded words and low-frequency words. The interaction was not significant, F 1. For the third cumulant, only the main effect of stimulus quality was significant, F(1, 55) 13.94, p .001, MSE 2.79E 15, 2 .20; the third cumulant was larger for degraded words. The main effect of frequency and the interaction were not significant, Fs 1.\nEx-Gaussian analyses.

Importantly, the stimulus quality word frequency interaction was now significant, F(1, 55) 6.05, p .017, MSE 1,106.37, 2 .10, with larger frequency effects for degraded words. Turning to , the main effect of word fre-\nquency was significant, F(1, 55) 11.62, p .001, MSE 547.65, 2 .17; the interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was marginal, F(1, 55) 3.88, p .054, MSE 849.55, 2 .07, with larger frequency effects for degraded words. Turning to , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 55) 65.70, p .001, MSE 5,034.61, 2 .54, and word frequency, F(1, 55) 21.83, p .001, MSE 2,563.92, 2 .28, were significant, but the stimulus quality word frequency interaction was not significant ( p .22). Although the stimulus quality word frequency interaction was not significant in , it is noteworthy that the effect of frequency was actually larger in the clear condition than in the degraded condition, which is precisely opposite to the pattern obtained in and .\nVincentile analyses. The magnitudes of the frequency effect across the different vincentiles are plotted in Figure 2 (bottom panel). In the presence of pseudohomophones, degraded words show a larger frequency effect than clear words, particularly in the early and modal vincentiles. This trend reverses in the final vincentile, where clear words show a larger frequency effect than degraded words. This is consistent with the nonsignificant tendency in , noted above. Hence, the opposing effects in the early and late vincentiles create additive effects at the level of the mean.\nIn summary, at the level of the mean, large additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were obtained in both Experiments 1 and 2. Importantly, at the level of distributional characteristics, the two experiments yielded different patterns. In Experiment 1, which used legal nonword foils, additivity was demonstrated in both means and distributional characteristics. In Experiment 2, which used pseudohomophone foils, stimulus quality and word frequency interacted in , with larger frequency effects for degraded words. The vincentile analyses also confirmed that frequency effects were larger for degraded words in the early vincentiles. Collectively, these results suggest that when distributional characteristics are considered, one does not obtain unambiguous additivity between stimulus quality and word frequency in the presence of pseudohomophones. Instead, for the fastest and modal RTs, a larger frequency effect is obtained for degraded words; this trend is offset by an opposing effect in the slowest RTs. As noted above, such tradeoffs in distributional characteristics have been observed before (see Heathcote et al., 1991, and Spieler\net al., 1996). However, because of the theoretical importance of such a pattern, we decided to establish its stability by attempting to replicate the results from Experiment 2 in two distinct populations (Experiment 3, University at Albany, and Experiment 4, University of Waterloo), which produced varying levels of performance in the LDT.\nExperiment 3"}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The overall error rate was 11.3%, and data trimming eliminated an additional 4.3% of the trials.

The magnitudes of the frequency effect across the different vincentiles are plotted in Figure 3 (bottom panel). As in Experiment 2, there is a larger frequency effect for degraded words in the fast vincentiles, and this trend reverses sharply in the final vincentiles. This pattern is also very consistent with the tradeoffs in the ex-Gaussian parameters, and the trends in the relatively unstable higher order cumulants. These opposing effects again create the overall additive effects at the level of the mean.

For , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 31) 48.77, p .001, MSE 6,093.32, 2 .61, and word frequency, F(1, 31) 76.06, p .001, MSE 1,494.41, 2 .71, were significant. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was again significant, F(1, 31) 5.17, p .030, MSE 2,641.78, 2 .14, with larger frequency effects for the degraded words. Turning to , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 31) 10.84, p .002, MSE 3,512.34, 2 .26, and word frequency, F(1, 31) 9.18, p .005, MSE 1,407.75, 2 .23, were significant. The interaction approached significance, F(1, 31) 2.96, p .096, MSE 2,402.63, 2 .09, with larger frequency effects in the degraded condition. Turning to , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 31) 36.59, p .001, MSE 10,696.82, 2 .54, and word frequency, F(1, 31) 14.15, p .001, MSE 3,827.70, 2 .31, were significant. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction showed a trend towards significance, F(1, 31) 2.52, p .123, with significant simple effects of frequency in the clear ( p .001), but not the degraded ( p .098), condition. In summary, the stimulus quality word frequency interaction was significant for , and approached significance for and .\nVincentile analyses. The magnitudes of the frequency effect across the different vincentiles are plotted in Figure 4 (bottom panel). As in Experiments 2 and 3, there is a larger frequency effect for degraded words in the fast vincentiles, and this trend reverses in the final vincentiles, creating additivity at the level of the mean. In general, Experiment 4 replicates the empirical pattern observed in Experiments 2 and 3, supporting the robustness of the tradeoffs.\nComposite Analyses\nBecause participants in Experiments 2, 3, and 4 were presented with the same set of items, we also conducted composite analyses that combined the data of the 116 participants across the three experiments, with university as a between-participant variable and stimulus quality and frequency as within-participant variables.\nThis was done in order to maximize power and to establish the reliability of the observed distributional effects across three sets of participants who are associated with different lexical decision profiles. Table 6 presents the mean response latencies, accuracy, and ex-Gaussian parameters for these analyses, collapsing across Experiments 2 to 4.\nMean response latencies and accuracy. The ANOVA on mean response latencies yielded significant main effects of stimulus quality,\nF(1, 113) 278.39, p .001, MSE 12,279.72, 2 .71, and word frequency, F(1, 113) 220.60, p .001, MSE 4,037.88, 2 .66. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was not significant, F 1. University interacted significantly with stimulus quality (p .002) and frequency (p .012). Compared to the participants in Washington University (Experiment 2), participants in University at Albany (Experiment 3) and the University of Waterloo (Experiment 4) produced larger main effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in means. Importantly, the three-way interaction between university, stimulus quality, and word frequency was not significant (F 1), indicating that additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were replicated across sites.\nTurning to accuracy, the main effects of stimulus quality, Fp(1, 113) 72.45, p .001, MSE .0021, 2 .39, and word frequency, Fp(1, 113) 207.78, p .001, MSE .0029,\n2 .65, were significant. The interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was borderline significant ( p .053), with larger frequency effects for degraded words. University interacted significantly with stimulus quality ( p .001) and frequency ( p .019). For stimulus quality, participants in Experiment 4 produced a larger main effect than participants in Experiment 2 and Experiment 3; for frequency, participants in Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 produced a larger main effect than participants in Experiment 2. The three-way interaction between university, stimulus quality, and word frequency was not significant (F 1).\nVariance and third cumulant. For variance, the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 113) 75.97, p .001, MSE 3.68E 09, 2 .40, and word frequency, F(1, 113) 25.44, p .001, MSE 1.26E 09, 2 .18, were significant; the variance was larger for degraded words and low-frequency words. The interaction approached significance ( p .106), with smaller frequency effects for degraded words. For the third cumulant, the main effect of stimulus quality was significant, F(1, 113) 16.16, p .001, MSE 3.28E 15, 2 .13; the third cumulant was larger for degraded words. Although not significant, F(1, 113) 1.98, p .163, the interaction in the third cumulant also indicated smaller frequency effects for degraded than clear words. Again, as expected, the high variability in these measures does not allow strong inferences to be made. University did not interact significantly with any other variable in both cumulants.\nEx-Gaussian analyses. For , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 113) 188.06, p .001, MSE 3,918.34, 2 .63, and word frequency, F(1, 113) 101.82, p .001, MSE 3,296.89, 2 .47, were significant. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was significant, F(1, 113) 20.22, p .001, MSE 2,035.66, 2 .15, with larger frequency effects for the degraded words. University interacted significantly with stimulus quality ( p .001) and frequency ( p .024). Compared to the participants in Experiment 2, participants in Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 produced larger main effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in . The three-way interaction between university, stimulus quality, and word frequency was not significant ( p .26), indicating that the same interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was present across sites.\nTurning to , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 113) 22.69, p .001, MSE 1,942.11, 2 .17, and word frequency, F(1, 113) 35.61, p .001, MSE 1,877.97, 2 .24, were significant. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was significant, F(1, 113) 12.16, p .001, MSE 1,587.42, 2\n.10, with larger frequency effects in the degraded condition. University interacted significantly with stimulus quality ( p .006) and frequency ( p .004). Compared to the participants in Experiment 2, participants in Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 produced larger main effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in . The three-way interaction was not significant, F 1.\nTurning to , the main effects of stimulus quality, F(1, 113) 130.04, p .001, MSE 7,724.74, 2 .54, and word frequency, F(1, 113) 29.70, p .001, MSE 4,812.90, 2 .21, were significant. The stimulus quality word frequency interaction was significant, F(1, 113) 9.78, p .002, MSE 3,816.32, 2 .08, with larger frequency effects in the clear condition. University did not interact with either stimulus quality (p .166) or frequency (p .82). The three-way interaction was not significant, p .220.\nIn summary, stimulus quality and word frequency were additive in means but interactive in all three ex-Gaussian parameters. Compared to clear words, degraded words produced larger frequency effects in and , which reflect the modal part of the distribution, but smaller frequency effects in , which reflects the tail of the distribution; this is consistent with the results of the individual experiments. The threeway interaction between university, stimulus quality, and frequency was not significant in any of the parameters, indicating that the same distributional tradeoffs were observed at all three sites. This is all the more impressive given the variability in lexical decision performance across the different participant populations. Specifically, compared to participants in Experiment 2, participants in Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 were producing larger main effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in means, accuracy, , and .\nVincentile analyses. The magnitudes of the frequency effect across the different vincentiles are plotted in Figure 5 (bottom panel), collapsed across all 116 participants. In line with the previous analyses, there is a larger frequency effect for degraded words in the fast vincentiles, and this trend reverses in the slowest vincentiles. More importantly, these opposing effects produce additivity in the analysis of means. We explored these effects by conducting an ANOVA with stimulus quality, word frequency, and vincentiles as within-participant variables. Interestingly, even with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction to compensate for potential violation of sphericity, the three-way interaction between stimulus quality, word frequency, and vincentiles was significant,\nF(1.79,205.73) 6.26, p .003, MSE 7,602.17, 2 .05, confirming that the shape of the frequency effect in the clear condition is markedly different from its counterpart in the degraded condition. To probe the three-way interaction, we separately examined the effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in the three fastest vincentiles versus the slowest vincentile. In the analysis based on the three fastest vincentiles, the interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was significant, F(1, 115) 7.08, p .009, MSE 2,717.69, 2 .06, with larger frequency effects for degraded words. In the analysis using the slowest vincentile, the interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency was also significant but in the opposite direction, F(1, 115) 4.15, p .044, MSE 13,242.66, 2 .04; frequency effects were now larger for clear words. It is indeed noteworthy that ex-Gaussian and vincentile analyses, two very different approaches for examining RT distributions, converge on such similar conclusions.\nGeneral Discussion\nThis is the first study to examine the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency as a function of nonword type, using both conventional and distributional analyses, and the main findings can be summarized succinctly. In Experiment 1, using an LDT with legal nonword distracters (e.g., FLIRP), the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were additive in means, accuracy, and distributional characteristics. These findings are compatible with the extant literature (Plourde & Besner, 1997; Yap & Balota, 2007). More intriguingly, when pseudohomophones (e.g., BRANE) were used as foils (Experiments 2, 3, and 4), opposing interactive effects in the underlying distributions were observed, producing apparent additivity at the level of the mean. This same basic pattern was reproduced in three experiments across three different universities, attesting both to the robustness of the effect and to the stability of RT distributional measures. Specifically, the composite analyses revealed that stimulus quality and word frequency interacted significantly in and , with larger frequency effects for degraded words. This interactive trend in (reflecting modal RTs) was offset by an opposing pattern in (reflecting slowest RTs), where frequency effects were larger for clear words. As the mean is the algebraic sum of and , these\neffects offset each other to produce additive effects in means. It is noteworthy that the same distributional tradeoffs were produced by distinct participant populations that varied along a number of dimensions, including overall response latency and accuracy (see Tables 3\u20135), Shipley vocabulary scores (see Table 1), and the magnitude of stimulus quality and frequency effects.\nThese data indicate that the joint effects of factors in means can be dissociated from joint effects in distributional characteristics. The trade-off between and is strikingly similar to the Stroop color-naming performance data reported by Heathcote et al. (1991) and Spieler et al. (1996). As discussed at the beginning of this article, they observed no difference between the congruent and baseline conditions in mean RTs, but ex-Gaussian analyses revealed that this null effect was spuriously produced by opposing effects in and . Likewise, in Experiments 2 to 4, the apparent additivity in means was driven by countervailing interactive effects in and , trends which are also reflected by the vincentile plots (see Figures 2 to 5). This is markedly different from Experiment 1, where the additivity in means was mirrored identically in ex-Gaussian parameters and vincentiles.\nFor ease of exposition, our discussion has, thus far, focused on how effects in means can be partitioned into and effects. This is, of course, an oversimplification. For example, one could argue that in ex-Gaussian analyses, and are not truly independent parameters. As mentioned in the Are Additive Effects TaskSpecific section, the mean is the algebraic sum of and , suggesting that any effect on will necessarily also have an effect on . This could be responsible for the trade-off between and . Specifically, increased effects in could be accompanied by decreased effects in , which is the pattern observed in Experiments 2 to 4. We do not believe this to be a problem in the present analyses. First, the trade-off was only demonstrated when pseudohomophones, but not legal nonwords, were used. A fitting artifact should manifest itself in both nonword type conditions. Second, when we examined the correlations between and estimates across Experiments 2 to 4, the correlations were always positive, which is inconsistent with a trade-off.\nIn addition, it is important to note that ex-Gaussian fits yield a parameter that reflects variability of the modal RTs. The composite analyses indicate that when pseudohomophones were present, stimulus quality and frequency interacted significantly in , with larger frequency effects in degraded words. This interaction qualifies the interpretation that additive effects in means are due entirely to a trade-off between and . To see why this is the case, consider Table 6, which indicates a 24 ms interaction in . As can be seen, the frequency effect is much larger in degraded words (34 ms) than in clear words (10 ms), and this is driven primarily by a large for degraded low-frequency words. Because the estimate for (the standard deviation of the modal RTs) is disproportionately high for degraded low-frequency words, the estimate for will be correspondingly lowered, because there is effectively less skew to model. This will attenuate the frequency effect for degraded words.\nThere is always the possibility that the results from an RT distributional analytic procedure can be influenced by the particular model that is being fitted or the fitting process (Luce, 1986; Van Zandt, 2000, 2002). Although the interaction is certainly responsible for part of the trade-off between and , it is also very clear that the opposing effects cannot be fully explained away as a consequence of the fitting procedure. Here is where the vincentile analyses are useful. In particular, the vincentile analyses reveal precisely the same empirical pattern (see Figure 5); and, as mentioned, vincentizing is a nonparametric technique that plots raw data directly without making any assumptions about the true underlying RT distribution. Hence, we are confident about the observed trade-off in the present results, although we do recom-\nmend that all three parameters should be considered when interpreting the results of ex-Gaussian analyses and that vincentile plots should be examined for evidence of convergence or divergence (see Balota et al., in press, for further discussion of advantages and possible constraints in RT distributional analyses)."}, {"heading": "Foil Type Modulates the Relation Between Stimulus Quality and Word Frequency", "text": "The additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency have traditionally been considered one of the most robust benchmarks in the word recognition literature. However, the generality of this finding is an issue. As noted, Yap and Balota (2007) have demonstrated that although additive effects are clearly obtained in lexical decision performance, one instead observes interactive effects in other word identification paradigms such as speeded pronunciation (replicated by O\u2019Malley et al., 2007) and semantic classification. Moreover, the nature of the interaction, larger frequency effects for degraded words, is exactly the pattern predicted by leading computational models of word recognition, such as a parallel distributed processing model (Plaut et al., 1996), the dual route cascaded model (Coltheart et al., 2001), and the multiple read-out model (Grainger & Jacobs, 1996). This suggests that discrete stages, the traditional interpretation of additive effects, may not be a fixed property of word recognition processing dynamics but may instead reflect processes that are specific to the LDT. Specifically, lexical decision, unlike other word recognition tasks, places a premium on familiarity-based information for discriminating between words and nonwords (Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Balota & Spieler, 1999; Besner, 1983). Stimulus degradation undermines this familiarity, making it necessary for degraded words to undergo an additional normalization procedure prior to word identification. In speeded pronunciation, where familiarity is not useful for driving responses, one would not expect additive effects, which is indeed what Yap and Balota and O\u2019Malley et al. reported. Furthermore, Yap and Balota also reported an interaction in semantic classification, where familiarity discrimination is also unlikely to play a role.\nThe departure point of the present experiments was the examination of lexical decision performance when pseudohomophones are\nused as foils. As discussed earlier, all previous studies investigating the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency have used legal nonwords, which allows familiarity to function as a viable dimension for word\u2013nonword discrimination. In the context of pseudohomophones, which are orthographically legal and phonologically very similar to real words, the utility of familiarity for driving lexical decision responses is undermined. One expects the lexical decision mechanism to rely less on global lexical activity (a proxy for familiarity) and more on the activation levels of individual representations, making the LDT functionally more similar to speeded pronunciation and semantic classification. Hence, when familiarity is deemphasized in lexical decision, the early normalization stage and its attendant additive effects may no longer be mandatory. Instead, stimulus quality and frequency should interact, just as it does in other word recognition tasks (Yap & Balota, 2007).\nOur results indicate that the type of nonword used in an LDT does modulate the joint effects of stimulus quality and frequency. When pseudohomophones are used, additive effects are seen in means, but this additivity is obscuring other effects at the level of the underlying RT distributions. In fact, the ex-Gaussian analyses on the composite data from Experiments 2\u20134 indicate that stimulus quality and word frequency interact significantly in and (see Table 6), with larger frequency effects for degraded words. This is precisely the predicted theoretical pattern from most computational models of lexical decision performance. Importantly, the corresponding vincentile plot also shows significantly larger frequency effects for degraded words in the early and modal vincentiles (see Figure 5). Indeed, follow-up tests based on data from the three fastest vincentiles (i.e., approximately the fastest 40% of the responses) indicate a significant interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency. This pattern, obtained across three universities, is particularly noteworthy because when legal nonwords (e.g., FLIRP) are used, the two factors are unequivocally additive in . One sees this not only in Experiment 1 but also in other studies featuring distributional analysis (Plourde & Besner, 1997; Yap & Balota, 2007). These results suggest that when familiaritybased information is less useful for driving lexical decisions, interactive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency can be detected in the modal portion of the RT distribution."}, {"heading": "Why Are Frequency Effects Smaller for Degraded Items in the Later Vincentiles?", "text": "One of the most interesting aspects of this study was the observation that although degraded words show larger frequency effects\nfor the faster and modal RTs, this pattern abruptly reverses itself in the slowest RTs. The larger frequency effects for clear items in the slowest vincentiles offset the larger frequency effects for degraded items in the earlier vincentiles, effectively producing additive effects at the level of the mean. There are two ways one might accommodate this counterintuitive finding. First, these effects may reflect additional task-specific checking processes, which in this context refer to postlexical attention-demanding analytic processes (e.g., spelling verification or retrieval of semantic referents) that increase RTs (Balota & Spieler, 1999). Specifically, it is difficult to discriminate between low-frequency words and pseudohomophones, and so, whether low-frequency words are clearly presented or visually degraded, it is likely that they will undergo additional checking. In contrast, this may not apply to highfrequency words. Whereas degraded high-frequency words might undergo checking, clearly presented high-frequency words are sufficiently familiar that they may not require additional checking. Checking processes are more likely to be reflected in the component or the slowest RTs (Balota & Spieler, 1999), and this account predicts larger frequency effects in the slow RTs for clear words but more modest frequency effects for degraded words. This is because clear low-frequency words engage additional checking processes to a greater extent than clear high-frequency words, but all degraded items undergo checking, independent of frequency.\nOf course, by invoking an additional checking process that operates after familiarity-based discrimination, the checking account increases the theoretical complexity of the machinery underlying lexical decision. Indeed, after examining the joint effects of nonword type (pseudohomophones vs. legal nonwords vs. illegal nonwords) and word frequency using distributional analyses, Yap et al. (2006) argued that the overall pattern of results was more consistent with a single-process random-walk model than a two-stage model that incorporated familiarity-based and checking processes (Balota & Spieler, 1999). We have three responses to this. First, although Yap et al. implemented a particular instantiation of a two-process model, their results obviously do not rule out two-process models in general (see their discussion on p. 1341). Second, the primary data that distinguished the two-process account from the random-walk perspective in Yap et al. (2006) came from the illegal nonword condition (e.g., XNIV). It is possible that lexical decision performance in that condition is qualitatively outside the scope of the standard LDT, because participants may be making orthographic legality decisions. Third, and most importantly, the constellation of findings in the present study presents an important challenge to any one-process model. We are not aware of any single-process model that has explicitly simulated opposing effects in different portions of the RT distribution. For example, consider the diffusion model, which suggests that lexical decision reflects the unitary accumulation of noisy evidence over time. Based on the geometry of the diffusion process, one would expect any effect observed in fast RTs to stay either the same size or become larger in slow RTs. Hence, going from fast to slow RTs, it should not be possible for an effect to become smaller in magnitude, much less reverse in direction. Yet, this is the precise empirical pattern we have observed across three experiments. Although the diffusion model has been remarkably successful in accounting for aspects of lexical decision performance (Ratcliff et al., 2004; Yap et al., 2006), we would argue that there are instances where two (or perhaps more) processes need to be invoked. For\nexample, as discussed in the Additive Effects and Models of Word Recognition section, the diffusion model had difficulty handling the additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in the presence of legal nonwords (O\u2019Malley et al., 2007; Yap & Balota, 2007), a limitation that applies to other models of lexical decision performance. Likewise, it is unclear how the diffusion model can accommodate the consistent opposing interactive effects of stimulus quality and frequency in fast and slow RTs without incorporating a secondary process.\nA second possible explanation for the crossover at the slowest vincentiles is that there is a temporal deadline or functional ceiling in lexical decision performance, which the degraded lowfrequency words are up against. When participants are responding to such items, there is sufficient partial lexical activity to drive a \u201cword\u201d response when the deadline is reached. This will cause the slowest responses in the degraded low-frequency condition to be truncated, reducing distributional skew and attenuating the frequency effect in the slow RTs for the degraded words. Of course, one might ask why this functional ceiling exists when pseudohomophones but not legal nonwords are used. Nonword type affects word latencies in lexical decision; the more similar nonword foils are to words, the longer word latencies are (Stone & Van Orden, 1993; Yap et al., 2006). Hence, words in the pseudohomophone condition, compared to the legal nonword condition, will have longer latencies and are more likely to encounter the above-mentioned functional ceiling. One problem with the simple deadline account is that it predicts very little (or no) variance for the slowest RTs of degraded low-frequency words. This is inconsistent with the present results where, compared to the slowest RTs in the other three conditions, the slowest RTs of degraded low-frequency words were associated with the greatest variability. Permitting variability in the deadline (a\u0300 la Coltheart et al., 2001) might address this, but these explanations are ultimately post hoc and require independent verification (see Wagenmakers, Ratcliff, Gomez, & McKoon, 2008, for further discussion of deadline vs. nondeadline models of lexical decision performance)."}, {"heading": "Implications for Models of Visual Word Recognition", "text": "How do the findings reported in this study inform the computational dual route cascaded (Coltheart et al., 2001) and multiple read-out (Grainger & Jacobs, 1996) models, which are able to carry out lexical decisions? As discussed at the beginning of this article, these models produce word lexical decisions when either local or global lexical activity exceeds their respective thresholds. In general, we are skeptical that these models, which are extensions of the logogen approach, can accommodate the present set of lexical decision data. In speeded pronunciation at least, simulations of the dual route cascaded model (and by inference, the architecturally similar multiple read-out model) yield interactive, not additive, effects of stimulus quality and word frequency (Reynolds & Besner, 2004). In order to produce additive effects in lexical decision, O\u2019Malley et al. (2007) have suggested modifying the dual route cascaded model such that the output of the letter units level is thresholded during lexical decision. That is, activation does not reach the orthographic input lexicon until activity in the letter level has reached threshold. Thresholding at the letter level is of course functionally similar to an early perceptual normalization stage. As we have argued, thresholded processing (or\nperceptual normalization) in lexical decision is adaptive because it allows familiarity-based information to be recovered prior to word\u2013nonword discrimination. Furthermore, the implication here is that the dual route cascaded model is sensitive to task demands and is able to appropriately engage cascaded and thresholded letter-level processing during speeded pronunciation and lexical decision, respectively. The preceding account handles additive effects of stimulus quality and frequency in lexical decision, in both means and distributional characteristics, which is the pattern observed when legal nonwords are used as distracters.\nThis account is complicated by the results of the present study, which demonstrated that the presence of pseudohomophone foils produces an interaction between stimulus quality and word frequency in modal RTs, with larger frequency effects for degraded words. How might the model accommodate this? When word-like nonwords (i.e., pseudohomophones) are used as foils, global lexical activity is less diagnostic for word\u2013nonword discrimination. We have suggested that thresholded processing is useful for recovering familiarity-based information. In lexical decision contexts where the utility of this information is undermined, the model should revert to cascaded processing, which yields interactive effects. However, note that this only accounts for interactive effects in the modal portion of the RT distribution. It is unclear how one can handle the trade-off in the tail of the distribution without positing additional checking or deadline-based mechanisms (see the previous section). Finally, we need to emphasize that the discussion in this section is post hoc and, in some ways, counterintuitive. A priori, there is no principled reason why any computational model of visual word recognition would selectively engage thresholded processing in lexical decision and cascaded processing in pronunciation. At the very least, these results support the adaptive nature of subtle characteristics of the lexical processing system to task constraints (Balota & Yap, 2006).\nOf course, the account above rests on the assumption that additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency are more consistent with thresholded than cascaded processing. So far, we have argued that additivity is easier to reconcile with a stage framework, given that cascade models make incorrect predictions about the relationship between means and variances (Roberts & Sternberg, 1993). However, it is important to note that the experimental tasks Roberts and Sternberg based their simulations on did not include the LDT, and it is unclear if the superiority of the stage account holds when one examines additivity in lexical decision performance. We explored this by conducting a supplementary analysis on the data in Experiment 1, where additive effects in means and ex-Gaussian characteristics were observed. Specifically, we computed the variance-change statistic proposed by Roberts and Sternberg for adjudicating between the stage and cascade models; this statistic reflects the ratio of variance effect size to mean effect size. In the simulations described by Roberts and Sternberg, cascade models in general yielded variance-change statistics larger than those observed behaviorally in their datasets. Interestingly, based on the variance-change statistic for our dataset, it turns out that the results in Experiment 1 can also be accommodated by cascade models. In other words, the clear-cut additivity in Experiment 1 may reflect either thresholded processing (the position we have been taking) or cascaded processing. Cascade models can produce additive effects in means and variances, but it is necessary to make additional assumptions. For example, assume we start out with a two-process cascade model and process A is selectively influenced by stimulus\nquality whereas process B is selectively influenced by word frequency. For the model to produce stage-like additivity, each process has to be joined to a fixed slow process that is unaffected by either stimulus quality or word frequency; this effectively becomes a threeprocess model. Specifically, one might have a fast process that is affected by stimulus quality, followed by a slow process that is influenced by neither factor, followed by a fast process that is affected by word frequency.\nThe important point here is that the additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality (with pronounceable nonwords) should not be taken as evidence that eliminates all possible cascade models. However, we believe that such accounts of the present results become quite cumbersome and ad hoc. To produce additive effects in Experiment 1, one requires a cascade model (e.g., the three-process model described above) where the two processes of interest are mated to a slow process that is uninfluenced by both stimulus quality and frequency. When pseudohomophones are used, the slow process stops operating, and the model reverts back to what are functionally two processes, yielding interactive effects in the modal portion of the RT distribution. As noted, we prefer the stage model account for the additive effects of word frequency and degradation for the following reasons: (a) It is relatively simple and parsimonious, (b) it also accommodates performance in another familiarity-based task (e.g., the additive effects of stimulus quality and set size observed in memory scanning), and (c) it is motivated by existing accounts of lexical decision performance. Most important, when familiarity-based information is disabled by including pseudohomophones as the nonwords, thereby forcing individuation of the lexical representations, the system reverts back to the interactive cascadic processes that are typically engaged in most lexical processing tasks. For the cascaded account to be equally viable in accounting for the full set of data, a theorist needs to explain why and how processes in the cascade model are modulated by nonword type. For example, why would the presence of legal nonwords engage additional slow processes that are not modulated by experimental factors? How do the processes reconfigure themselves in a pseudohomophone context, and what might be the reason for this? A modeler trying to simulate these processes faces the additional hurdles of having to explicitly specify which factors influence which processes and to consider other parameters like the shape, location, and spread of the response criterion\u2019s distribution, as well as the specific activation function mediating input and output (Roberts & Sternberg, 1993)."}, {"heading": "Mapping Distributional Characteristics Onto Cognitive Processes", "text": "Based on the foregoing discussion, it may be tempting to conclude that lexical retrieval processes are reflected by the component and the fast and modal RTs, whereas postlexical checking processes are reflected by the component and the slowest RTs. This view is seductive, but clearly oversimplistic. Although some early theorists attempted to map specific processes onto different distributional parameters (Hohle, 1965; McGill & Gibbon, 1965), we agree with Heathcote et al. (1991), Schwarz (2001), and Van Zandt (2002) that the ex-Gaussian model is probably too simple for such substantive cognitive attributions to be made. In that light, it is necessary to emphasize that our \u201cmapping\u201d between distributional characteristics and different classes of cognitive operations\nshould be construed as metaphorical at this point. It is only appropriate to ascribe specific processes to specific distributional parameters when one has a computational model of the targeted task. The model needs to be explicit and well-specified enough for the researcher to predict a priori how experimental manipulations might modulate different RT parameters (Balota & Spieler, 1999). In general, the present distributional analyses should be viewed as a descriptive tool that partitions factor effects into distributional shifting and skewing. These finer-grained effects (especially the types of tradeoffs observed in the current results) can then be used to impose finer constraints on extant models and processes."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The results from the present experiments further underscore the utility of distributional analyses in better understanding the influence of multiple variables. As Heathcote et al. (1991) have pointed out, relying on analyses of means alone can potentially lead to inadequate or misleading conclusions. In this instance, distributional analyses and analyses of means yielded markedly divergent outcomes. At the level of the mean, additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were observed in lexical decision, regardless of nonword type. At the level of the RT distribution, however, interactive effects in were produced only when pseudohomophones, but not legal nonwords, were used, and this pattern was replicated in three different populations of subjects. Collectively, these findings indicate that distributional analyses not only resolve data at a finer level of granularity but may also provide more faithful insights into underlying processes.\nReferences\nAndrews, S., & Heathcote, A.

Mahon and Alfonso Caramazza Harvard University and University of Trento\nIn 2 experiments participants named pictures of common objects with superimposed distractor words. In one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every trial, and participants produced the target response immediately. In the other naming condition, the presentation of the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants delayed production of their naming response until distractor word presentation. Within each naming condition, the distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated. Orthogonal to this manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of the pictures\u2019 names was manipulated. The authors observed semantic interference effects in both the immediate and delayed naming conditions but a frequency effect only in the immediate naming condition. These data indicate that semantic interference can be observed when target picture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. In the context of other findings from the picture\u2013word interference paradigm, the authors interpret these data as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing.\nKeywords: semantic interference effect, lexical selection by competition, picture\u2013word interference, delayed naming, response exclusion hypothesis\nA central question in language production research concerns the dynamical principles that govern the mechanism responsible for retrieving words from the mental lexicon. A widespread assumption in language production models is that lexical selection is a competitive process (e.g., La Heij, 1988; Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999; Roelofs, 2003). The hypothesis of lexical selection by competition proposes that the time it takes to select a target word increases as the levels of activation of nontarget words increase. The primary source of empirical evidence cited in support of lexical selection by competition is the semantic interfer-\nence effect (e.g., Lupker, 1979; Rosinski, 1977): Naming a picture of an object (e.g., CAR) is slower in the context of a semantic category coordinate distractor word (e.g., truck) compared to an unrelated distractor word (e.g., table). The explanation of the semantic interference effect in terms of lexical selection by competition assumes that semantic category coordinate distractors lead to more highly activated lexical representations than do unrelated distractors.1\nRecently, the assumption that lexical selection is a competitive process has been challenged. A number of studies have observed semantic facilitation effects when target pictures and distractor words are semantically related. For example, naming a picture of an object (e.g., CAR) is (a) faster in the context of a semantically related verb distractor (e.g., drive) compared to an unrelated verb distractor (e.g., read; Mahon, Costa, Peterson, Vargas, & Caramazza, 2007), (b) faster in the context of a distractor word that refers to a part of the target object (e.g., engine) compared to an unrelated distractor (e.g., branches; Costa, Alario, & Caramazza, 2005), (c) faster in the context of a within-category semantically close distractor word (e.g., truck) compared to a within-category semantically far distractor word (e.g., wagon; Mahon et al., 2007; but see Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, & Garrett, 2004), and (d) faster in the context of a masked semantic category coordinate distractor\n1 This is because lexical representations of semantic category coordinate distractors receive activation from two sources (the picture and word), whereas those of unrelated distractors receive activation from only one source (the word).\nNiels Janssen, Department of Psychology, Harvard University, and Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive, CNRS & Universite\u0301 de Provence, Marseille, France; Walter Schirm, Department of Psychology, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands; Bradford Z.

(This list is nonexhaustive; for a review of semantic facilitation effects, see Mahon et al., 2007.) If lexical selection were by competition, one would have expected semantic interference effects\u2014not facilitation effects\u2014in the studies cited above.\nAn alternative to lexical selection by competition is the view that the highest activated lexical node is selected, without regard to the levels of activation of nontarget lexical nodes (e.g., Caramazza, 1997; Dell, 1986; Stemberger, 1985).2 If one adopted such a model of lexical selection then the range of semantic facilitation effects that have been reported in the literature would follow as a natural consequence (Costa et al., 2005; Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006; Mahon et al., 2007). Specifically, such semantic facilitation effects would arise as a result of semantic priming between distractor words and target pictures. However, if one assumed that the semantic facilitation effects arise during lexical selection, one would be compelled to assume that the semantic interference effect arises at a different level of processing. It is thus clear that the semantic interference effect would constitute evidence for the hypothesis of lexical selection by competition only if there is independent reason to believe that the phenomenon reflects a lexical-level process.\nThe Response Exclusion Hypothesis\nSpoken language permits only a single word to be produced at a given time. It must therefore be the case that at a suitably peripheral level of processing, spoken language production involves a single-channel output buffer. It is also known that aurally and visually presented words have a privileged relationship to the articulators in a way that pictures do not (e.g., Roelofs, 2003). It follows that in the situation presented by the picture\u2013word interference paradigm, written or aurally presented distractor words will be available to the articulators sooner than the names of the target pictures. Thus, in a given picture naming event in the picture\u2013word interference paradigm, a production-ready representation corresponding to the distractor word must be purged from the single-channel output buffer before the name of the picture can be produced. Consistent with this analysis, recent work has suggested that part of the variance in naming latencies observed in the picture\u2013word interference paradigm arises at a postlexical level. For instance, Miozzo and Caramazza (2003) had participants name pictures of objects (e.g., CAR) in the context of low frequency (e.g., spleen) and high frequency (e.g., school) distractor words. Picture naming latencies were faster in the context of high frequency distractor words compared to low frequency distractor words. The distractor frequency effect can be explained if it is assumed that high frequency words are available for exclusion from production sooner than low frequency words.\nA recent proposal for explaining the semantic interference effect at a postlexical level of processing is the response exclusion hypothesis (Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006; Mahon et al., 2007). The central claim of the response exclusion hypothesis is that the decision process responsible for excluding nontarget words from the single-channel output buffer has semantically interpreted information at its disposal. Such semantically interpreted information would be, for instance, the provenance (word or picture) or the coarse semantic category of a production-ready representation\n(e.g., \u201canimal\u201d). In this framework, the semantic interference effect arises because unrelated distractors can be excluded from production relatively sooner than distractor words corresponding to semantic category coordinates of the target pictures. For example, when naming a picture of a CAR, the semantically related distractor word truck satisfies the semantic criterion of naming a vehicle, whereas the unrelated distractor word table does not satisfy this response-relevant criterion (for discussion of response relevant criteria, see also Hantsch, Jescheniak, & Schriefers, 2005; Kuipers, La Heij, & Costa, 2006; for the first systematic treatment of response relevant factors, see Lupker, 1979; Lupker & Katz, 1981).\nThe response exclusion hypothesis and the hypothesis of lexical selection by competition make different assumptions regarding the locus of the semantic interference effect. According to the hypothesis of lexical selection by competition, the semantic interference effect arises at the level of lexical selection. According to the response exclusion hypothesis, the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing. One way to distinguish between a lexical and a postlexical locus of the semantic interference effect is to test whether semantic interference is observed when participants delay their picture naming responses. In a delayed picture naming task, naming latencies to target pictures will not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection but rather the bottleneck at the single-channel output buffer. We can thus derive the following predictions. If the semantic interference effect arises at the level of lexical selection, then the semantic interference effect will not be observed when participants delay their picture naming responses. However, if the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing, then semantic interference should be observed in a delayed naming task.\nWe tested these predictions in two experiments. Both experiments consisted of an immediate and a delayed naming condition. In the immediate naming condition, pictures and distractor words appeared simultaneously, and participants named the pictures immediately. In the delayed naming condition, the distractors appeared 1,000 ms after the onset of the pictures, and participants produced the target picture names only when the distractor word was presented. Within each naming condition, distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated to the target pictures.\nWe used the presence versus absence of a frequency effect of the target pictures as an independent means for determining whether naming latencies in the immediate and delayed naming conditions reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. If participants have already retrieved the lexical representations corresponding to the target picture names in the delayed naming condition at the time the cue is presented, then there should be no effect of the frequency of the target pictures on naming latencies.\n2 There are several ways in which such a \u201cselection by activation level model\u201d may be implemented. For instance, we may assume that selection occurs according to a temporal threshold, an activation threshold, or a combination of the two. For purposes of the present discussion, it is sufficient to assume that the word that is ultimately produced in a given utterance was at the time of selection the most highly activated lexical node. In other words, either a \u201ctemporal threshold\u201d or an \u201cactivation threshold\u201d account (all else equal) would yield the observed semantic facilitation effects.\nIt is uncontroversial in the field of language production that a manipulation of frequency affects, at least, lexical levels of processing (Alario, Costa, & Caramazza, 2002; Almeida, Knobel, Finkbeiner, & Caramazza, in press; Dell, 1990; Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994; Oldfield & Wingfield, 1965). Previous studies that have used the delayed naming task have shown that the frequency effect disappears with delays longer than 800 ms (Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994; Savage, Bradley, & Forster, 1990; but see Goldinger, Azuma, Abramson, & Jain, 1997). On the basis of these studies we expected a frequency effect of the target pictures in the immediate but not in the delayed naming condition.\nExperiment 1: Immediate Versus Delayed Naming"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

Half the pictures had low frequency names (range 1\u20139 per million), and half had high frequency names (range 72\u2013724 per million). Properties of the pictures and their names in the low and high frequency conditions are presented in Table 1. A related word was selected for each picture, and the unrelated items were created by re-pairing each word with an unrelated picture from the other frequency category. Thus, the same words appeared in the semantically related and unrelated conditions (see Appendix A). In the design there were two crossed experimental variables (i.e., frequency and semantic relatedness) with two levels of each variable. Each cell in the design had 20 items, leading to a total of 80 experimental items. For each experimental item the distractor word was colored blue. For the filler items the color of the distractor words was red. Participants\u2019 task in both immediate and delayed naming conditions alternated unpredictably between picture naming and distractor word reading on the basis of the color of the distractor word, with blue distractors designating picture naming and red distractors designating word reading.\nA total of 160 items were included in each naming condition (immediate and delayed). Twelve additional pictures and words\nwere selected to form 36 practice items. Distractor words were assigned to pictures and were colored appropriately such that 18 picture naming and 18 word reading items were created.\nThe experimental and filler items were pseudorandomized into four blocks of trials. Within a given block there were an equal number of each condition, and each picture appeared once per block, either in the experimental or in the filler condition. Care was taken that (a) on consecutive trials there was no semantic or phonological relationship between pictures\u2019 names or distractor words, and (b) no more than three consecutive trials were from the same condition. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced according to an orthogonal Latin-square design into four lists.\nProcedure. The experiment was controlled by DMDX software (Forster & Forster, 2003). There were three phases in the experiment. In the first phase, participants were familiarized with all of the pictures and their names. In this phase, on each trial, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced with the picture for 2,000 ms. After 1,000 ms, the picture name appeared beneath the picture and cued the participant to pronounce the picture name aloud. The second phase consisted of 36 trials in which the experimental task was practiced. Participants were instructed to name pictures or words depending on the color of the word. If the word was colored blue they were instructed to name the picture; whereas if the word was colored red they were to read the word. The third phase was the experiment proper. The trial structure of the second and third phases was identical.\nParticipants either took part in the delayed or in the immediate naming condition. Participants in the delayed naming condition were instructed to postpone their naming response until the distractor word was presented. On each trial in the delayed naming condition, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced by a picture. After the picture was presented for 1,000 ms, the distractor word appeared. The pictures and distractor words remained on the screen for 500 ms. An empty screen was then displayed for 1,000 ms. Participants in the immediate naming condition were instructed to name the picture or word upon presentation (depending on the color of the word). The trial structure for the immediate naming condition was identical except for the fact that the distractor appeared simultaneously with the presentation of the picture. The picture and distractor remained on the screen for 500 ms. The participant initiated the next trial by pressing the space bar. The duration of the experiment was about 25 min.\nAnalysis. Only the picture naming trials were analyzed. Three types of responses were excluded from the analysis of response times (RTs): (a) naming errors, (b) verbal disfluencies (stuttering, utterance repairs, production of nonverbal sounds), (c) recording failures, and (d) RTs below 300 or above 3,000 ms (immediate naming, 4.7%; delayed naming, 5.3%). RTs exceeding a cutoff value (defined as a participant\u2019s and an item\u2019s mean plus three standard deviations) were replaced by the cutoff value (immediate naming, 2.0%; delayed naming, 4.4%).\nIn the analyses reported here we distinguish between bysubjects (F1) and by-items (F2) analyses. For the F1 analyses we treat frequency and semantic relatedness as within-subjects variables. For the F2 analyses we treat frequency as a between-subjects variable and semantic relatedness as a within-subjects variable. We report separate analyses for the immediate and delayed naming conditions.

By contrast, if the semantic interference effect reflects lexical selection by competition, then no semantic interference effect should be observed under delayed naming conditions. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that semantic interference is observed under delayed naming conditions\u2014that is, in an experimental situation in which a frequency effect of the pictures\u2019 names was not observed.\nConvergent evidence suggesting that semantic interference can arise under delayed naming conditions has been reported by Hum-\nphreys, Lloyd-Jones, and Fias (1995). In that study participants were shown two colored pictures (e.g., CAR in red, TRUCK in green) that were then removed from the screen. Participants were instructed to prepare both picture names for production. After a delay of 2,000 ms, participants were presented with a cue word (e.g., the word red). The cue word designated which prepared response should be produced (i.e., in this case, car). Humphreys et al. found that picture naming latencies were slower when the two pictures that had been presented were items from the same semantic category (e.g., CAR and TRUCK) compared to when the two pictures were items from different semantic categories (e.g., CAR and TABLE).\nOne concern with Humphreys et al.\u2019s (1995) findings is that it cannot be known whether participants in the postcue paradigm actually prepared their naming responses. For instance, it may have been the case that in that paradigm participants delayed lexical processing of the target picture name until presentation of the cue. In contrast, in Experiment 1, we directly assessed whether participants prepared their picture-naming responses by manipulating the frequency of the target pictures.\nIt is important to note that in studies in which the stimuli consist of pictures of common objects, the lexical frequency variable often correlates with subjective familiarity and age of acquisition variables (e.g., Barry, Morrison, & Ellis, 1997; Bonin, Barry, Me\u0301ot, & Chalard, 2006; Caroll & White, 1973; Ellis & Morrison, 1998; Gordon, 1983). In our study (both Experiment 1 above and Experiment 2 below) this correlation is also present. Critical for our purposes, however, is that there is positive empirical evidence indicating that a manipulation of lexical frequency affects lexicallevel processing, even though the manipulation of lexical frequency is correlated with familiarity and/or age of acquisition. Almeida et al. (in press) had participants delay their picture naming responses for 1,000 ms. On 75% of trials, participants were cued to produce the superordinate-level name of pictures, while on 25% of trials, participants were required to produce the basic-level names. Given this imbalance, participants would be expected to prepare superordinate-level names more often than basic-level names. Critically, however, on every trial participants would have retrieved the concept corresponding to the picture. Thus, under such circumstances, producing the basic-level name (on 25% of trials) would reflect only lexical and articulatory processes, not picture recognition processes. The results revealed a frequency effect in producing the basic-level names. A control experiment in which there was no uncertainty regarding the level at which the pictures were to be named ruled out an articulatory level of processing for the observed frequency effect. Almeida et al.\u2019s data thus provide positive evidence for a lexical locus of the frequency effect in picture naming.\nWe can thus confidently interpret the lack of a frequency effect in the delayed naming condition of Experiment 1 as an indication that participants fully retrieved the lexical nodes corresponding to the picture names by the time the cue was presented. An interpretation of the data from Experiment 1 in terms of the response exclusion hypothesis compels an important inference. The fact that semantic interference can arise despite the fact that the lexical representation of the target picture has been retrieved means that the representation corresponding to the distractor (i.e., cue) word effectively displaces the target response from the single-channel output buffer. We assume that this happens in situations in which\nthere is a strong difference between the target and distracting stimuli, in terms of the privileged relationship of those stimuli to the articulators, and when participants cannot produce the naming response until distractor (i.e., cue) presentation.\nThe semantic interference effect in the delayed naming condition in Experiment 1 was marginally significant. Given the importance of this effect for models of lexical selection in speech production, Experiment 2 is an attempt to further establish the robustness of this effect.\nExperiment 2: Replication in French"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Thirty-six native French speakers, students at the Universite\u0301 de Provence, took part in the experiment. Half participated in the immediate naming condition and half in the delayed naming condition. All participants received credit for participation.\nMaterials and design. Twenty-four pictures with high name agreement ( 90%) were chosen from the picture set of Alario and Ferrand (1999). Half of the pictures had a low frequency name, and half had a high frequency name, as estimated by Lexique (New, Pallier, Ferrand, & Matos, 2001). Properties of the pictures and their names in the low and high frequency conditions are presented in Table 3. Each picture was paired with a semantically related distractor word to form the semantically related condition, which was then re-paired with a different picture to form the unrelated condition. Thus, the same pictures and distractors appeared in the related and unrelated conditions. This led to a total of 48 experimental items (see Appendix B) for the immediate and delayed naming conditions. For each experimental item, the distractor was colored black. For the filler items, the color of the distractor was dark blue. In total there were 96 items in the experiment. Twenty-four practice pictures were created as in Experiment 1. Other aspects of the design were identical to those in Experiment 1.\nProcedure. The procedure for the immediate and delayed naming conditions was identical to that in Experiment 1.\nAnalysis. The same exclusion criteria as in Experiment 1 were employed (trials excluded: immediate naming, 9.5%; delayed naming, 6.0%. Trials replaced by cutoff: immediate naming, 0.3%; delayed naming, 1.5%).

The presence of a semantic interference effect in the absence of a target picture frequency effect indicates that the existence of semantic interference does not require that target picture naming latencies be determined by the bottleneck at lexical selection.\nGeneral Discussion\nWe have shown that the semantic interference effect in the picture\u2013word interference paradigm can arise at a postlexical level of processing. The presence of the semantic interference effect in\na delayed naming task cannot be explained in terms of lexical selection by competition. In the introduction, we noted that the semantic interference effect would constitute empirical support for the assumption of lexical selection by competition only if there is reason to believe it is a lexical-level phenomenon. For this reason, the data that we have reported remove the empirical support from the picture\u2013word interference paradigm for the hypothesis of lexical selection by competition. By contrast, the presence of the semantic interference effect in a delayed naming task is a central prediction of the response exclusion hypothesis (Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006; Mahon et al., 2007).\nIt might be argued that the demonstration that semantic interference can arise at a postlexical level of processing is consistent with a two-loci account of the semantic interference effect: one locus at the lexical level (e.g., La Heij, 1988; Levelt et al., 1999; Roelofs, 2003) and one locus at the postlexical level. In other words, the pattern of findings we have reported do not directly disconfirm the interpretation of the semantic interference effect, as observed in immediate picture naming, in terms of lexical selection by competition. Of course, a simpler (i.e., single locus) theory is to be preferred if there were independent grounds for questioning whether lexical selection is a competitive process. As noted in the introduction, a number of studies have demonstrated that higher levels of activation of nontarget lexical nodes result in faster target naming latencies (Costa et al., 2005; Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006; Mahon et al., 2007; Miozzo & Caramazza, 2003). Such findings (for review, see Mahon et al., 2007) provide independent evidence for challenging the assumption that lexical selection is by competition. We thus favor the view that the semantic interference effect in the picture\u2013word interference paradigm arises at a postlexical level of processing. An important topic for future research is whether other observations of semantic interference (e.g., Howard, Nickels, Coltheart, & Cole-Virtue, 2006) fall within the scope of the response exclusion hypothesis.\nReferences\nAlario, F.-X., Costa, A., & Caramazza, A.

Turk-Browne, Phillip J. Isola, Brian J. Scholl, and Teresa A. Treat Yale University\nRecent studies of visual statistical learning (VSL) have demonstrated that statistical regularities in sequences of visual stimuli can be automatically extracted, even without intent or awareness. Despite much work on this topic, however, several fundamental questions remain about the nature of VSL. In particular, previous experiments have not explored the underlying units over which VSL operates. In a sequence of colored shapes, for example, does VSL operate over each feature dimension independently, or over multidimensional objects in which color and shape are bound together? The studies reported here demonstrate that VSL can be both object-based and feature-based, in systematic ways based on how different feature dimensions covary. For example, when each shape covaried perfectly with a particular color, VSL was object-based: Observers expressed robust VSL for colored-shape sub-sequences at test but failed when the test items consisted of monochromatic shapes or color patches. When shape and color pairs were partially decoupled during learning, however, VSL operated over features: Observers expressed robust VSL when the feature dimensions were tested separately. These results suggest that VSL is object-based, but that sensitivity to feature correlations in multidimensional sequences (possibly another form of VSL) may in turn help define what counts as an object.\nKeywords: statistical learning, feature binding, objects, feature dimensions\nVisual perception is remarkable in at least two ways. First, it serves to make us aware of a highly coherent and structured world, despite noisy fragmented input. Second, it provides such experiences without any hint of the underlying computational complexity involved in their construction. In fact, recent work has demonstrated that perception is supported by surprisingly subtle types of visual associative learning. One type of learning\u2014visual statistical learning\u2014may be particularly important in this context, since it can occur automatically and without any intent or even awareness.\nVisual Statistical Learning\nThe study of implicit learning has a long history in psychology (see Stadler & Frensch, 1998), going back to early studies of learning in natural languages (e.g., Harris, 1955), artificial grammars (e.g., Reber, 1967), and manual sequences of responses (e.g., Nissen & Bullemer, 1987). In its modern incarnation, the study of statistical learning began with the demonstration that young infants are able to find \u201cword\u201d boundaries in acoustically unsegmented syllable sequences by using only the differential transitional prob-\nabilities between syllables (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996). The precise relationship between such forms of statistical learning and the implicit learning literature more generally is under active consideration (Perruchet & Pacton, 2006).\nThe auditory statistical learning design was later adapted for use with visual stimuli in studies with adult observers by Fiser and Aslin (2002a; see also Olson & Chun, 2001). Observers viewed an animation in which a single object moved horizontally across the screen, continuously cycling back and forth behind a central occluder and changing its shape each time it passed behind the occluder (see Figure 1a). Observers watched this animation for only a few minutes, with no specific task. The sequence of shapes, though apparently random, actually consisted of temporal \u201ctriplets\u201d in which the same three shapes always appeared in the same order (e.g., A-B-C-G-H-I-D-E-F-A-B-C . . .). Critically, only this statistical regularity demarcated the triplets, since the intershape delay was always the same.\nAfter this passive exposure, observers completed a surprise two-interval-forced-choice familiarity task that pitted triplets (e.g., ABC) against foil sequences of three shapes with a joint probability of zero (e.g., AEI). Observers correctly identified the triplets as more familiar than the foil sequences 95% of the time, indicating robust statistical learning of visual temporal sequences. While the use of deterministic triplets and familiarity judgments may support explicit recognition of the regularities in some cases, visual statistical learning (VSL) can also occur during an orthogonal task (such as repetition detection), without any reported awareness of the statistical structure (Turk-Browne, Junge\u0301, & Scholl, 2005), and can facilitate online performance (Hunt & Aslin, 2001; Olson & Chun, 2001; Turk-Browne et al., 2005; Turk-Browne & Scholl, 2006).\nOther recent work with VSL has demonstrated that such learning operates over spatial as well as temporal regularities (e.g.,\nNicholas B.

Moreover, other recent studies of temporal VSL have begun to elucidate some of the underlying processes that help make VSL possible, involving selective attention (Turk-Browne et al., 2005), association (Turk-Browne & Scholl, 2006), computations of persisting object representations (Fiser, Scholl, & Aslin, 2007), and anticipation (Turk-Browne, Johnson, Chun, & Scholl, 2007).\nThe Units of VSL: Features or Objects?\nDespite this considerable body of work on VSL, several fundamental questions remain about its nature. In particular, previous experiments have not determined the underlying units over which VSL operates. In a sequence of colored shapes, for example, does VSL operate over each feature dimension independently, or over multidimensional objects in which color and shape are intrinsically bound together? Our study modifies two aspects of previous designs, which rendered them unable to answer this question. First, most previous studies used either monochromatic shapes (so that there was no statistical information about color; e.g., Fiser & Aslin, 2002a) or sequences in which each shape had a single unique color (so that the statistics of color were also perfectly correlated with those of shape; e.g., Fiser & Aslin, 2002b; Kirkham et al., 2002). Second, in all but one previous VSL experiment, the surface features present during familiarization were always present during test.1\nExploring the nature of the underlying units of VSL seems important for several reasons: First, the existence of multiple feature dimensions is an inescapable facet of real-world visual experience, and thus these studies may help to reveal how VSL operates in a more ecologically valid situation. Second, exploring the necessity of certain features during familiarization and test may\nhave important implications for how readily learning in one situation will transfer to another (see also Turk-Browne & Scholl, 2006). Finally, and most generally, one of the most critical steps in understanding any cognitive or perceptual process is to determine the underlying currency over which that process operates. In the following experiments, we explore how VSL operates over individual features and bound objects.\nGeneral Method"}, {"heading": "Observers", "text": "Seventy-two na\u0131\u0308ve subjects (16 in Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4a; 8 in Experiment 4b), all with normal or corrected-to-normal acuity and color vision, participated for course credit or monetary compensation."}, {"heading": "Apparatus and Stimuli", "text": "Stimuli were presented with custom software written with the VisionShell graphics libraries (Comtois, 2004) on Apple desktop computers. Observers sat approximately 46 cm from the monitor without head restraint. Displays were constructed from a set of 12 nonsense shapes used previously in studies of VSL (Figure 1b; e.g., Fiser & Aslin, 2001). Each shape appeared in one or more of 13 colors (including black; see Figure 1c), and subtended roughly 3.3\u00b0. Each sequence began with the object located in the center of\n1 The one exception is the study of Turk-Browne et al. (2005), who observed expression of learning at test for monochromatic shapes that had been colored during familiarization. However, the color information during familiarization in this study was used only to manipulate attention, and was not diagnostic; in fact, each shape throughout the study appeared in one of only two colors, and only one color was attended. In addition, one auditory statistical learning study has employed stimuli that varied between familiarization and test: Thiessen and Saffran (2003) changed the prosody of spoken syllables after familiarization and still observed auditory temporal statistical learning in 9-month-old infants.\nthe display, where it immediately began moving to either the left or right at 11.48\u00b0/s. When the center of the object was 12.76\u00b0 from the display border, the object immediately reversed direction and moved toward the same point on the opposite side of the screen. The object then continued back toward the center of the display, at which time the entire movement could be repeated. A stationary gray occluder, subtending 9.51\u00b0 5.68\u00b0, was always present in the center of the display. The object was (at least partially) visible for 1 s between each moment of complete occlusion (see Figure 1a)."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Familiarization phase. Observers watched a 5-minute sequence of 288 colored shapes, presented as described above. Although the sequence of colors varied across experiments, the sequence of shapes was always identically structured. Each shape was assigned to a unique position in one of four triplets\u2014 sequences of three shapes that always appeared in the same order (e.g., ABC, GHI, etc.). Each third of the full shape sequence was generated by randomly interleaving 8 repetitions of each triplet with two constraints (for a total of 24 repetitions/triplet): (a) no triplet could be repeated sequentially (e.g., ABCABC), and (b) no pair of triplets could be immediately repeated (e.g., ABCGHIABCGHI). As a result, the joint probability of a triplet (e.g., ABC) was 0.083, while the joint probability of a sequence of three shapes spanning triplets (e.g., CGH) was 0.027.2\nTest phase. After the familiarization phase, observers completed 32 two-interval forced-choice test trials, judging the relative familiarity of (a) triplets versus (b) foil sequences of three familiar shapes that had never appeared sequentially during familiarization.3 The triplet and foil sequences were presented on each trial in the same disoccluding\u2013occluding manner as during familiarization, separated by a 1-second pause, and were randomly chosen with equal likelihood; the presentation order of the alternatives was randomized. Observers pressed a key if the first sequence seemed more familiar and a different key if the second sequence seemed more familiar.4\nExperiment 1: Testing Bound Objects\nWhile most previous studies have employed monochromatic shapes, this preliminary experiment verified that our method could give rise to VSL even when each shape had its own unique color during both familiarization and test, as a critical baseline for our later experiments."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Each shape was assigned a single unique nonblack color, in which it always appeared throughout the experiment (Figure 2a)."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "In this and all future experiments, our measure of VSL was the percentage of test trials in which the triplet was chosen over the foil (where chance 50%). Observers showed robust statistical learning (80%; Figure 3a) that differed significantly from chance, t(15) 5.730, p .001, d 1.432. This effect serves as a baseline for later experiments.\nExperiment 2: Testing Separated Features\nDid VSL in Experiment 1 operate over bound object representations? If so, then the presence of both features should be necessary for learning to be expressed at test, such that testing either monochromatic shapes or colored circles would break the binding (i.e., the associations between dimensions) and should attenuate the expression of VSL."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The familiarization phase of this experiment was identical to that of Experiment 1. The test phase consisted of two separate blocks: a shape test and a color test (with order counterbalanced across observers). The shape test was identical to the test in Experiment 1, except that all shapes were presented in black (such that only shape information was preserved; see Figure 2b). Conversely, the color test was identical to the test in Experiment 1, except that all colors were presented as circles (such that only color information was preserved; see Figure 2b)."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "As depicted in Figure 3b, observers expressed weak VSL in the shape test (57%), t(15) 2.159, p .047, d 0.540, and these results were significantly weaker than those in Experiment 1, t(30) 3.699, p .001, d 1.308. Observers expressed no significant VSL in the color test (55%), t(15) 1.412, p .178, d 0.353, and these results were again significantly weaker than those in Experiment 1, t(30) 4.033, p .001, d 1.426. There was no difference between the performance for shape and color (t 1). Critically, the familiarization phase in this experiment was identical to that in Experiment 1, suggesting that the weaker results here reflect only the expression of learning rather than the learning itself. These results suggest that performance in Experiment 1 was not driven by learning of sequences of features in either the shape or color dimension alone. Given that both features were necessary for VSL to be expressed, learning must have operated over bound shape\u2013color pairs.\nAn alternative explanation could be that individual observers only ever attended to either shape or color during learning. Thus,\n2 For derivations of these probabilities, see Turk-Browne et al., 2005. 3 The foils (e.g., AEI) contained three shapes that were equally familiar as the shapes in the triplets, but they had never been presented in succession during familiarization. Thus, the two test sequences in each trial could be discriminated only based on statistical learning of the joint probabilities between shapes during familiarization: Observers could respond accurately only by noting relationships between individual shapes, in particular by encoding their nonzero joint probabilities. Note that while this is perhaps the most direct test of statistical learning, other studies have also tested for the learning of even subtler statistics, such as relative joint probability and conditional probability.\n4 Following the test phase, observers were carefully debriefed to assess their explicit awareness of the triplet structure from familiarization. Note that such awareness would not necessarily indicate explicit or strategic learning per se; observers may instead become aware of the structure after implicit processes have run their course. Regardless, only 2 of 72 observers reported becoming fully aware of the triplet structure during familiarization. The majority of subjects fell into one of two groups, either reporting no awareness of any regular sequences or reporting that they noticed one or more pairs of objects that consistently appeared together.\nperformance in Experiment 1 would be high (given that both dimensions were present at test), while average performance across individuals would be low in the feature tests in Experiment 2 (since half of the time observers would have attended to a feature dimension during learning that was not present at test). To explore this possibility, we correlated each observer\u2019s shape performance in Experiment 2 with their color performance in Experiment 2, expecting a negative correlation if observers had attended to only one dimension. In contrast, we obtained a positive correlation (r .616, df 14; p .011), which is consistent only with learning of multidimensional objects.\nExperiment 3: Binding Versus Quantity of Statistical Information\nThe attenuated performance in Experiment 2 relative to Experiment 1 suggests that VSL is object-based, but it remains possible that observers performed better in Experiment 1 because the triplets presented during the test phase itself contained twice as much statistical information (i.e., accumulating over both shape and color dimensions potentially independently), and not because of feature binding between particular shapes and colors. To rule out this explanation, we equated the amount of statistical feature\ninformation at test in this experiment (such that each test triplet contained both a shape and color triplet) but disrupted the feature binding (such that shape triplets were assigned different color triplets than during familiarization). If performance is still attenuated relative to Experiment 1, we can conclude that VSL operated over bound shape\u2013color pairs and that such differences cannot be explained in terms of the brute amount of statistical information present in the input."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The familiarization phase of this experiment was identical to that of Experiment 1. The test phase, however, pitted \u201cre-paired triplets\u201d against \u201cre-paired foils.\u201d Each re-paired triplet consisted of the shape sequence from one familiarization triplet appearing in the color sequence from a different familiarization triplet. In this way, each shape was assigned to a different color at test than during familiarization (see Figure 2c). These reassignments were kept constant throughout the test and were also used to construct the re-paired foils (which contained unstructured sequences of shape and color). In other words, neither feature of the triplets violated the training sequence, whereas both features of the foils did so."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "As depicted in Figure 3c, observers reliably preferred the repaired triplets over the re-paired foils (64%), t(15) 3.168, p .006, d 0.792. Critically, expression of learning was significantly weaker when feature triplets were recombined at test in this experiment versus when presented in the same manner as during familiarization in Experiment 1, t(30) 2.327, p .027, d 0.823. Thus, performance in Experiment 1 cannot solely be attributed to the fact that test triplets contained both shape and color triplets, further supporting the notion that VSL operates over bound shape\u2013color pairs.\nPerformance was not significantly better in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 2: shape test, t(30) 1.253, p .220, d 0.443; color test, t(30) 1.652, p .109, d 0.584. While our conclusions from this experiment are being driven by statistics rather than by numerical differences, note that our primary conclusion would not be altered even if these differences had reached significance. In other words, the purpose of this experiment was to rule out alternative explanations of Experiment 1 based on the presence of more feature information during test, or on increased surface similarity between familiarization and test phases. Our claim in this respect relies on a comparison only between Experiments 1 and 3. Indeed, the comparison of Experiments 2 and 3 would speak to a different question about whether the amount of feature information at test matters at all. This question seems independent; for example, the number of feature dimensions present at test may modulate performance, while presenting features with the same binding as during familiarization may provide an additional benefit.\nExperiment 4a: Feature-Based Learning of Shapes\nThe first three experiments collectively demonstrate that VSL operates over bound objects, but how general is this conclusion? In\nthe real world, color and shape do covary for some objects (e.g., bananas) but not others (e.g., t-shirts). Is VSL sensitive to this type of distinction? The previous experiments employed multidimensional objects during familiarization, implemented in a particular way: Both color and shape varied during familiarization and did so in a correlated fashion. However, would VSL still be object-based even if the two feature dimensions did not perfectly covary?\nHere, we explored this possibility by testing with monochromatic shapes (as in Experiment 2), but we manipulated the covariance of shape and color during familiarization (Figure 2d): Shapes in two of the triplets (matched-color triplets) were assigned unique colors as in the previous experiments, but the shapes in the remaining two triplets (random-color triplets) were assigned different randomly chosen colors on each presentation.\nIf VSL is always object-based, then the results of this experiment should parallel those of Experiment 2: The shift to monochromatic shapes should frustrate the expression of learning. However, if VSL is sensitive to the covariance between feature values for individual objects (at the same time that the triplets themselves are being learned), then we might observe object-based learning for the matched-color triplets (i.e., attenuated performance due to the removal of color at test) but feature-based learning for the random-color triplets (i.e., strong performance despite the removal of color at test). A third possibility is that this type of diagnosticity is assessed for entire feature dimensions rather than individual feature values: The presence of at least some shape\u2013color covariance (i.e., in the matched-color triplets) could yield object-based learning for all triplets, or the presence of deviation from such covariance (i.e., in the random-color triplets) could yield featurebased learning for all triplets."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The familiarization phase of this experiment was identical to that of Experiment 2 except as noted here. The two matched-color triplets were sub-sequences of three shapes that were each paired with a unique color throughout the familiarization phase. The two random-color triplets were sub-sequences of three shapes that were paired with three colors drawn randomly on each presentation (from the remaining six colors), with the constraint that no color could appear twice in a row. In other words, shapes in the random triplets could appear in one of six colors at different points during familiarization. In this way, colors in random triplets were nondiagnostic of shape identity, while colors in the matched condition were perfectly diagnostic of shape identity. At test, all shapes were presented monochromatically."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "As depicted in Figure 3d, observers expressed robust VSL despite the removal of color at test for both the matched-color triplets (74%), t(15) 3.973, p .001, d 0.993; and the random-color triplets (71%), t(15) 3.091, p .007, d 0.773, which did not differ (t 1).\nThree key implications follow from these results. First, the lack of any difference between the matched-color and random-color triplets indicates that the diagnosticities of individual color values do not affect the likelihood that shape triplets can be recognized without color. Second, performance for both the matched-color\nand random-color triplets was significantly greater than chance\u2014 and not reliably different than in the colored-shape test of Experiment 1: matched-color, t 1; random-color, t(30) 1.143, p .262, d 0.404. This suggests that when the covariance between shape and color feature dimensions is disrupted even partially, VSL operates over shapes alone, in a feature-based manner. Third, performance for the (always-color-matched) triplets in Experiment 2 was worse than for the matched-color triplets, t(30) 2.403, p .023, d 0.849; and marginally worse than for the random-color triplets, t(30) 1.800, p .082, d 0.636. This provides further evidence that observers were sensitive to the diagnosticity between shape and color dimensions as a whole, such that color information was discarded\u2014even for the matched triplets\u2014when some colors were nondiagnostic.\nExperiment 4b: Feature-Based Learning of Colors\nWould this switch to feature-based rather than object-based processing in the face of reduced covariance between feature dimensions also extend to other dimensions, or might it be peculiar to shape processing? Here, we addressed this question by repeating the familiarization phase of Experiment 4a, but now testing the two color triplets without their matched shapes (Figure 2d)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The familiarization phase of this experiment was identical to that of Experiment 4a, with six of the colors (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F) uniquely paired with one of the shapes from two of the shape triplets, and six of the colors (e.g., G, H, I, J, K, L) randomly presented on each presentation of shapes from the other two shape triplets. The test phase was similar to the color test of Experiment 2, except that there were only two color triplets from familiarization (e.g., ABC, DEF). However, a test of only these two triplets would be underpowered since the two triplets could only be tested against two foils (resulting in eight trials: 2 triplets 2 foils 2 repetitions). We could not simply use four foils as before because the triplets would then appear twice as often as the foils during test (confounding the familiarity measure): The likelihood of a particular triplet appearing in a test trial would be 50%, while the likelihood of a particular foil appearing would be 25%. To avoid this issue while increasing the number of test trials, we also defined two pseudo-triplets from the six random colors (e.g., HLG, IKJ). The items within the pseudo-triplets were always presented in the same order, similar to the real triplets. The triplets and pseudo-triplets were then used to construct four foil sequences as in the other experiments (e.g., AEL, DLJ, HKA, IBF). Each of the \u201ctriplets\u201d was tested against each of the foils twice, resulting in 16 trials containing a real triplet and 16 trials containing a pseudotriplet. While data from the pseudo-triplet trials were meaningless (since observers had no basis for selecting which pattern was more familiar, as confirmed by chance performance on these trials, t 1), their presence allowed us to equate the frequency of the real triplets with the frequency of all foils during the test phase. Data analysis was then restricted to the test trials containing real triplets."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "As depicted in Figure 3d, observers expressed robust VSL for the two color triplets despite the removal of shape at test (72%), t(7) 2.892, p .023, d 1.023, thus providing further evidence that VSL can operate in a feature-based manner if the covariance between feature dimensions is disrupted. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that performance was significantly greater than in the color test of Experiment 2, t(22) 2.362, p .027, d 0.943. Moreover, this experiment also provides what we believe is the first demonstration of VSL for colors (or indeed for any feature dimension beyond shape). This rules out the possibility that observers simply discarded color information completely in Experiment 4a in order to learn shape sequences. Instead, low covariance between feature dimensions allowed VSL to operate in parallel in each of these dimensions.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe five experiments reported here constitute the first exploration, to our knowledge, of whether VSL operates over bound objects or lower level visual features. Our results suggest one straightforward implication (that VSL can be object-based), and one surprising possibility (that VSL can perhaps help to determine what counts as an object in the first place). We elaborate on each of these conclusions below."}, {"heading": "The Units of VSL", "text": "It is perhaps worth noting that we began these studies with no strong prediction about the results. On one hand, many researchers have stressed that VSL can be an automatic low-level process, which operates early in perceptual analysis to provide the initial segmentation on which other later processes depend. As such, we might predict that VSL would operate on those representations which are most common very early in perceptual processing, namely independent visual features. On the other hand, a wealth of data has indicated that discrete bound objects are the currency of many other types of visual processing, including attention (Scholl, 2001), tracking (Alvarez & Scholl, 2005), masking (Moore & Lleras, 2005), and short-term memory (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004; Luck & Vogel, 1997; Xu & Chun, 2006)\u2014among many others. As such, we might predict that VSL would also be fundamentally object-based, operating over representations in which features are already bound together. This possibility would also be consistent with another recent study in which VSL was more robust for sequences that were bound into the same persisting object representation as a result of spatiotemporal continuity (Fiser et al., 2007).\nHere we operationalized the question of whether VSL is featurebased by asking whether the expression of VSL would survive the elision of some features at test, while the remaining features still possessed the same statistical structure that they had during familiarization. Our initial results demonstrated that VSL can be objectbased: When colors and shapes perfectly covaried (i.e., when each shape had its own unique color) during familiarization, the expression of learning required the presence of both shapes and colors at\ntest (as in Experiment 1). Of course, there were still robust statistical correlations between the shapes themselves during familiarization, but the expression of learning of these shape sequences was considerably weaker when they were presented in isolation at test (with no reliable expression of learning for colors presented in isolation at test) in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 further demonstrated that the difference in performance between these two experiments was a function of feature binding per se, rather than the mere presence of more feature correlations (due to the added dimensions) present during the test phase of Experiment 1.\nThe fact that the observers in Experiment 2 largely failed to recognize feature triplets at test is reminiscent of a result from the category learning literature (e.g., Roberts & MacLeod, 1995) showing that categorization cannot be expressed for constituent elements of a rule\u2014analogous to our individual features\u2014when learning is nonstrategic (like VSL, which has been considered a form of incidental learning; see Turk-Browne et al., 2005). Our results also parallel a feature of associative models of Pavlovian conditioning and causal learning (see Williams & Braker, 1999), in which experience with compound cues\u2014analogous to our multidimensional objects\u2014results in associations involving those compounds, but not their constituent elements (e.g., Pearce, 1987; see also Shanks, Charles, Darby, & Azmi, 1998; Williams, Sagness, & McPhee, 1994).\nCould VSL Define Objects in the First Place?\nThe two final experiments (Experiments 4a and 4b) complicated our initial \u201cobject-based\u201d conclusion in a particularly interesting way, suggesting that VSL may be object-based only when feature binding is useful\u2014that is, when the values across different dimensions reliably covary. When only half of the shape triplets during familiarization had randomly assigned colors, this effectively disrupted the feature binding seen in the previous experiments (despite the fact that other triplets had perfectly covarying shapes and colors), yielding feature-based VSL\u2014that is, a robust expression of learning when each feature dimension was presented in isolation at test. We could, however, instead characterize VSL as always object-based but interpret our results as indicating that multiple feature values are only combined into single object representations when their covariance is high.\nIntuitively, we recognize that some properties are intrinsic to an object, while others are not. We typically think of color as intrinsic: For example, bananas are usually yellow. We do not typically think of luminance as intrinsic to an object, however: A banana may be brighter in the sun and darker in the shade. Why do we treat these two properties differently? On reflection, it seems that the critical difference between these cases is not some special essence of the properties themselves but rather the fact that they are differentially variable with respect to their occurrence in the presence of an object: For example, bananas typically appear in many different lighting situations, but they are usually yellow. We suggest that covariance between surface features in the visual environment serves as an important cue about which object properties are diagnostic (and nondiagnostic). (This point has been made before in the memory literature; see Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996.)\nThis view can readily accommodate our results. When color and shape are highly correlated (i.e., when all bananas are yellow), then the colors become inextricably bound into the representations that result from VSL, such that removing the colors later on disrupts the expression of VSL (as in Experiment 2a). This disruption may be analogous to ways in which we are slower to recognize purple \u201cbananas\u201d or achromatic fire engines (Naor-Raz, Tarr, & Kersten, 2003; Tanaka & Presnell, 1999). This objectbased model could also be applied to the results of Experiments 4a and 4b, where the lack of correlations between features during familiarization may have resulted in separate \u201cobject\u201d representations for shapes and colors. In this framework, VSL is always object-based and operates over the largest available set of highly correlated features. This interpretation can be contrasted with the notion discussed in the previous section that VSL becomes featurebased under conditions of reduced feature correlations. Irrespective of the interpretation, however, the sensitivity to correlations between features within objects demonstrated in our experiments may constitute another type of VSL.\nInterestingly, the monochromatic shape sequences in Experiment 4a were recognized equally well no matter whether they had been familiarized with perfectly correlated colors or with random colors. Moreover, the only difference between the perfectly correlated shape\u2013 color pairs in Experiments 4a and 4b (from matched-color triplets) versus Experiment 2 is that they occurred in the context of other shapes paired with random colors. This demonstrates that observers were sensitive to the correlations between feature dimensions (or possibly the average correlation over all shapes), rather than maintaining separate statistical representations of correlations for individual objects. This effect may be atypical in the broader context of real-world objects, though, where color diagnosticity differs from object to object (e.g., consider a fire engine vs. a lamp; Tanaka & Presnell, 1999) and may be moderated by the degree to which feature dimensions are processed in a separable or integral manner (e.g., Nosofsky & Palmeri, 1996; see also Garner, 1974). Also, children seem to be reluctant at some ages to categorize objects by color (despite intact color perception), but they will do so robustly for some items that have reliable colors, such as foods (Macario, 1991).\nSensitivity to feature correlations may in fact hold more generally, explaining why other types of statistical regularities are or are not learned. A study of spatial VSL, for example, demonstrated that small spatial groups of larger spatial arrays were learned only when the smaller groups could vary in their spatial relationships to each other (Fiser & Aslin, 2005). When the small \u201cparts\u201d were always arranged into the same global patterns, in contrast, observers were not later sensitive to the intra-part statistical structures when they were tested by themselves. In other words, testing the local parts later in isolation (from the other local parts with which they had been previously associated) was equivalent to testing the shapes in our experiments in isolation from the colors with which they had been previously associated. Thus, statistical structure may serve to define objects in terms of both spatial scale (as argued by Fiser & Aslin, 2005) and surface features (as suggested here). Fiser and Aslin (2005) argued that their results reflect a constraint on \u201cembeddedness\u201d in hierarchical structures, which essentially serve to bind objects into global scenes. Our results, in a complementary fashion, indicate that statistical\ncovariance can also serve to determine which surface features are bound into objects themselves.5\nIn fact, the idea that associative variability may serve to define the underlying units of processing has a long history, going back to William James: \u201cWhat is associated now with one thing and now with another, tends to become dissociated from either, and grow into an object of abstract contemplation by the mind\u201d (James, 1890, p. 506). This concept has also been important in the longterm memory literature. According to the encoding variability hypothesis (Martin, 1968), for example, the more often a stimulus is encountered within a particular context, the more deeply entrenched task-relevant attributes of the stimulus become. Relative to an item that has been encountered an equal number of times in multiple contexts, memory for the fixed-context item will be impaired in a novel context (both because it is associated with fewer retrieval cues and because the associations to these retrieval cues are stronger). In Experiment 2, triplets of black (novel color context) shapes may have been unrecognizable because of the fixed color context in which they were encountered during familiarization. Conversely, in Experiment 4a where some shapes were encountered in multiple color contexts, recognition of black shape triplets was spared. Where this account differs from the sensitivity to covariance demonstrated here is in terms of automaticity: Conventional demonstrations of encoding variability have defined context as the task in which subjects were engaged (e.g., categorization vs. recognition; Wagner, Maril, & Schacter, 2000), while context in the current study was based on surface features themselves."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "We began this project in an attempt to determine the impact of features vs. objects on VSL, and in the process we discovered that in some cases VSL can be object-based. In the end, however, our results and their connections to other studies suggest that statistical learning may also serve to construct objects out of some features but not others. In this sense, statistical learning may reflect not a unitary process but rather a hierarchy of interacting processes, some of which help to determine the input to others. Thus, whereas VSL has often been studied in an isolated way, it may actually be an integral component of many other more familiar types of visual processing.\n5 In both the present experiments and the studies of Fiser and Aslin (2005), smaller features (shapes or parts) may be learned despite the presence of other statistical structure (in colors or more global hierarchies) when there is high variability. However, we have previously shown that statistical regularities in shape sequences are learned when there is especially low color variability (such that many different shapes can appear in the same color; Turk-Browne et al., 2005). Onnis and Christiansen and their colleagues demonstrated a similar effect in a very different context: Nonadjacent dependencies between syllables can be learned when the intervening syllable(s) have extremely high or low variance, but not middling variance (Onnis, Christiansen, Chater, & Go\u0301mez, 2003; Onnis, Monaghan, Christiansen, & Chater, 2004).\nReferences\nAlvarez, G.

White Cardiff University\nWhen people make causal judgments from contingency information, a principal aim is to account for occurrences of the outcome. When 2 causes are under consideration, the capacity of either to account for occurrences is judged from how likely the cause is to be present when the outcome occurs and from the rate at which the outcome occurs when that cause alone is present, which gives an estimate of the strength of the cause. These propositions are formalized in a weighted averaging model, which successfully predicted several judgmental phenomena not predicted by other models of causal judgment. These include a tendency for judgment of one cause (A) to be reduced as the number of occurrences of when only the other one (B) increases and a tendency for A to receive higher judgments than B if A is better able to account for occurrences than B is even if B has a higher contingency with the outcome than A does. Overshadowing, a tendency for judgments of B to be depressed if A has a higher contingency, is weak or absent when B is better able to account for occurrences than A. Results of several experiments support these and related predictions derived from the accounting for occurrences hypothesis.\nKeywords: causal judgment, contingency information, overshadowing\nSuppose you are a doctor, faced with an array of patients some of whom have and some of whom do not have a particular symptom\u2014let us say blue spots on their skin. You are considering the possibility that the symptom could be caused by a virus called XZ virus. You test each of the patients to see whether XZ virus is present in their blood or not. As a result of these tests, you end up with four frequencies: patients who have both XZ virus in their blood and blue spots, patients who have XZ virus but do not have blue spots, patients who have blue spots but do not have XZ virus, and patients who have neither. It is then possible to use this information to make a judgment about whether XZ causes blue spots or not. For example, if 10 patients fell into each of the four categories, it would seem unlikely that XZ virus had anything to do with the blue spots. If all the patients who had blue spots also had XZ virus in their blood, and all those who did not have blue spots did not have XZ virus in their blood, then XZ virus would seem a likely candidate as the cause.\nInformation of this kind is called contingency information. The degree of contingency between a candidate cause and an effect, that is, the degree to which the occurrence of the effect is associated with the presence and absence of the candidate cause, can be measured with the P rule (Jenkins & Ward, 1965; McKenzie, 1994; Ward & Jenkins, 1965). P is the probability of the effect occurring when the cause is present minus the probability of the effect occurring when the cause is absent. Values of P vary from\n1 (maximum negative contingency) to 1 (maximum positive contingency), with a value of zero indicating no contingency. This is an objective measure of contingency (McKenzie, 1994), but it is not a valid measure of causality. For example, a candidate cause may be associated with an effect not because the cause brings about the effect but because both of them are produced by some third factor. Infection with XZ virus and blue spots might be empirically associated because both are caused by exposure to a contaminated water supply.\nSuppose now that you are considering two possible causes. For purposes of terminological conventions, call them Causes A and B. Now there are not four kinds of contingency information but eight: occurrences and nonoccurrences of the effect when both causes are present (hereafter AB and AB , respectively), when only Cause A is present (A and A ), when only B is present (B and B ), and when both are absent (0 and 0 ). There are also four kinds of occurrence rates: AB occurrence rate (the proportion of instances in which the outcome occurs when both A and B are present, A occurrence rate (occurrence rate when A alone is present), B occurrence rate, and absent occurrence rate (occurrence rate when both causes are absent). How do people make causal judgments about two causes, given these kinds of information?\nOne possibility is that causal judgment is derived from the objective contingency between the cause and the outcome. There are two ways of computing the objective contingency when two causes are being considered. The contingency for one cause can be computed across all the available information, without considering whether the other cause is present or absent. This is the unconditional contingency, or Pu. Or the contingency for one cause can be computed while holding the presence or absence of the other cause constant. Thus, one can compute the contingency for Cause A conditional on Cause B being present, hereafter PcA(B), or the contingency for A conditional on B being absent, PcA( B). These are conditional contingencies. I would like to express my gratitude to Marc Buehner and Mark Johansen for their thorough and helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article. Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Peter A. White, School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Tower Building, Park Place, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom, CF10 3AT.

Spellman (1996a) ran an experiment in which conditional contingencies were manipulated while the unconditional contingency was held constant and found that causal judgments varied in accordance with conditional contingency. In a second experiment, unconditional contingency was manipulated while conditional contingency was held constant, and there were no significant differences in causal judgment between conditions. The hypothesis that causal judgments are made in accordance with conditional contingencies has been used to predict and interpret a number of phenomena (Spellman, 1996a, 1996b; Spellman, Price, & Logan, 2001; Goedert & Spellman, 2005), including overshadowing, a tendency for judgments of one cause to decrease as the association between the other cause and the outcome increases (Baker, Mercier, Valle\u0301e-Tourangeau, Frank, & Pan, 1993; Baker, Valle\u0301e-Tourangeau, & Murphy, 2000; Price & Yates, 1993).\nExplanatory accounts in which the computation of contingency plays a part, such as the conditional contingency hypothesis and the power PC theory (Cheng, 1997; Novick & Cheng, 2004; Spellman, 1996a), implicitly focus on the cause and ask what the overall pattern in the evidence implies for the status and power of the cause being judged. Information about nonoccurrences of the outcome contributes as much to this as information about occurrences of the outcome does. In the account proposed here, causal judgment focuses more on the outcome and assesses how well occurrences of the outcome can be accounted for by the cause being judged. This account amounts to a claim about psychological processes and their outputs. It is not claimed that it is a normative or objectively correct means of identifying causes; on the contrary, it generates predictions, such as effects of the mere prevalence of causes (White, 2004), that are unlikely to form any part of a normative account of causal inference. It is consistent with a view of humans as fallible but pragmatic causal judges.\nIn the absence of expectations, nonoccurrences of outcomes do not require causal explanation. If someone eats a meal and does not suffer an allergic reaction, no cause will be sought for the lack of reaction (unless a reaction was expected). Occurrences of outcomes, however, do drive causal judgment processes. If someone does have an allergic reaction after a meal, and there was no expectation either way, then it is likely that a search for a cause will ensue. I propose, therefore, that the main aim of causal judgment is accounting for occurrences and that the judgments made about each cause will depend on how well they are deemed to account for occurrences of the outcome.\nTwo kinds of information influence judgment of the extent to which a cause accounts for occurrences. One is the extent to which the cause is present when the outcome occurs. I shall call this occurrence judgment. Cause A cannot account for an occurrence of the outcome when Cause A is absent, so its judged capacity to account for occurrences is diminished by such instances. Thus, for Cause A, A instances tend to increase A\u2019s judged capacity to produce the outcome, but B and 0 instances tend to reduce it, because A cannot account for an outcome that occurs when it is absent.\nThe other kind of information is evidence concerning the strength of the cause as a generator of the outcome in question. To assess strength, people will give most weight to the most unambiguous information, which is information about what happens\nwhen the cause being judged is present and no other cause is explicitly identified as being present, that is, A and A instances for Cause A and B and B for Cause B. The occurrence rate is an empirical guide to the strength of the cause being judged. The higher the occurrence rate, the stronger the cause is estimated to be.\nSo far, then, A and A are used for strength estimation, and A , B , and 0 are used for occurrence judgment. However, AB and AB instances would appear to be relevant as well. AB is occurrence information and therefore apparently relevant to occurrence judgment. AB and AB are both information about instances where Cause A is present and therefore relevant in principle to strength estimation. The problem is that these kinds of information are relatively ambiguous. For AB , it is not clear which of the two causes produced the outcome. But the outcome did occur, so there is a need to account for it. In the absence of disambiguating information, the simplest rule would be that each cause is attributed about half of the causal responsibility for producing the outcome. In effect, AB counts in the attempt to account for occurrences but with no more than half the weight of A information (for Cause A). By the same token, AB counts in the attempt to estimate the strengths of the causes but with no more than half the weight of A (for Cause A).\nEvidence for this can be found in studies of cue interaction effects such as blocking (Chapman & Robbins, 1990; De Houwer & Beckers, 2002a; Dickinson, Shanks, & Evenden, 1984; Wasserman, Kao, Van Hamme, Katagiri, & Young, 1996) and superlearning (Aitken, Larkin, & Dickinson, 2000). These studies commonly present AB instances as a standard against which to assess the effects of a manipulation of other cues. In blocking, for example, C and CD instances are also presented. Judgments of Cues A and B are then compared with judgments of Cue D. It is usually found that Cues A and B receive equal and moderate causal ratings. For example, in Aitken et al. (2000, Experiment 1), Cues A and B received mean causal ratings of 4.0 and 4.8 (the scale extreme being 12). This can be compared to a mean of 10.3 for a different cue that was only ever presented on its own and with the outcome always occurring. This result supports the claim that AB instances result in equal causal responsibility being attributed to each cue and that AB instances carry no more than half the weight of A (or B ) instances.\nThe accounting for occurrences hypothesis assigns specific functions to different kinds of contingency information, functions that support an activity of causal inference. However the foregoing discussion of those functions has some implications for the relative weights that the different kinds of information carry in the inferential activity. For this reason, it is possible to represent accounting for occurrences in terms of a weighted averaging model. A brief summary of the implications for cell weights follows.\nA instances carry the most weight because they are involved in both strength estimation and occurrence judgment and are less ambiguous than AB instances. Each kind of occurrence information carries more weight than the corresponding kind of nonoccurrence information (e.g., A vs. A ) because nonoccurrence information is not involved in occurrence judgment. AB carries less weight than A (and B for Cause B), and AB carries less weight than A , because of the ambiguity due to the fact that both causes are present. B and 0 are not involved in either strength estimation or in occurrence judgment, so they carry negligible weight. It is also likely that B carries more weight than 0 does,\nbecause it is more relevant to the assessment of Candidates A and B as competing accounts of the outcome. A weighted averaging model that represents these propositions about weights is shown in Equation 1:\nJ A\n.15nAB .075nAB .4nA .15nA .15nB .075n0\n.15nAB .075nAB .4nA .15nA .15nB .075n0\n(1)\nJ(A) stands for judgment of Cause A and n stands for the number of instances of a given kind. For judgment of Cause B, substitute B for A , B for A , and A for B . Weights are normalized to sum to 1, and the equation generates values in the range 1 (prevent) to 1 (cause). AB and A have positive valence, and the other four kinds of information in the model have negative valence. B and 0 are not represented because under the accounting for occurrences hypothesis, they carry negligible weight. In a model of this kind, each kind of information makes its own contribution to the weighted average. Under this model, causal judgments are not derived from assessments of contingency but from assessments of the extent to which the cause accounts for occurrences, which is inferred from its estimated strength and the occurrence judgment. Any weights that do not violate the foregoing propositions may be used. For example, the weights are not meant to imply that AB and B must carry the same weight; there is just nothing in the propositions advanced here to indicate that one kind should carry more weight than the other.\nThe aim of the experiments reported here was to test predictions that distinguish the accounting for occurrences hypothesis from the conditional contingency hypothesis. The predictions are briefly described here and are worked out in more detail in the account of each experiment.\n1. According to the principle of accounting for occurrences, occurrences of the outcome in A instances can be accounted for by A because A is present, but they cannot be accounted for by B because B is absent. Therefore, A instances should tend to raise judgment of A and lower judgment of B.\nWhite (2004) found support for this implication in several experiments. In these experiments the prevalence of one cause was manipulated while holding both the conditional contingency for that cause and the prevalence of the other cause constant. Increasing the prevalence of Cause A resulted in higher judgments of Cause A and lower judgments of Cause B, a phenomenon labeled the cause prevalence effect by White (2004). Under the present account, the cause prevalence effect occurs because increasing the prevalence of Cause A entails increasing the number of A instances. This increases judgment of A\u2019s capacity to account for occurrences and reduces judgment of B\u2019s capacity to do so, because B cannot account for outcomes that occur when it is absent. In a further series of studies by White (2005), when Cause B had a positive association with the effect, manipulations of the number of A instances had a significant effect on judgments of Cause B. Manipulations of the number A instances, however, had no significant effect on judgments of Cause B. These findings support the accounting for occurrences hypothesis because A instances alter B\u2019s judged capacity to account for occurrences, but A instances do not; nor are A instances involved in assessing B\u2019s strength, which is judged only from instances where B is present. This prediction is further tested here in Experiments 1, 2, and 3.\n2. Under some circumstances, if the evidence indicates that Cause A accounts for more occurrences of the effect than Cause B does, Cause A should receive higher causal judgments than Cause B even though B may have a higher conditional contingency than A does. Such a difference is never predicted by the conditional contingency hypothesis, because ordinal differences in causal judgment should always conform to ordinal differences in conditional contingency between the candidates. This is tested in Experiments 1, 2, and 3.\n3. When there are no nonoccurrences of the outcome in the presence of just one cause, manipulating the number of occurrences of the outcome in the presence of that cause alone does not alter the conditional contingency. Under the conditional contingency hypothesis, therefore, such manipulations should not have a significant effect on causal judgment. Such manipulations do, however, tend to affect judgment of the extent to which the cause can account for occurrences and to alter the weighted average computed by Equation 1. So the accounting for occurrences hypothesis predicts significant effects of such manipulations. This is tested in Experiments 2 and 3.\n4. Instances of 0 should have no significant effect on judgment of either cause, because they do not contribute to either accounting for occurrences or assessing causal strength. Instances of 0 cannot be accounted for by either cause, so some reduction in judgment of both causes as the number of 0 instances increases is predicted. By contrast, if people make causal judgments by computing the contingency for one cause conditional on the absence of the other cause or by computing Pu for each cause, both 0 and 0 instances should have a significant influence on causal judgment, because they both contribute to both kinds of contingency. If causal judgments are made by computing the contingency for one cause conditional on the presence of the other cause, then neither 0 nor 0 should have a significant effect on causal judgment. This is tested in Experiment 4.\n5. Under the present hypothesis, overshadowing is also an outcome of the attempt to account for occurrences. If this is the case, then overshadowing should be weakened or nonexistent when the number of occurrences of the outcome in the presence of the cause with the higher contingency is lower than the number of occurrences of the outcome in the presence of the cause with the lower contingency. This can be the case when the latter has greater prevalence than the former. This is tested in Experiment 5.\nExperiment 1\nThis experiment tests Predictions 1 and 2. The design involved orthogonal manipulations of the prevalence of each cause. Table 1 shows that the conditional contingency for each cause did not vary across the four conditions and that the conditional contingency for Cause A was always higher than that for Cause B. Values generated by Equation 1 for each cause in each condition are also shown in Table 1. The predicted values are higher for A and lower for B when the prevalence of A is high than when it is low. The predicted values are higher for B and lower for A when the prevalence of B is high than when it is low. This is the cause prevalence effect, Prediction 1. In the A low, B high condition, but not in any of the others, the predicted value for B is higher than that for A. The model therefore predicts that judgments of B\nshould be higher than judgments of A in this condition alone. This is the test of Prediction 2."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Forty-one first-year undergraduate students of psychology participated in return for course credit.\nStimulus materials. The materials were composed of a questionnaire with an initial written set of instructions followed by four judgmental tasks (shown in Table 1).\nThe instructions told participants to imagine that they were a horticulturalist studying a garden plant called hosta. Normally this plant had plain green leaves, but sometimes the leaves had an attractive gold edge much prized by gardeners. Their task was to find out what determines whether plants have gold edges on their leaves or not. The suspicion is that chemicals found in the soil might influence this, either causing or preventing gold edges. To test this, they set up a number of pots each containing one hosta, and they control whether the chemicals they are testing are present or absent in the pots. They investigate two chemicals at a time. Once the pots are set up, they wait to see if each plant\u2019s leaves have gold edges or not.\nOn each page following, the participant would see the results of a series of trials involving a different kind of hosta and two chemicals, different ones on each page. At the top of the page the kind of hosta and the chemicals would be identified by code letters. Under this would be four columns of information. The first column identified individual plants by number. The second column identified one of the chemicals and told the participant whether that chemical was present or absent in the soil for each plant. The third column identified the other chemical and told the participant whether that chemical was present or absent in the soil for each plant. The fourth column indicated whether each plant developed gold edges on its leaves or not. Thus, by reading across a row, participants would see for each numbered plant whether the first chemical was present or absent, whether the second chemical was present or absent, and whether the plant developed gold edges on its leaves or not.\nThe instructions then told the participants that, at the bottom of each page, they would see the following two questions:\nTo what extent does [the first chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?\nTo what extent does [the second chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?\nTo make their judgment, they were to write a number from 100 to 100 beside each question. Writing 100 meant that the chemical in question very strongly prevents gold edges on the leaves. Writing zero meant that the chemical in question has no effect either way. Writing 100 meant that the chemical in question very strongly causes gold edges on the leaves. The more strongly they thought the chemical in question prevented gold edges on the leaves, the lower the number they should put. The more strongly they thought the chemical in question caused gold edges on the leaves, the higher the number they should put.\nEach page of the questionnaire presented a separate judgmental task (hereafter task) conforming to this format but with different identifiers for hosta species and chemicals. There were four tasks in all. The first chemical, that is, the one information about which was in the second column, is here designated Cause A, and the second chemical, information about which was in the third column, is Cause B.\nDesign. Two variables were manipulated within subjects. The prevalence of Cause B (B prevalence) was manipulated with two values, low and high. As shown in Table 1, in the low condition there were 3 B instances and 1 B instance. In the high condition there were 12 B and 4 B instances. The other independent variable was the prevalence of Cause A (A prevalence), which was also manipulated with two values, low and high. As shown in Table 1, in the low condition there were 4 A instances and 1 A instance, and in the high condition there were 12 A and 3 A instances. Table 1 shows that both kinds of conditional contingency are constant across conditions for both causes and that the conditional contingency for Cause A is in all conditions higher than the corresponding kind of conditional contingency for B.\nThe nature of these manipulations entailed that the total number of instances per judgmental task varied from 17 to 39.

Mean causal judgments are shown in Table 1.\nAnalysis of judgments of Cause A revealed that judgments of A were lower both when the prevalence of A was lower and when the prevalence of B was higher. These are the two components of the cause prevalence effect, so these results support Prediction 1. There was a significant effect of A prevalence, F(1, 40) 4.61, MSE 962.54, p .05, with a higher mean at high prevalence (49.84) than at low prevalence (39.44). There was a significant effect of B prevalence, F(1, 40) 14.09, MSE 1,032.80, p .001, with a higher mean at low prevalence (54.06) than at high prevalence (35.22). The interaction was not statistically significant.\nAnalysis of judgments of Cause B also yielded evidence for both components of the cause prevalence effect, supporting Prediction 1. Judgments of B were lower when prevalence of B was lower and when prevalence of A was higher. There was a significant effect of A prevalence, F(1, 40) 16.45, MSE 770.77, p .001, with a higher mean at low prevalence (42.82) than at high prevalence (25.23). There was a significant effect of B prevalence, F(1, 40) 18.09, MSE 658.75, p .001, with a higher mean at high prevalence (42.55) than at low prevalence (25.50). The interaction was not significant.\nThe analyses that test Prediction 2 involve comparisons between judgments of causes A and B within each of the four tasks. It was predicted that judgments of Cause B would be higher than judgments of Cause A in the A low, B high task. The means in Table 1 show a difference in the predicted direction, and this was found to be significant, F(1, 40) 8.11, MSE 1,415.56, p .01. In the other three tasks, as predicted, judgments of Cause A appeared to be higher than those of Cause B. The difference was significant in the two tasks where the prevalence of B was low: when both causes had low prevalence, F(1, 40) 17.65, MSE 331.89, p .001, and when B had low prevalence and A had high prevalence, F(1, 40) 28.11, MSE 1,179.59, p .001. When both causes had high prevalence the trend was not significant, F(1, 40) 3.54, MSE 468.90, p .07.\nSignificant cause prevalence effects were therefore found in judgments of both causes. This is predicted by the accounting for occurrences hypothesis, modeled in Equation 1, but not by the conditional contingency hypothesis. The mean judgment of Cause B was significantly higher than that of Cause A in one of the four conditions. This result was predicted by Equation 1. It is, however, contrary to the conditional contingency hypothesis because the conditional contingency for A was always higher than that for B. The correlation between values predicted by Equation 1 and ob-\nserved means across the four conditions was .99 for Cause A and .99 for Cause B."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "One potential problem with the results of Experiment 1 is that judgments of Cause B were only higher than those of Cause A when B had high prevalence and A had low prevalence. Because the manipulation of prevalence was within subjects, some participants might notice the difference in prevalence between tasks. They might then give higher judgments to Cause B not because of the comparison with the number of A instances but because of the comparison with the number of B instances in other tasks. Thus, B might receive higher judgments when there were 12 B instances because of a comparison with other tasks in which there were 4 B instances, and this comparison might be enough to push judgment of B above judgment of A, when the prevalence of A is low. To address this problem, I designed Experiment 2 with a condition in which prevalence was low for both causes, and the conditional contingency was higher for Cause A than for Cause B, but there were still more B than A instances. If participants judge by comparing B instances across conditions, judgments of B should be lower than judgments of A in this task because the prevalence of B is low. But if participants judge by comparing B with A instances, then judgments of B should be higher than judgments of A, as the accounting for occurrences hypothesis predicts.\nThe aim of Experiment 2, therefore, was to run a further test of Prediction 2, but with different contingency information.

This therefore rules out the hypothesis that participants were giving high judgments to Cause B by comparing B instances across the four conditions as an explanation for the results of Experiment 1. Further evidence of the cause prevalence effect was also found, together with an effect on judgments of Cause A of manipulating the number of A instances.

Even when PcA( B) 1 and PcB( A) .67, causal ratings were higher for B than for A when there were two A instances. In this experiment there was no task in which ratings of A were significantly higher than those of B, even though the conditional contingency for A was always 1 and that for B was always less than 1. The correlation between values predicted by Equation 1 and observed means across the four conditions was .93 for Cause A and .89 for Cause B.\nIt could be argued that the lower prevalence of Cause A means that there is less opportunity to learn about the relation between A and the outcome. Ratings of A might therefore be relatively low because the causal judgment of A is at an early stage of acquisition and should not be regarded as asymptotic. This argument could hold when there were just two A instances. However even when there were six A instances, B was still rated significantly higher than A when there were two B instances. If people assess contingency for A only from instances where B is absent, in this task there were 10 relevant instances: six A and four 0 instances. This should be enough for a judgment that is close to asymptote. Studies of the acquisition of causal judgment have tended to show that much of the learning about a cause takes place in the first few trials and that the rate of acquisition of causal judgment tends to taper off after that (Shanks, 1985, 1987; Shanks, Lopez, Darby, & Dickinson, 1996; Wasserman et al., 1996; White, 2000). Previous experiments that have compared different total numbers of instances for otherwise identical contingencies have not found significant effects (Anderson & Sheu, 1995; Lober & Shanks, 2000; Mandel & Lehman, 1998; White, 2003b). The only exceptions involved a small number of trials on one side of the comparison, eight in Mercier and Parr (1996) and six in Anderson and Sheu (1995). These findings indicate that it is unlikely that the differences found in the present experiments could be attributed to insufficient opportunity to learn about the contingency for Cause A, at least when there were six A instances.\nIf a participant judged in accordance with either PcA( B) or PuA, their judgments of Cause A would be at or close to the scale extreme of 100 in all six tasks. This was found for 4 participants, 2 of whom each gave six judgments of 100, and the other 2 of whom each gave five judgments of 100 and one of 90. Only three other ratings of 100 were recorded in the entire sample. These 4 participants constitute 11% of the sample. This is similar to the figure of 10% judging in accordance with P reported by Kao and\nWasserman (1993). It is not possible to say that the present 4 participants were judging in accordance with either conditional or unconditional contingency because judging just from the occurrence rate when A alone was present would yield the same result. It is noteworthy, however, that removing these 4 participants from the data results in mean causal judgments of Cause A that were less than zero in two tasks. When A 2 and B 2, the mean judgment was 2.39, and when A 2 and B 4, the mean judgment was 4.27. This refutes any claim that judgments of A are in an early stage of acquisition in those tasks, because two A instances and no A instances would never result in a negative judgment (see, e.g., Shanks, 1987). All forms of contingency, conditional and unconditional, yield positive values for Cause A in these cases. The only plausible explanation is that judgments of Cause A were depressed by the comparison with the number of B instances.\nExperiment 4\nExperiment 4 was designed to test Prediction 4: Although there could be an effect of 0 instances, there should be no significant effect of 0 instances on judgments of either cause.

The latter value is lower than those obtained in the previous experiments. This may be explained by the fact that the range of predicted values for Cause B is both low and small, ranging only from .02 to .24. This would be likely to magnify effects of error variance that would tend to reduce the correlation."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "As predicted, there was no significant effect of the 0 manipulation. The effect of the 0 manipulation was significant for Cause A but not for Cause B. The latter result could itself be a consequence of the need to account for occurrences. The predictions for B shown in Table 4 tend to be close to zero, especially when there are eight 0 instances. But giving a judgment of zero to Cause B is problematic because it implies that B is not a cause. Despite this, B is the only explicit candidate that can account for the four B instances in each condition. The need to account for those occurrences means that there will be resistance to judgments of the cause being pushed below zero. In effect, the closer to zero judgment of the cause gets, the less weight the disconfirmatory\ninformation carries. This tendency could have occurred in Experiment 1 as well. In the A high, B low condition the predicted value for B was .04, but the mean causal judgment was 16.15 (see Table 1). In this case, assigning a negative judgment to B leaves three B instances unaccounted for. Making a judgment of B that is greater than zero leaves it with some capacity to account for these occurrences. Thus, disconfirmatory information such as 0 may be partially discounted when there is a need for positive judgment to account for occurrences of the outcome when only the cause being judged is present.\nThese results count against the possibility that causal judgments might be based on conditional contingencies. If causal judgments were based on the contingency conditional on the absence of the other cause, then both 0 and 0 should have had an influence on causal judgment. The finding (in judgments of Cause A) that 0 had a significant effect but 0 did not disconfirms this expectation. Instances of 0 contribute to a conditional probability that can be computed only by taking 0 instances into account as well. If there is no significant effect of 0 , then that conditional probability is not being computed, and the influence of 0 on causal judgment is of some other kind. If causal judgments were based on the contingency conditional on the presence of the other cause, then there should have been no significant effect of either 0 or 0 . Obtaining a significant result for one manipulation and not for the other is difficult to reconcile with the conditional contingency hypothesis.\nExperiment 5\nThis experiment was designed to test Prediction 5. Overshadowing should be weak or absent when the number of occurrences of the outcome in the presence of the cause with the higher contingency is lower than the number of occurrences of the outcome in the presence of the cause with the lower contingency."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Thirty-nine first-year undergraduate students of psychology participated in return for course credit. None had taken part in any of the previous experiments. The materials were similar to those of Experiment 1 except for the design. PcA( B) was manipulated by altering frequencies of A and A instances. In one condition there were 10 A and 2 A instances, and in the other there were 2 A and 10 A instances. As shown in Table 5, given that the absent occurrence rate was zero, this yields conditional contingencies of .83 and .17, respectively. PcB( A) was held constant at .5, intermediate between the two contingencies for Cause A. This is an overshadowing manipulation, and the usual prediction would be that judgments of Cause B should be depressed in the condition where Cause A has the higher contingency (Price & Yates, 1993). The prevalence of Cause B was manipulated, such\nthat in one condition there were 6 B and 6 B instances, and in another condition there were 12 of each. The latter number is greater than the number of A instances in the high contingency condition for A (10). Because of this, B is still better able to account for occurrences of the outcome than A is, even though the conditional contingency for B is lower than that for A.\nThis is shown in the model predictions in Table 5. When the prevalence of Cause B is low, the model predicts an overshadowing effect with values of .43 when PcA( B) is low and .11 when PcA( B) is high.

This amounts to a manipulation check, showing that participants were sensitive to the manipulation of information about Cause A, as predicted by both the conditional contingency hypothesis and by the accounting for occurrences hypothesis (see Table 5).\nThe analysis of judgments of Cause B yielded a significant effect of A contingency, F(1, 38) 6.80, MSE 624.27, p .05, with a higher mean at low contingency (55.14) than at high contingency (44.71). This is in the direction of an overshadowing effect. It was qualified by a significant interaction with B prevalence, F(1, 38) 8.12, MSE 339.60, p .01. Simple effects analysis revealed a significant effect of A contingency at low B prevalence, F(1, 38) 13.56, MSE 510.70, p .01, but no significant effect of A contingency at high B prevalence, F(1, 38) 0.18, MSE 453.17. The means involved in these comparisons are in Table 5. These results show, as predicted, an overshadowing effect when the prevalence of B was low but not when the prevalence of B was high.\nThere was no significant effect of B prevalence on judgments of Cause B at high A contingency, F(1, 38) 0.70, MSE 322.89. However there was an unexpected reversal of the usual cause prevalence effect at low A contingency, F(1, 38) 12.01, MSE 291.97, p .01. The means involved in these comparisons are also those reported in Table 5. The main effect of B prevalence was not significant, F(1, 38) 3.54, MSE 275.25, p .07."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "As predicted, no significant overshadowing effect was found when B had high prevalence.

B is therefore better able to account for occurrences of the outcome than A is, and, according to the accounting for occurrences hypothesis, this weakens or eliminates effects of changes in A\u2019s contingency on judgments of B. The usual overshadowing effect was found, however, when B\u2019s prevalence was low. In this condition, when A\u2019s contingency was high there were more A than B instances, whereas the opposite was the case when A\u2019s contingency was low. According to the accounting for occurrences hypothesis, this is what determines the occurrence of an overshadowing effect.\nUnusually, however, there was no significant main effect of prevalence in this experiment. In fact, when A\u2019s contingency was low, there was a statistically significant reversal of the cause prevalence effect in judgments of B. This is unprecedented in research on the cause prevalence effect. There were 11 tests of the cause prevalence effect in White (2004), 10 of which yielded statistically significant tendencies in support of the effect, with the exception showing a nonsignificant trend in the direction of cause prevalence. Experiments 1\u20133 in the present article included 8 tests of the cause prevalence effect (Prediction 1) and 7 of them yielded statistically significant support for it, and in the 8th there was a nonsignificant trend in the predicted direction.\nThere is no obvious difference between the present study and the others that might account for a reversal of the cause prevalence effect. One noteworthy feature of the comparison that yielded the reversal is that there were more B (6 and 12) than A instances (2) in both conditions. The difference between 6 and 12 might not be meaningful, given that both are substantially greater than 2. In support of this, in Experiment 2 an identical manipulation resulted in no significant difference in judgments between 6 and 12 B instances when there were 2 A instances. There was a significant difference, however, when there were 12 A instances (see Table 2). This would not explain a reversal of the effect, but it might explain an absence of the effect, and the reverse tendency observed could be regarded as a statistical aberration, the reliability of which would need to be confirmed before too much effort was expended on the attempt to interpret it.\nGeneral Discussion\nIt has been proposed that a principal aim of causal judgment is to account for occurrences of the outcome. Capacity to account for occurrences is based on the strength of the cause as estimated by the occurrence rate when the cause is present and by occurrence judgment, which is the extent to which the cause is present when the outcome occurs. Under this hypothesis, people compute neither any form of contingency nor the conditional probabilities from which contingencies are computed. Instead, the inferential activity of accounting for occurrences can be represented by a weighted averaging model.\nThe model shown in Equation 1 successfully predicted several findings: the cause prevalence effect (Experiments 1, 2, and 3); the tendency for the cause prevalence effect to occur under manipulations of occurrences and not of nonoccurrences (Experiments 2 and 3); a tendency to give higher judgments to a cause that is better able to account for occurrences than another cause, even when the latter has a higher conditional contingency than the former (Experiments 2 and 3); a significant effect of changing the number of\noccurrences in the presence of one cause even though the conditional contingency does not change (Experiments 2 and 3); and a significant effect of 0 instances, particularly when other available information supports a high causal judgment, but no significant effect of 0 instances (Experiment 4). It was also predicted that overshadowing would be weak or nonexistent if the cause, the contingency of which was manipulated, was less able to account for occurrences of the outcome even at its higher level of contingency. Experiment 5 found no significant overshadowing when this was the case, but overshadowing did occur when both causes were equally prevalent. This experiment had an additional peculiar result in the form of an unexplained reversal of the usual cause prevalence effect in one condition, but this effect is independent of the overshadowing test and does not provide grounds for doubting the result of the overshadowing test. Overall, then, the results supported the predictions derived from the accounting for occurrences hypothesis as formalized in Equation 1, and they did not support those derived from the hypothesis that causal judgments follow from the computation of conditional contingencies.\nThe results of the study by Spellman (1996a) supported the conditional contingency hypothesis, but they are also predicted by the accounting for occurrences hypothesis. The design of Experiment 1 from Spellman (1996a) is shown in Table 6. In this experiment there were two causal candidates: blue and red liquids. There were three conditions, designed so that conditional contingencies varied as shown in Table 6, but unconditional contingencies were held constant at zero for blue and .5 for red. Table 6 shows that mean judgments of blue declined across conditions in accordance with the conditional contingency. Judgment of red was, unexpectedly, significantly higher in Condition 3 than in Condition 1, and Condition 1 was not significantly different from Condition 2, despite the difference in conditional contingencies.\nTable 6 also shows the predictions generated by Equation 1. These too predict the observed decline in judgments of blue across\nconditions. They also predict that judgment of red should be higher in Condition 3 than in the other two conditions, which was found. Equation 1 also predicts higher judgment in Condition 2 than in Condition 1, which was not found. Both the conditional contingency hypothesis and the accounting for occurrences hypothesis therefore predict the results for judgments of blue. Neither model exactly predicts the results for judgment of red, but the accounting for occurrences hypothesis does predict the higher mean found in Condition 3, which was not predicted by the conditional contingency hypothesis. Overall, then, the accounting for occurrences hypothesis accounts for the results at least as well as the conditional contingency hypothesis does."}, {"heading": "Other Theories and Models", "text": "There are four ways of making causal judgments that involve the computation of contingencies: unconditional contingencies, contingency for one cause conditional on the absence of the other cause, contingency for one cause conditional on the presence of the other cause, and computation of simple causal power according to the power PC theory (Cheng, 1997). The computational procedure of the power PC theory modifies the contingency for the cause being judged conditional on the absence of the other cause, with information about the absent occurrence rate (0 and 0 information). Specifically, P for the cause being judged is divided by one minus the absent occurrence rate.\nLeaving aside unconditional contingencies for a moment, the other three ways cannot account for the cause prevalence effect because manipulations of cause prevalence do not alter the conditional contingencies. They are unable to account for effects, on judgments of a cause, of changing the number of occurrences in the presence of that cause when the contingency does not change (Experiments 2 and 3). They are unable to explain the finding that the occurrence of an overshadowing effect depends on the relative prevalence of the two causes (Experiment 5). Illustrating the failings of the power PC theory in this respect, in Experiment 1 the absent occurrence rate is zero in all four conditions. This means that the simple causal power for each cause is equal to its contingency conditional on the absence of the other cause. As Table 1 shows, this does not vary across conditions and is therefore unable to explain the significant differences found in that experiment.\nIn the study by Spellman (1996a), both forms of conditional contingency had the same values in all conditions. In the present experiments, as the tables show, the values were usually different, so each form has to be evaluated separately. The hypothesis that people compute contingency for one cause conditional on the absence of the other cause cannot explain why 0 instances had a significant effect on causal judgment but 0 instances did not (Experiment 4). Both kinds of occurrence contribute equally to the computation of the conditional contingency, so if only one of them is influential, it must be used in some other way. The hypothesis that people compute contingency for one cause conditional on the presence of the other cause cannot explain the significant effect of 0 instances (Experiment 4), because those events do not enter into that conditional contingency. It is unable to explain the influence of the manipulation of numbers of occurrences in the presence of one cause on judgments of that cause for the same reason (Experiments 2 and 3). It is also unable to explain the cause\nprevalence effect, because manipulations of cause prevalence do not alter either form of conditional contingency.\nTurning now to unconditional contingencies, cause prevalence manipulations for one cause (A) do alter the unconditional contingency for the other cause (B). To illustrate, in Experiment 1, when the prevalence of Cause A is low, PuA .52 when the prevalence of B is low and .29 when the prevalence of B is high. This would predict a higher causal judgment for Cause A in the former task than in the latter, consistent with the results. However White (2004) found that unconditional contingencies for both causes consistently decreased as the prevalence of one cause increased, whereas judgments tended to increase for the cause, the prevalence of which increased, and to decrease for the other cause. Also, at low conditional contingencies ( .25), unconditional contingencies predict the reverse of a cause prevalence effect, and this was not found (White, 2004). In the present research, unconditional contingencies do not predict the overshadowing effect found at low prevalence of Cause B in Experiment 5. Nor do unconditional contingencies predict the effects on judgments of Cause A of altering the number of A instances in Experiment 2, because this manipulation did not alter the unconditional contingency for Cause A. On the other hand, unconditional contingencies predict effects of both 0 and 0 , because these contribute to the computation of unconditional contingency for both causes. However, there was no significant effect of 0 in Experiment 4. Furthermore, the results of the study by Spellman (1996a) count against the hypothesis that causal judgments are based on unconditional contingencies.\nWhen there are two possible causes, an additional possibility is that they may be judged to interact in some way. When participants are not allowed to judge interactive causal influence, as in the present research, they may distribute their judgment of the interaction between their judgments of the two individual causes. In this way, judgmental tendencies could reflect the influence of a covert judgment that the causes interact with each other. There are a priori many kinds of interaction that might take place. A might facilitate the effect of B while B has no effect on A, the combination of the two causes might pass a threshold for production of the outcome that is not passed by either cause on its own, the two causes might inhibit each other, and so on. It is clear, however, that the two causes cannot interact with each other when one of them is not present. This implies that an effect of B on judgments of A cannot reflect a judgment that A and B interact with each other: A and B cannot be interacting in the case of B because A is absent, and they cannot be interacting in the case of A instances because B is absent. The cause prevalence effect therefore cannot reflect an implicit judgment that the two causes are interacting with each other. People could judge that an interaction is going on when both A and B are present, and they could use other kinds of contingency information to assess the likelihood of this (Novick & Cheng, 2004). But such an effect would be independent of the cause prevalence effect and of the other effects investigated here.\nNovick and Cheng (2004) proposed that people make interactive causal influence judgments in a normatively appropriate way, extending the principles of the power PC theory (Cheng, 1997). The equation used to compute interactive causal influence depends on two things: whether values of P for A and B are both generative, both preventive, or one of each, and on whether the two-way interaction contrast, a version of P for the conjunction of A and B, is positive or negative. I illustrate with the judgmental\ntasks from Experiment 1 (Table 1). P is computed for each cause conditional on the absence of the other cause. This gives values of .8 for Cause A and .75 for Cause B in all four conditions. The interactive contrast, computed with Equation 2 from Novick and Cheng (2004) is .55 in all conditions. This means that the empirical equation for assessing interactive causal influence is Case 2 from Figure 6 of Novick and Cheng (2004). This gives a value of .05 for all four conditions.\nThe extension of the power PC theory to interactive causal influence is therefore unable to explain the results because the interactive causal influence is the same, and close to zero, in all four conditions. In general, the empirical procedures for computing both simple and interactive causal powers all employ the various conditional probabilities. If the conditional probabilities do not vary across conditions, as is the case in Experiment 1 (and Experiment 2), all the computational procedures predict that judgments will not differ across conditions. The present results therefore have disconfirmatory import for the power PC theory and indicate that causal judgment does not involve the computation of conditional probabilities.\nRecently a number of authors have proposed that causal judgment can be modeled in accordance with principles of Bayesian inference (e.g., Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005; McKenzie & Mikkelson, 2007). Thus far, these accounts have been confined to the case where a single explicit cause is under consideration, and it is not clear how they could be extended to the two-cause case. Griffiths and Tenenbaum (2005) treated the discovery of causal structure as distinguishing between two possible causal graphs, one in which only B (the background or set of all other possible causes) is connected to the effect and one in which both B and C1 (the cause under consideration) are connected. The account also distinguishes between the structure of the system and the strength of a given link.\nIt might be thought that extending this approach to the case of two possible causes, C1 and C2, involves four graphs rather than two: structures where B only, B and C1 only, B and C2 only, or all three, respectively, are connected to the effect. But in fact there is an extra structural layer on top of this, concerned with the link between the two possible causes. As it is not clear a priori which of these could be the effect, there are four possibilities: no link, C1 affects C2 only, C2 affects C1 only, and both causes affect each other. These possibilities are superimposed on the preceding ones, making a total of 16 different graphs. And this is without considering the nature of the interaction that might take place: C1 might enable C2 to produce the outcome, so that the link between C2 and the outcome is not there unless C1 is part of the system; C1 might inhibit C2; the two causes might interact to produce an effect that neither of them produces alone, and so on. This illustrates a general problem for the Bayesian approach. Extending the model to the two-cause case would involve a combinatorial explosion that is computationally intractable. As McKenzie and Mikkelson (2007, p. 35) wrote, \u201cBayesian models are notorious for their enormous complexity when applied to real-world problems, making them unlikely candidates for models of psychological processes.\u201d\nThe Bayesian inference account by McKenzie and Mikkelson (2007) seeks to interpret the unequal cell weights found in many previous experiments as adaptive, given assumptions about the rarity of things being present. They showed that the weights can be\nchanged when things being present are explicitly presented as, or believed to be, common. They too considered only the singlecause case. There are three main problems with extending their model to the two-cause case. One is that the assumption about the rarity of things being present is a free parameter (so long as it is less than .5), which gives opportunities to fit data to the model by adjusting the assumed value. The second is that it is not clear how the model would deal with instances where both causes are present. If cell weights are set only by rarity, one would expect these cells to carry the most weight because the conjunction of A and B must be rarer than either A or B occurring alone (if A and B are distributed independently of each other). But this implied difference in cell weights is contradicted by the results of Spellman\u2019s (1996a) experiments. The third problem is that on any assumption about rarity other than zero, the cells equivalent to cell D, namely B and 0 (for judging Cause A) should carry nonzero weight. The results of Experiment 4 and of the study by White (2005) do not support this, although nonsignificant results carry limited disconfirmatory weight. The Bayesian approach to causal judgment holds great promise, but it is not yet clear what form a Bayesian account of judgment with two explicit causal candidates would take.\nThe fact that instances occur individually in the instance list procedure means that judgment could be acquired by some form of associative learning process operating during visual scanning of the instances in the list. Any associative learning model would readily explain one finding from the present research: That judgments of a cause were higher when there were 12 instances than when there were 2, in the absence of any change in conditional contingency (Experiment 2), would be predicted on the grounds that 12 instances provide more opportunity for learning the causal relation than 2 do, making the association between cause and outcome stronger.\nThe associative learning model that has been most investigated in application to human causal judgment is the Rescorla\u2013Wagner model (Allan, 1993; De Houwer & Beckers, 2002b; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972; Shanks, 1995; Tangen & Allan, 2003). White (2005) showed that the model fails to predict some of the phenomena of the cause prevalence effect. When there are no instances where both causes are present, the model predicts that B and B will have no effect on judgment of A, and vice versa (Tangen & Allan, 2003). This prediction was disconfirmed by the results of two experiments reported by White (2005), where effects of B on judgments of A did occur despite the fact that there were no instances where both causes were present together. When there are instances where both causes are present, the model predicts that both B and B will affect judgment of A (Tangen & Allan, 2003). This prediction was also disconfirmed by several findings in White (2005) that B had no significant effect on judgments of A. Therefore the Rescorla\u2013Wagner model does not account for the evidence relating to the cause prevalence effect.\nIf any other associative learning model is to account for these results, it has to predict effects on judgments of A of instances where B alone is present (or vice versa), even when there are no instances where both causes are present; not only that, but it should also predict effects of B and no effects of B . It would then be required to explain the other findings reported here, such as the finding that the occurrence of overshadowing depends on the relative prevalence of the two causes.\nThe cause prevalence effect can be predicted on the hypothesis that participants are making diagnostic judgments, that is, reasoning from effect (e.g., symptoms) to cause (e.g., disease) instead of from cause to effect. A typical task is predicting which of two diseases a patient has from information about symptoms. On any given trial information about two symptoms is presented, one of which is a perfect predictor of one of the diseases and the other is an imperfect predictor (I) because it is associated with both diseases. One of the diseases is common in the stimulus materials and the other rare, typically with a ratio of 3:1. When presented with I on its own, participants tend to judge that the common disease is present. This is a standard base rate effect (Medin & Edelson, 1988). If participants adopted the diagnostic direction of reasoning, therefore, giving higher ratings to the more prevalent cause could be interpreted as an instance of the standard base rate effect.\nIt is not likely, however, that judgments made in the present research were diagnostic judgments. The initial instructions contained a possible ambiguity in this respect. Participants were told that their task was to find out what determines whether plants have gold edges on their leaves or not. This could mean that they were to judge the strength of different possible causes or that they were to evaluate the extent to which the evidence favored one possible cause over another, an interpretation that could encourage a diagnostic direction of reasoning. Against that, the wording of the causal judgment question was unambiguously causal and not diagnostic: \u201cTo what extent does [the first chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?\u201d Participants were faced with this question every time they made a judgment, so it was more salient than the sentence from the early part of the instructions. The instructions on how to make the judgment were also unambiguously causal, as shown in the method section of Experiment 1.\nIn addition, the cause prevalence effect was initially found with tasks where the measure could not be interpreted as a request for diagnostic judgment. These were medical scenarios involving judging what was causing either headaches or rashes of blue spots (White, 2004, 2005). The initial instructions did not include the ambiguous statement that was present in the instructions used here (see, e.g., White, 2004, p. 966). Moreover it has been shown that cue interaction effects such as overshadowing do not occur with the diagnostic direction of reasoning (Waldmann, 2000; Waldmann and Holyoak, 1992). If participants had adopted the diagnostic direction of reasoning to make their judgment in the present research, the overshadowing effect reported in Experiment 5 would not have occurred. It is therefore likely that the findings reported here are phenomena of causal judgment."}, {"heading": "The One-Cause Case", "text": "The accounting for occurrences hypothesis can be extended to the case where just one cause is under consideration. As in the two-cause case, A instances contribute to both accounting for occurrences and assessing strength. A instances contribute only to assessing strength and should therefore carry less weight than A instances. Instances of 0 contribute only to accounting for occurrences and should therefore also carry less weight than A instances. It is not clear whether A instances should carry more weight than 0 instances. Instances of 0 contribute to neither and should therefore carry negligible weight.\nAs far as these predictions go, they fit with the results of studies of cell weights with one causal candidate. These studies have consistently found the order A A 0 0 , though the difference between A and 0 has not always been significant (Anderson & Sheu, 1995; Kao & Wasserman, 1993; Levin, Wasserman, & Kao, 1993; Mandel & Lehman, 1998; Wasserman, Dorner, & Kao, 1990; White, 2003a). However, under the present account, 0 instances carry no weight, and the results of the present experiments are consistent with that. But 0 information does carry some weight when a single cause is being judged, though less than the other three kinds. One possible explanation for this is that the format of judgment with a single cause induces some participants to adopt a different approach in which they compare occurrence rates when the cause is present and absent, respectively. This may be more likely to happen when just one cause is being judged, particularly with summary presentation where all the information is available at once in a statistical summary, because the information is simpler (four kinds of information as opposed to eight when there are two causes). Kao and Wasserman (1993) reported that approximately 10% of their participants appeared to be making judgments in accordance with P. These participants gave approximately equal weight to all four cells, so the limited weight given to 0 information could be explained as the average of P judges giving substantial weight to that cell and the rest giving no weight to it.\nThis is not a complete explanation of the weight given to 0 , however. White (2000) found that different individuals used 0 information in different ways: Some gave it no weight at all, others treated it as confirmatory, others treated it as disconfirmatory, and others treated it as either confirmatory or disconfirmatory depending on whether the previous judgment had been below or above zero, respectively. The overall weight given to 0 emerges from the combination and prevalence of these different tendencies. It therefore appears that the meaning of 0 information varies between individuals in ways that have yet to be elucidated. Further research may reveal whether these meanings contribute to the attempt to account for occurrences or whether other factors additional to accounting for occurrences are involved. Such research might also help to explain why 0 information is influential in the single cause case but apparently not when two causes are being judged.\nReferences\nAitken, M. R. F., Larkin, M. J.

Participants were presented with digits spaced irregularly in time and postcued (Experiments 1 and 2) or precued (Experiment 3) to recall the order or timing of the digits. The primary results of interest were as follows: (a) Instructing participants to group lists had similar effects on serial and timing recall in inducing a pause in recall between suggested groups; (b) the timing of recall was predicted by the timing of the input lists in both serial recall and timing recall; and (c) when the recall task was precued, there was a tendency for temporally isolated items to be more accurately recalled than temporally crowded items. The results place constraints on models of serial recall that assume a timing signal generates positional representations and suggest an additional role for information about individual durations in short-term memory.\nKeywords: serial recall, timing, short-term memory, recall latencies, grouping\nHow do we remember the temporal structure of sequences of events? This question has concerned short-term memory researchers for a number of decades and has culminated in the formulation of a number of models specifically dedicated to explaining short-term memory for ordered sequences of information (Brown, Preece, & Hulme, 2000; Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Estes, 1972; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002; Page & Norris, 1998). The interest in the principles underlying shortterm memory for order has been supplemented by a concern with short-term memory for the timing of sequences (e.g., Collier & Logan, 2000; Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Glenberg, Mann, Altman, Forman, & Procise, 1989; Watkins, LeCompte, Elliott, & Fish, 1992). This interest in time as the content of memories has been partly driven by the suggestion that the positional representations underlying memory for serial order have a general temporal basis (Brown et al., 2000; Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Glenberg & Swanson, 1986) and a more general belief in the importance of studying time as an object of memory (Crowder & Greene, 1987; Estes, 1985).\nThe purpose of this article is to consider the role of timing information in short-term memory for both the order and timing of sequences. Below, we consider the possibility that the same principles apply to memory for time and memory for order, and the stronger claim that memory for time and memory for order rely on the same mechanisms or representations is discussed. To examine this claim, we tested the following three predictions from the involvement of a timing mechanism in serial recall across three experiments: (a) Grouping should have effects of recall of timing information, as well as order information, (b) input timing should be reflected in output timing for recall of both order and timing, and (c) temporally distinct items should receive an ordered recall advantage. The accuracy and dynamics of recall from the experiments suggest that time is represented in both a timing signal and at the level of individual durations, placing constraints on contemporary models of working memory.\nThe Role of Time in Models of Short-Term Memory\nA popular class of serial recall models assumes that items are associated with some representation of position, such that a sequence can be recreated by cueing for items with successive positional cues. In some these models (Brown, Neath, & Chater, 2007; Brown et al., 2000), time can be identified as playing a fundamental role in the representation of position. For example, in the OSCillator-based Associative Recall (OSCAR) model of Brown et al. (2000), it is assumed that each stimulus in a sequence is associated with the state of activation across a set of nodes representing temporal context. This timing signal is assumed to follow from the activity of neural oscillators\u2014which have been suggested to play a role in timing behavior (e.g., Treisman, Cook, Naish, & MacCrone, 1994)\u2014and gives a natural mechanism for the reinstatement of the timing context for each position by \u201crewinding the clock\u201d (Brown et al., 2000).

(2007), the primary assumption is that items being retrieved from memory are discriminated on the basis of their temporal distance from the present. As in the OSCAR model, time plays a key role in determining the recall of the ordering of items.1\nThese time-based models make a strong prediction that distinguishes them from models assuming ordinal representations of position (e.g., Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002): Items that are spaced further apart in time (leading to less overlap in the temporal contexts of the two items) are predicted to be less confusable in order memory tasks. Contrary to this prediction, a number of studies have failed to demonstrate any effects of the temporal isolation of items, whether the information to be remembered is auditory, visual, or spatial in nature; whether recall or recognition is used as measure of memory; and regardless of the range of temporal intervals used (Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005; Lewandowsky, Brown, Wright, & Nimmo, 2006; Nimmo & Lewandowsky, 2005, 2006; Parmentier, King, & Dennis, 2006). There are two exceptions to this general failure to observe a temporal isolation effect. One is the observation that extending the duration following an item can enhance memory for that item (Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005). However, this has been argued to follow from the employment of other processes, such as rehearsal and consolidation, during these longer intervals; thus, time may only be a proxy in determining the application of time-dependent processes. Consistent with this is the observation that requiring participants to remember items under conditions of articulatory rehearsal negates these temporal isolation effects while leaving ordered recall relatively intact (Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005). A second form of evidence is less easily explained away. In a recent set of experiments, Brown, Morin, and Lewandowsky (2006) have observed that temporal isolation effects are observed in free recall and may also occur in ordered recall tasks when the output order is left unconstrained, even when participants cannot anticipate the nature of the memory test (Lewandowsky, Nimmo, & Brown, in press). On the basis of these results, it has been argued that both ordinal and temporal information are encoded, with these different sources of information being differentially weighted when retrieving items (Lewandowsky et al., in press). What is clear is that temporal information does not solely drive the sequencing of information in short-term order memory but appears to be encoded by default in short-term order memory tasks.\nAnother set of studies has tested these models by examining the accuracy and dynamics of the recall of list items under grouping conditions. Imposing a grouped structure on lists (effectively forming \u201cmini-lists\u201d) has a number of effects on serial recall performance (see Ng & Maybery, 2002a, for a review). Overall order recall accuracy is enhanced for grouped lists (e.g., Hitch, Burgess, Towse, & Culpin, 1996; Maybery, Parmentier, & Jones, 2002; Ryan, 1969a, 1969b), and grouping results in the appearance of miniature serial position functions (i.e., multiple bowings in the serial position function) corresponding to the groups (e.g., Hitch et al., 1996; Maybery et al., 2002). Grouping also has a qualitative effect on recall latencies: A pause is left in recall between groups, leading to discontinuous peaks in the latency serial position function (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Maybery et al., 2002; Parmentier, Andre\u0301s, Elford, & Jones, 2006).\nUsually, this grouping is accomplished by separating the groups in time (e.g., presenting a six-item list with the temporal structure 1..2..3. . . ..4..5..6; see Frick, 1989; Hitch et al., 1996; Maybery et al., 2002; Ryan, 1969a), which has led some to emphasize the temporal nature of the grouping effect (Hitch et al., 1996). That these grouping effects on accuracy and latency may also be obtained with other manipulations that leave the temporal organization of list items undisturbed\u2014such as visual organization (Anderson & Matessa, 1997), playing auditory pips between groups (Ryan, 1969a), and simply instructing participants to group the lists without any stimulus manipulation (Ryan, 1969a)\u2014indicates that temporal variation is not critical to obtaining grouping effects. Nevertheless, time-based theories, such as that of Brown et al. (2000), specify that grouped lists are represented by a hierarchy of temporal representations, with grouped lists recruiting an additional set of oscillators that repeat between groups. That is, these models assume that one component of the timing signal represents time in the sequence, and another represents time within each group. This assumption was tested in experiments by Ng and Maybery (2002a, 2005), who varied the timing of items within temporally separated groups. The time-based models predict that confusions of items between groups should occur on the basis of the time of the occurrence of items within the group; that is, items that occurred at the same time within their respective groups would be more likely to be confused at recall than otherwise. Instead, Ng and Maybery (2002a, 2005) observed that confusions between groups occurred solely on the basis of shared in-group ordinal position. Furthermore, Maybery et al. (2002) observed that the dynamics of recall also failed to indicate a temporal synchronization between input and output: Although introducing a temporal gap between items at input led to a pause being introduced between the groups at output, the size of this pause did not vary with the size of the original temporal gap (see also Ng & Maybery, 2002b). Generally, these data have been argued to invalidate temporal models of order memory and have instead been interpreted as evidence in favor of order-based theories (Ng & Maybery, 2005).\nOne attempt to resolve these findings with a belief in a primary role for time in short-term memory is found in the SIMPLE model of Brown et al. (2007). As mentioned, SIMPLE\u2019s primary assumption is that items being retrieved from memory are discriminated on the basis of their temporal distance from the present. An\n1 One other model to which the label \u201ctime-based\u201d has been applied is the phonological loop model of Burgess and Hitch (1999)\u2014a connectionist version of the phonological loop model of Baddeley (1986). In this model, it is assumed that each stimulus in a sequence is associated with the state of activation across a set of nodes representing temporal context; as time passes, a window of activation slides across the context nodes. Given that Burgess and Hitch have identified the timing signal as being the output of temporal oscillators as in the OSCAR models, some authors have justifiably identified this model as being time-based (e.g., Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005; Lewandowsky et al., 2006). However, in a recent article, Burgess and Hitch (2006) have stated that the \u201ctiming\u201d signal was never intended to be taken as time-based and that the intended assumption is that the \u201cticking over\u201d of the timing signal is driven by events rather than time. We take Burgess and Hitch\u2019s interpretation of the model but note the implications of the results reported here for a time-based interpretation of the model when appropriate.\nassumption critical to explaining the above results is that the relative weighting of the various dimensions along which items might be discriminated is not fixed but can be set at retrieval (Brown et al., 2007; Lewandowsky et al., in press). Together, these assumptions allow the SIMPLE model to explain many of the results above that appear problematic for a time-based model. The lack of temporal isolation effects in serial recall are accounted for by assuming that items are represented on both a temporal dimension and an ordinal dimension, with the ordinal dimension being given primary weighting in standard serial recall, whereas the temporal dimension may be more heavily weighted in cases in which the order of output is unconstrained (Brown et al., 2006; Lewandowsky et al., in press). To explain the null effect of varying timing of items in groups (Ng & Maybery, 2002a, 2005), Brown et al. (2007) assumed that items are discriminated along both a temporal dimension representing time since occurrence and an ordinal dimension representing the position of items in a group. Although the flexibility to allocate weights to temporal and ordinal dimensions gives the model additional freedom to account for these effects, it is not clear under what situations the modeler can a priori determine when participants will recruit one or the other dimensions to guide responding. More germane to the issues here, the nature of the temporal dimension and its relation to temporal representations in other models and tasks are unclear, as Brown et al. deliberately abstract from such a level of instantiation. We next consider more direct approaches to the nature of temporal representations and how they might relate to sequence recall.\nA Common Basis for Timing and Ordering in Short-Term Memory?\nThe data reviewed in the previous section, in questioning the necessary involvement of temporal information in ordered recall, are quite surprising given that a wealth of evidence indicates a critical relationship between timing behavior and shortterm or working memory (e.g., Fortin & Masse\u0301, 1999; Neath & Fortin, 2005). Evidence for a specific relationship between short-term memory for order and timing comes from a study by Elvev\u00e5g, Brown, McCormack, Vousden, and Goldberg (2004), who tested schizophrenia patients and controls on a probed order recall task, a temporal estimation task, and a line length estimation task. Elvev\u00e5g et al. found that, compared with controls, the patients with schizophrenia were impaired on the order recall task and the temporal estimation task but were not impaired on the line length estimation task. Elvev\u00e5g et al. concluded that this pattern of impairment suggested a specific dysfunction in the biopsychological mechanism(s) responsible for the processing of temporal information. Henson, Hartley, Burgess, Hitch, and Flude (2003) argued that these temporal mechanisms might also be disrupted in experimental situations. They showed that articulatory suppression, irrelevant speech, and concurrent tapping all interfered with a short-term memory task that placed demands on order memory to a greater extent than one simply requiring the retention of the identity of list items. Henson et al. suggested that their results were consistent with the recruitment of a timing mechanism (or possibly more than one) to enable the short-term ordering of sequences.\nRecent work has also considered the extent to which serial order memory might be related to processing and memory of the tem-\nporal structure of whole sequences. A number of studies have examined memory for the temporal schedule of items, with the majority of these considering the hypothesis that the modality effect in serial recall (e.g., Cowan, Saults, & Brown, 2004; Frankish, 1985) is due to a greater temporal resolution in the auditory modality. Most studies failed to find an effect of modality for timing tasks, or observed an auditory advantage only under specific conditions of rate of presentation, distractor activity, and variability in the timing of stimuli (Collier & Logan, 2000; Glenberg & Jona, 1991; Watkins et al., 1992). A more direct investigation of the time\u2013order relationship was conducted by Saito (2001), who examined individual differences in a number of shortterm memory measures\u2014including visual and auditory digit span, and memory for rhythms (i.e., sequences of on\u2013off beats). Saito found that both visual and auditory digit span correlated with rhythm recall performance, even when individual differences in reading speed (a measure of articulatory speed) were accounted for. Given that the relationship was observed for both auditory and visual stimuli, Saito concluded that any common basis for timing and ordering extended beyond auditory or articulatory processes and was instead due to a shared reliance on a timing mechanism, such as that assumed in Burgess and Hitch\u2019s (1999) model.\nTogether, the evidence for the role of a timing mechanism in short-term order memory, and the nature of a more general relationship between time and memory, is unclear. Although there is some evidence against the specific formalism of the time\u2013order relationship in Brown et al.\u2019s (2000) model (see also Burgess & Hitch, 1999), further exploration of this relationship is warranted in light of the positive evidence discussed and the abstract nature of more general models of the role of time in order memory (Brown et al., 2007). The remainder of this article reports three experiments that examine the relationship between time and order memory in a single task that manipulates memory requirements (remembering order or timing) and otherwise equates experimental details. In exploring this relationship, three questions are addressed:\n1. Does grouping have a similar effect on timing recall and order recall? In accounting for the well-replicated effects of grouping on ordered recall, Henson, Burgess, and Frith (2000) suggested that grouping has the effect of recruiting additional timing mechanisms (e.g., some representation of rhythm; Saito, 2001) and additionally modulates the timing signal assumed to be at play in ungrouped lists. On the assumption that recalling the timing of a sequence also recruits this timing signal (see Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Saito, 2001), we expected that grouping would similarly affect timing and order recall. In particular, given that people leave an extended pause at group boundaries in serial recall of grouped lists (Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Maybery et al., 2002), we predicted a pause to be left at group boundaries in recalling the timing of grouped lists.\n2. Does input timing drive output timing in timing and order recall? Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of humans to store, retain, and recall or recognize sequence timing (Collier & Logan, 2000; Crowder & Greene, 1987; Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Ross & Houtsma, 1994). Accordingly, we expected that participants would demonstrate some ability to reproduce the timing of sequences in output when this was the task demand. Of greater interest is the question of whether input timing is reflected in the dynamics of serial recall. Although previous studies have\nfailed to demonstrate a mirroring of input times between groups in recall of grouped lists (Maybery et al., 2002; Ng & Maybery, 2002b), this has not been studied more generally. One prediction of timing signal models\u2014such as OSCAR and Burgess and Hitch\u2019s (1999) model\u2014is that, if the timing signal unfolds in real-time (or a scaled version of real-time), input timing on a list should predict output timing.\n3. Does input timing affect ordered recall accuracy? In failing to systematically demonstrate a temporal isolation effect in shortterm order memory, the studies reviewed earlier indicate a noncritical role of timing in ordered recall (e.g., Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Lewandowsky et al., 2006). Nevertheless, a temporal isolation effect is sometimes observed (Brown et al., 2006; Lewandowsky et al., in press), and the boundary conditions on this effect are still unclear. The data collected here provide further constraints on accounts of temporal isolation effects; on the basis of the conclusions of Lewandowsky et al. (in press), we predicted no temporal isolation effects for the serial recall tasks employed here.\nExperiment 1\nTo address the time\u2013 order relationship in a controlled design, in Experiment 1 (and Experiment 2) we used the experimental procedure schematically depicted in Figure 1 (cf. Farrell & McLaughlin, in press). Participants were presented with lists of six digits, the digits being presented with irregular timing. After presentation of the list, participants were presented with a cue indicating either (a) recall of the digits on the list in order (\u201cNUMBERS\u201d) or (b) recall of the timing of the digits, disregarding the identity of the digits themselves (\u201cRHYTHM\u201d). Use of this postcueing procedure meant that the two memory tasks were equated both on the content of the lists and on the processing of the lists at encoding, with the only possible difference being the information recalled at output. The grouping of the lists was also manipulated by introducing grouping instructions halfway through the experiment. As reviewed earlier, instructing participants to think about list items as being in groups is sufficient to elicit grouping effects in serial recall (Ryan, 1969a). Temporal grouping was not employed, as this\nwas thought to be a less salient grouping cue given the irregularity of list timing, and would provide a stronger test of the grouping hypothesis: If grouping affects latencies in the absence of any objective timing manipulations, we can conclude that the effects of grouping on latencies in either task are not simply due to reading of the posited temporal dimension like a tape (cf. Maybery et al., 2002)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Participants were 40 undergraduate students from the University of Bristol, who participated in exchange for course credits.

Sixty lists were constructed for each recall task and were subject to two constraints: (a) Following Henson (1996), lists could not contain ascending or descending pairs of integers (e.g., \u201c3 4\u201d or \u201c7 6\u201d), and (b) an item could not appear in the same serial position on consecutive lists. These constraints also applied to all remaining experiments.\nWe varied the presentation duration of each item on each list pseudorandomly using the following procedure. First, a raw duration was generated for each item by pseudorandomly sampling from a uniform distribution with lower and upper limits of 0 and 1. The durations on each list were then scaled such that durations summed to a constant 3,000 ms; this equates to an average presentation rate of two digits per second, similar to other experiments requiring serial recall of visually presented digits (e.g., Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004). Any lists that contained a presentation duration shorter than 200 ms were entirely resampled, the resampling being repeated until the constraints were satisfied. A histogram of the resulting interstimulus intervals (ISIs) across all participants and serial positions is shown in the left panel of Figure 2.\nWe controlled the experiment with a PC that presented all stimuli (on a 15-in. [38.1 cm] monitor), and we collected and scored all responses using the Psychophysics Toolbox for MATLAB (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). The same apparatus was used in the remaining experiments."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Participants were tested individually in a laboratory. Each trial began with a fixation point (a cross) being presented in the center of the screen for 1,000 ms. This was followed by a blank screen with a duration of 500 ms, which was then followed by presentation of the memory list. List items were presented one by one on the screen, each item after the first immediately replacing the preceding item and being presented for the time determined by the pseudorandom sampling procedure described above. Following presentation of the list, there was another\nblank screen of 500 ms, followed by presentation of one of the two cues \u201cNUMBERS\u201d and \u201cRHYTHM.\u201d If \u201cNUMBERS\u201d appeared on the screen, the participant\u2019s task was to recall the digits from the list in the order they were presented by typing them on the numeric keypad of the keyboard (i.e., standard serial recall). If the \u201cRHYTHM\u201d cue appeared, the participants were instructed to ignore the identity of the digits, and instead to tap the \u201c5\u201d key on the numeric keypad in time with the remembered timing of the input list; that is, they should tap the key at the remembered onset of each item. In effect, the timing task required participants to reproduce the remembered durations of the items on the memory list in order. Demonstration trials were given to show exactly what was required of the participants in the timing task. The task cue remained on the screen throughout the recall period. When the participant had pressed six keys on the keypad, the cue was replaced by a blank screen for 1,000 ms before moving on to the next trial.\nFor the first half of the experiment (60 lists: 30 order recalls and 30 timing recalls), the participants carried out the experiment in line with the procedure as detailed. At the halfway point a message appeared on the screen with additional instructions. These instructions were to \u201cthink about the six numbers on each list as being in\ntwo groups of 3\u201d; participants were given an example of such a grouping (\u201cFor example, if you got the list of numbers \u20181 7 4 8 3 2,\u2019 you would remember \u20181 7 4\u2019 as one group, and \u20188 3 2\u2019 as another group\u201d). The experimental task was otherwise unchanged. The grouping instruction was presented in the second half of the experiment for all participants. Although this leads to an order confound, this constant ordering of conditions was chosen because the grouping strategy was otherwise expected to continue after people had been presented with grouped lists and thus contaminate the ungrouped condition (Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Henson, 1999).\nFour practice trials were presented before the experimental session began (two order trials and two timing trials) to familiarize participants with the experiment. A self-paced break was presented after every 10 experimental trials; participants were presented with a message indicating that they should press the space bar to move to the next set of trials.

An analysis of repeated measures contrasts for this interaction revealed a quadratic trend relating serial position to the difference between grouping conditions, F(1, 39) 9.16, p .004, p\n2 .19, in replication of previous grouping experiments involving lists of verbal items (Maybery et al., 2002)."}, {"heading": "Output Timing Serial Position Functions", "text": "The left panel of Figure 4 plots the mean output time serial position functions for the order task separately for the ungrouped and grouped conditions. A 2 (instruction: ungrouped vs. grouped) 6 (serial position) ANOVA revealed that response times were significantly longer in the ungrouped condition (ungrouped M 658.2 ms; grouped M 615.2 ms), F(1, 39) 18.75, p .001, p\n2 .36, and also indicated a main effect of serial position, F(2.15, 83.77) 299.00, p .001, p\n2 .86. The majority of the latter effect came from noticeably longer latencies for the item first recalled. This pattern is generally observed in latency serial position functions (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Oberauer, 2003; Thomas, Milner, & Haberlandt, 2003) and can be attributed to preparatory processes (Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002, 2004), particularly in the postcued task used here. Of greater interest was the observed significant interaction between grouping instruction and serial position, F(2.75, 107.14) 6.27, p .001, p\n2 .14. Inspection of Figure 4 shows the expected effects of grouping in discontinuously elevating the latency of the fourth item (the first item in the second group), a marker of grouping of the list.\nThough less pronounced, similar effects of grouping were observed for the timing task. Inspection of the left panel of Figure 5 reveals patterns of output times similar to those in the order task,\nin particular a discontinuous effect of grouping in elevating the output time for the fourth position. Consistent with this, a 2 (instruction: ungrouped vs. grouped) 6 (serial position) ANOVA revealed significant effects of serial position, F(1.76, 68.64) 82.92, p .001, p\n2 .68, and a significant interaction, F(3.67, 142.97) 5.36, p .001, p\n2 .12; the main effect of grouping was not significant, F(1, 39) 1.00, p\n2 .01. Although the interaction between serial position and grouping instruction is indicative of the peak in latencies at Position 4 consistent with the grouping strategy (Maybery et al., 2002), an analysis was desired to specifically test for the predicted discontinuity in latencies at the suggested group boundary. Previously, researchers\u2019 analyses have focused on comparing the peak point with the surrounding points using, for example, t tests (Maybery et al., 2002). Here a related approach was employed that uses information from the entire serial position function to determine a baseline with which to compare the peaked latencies. Inspection of a variety of reports of latency serial position functions for serial recall uncontaminated by grouping suggests that after the first output position, the serial position function for ungrouped lists is either monotonic (approximately linear) or quadratic (Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Maybery et al., 2002). Accordingly, for each participant, a second-order polynomial was fit to the latencies from Serial Positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 separately for ungrouped and grouped conditions, and the deviation between the observed latency at the fourth serial position and that predicted from the polynomial fit was calculated. Statistics for the resulting grouping deviations are shown in Table 1. Paired samples t tests comparing grouping deviations in the ungrouped and grouped conditions revealed significantly larger (more positive) differences for both the order task, t(39) 3.64, p .001, Cohen\u2019s d 0.58, and the timing task, t(39) 3.77, p .001, d 0.60, in the grouped condition. These results indicate that both tasks were sensitive to the instructions to group lists and that such instructions led to a lengthening of the pause in output separating the groups in both tasks.\n2 In cases in which Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity was significant, ANOVA results are reported with the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction applied.\nDoes Input Timing Predict Output Timing?\nInput\u2013output regression. To determine whether input timing predicts output timing, we fit a mixed-effects linear regression model (see, e.g., Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) to the data, with input durations for Serial Positions 1\u20135 as the predictor and the times between key presses at recall (which align with the input durations) as the dependent variable; random effects (variability between participants) were included for the intercept and slope parameters. A benefit of using mixed-effects models is that we can estimate relationships common to all the participants while accounting for variance due to individual differences. To maximize the power of the test, prior to application of the model, we filtered the observed effects of output position on output times (see Figures 4 and 5) from the output durations for each participant by subtracting from each individual response time the mean of all responses for that response\u2019s grouping condition and serial position (cf. Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004).\nThe results of the analysis are shown in the left half of Table 2. We first look at the timing task, in which reproduction of the input timings was the goal of the task. Table 2 shows that the estimated\nslope was positive and significantly above 0, indicating that participants were able to reproduce the input timings to some extent. This reproduction was not perfect in that the estimated slopes are well below 1; if participants were exactly matching the input timings with their responses, the estimated slopes should be equal to 1. One possibility is that the output timing that participants produce is a speeded up version of the input timing, given that people can underestimate durations in time estimation and time reproduction tasks (see, e.g., Fraisse, 1984; Wearden & Ferrara, 1993). This is unlikely, as rerunning these analyses with rescaled input and output durations (such that input and output durations both had standard deviations of 1) gave similar slope estimates. Instead, the lower slope estimate is likely to be a consequence of regression toward the mean.\nTable 2 also gives the parameter estimates when applying the mixed-effects linear regression to the output times from the order task. Recall that the order task required only ordered recall of the digits on the list, with the presentation durations being irrelevant. Table 2 shows that output times nonetheless significantly predicted the output times produced by the participants. The slope estimates indicate that this is only a weak dependence, with both slopes being below 0.1. Although theoretically these slopes would be equal to 1 for a perfect dependence, these slope estimates are better put in perspective by comparing them with the parameter estimates from the timing task. Such comparison reveals the order task estimates to be between roughly one quarter and one ninth of the values in the timing task.\nBefore moving on, we consider one potential confound in these results. One strategy that participants may be employing in these experiments is to use any pauses that are longer than average as a basis to group lists (see, e.g., Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005). For example, if there happens to be a long pause after onset of the second item, participants may use the extra time during presentation of the item (or after the item, in later experiments) to group the list in a 2\u20134 structure. If participants then leave a longer pause at the resulting group boundary because of this grouping strategy, as was observed for the group structure suggested by the experimenter in the grouped condition (see Figures 4 and 5), then we may see an artificial dependence between input and output times in\nthe absence of any retention of temporal information.3 To address this issue, we fit the mixed-effects model to the same set of data, with the longest output time in each list recall excluded, on the assumption that the longest response would be a marker for any grouping effects. Note that the resulting inclusion criterion is conservative in that the longest pause was always assumed to follow from a grouping strategy, and there was no explicit test for grouping. Nevertheless, a significant relationship remained between input and output times in both the order and the timing task, though the slope estimates were generally reduced (see the right half of Table 2).\nMigration errors. Additional information about the relationship between temporal information and order information can be obtained by examining the types of errors that participants make in the timing task. One marker of the ordering component underlying the serial recall task is referred to as the locality constraint: Items that are not recalled in their correct position tend to be recalled in nearby positions (Henson, Norris, Page, & Baddeley, 1996; Nairne, 1990; Page & Norris, 1998; Parmentier & Jones, 2000). If, at some level above the representation of individual durations, timing recall is driven by the same ordering processes or representations that drive ordered recall of other types of information, we would expect that timing errors should obey the locality constraint; that is, if a particular duration is recalled at the wrong position, it should tend to be reproduced at a nearby position. One challenge in examining such migration errors is determining which durations in the output sequence map to which durations in the input sequence, given the continuous nature of the responses. This\nissue was addressed by ordering the input and output durations for each list and designating an input\u2013output mapping on the basis of a common ordinal code. For example, for the ordered set of input durations {300 ms, 400 ms, 500 ms, 200 ms, 100 ms} and output durations {400 ms, 300 ms, 200 ms, 100 ms, 500 ms}, the input codes would be {3, 4, 5, 2, 1}, and the output codes would be {4, 3, 2, 1, 5}, such that, for example, the first output duration would be taken to match the second input duration in the original list (both being the fourth-longest duration, \u201c4,\u201d in their respective timing sequence). Using this procedure to discretize the stimuli and responses, we constructed a transposition gradient by tallying the frequency of migration errors committed over various distances (e.g., recalling the fourth item at the second position would be a transposition distance of 2).\nBefore being interpreted, these transposition gradients should be corrected for the chance of conducting transpositions of various distances; for example, for an ordered list of five durations, there are two ways for a transposition distance of 4 to occur (the first item being recalled at the fifth position, or the fifth item being recalled at the first position) and eight ways of committing a transposition error distance of 1. To assess the deviation of these gradients from chance, and to specifically determine whether such deviations are in line with the locality constraint, we fit two simple models to the transposition data. The first \u201crandom\u201d model assumed that the only errors made on the timing task were due to\n3 I am indebted to Murray Maybery for pointing out this possibility.\nconfusions between items of similar duration. Given the random assignment of durations to positions, this was approximated by assuming that an item was recalled at the correct position with probability 1 pit, and was otherwise recalled at a randomly selected position with equal probability for all positions. As an alternative model characterizing the locality constraint, a version of the perturbation model of serial order memory was fit to the data (Estes, 1972, 1997; Lee & Estes, 1977; Nairne, 1992). The perturbation model assumes that forgetting of serial order occurs over time because of the repeated perturbation of the position of items in memory. At each time step an item i migrates to an adjacent position (i 1 or i 1) with probability pord; otherwise, the item remains in the same position (see Nairne, 1992, for fully specified equations). Repeated application of the perturbation process leads to transposition gradients embodying the locality constraint: Transpositions over short distances are more frequent than those covering larger distances, above and beyond the different opportunities for making such transpositions completely at chance (Estes, 1972; Nairne, 1992). For application of the model here, and following precedent (Nairne, 1992), 10 perturbation cycles were assumed to take place for all items prior to retrieval. On retrieval of each item there was an opportunity for the item to be confused with other durations on the basis of similarity as in the random model; again, such an item-based confusion occurred with probability pit. This allowed for the determination of the relative contribution of item-based and position-based information to the transposition errors.\nThe models were fit to the aggregate data by minimizing the chi-square deviation between each model and the data (including correct responses, with a transposition distance of 0); for a particular set of parameter values, predictions were determined from 100,000 model replications. For the random model, pit .872 for the ungrouped condition and .897 for the grouped condition, respectively; for the perturbation model, the ungrouped and grouped conditions respectively gave parameter estimates of pit .872 and .860, and pord .001 and .027. A chi-square test comparing the two models indicated a nonsignificant difference between the two models for the ungrouped condition, 2(1, N 6,000) 0.29, p .59. For the grouped condition, a significant difference was observed, 2(1, N 6,000) 5.58, p .02. Figure 6 plots summary results of the modeling for Experiment 1 (top panels). Plotted in the figure are the deviation from chance (i.e., the predictions of the best-fitting chance model) for the data (triangles) and the best-fitting predictions of the perturbation model (circles); transpositions in the figure have been grouped into \u201clocal\u201d (transposition distance of 1) and \u201cremote\u201d (transposition distance 1) transpositions. The right panel of Figure 6 shows a tendency for the random model to underpredict transpositions with a distance of 1 and overpredict more remote transpositions. This pattern is captured by the order-based perturbation model, indicating some conformity of the data to the locality constraint. No such pattern is evident for the ungrouped condition (left panel)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The numerous data provided by Experiment 1 provide a rich and complex picture of the relationship between time and order memory. The similar effects of the grouping manipulation on order recall and timing recall indicate some common basis for timing\nand order information in short-term memory. The close connection between the sequencing and dynamics of recall is also revealed by the mirroring of input timing in output timing, regardless of whether the task called for recall of such information. Finally, the slight but significant conformation of timing recall to the locality constraint in the grouped condition is suggestive of some higher order timing or ordering mechanism at play above the level of individual durations.\nA full consideration of the implications of these results is explained in the General Discussion section. First, two further experiments are presented that serve as replications of this initial experiment and that generalize the results to provide further constraints on the theories under consideration.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 served as a basic replication of Experiment 1 but also extended the procedure in two ways (see Figure 1). First, digits were presented auditorily rather than visually. Some experiments have demonstrated an auditory advantage for recall of timing information, though this only appears to be the case in specific circumstances (e.g., Collier & Logan, 2000; Glenberg & Jona, 1991; Glenberg et al., 1989; Glenberg & Swanson, 1986; though see Nimmo & Lewandowsky, 2006; Schab & Crowder, 1989; Watkins et al., 1992). Although the empirical status of modality effects in temporal sequencing is unclear, the fact that a modality effect may sometimes be observed in rhythm memory, and may be observed for perception of single intervals (e.g., Wearden, Edwards, & Fakhri, 1998), suggests that this is an important variable to consider. Additionally, some researchers have suggested that timing of durations involves processes akin to the phonological loop in Baddeley\u2019s (1986) working memory model (Franssen, Vandierendonck, & Van Hiel, 2006; Saito & Ishio, 1998). Thus, it may be that different timing mechanisms are recruited for auditory and visual materials. In light of these concerns, it seemed appropriate to confirm that the results were replicated in the auditory modality.\nAnother change in Experiment 2 was to keep the duration of items constant and to instead vary the pauses between items to manipulate list timing. This was done first on pragmatic grounds, as lengthening auditory stimuli led to unnatural lists that were difficult to process and may have introduced acoustic artifacts. Second, this allowed for testing of the temporal isolation effect, which could not be examined in Experiment 1 given the constant pauses between items."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Participants were 40 undergraduate students from the University of Bristol, who were recruited as part of an opportunity sample and who provided informed consent for participation.

The stimuli themselves were recorded from a male speaker with a neutral English accent and were digitized for storage on hard disk. We pitch-flattened the digits to a fundamental frequency of 113 Hz using the phonetics software Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2006)\u2014to avoid any grouping effects arising from pitch variations (see Nicholls & Jones, 2002)\u2014and we normalized the digits to a constant length of 500 ms. The digits were additionally padded to give a regular sounding sequence for different permutations, as it is known (and was observed in pilot testing) that the subjective experience of the center of an acoustic stimulus does not exactly relate to the onset of the stimulus (e.g.,\nScott, 1998). The average duration of this padding was 85.9 ms (SD 50).\nIn Experiment 1 the presentation schedule was made irregular by varying the durations of item presentations. Experimentation with shortening and lengthening the auditory stimuli suggested this would lead to unnatural sounding stimuli. Instead, we randomly varied the pauses between the digits using a similar sampling procedure to that of Experiment 1. Raw pause durations were generated by pseudorandomly sampling from a uniform distribution, and the durations on each list were then scaled such that durations summed to a constant 3,000 ms. There was no minimum constraint on the pause durations.

A similar pattern of effects was observed for the timing task (see middle panel of Figure 5).

This was verified by examining grouping deviations as in Experiment 1 (see Table 1). Paired samples t tests comparing grouping deviations in the ungrouped and grouped conditions revealed larger (more positive) differences under grouping conditions for both the order task, t(39) 5.52, p .001, d 0.87, and the timing task, t(39) 2.82, p .008, d 0.44. Replicating Experiment 1, the instruction to group specifically led to a lengthening of the pause in output separating the groups in both tasks.\nDoes Input Timing Predict Output Timing?\nInput\u2013output regression. Fitting a mixed-effects linear regression model, with the pauses between items in the input as predictors and the times between key presses at recall as the dependent variable, gave similar results to Experiment 1. The results presented in the left half of Table 2 show similar sized estimates of the regression slope relating input times to output times in the timing task, these estimates being highly significant. The significance values for the slopes for the order task were significant for the ungrouped condition and failed to reach significance for the grouped condition; the slopes themselves were of similar size to those in Experiment 1. The results in the right half of Table 2 for the analyses on all data excluding (listwise) the longest response durations again show that this relationship between input and output was not attributable to confounding effects of grouping, with a similar pattern of results in both the order task and the timing task, with an additional marginally significant beta for the grouped condition in the order task.\nMigration errors. As for Experiment 1, the \u201cchance\u201d model and the perturbation model were fit to the frequencies of transpositions over various distances. For the random model, pit .907 for the ungrouped condition and .910 for the grouped condition, respectively; for the perturbation model, the ungrouped and grouped conditions respectively gave parameter estimates of pit .903 and .913, and pord .001 for both conditions. A chi-square test comparing the two models showed a nonsignificant difference between the two models for the ungrouped condition, 2(1, N 4,000) 0.601, p .44, and the grouped condition, 2(1, N 4,000) 0.24, p .72. The difference in frequencies between those predicted by the chance model, and those from the data and the perturbation model are shown in the middle row of Figure 6. Consistent with the modeling results, there is no evidence that transpositions in Experiment 2 conformed to the locality constraint.\nDoes Input Timing Predict Order Accuracy?\nThe manipulation of the pauses between list items in Experiment 2 also allowed calculation of the extent to which the relative temporal isolation of items in the order task resulted in enhanced recall for those items (cf. Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005). To determine whether input timing predicts output timing, we used a mixed-effects logistic regression model (see, e.g., Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) to predict the accuracy (i.e., either correct or incorrect) of each individual response at Serial Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Serial Positions 1 and 6 were excluded as these respectively have\nmissing preceding and following pause durations). The predictors were the length of the pause preceding and following each item; random effects (variability between participants) were included for both predictors. One concern was that effects of temporal isolation might be observed because of grouping effects, as detailed in presentation of the preceding mixed-effects linear regression. In this case it may be that participants use a long pause for extra rehearsals or to construct a new group and that there is therefore an advantage for the immediately preceding item (Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005). To address this possibility, before the analysis was run, we removed the longest input duration\u2014and the items preceding and following it\u2014from the data prior to analysis.4\nThe maximum likelihood estimates and model tests are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, there was little evidence in the data from Experiment 2 that surrounding items by longer pauses led to more accurate ordered recall, with the parameter estimates (betas) for both preceding (\u201cpre\u201d) and following (\u201cpost\u201d) durations being fairly close to, and not significantly different from, 0."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of Experiment 2 are in line with those from Experiment 1: Grouping had effects on both order and timing recall, and input timing was reflected in output timing for both tasks. Additionally, investigation of the relationship between input timing and ordered recall failed to suggest that recall of items benefitted from temporal isolation. This is consistent with previous failures to demonstrate a temporal isolation effect in serial recall (Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005; Nimmo & Lewandowsky, 2005, 2006; Parmentier, King, & Dennis, 2006).\nThese results provide clear evidence for some common basis for short-term memory for time and order information. The common effect of grouping on the dynamics of recall in the order and time recall tasks is consistent with suggestions that grouping has effects on the internal timing signal driving ordered recall (Brown et al., 2000; Burgess & Hitch, 1999). The lack of a temporal isolation effect also places constraints on such a relationship by indicating that a time-based timing signal as assumed in the OSCAR model (Brown et al., 2000) does not solely underpin sequential recall from short-term memory. The temporal isolation data are consistent with the generalization of the OSCAR model and Burgess and Hitch\u2019s (1999) model instantiated in the SIMPLE model (Brown et al., 2007), in which both temporal and ordinal information may be used at the time of retrieval and may be differentially weighted on the basis of task demands (Brown et al., 2007; Lewandowsky et al., in press); the lack of temporal isolation effects implies majority weighting of an ordinal dimension.\nNevertheless, a relationship was observed between input timing and the dynamics of output. If a single form of temporal representation, such as the suggested timing signal, was responsible for the effects of time on both ordering accuracy (temporal isolation effects) and latencies (input\u2013output timing coupling), then these measures theoretically should not dissociate (though in practice\n4 The same model was also fit to the data, including the removed responses and durations. A similar pattern was obtained for both Experiments 2 and 3, with the exception that the effect of \u201cpost\u201d duration was significant for ungrouped lists in Experiment 3.\ndifferential sensitivity in the two effects could give rise to an apparent dissociation). Along with those of Brown et al. (2007) and Lewandowsky et al. (in press), these results suggest instead that time is represented at two levels in this task: at the level of sequencing of the entire list (equating to the timing signal or dimension in the models of Brown et al., 2000, 2007; Burgess & Hitch, 1999; and accounting for the common effects of grouping on recall latencies) and at the level of individual durations (accounting for the relationship between individual input and output times in both tasks). Glenberg et al. (1989; see also Glenberg & Jona, 1991) made a similar distinction in accounting for their observed modality effect on recall accuracy in a rhythm reproduction task, arguing that any observed modality effects follow from the influence of modality on the tuning of representation of the order of events, not of individual durations. The results here, particularly the common effects of grouping, suggest that the posited representation of sequence information is common to memory for order and time.\nBefore drawing some final conclusions, one final experiment is presented that addresses an issue suggested by the SIMPLE framework. The possibility that participants choose to weight different dimensions of evidence begs the question of the extent to which an artificial weighting of dimensions was induced by the postcued nature of Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, we examine the relationship between serial and temporal recall again and also consider the extent to which these relationships are indicative of a basic relationship between these tasks.\nExperiment 3\nThe postcueing procedure employed in Experiments 1 and 2 allowed comparison of order recall and timing recall under very similar conditions. This postcueing controls strategic processes at encoding that might otherwise be differentially employed for dif-\nferent types of information (see, e.g., Duncan & Murdock, 2000). One cost of such an approach is that these conditions, and the results they give rise to, will not necessarily generalize to typical order and timing recall experiments. Accordingly, Experiment 3 replicated the basic procedure of Experiments 1 and 2, with the primary exception that the recall task was precued and blocked, in line with typical short-term memory experiments."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Participants were 57 undergraduate students from the University of Bristol, who were recruited as part of an opportunity sample and who provided informed consent for participation.

This pattern of results failed to replicate in the timing task (see the right panel of Figure 5). A 2 (instruction: ungrouped vs. grouped) 6 (serial position) ANOVA revealed a significant effect of grouping instruction (ungrouped M 963.8 ms; grouped M 912.8 ms), F(1, 56) 31.55, p .001, p\n2 .360, and serial position, F(2.29, 128.41) 6.91, p .001, p\n2 .110; however, the interaction between grouping and serial position was not significant, F(3.85, 215.57) 1.72, p .15, p\n2 .030. Inspection of Figure 5 (right panel) shows that output times were slightly slower in the ungrouped condition but fails to suggest a discontinuous peak for output times at the group boundary; if anything, the serial position function for the grouped condition approximately resembles that for the ungrouped condition in the other experiments and task.\nThe different effects of instructed grouping on the order and timing task were confirmed by examining grouping deviations (see Table 1). Paired samples t tests comparing grouping deviations in the ungrouped and grouped conditions revealed larger (more positive) differences for the grouped condition in the order task, t(56) 3.02, p .004, d 0.40, despite evidence from Figure 4 and Table 1 that the grouping strategy was often being employed spontaneously even in the ungrouped condition. In contrast, the difference in grouping deviations between ungrouped and grouped conditions in the timing task was not found to be significant, t(56) 1.00, p .339, d 0.13.\nDoes Input Timing Predict Output Timing?\nInput\u2013output regression. Fitting a mixed-effects linear regression model to the data from Experiment 3 revealed a similar pattern of effects to those in Experiments 1 and 2, with one exception. The left half of Table 2 shows that, for the timing task,\nslope parameter estimates were large and highly significant. For the order task the relationship was found to be significant for the ungrouped condition, with similar parameter estimates to those observed in the previous experiments. In contrast, the regression coefficient for the data in the grouped condition was not significantly different from 0. As shown in the right half of Table 2, these results remained unchanged, with the exception of a downwards shift in the slope estimates, when the possible contributions of time-based grouping were approximately controlled by removing the longest output times.\nMigration errors. Best-fitting parameters were obtained for the models as before. For the random model, pit .776 for the ungrouped condition and .811 for the grouped condition, respectively; for the perturbation model, the ungrouped and grouped conditions respectively gave parameter estimates of pit .751 and .776, and pord .010 and .013. A chi-square test comparing the two models revealed a difference approaching significance for the ungrouped condition, 2(1, N 5,700) 3.39, p .066, and a significant difference for the grouped condition, 2(1, N 5,700) 5.65, p .018. Differences in transposition frequencies by migration distance for Experiment 3 are shown in the bottom row of Figure 6. The plotted results confirm the pattern implied by the model statistics, with a tendency for there to be greater frequencies of transpositions to adjacent positions (transposition displacement of 1) in both the data and the perturbation model compared with those expected from the random model.\nDoes Input Timing Predict Order Accuracy?\nAs for Experiment 2, a mixed-effects logistic regression model was applied to the data to determine whether input timing predicts order recall accuracy. The same model was applied here, including the removal of the longest pause and surrounding responses on each list prior to analysis. The maximum likelihood estimates and model tests are shown in the bottom half of Table 3. Although the \u201cpost\u201d duration estimates did not differ significantly from 0, the effect of preceding (\u201cpre\u201d) durations was found to be significant for the grouped condition and marginal for the ungrouped condition. The parameter estimates for the ungrouped and grouped conditions indicate a respective increase (multiplication) in odds of recalling an item correctly of 1.34 and 1.82 with each unit (seconds) increase in the pause duration preceding an item. Thus, ordered recall benefitted from temporal isolation, though in an apparently asymmetric fashion."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Experiment 3, which employed a precueing procedure, showed some interesting similarities and contrasts with Experiments 1 and 2. In contrast to the preceding experiments, participants did not appear to group lists in the timing experiment as they did in Experiments 1 and 2, although a grouping strategy did appear to be employed on order trials. In line with previous experiments, input timing was reflected in output timing in both the order and timing tasks; in the order task, this was regardless of the experimental\n6 Order of blocks was fully counterbalanced for all participants except Participant 57, who received the same block order as Participant 1.\nsetup, which allowed timing information to be ignored throughout order recall blocks. Finally, there was some evidence of a temporal isolation effect in Experiment 3, where none was observed in Experiment 2. Together, these results reinforce the general picture emerging from Experiments 1 and 2 that timing and order information are not entirely independent in short-term memory and place constraints on interpretations of the relationship between the two. In the General Discussion section, we consider the possible source and nature of the overlap between the two tasks and what the differences between tasks might tell us about the function of the putative timing signal in short-term memory.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe results of the experiments can be summarized as follows. First, when participants were not precued about the nature of the information to be recalled, instructed grouping had effects on the dynamics of recall of both order and timing information: In grouping conditions, participants left an extended pause between groups in their output (cf. Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Maybery et al., 2002). When the recall task was precued, grouping had this effect on the latencies of serial recall but not recall of list timing. Second, it was generally the case that input timing was reflected in the timing of participants\u2019 output, even in the serial recall task in which recall of timing was not explicitly required. Third, there was some inconsistent evidence for temporal isolation effects: For the precued experiment (Experiment 3), items preceded by a longer pause were more likely to be correctly recalled.\nAlong with other experiments examining the relationship between time and order in short-term memory (e.g., Elvev\u00e5g et al., 2004; Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Lewandowsky et al., in press; Saito, 2001), these data are both suggestive and constraining with respect to models of short-term memory of order and temporal structure of sequences of information. The specific implications of each of the findings is considered in turn."}, {"heading": "Grouping Effects on Recall Timing", "text": "The common effects of instructed grouping on recall and timing in the postcued task (Experiments 1 and 2) are consistent with the notion that a common timing signal supports positional representations in serial recall. Researchers have previously demonstrated a peak in latencies at group boundaries in serial recall using temporal and spatial grouping (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004; Maybery et al., 2002; Parmentier, Andre\u0301s, et al., 2006); our results here\u2014using instructed grouping, along with the lack of effect of the length of the pause in temporal grouping (Maybery et al., 2002)\u2014suggest that this effect follows from organizational strategies employed by participants. The novel finding from the experiments was the occurrence of a latency peak at the boundary between groups in the timing task. This latency peak is surprising in that it is contrary to task demands. Leaving a pause between groups disrupts the dynamics and may make the recall of the duration coinciding with the group boundary less accurate. This is one explanation for the failure to observe a latency peak on the timing task in the precued experiment (Experiment 3), in which participants apparently chose not to use a grouping strategy despite being instructed to do so. Although others have noted a tendency for participants to segment longer\nsequences of intervals into subgroups in timing recall, this is assumed to occur on the basis of intervals themselves (Ross & Houtsma, 1994); for the short sequences here, in which the suggested grouping structure would not always be consistent with the grouping structure suggested by the intervals, the 3\u20133 grouping would not have been a useful strategy.7\nThe suggestion of a common underlying timing signal that is affected by grouping is consistent with neuroscientific evidence on the mechanisms underlying grouping effects. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment exploring the neural underpinnings of verbal short-term memory, Henson et al. (2000) observed that activity in the left dorsolateral premotor cortex increased when placing an additional requirement on participants to remember order information. Henson et al. also observed that introducing a grouping structure decreased activation in this region and medial thalamus while increasing activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Henson et al. suggested that the change in activity in premotor cortex reflected the modulation by temporal grouping of the timing signal assumed in the models of Burgess and Hitch (1999) and Brown et al. (2000). In further support of this, Henson (2005) pointed to evidence of premotor cortex involvement in timing tasks, such as enacting repetitive finger movements (e.g., Catalan, Honda, Weeks, Cohen, & Hallett, 1998). The increase in activity in the right IFG observed by Henson et al. in grouped lists is interesting in the light of carefully controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging work by Livesey, Wall, and Smith (2007), who identified the right IFG (specifically, its confluence with the anterior insula) as one of only three brain regions specifically involved in timing behavior beyond more general processes. The results of Livesey et al. suggest that the premotor activity witnessed by Henson et al. reflects operation of more general working memory processes; one interpretation is that this activity reflects the operation of a timing mechanism subserved and driven by working memory, as suggested in the work of Fortin and others (Field & Groeger, 2004; Fortin & Breton, 1995; Fortin & Masse\u0301, 1999; Fortin & Rousseau, 1987; L. A. Jones & Wearden, 2004; Neath & Fortin, 2005; Wearden & Ferrara, 1993). Indeed, in the framework of the SIMPLE model, this could be seen as a shift from the use of ordinal information (subserved by dorsolateral premotor cortex) in serial recall of ungrouped lists to the use of both ordinal (within-group) and temporal (within-list, supported by right IFG) information in grouped lists.\nDespite this consistency with timing signal hypothesis, this account does not explain where the pause between groups comes from in the first place, especially in the experiments here in which the grouping was only instructed, and no temporal separation of the groups was explicitly indicated. Although Maybery et al. (2002) convincingly demonstrated that directly encoding the pause between groups using the timing signal could not account for the pause in participants\u2019 output, one possibility is that grouping\n7 One possible criticism, raised by a reviewer, is that the effect of grouping on the timing task demonstrates that participants are no longer performing this task accurately under grouping instructions. However, Table 2 reveals that grouping instructions did not grossly disrupt performance on the timing task, with similar regression estimates for the ungrouped and grouped conditions, and with only slightly poorer performance in the grouped condition generally.\n(whether instructed or not) leads participants to implicitly insert a fixed pause along their internal representation of time regardless of the actual time separating groups (e.g., a list presented as 3.4..7..2.1..5 is internally represented as 3.4..7. . . ..2.1..5 when a 3\u20133 grouping structure is suggested). An alternative explanation is that the common effects in the order and timing tasks do not point to the dynamics of a common timing signal but instead reflect the dynamics of retrieval, with the time between groups reflecting the time taken to retrieve a representation of the next group (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Henson et al., 2003; Maybery et al., 2002). In other words, the same representations and processes may drive ordered sequence recall for both information about digits and information about their durations without the necessary involvement of a timing signal. We return to this possibility shortly."}, {"heading": "Reflection of Input Timing in Output Timing", "text": "The finding that participants\u2019 output timing reflected the timing of presented sequences is consistent with previous demonstrations that information about the temporal structure of sequences (i.e., rhythm) is a type of information readily processed and retained in short-term memory (Collier & Logan, 2000; Farrell & McLaughlin, in press; Glenberg & Jona, 1991; Glenberg et al., 1989; Ross & Houtsma, 1994; Watkins et al., 1992). A more surprising observation was that input times were also reflected in output times in the order task; the only clear exception to this finding was a lack of relationship observed in the grouping condition in the precued task of Experiment 3. There are two possible explanations for this general relationship between the timing of list items and their output. This relationship is what would be expected from the real-time ticking forward of the timing signal assumed in models, such as the OSCAR model and some interpretations of Burgess and Hitch\u2019s (1999) model (see, e.g., Ng & Maybery, 2002a, 2005). Under this assumption, the isolated lack of effect for grouped lists in Experiment 3 and other experiments (Maybery et al., 2002; Ng & Maybery, 2002b) might be explained by participants paying more attention to an ordinal position-in-group dimension in grouped lists, a strategy not allowed in Experiments 1 and 2 given the requirement to remember the timing of items. However, the relationship between the input and output timing was weak for the serial recall lists (several of the observed relationships were only marginally significant), suggesting that this timing was not driving recall in the order task, particularly given the overall high accuracy of ordered recall. Additionally, the use of a real-time signal also predicts a temporal isolation effect, which was not universally observed in the experiments (as discussed below).\nAn alternative explanation is that recall is not necessarily timebased, but that individuals nonetheless have immediate and compulsory access to the temporal information stored as part of the information of items. In such a framework it would be the durations of, or intervals between, items that would be the content of memory and not the time of occurrence of items. The treatment of intervals as being the unit of information in remembering the temporal arrangement of sequences is consistent with the treatment of timing memory elsewhere (e.g., Glenberg & Jona, 1991; Glenberg et al., 1989; Sorkin, 1990). This would also explain the nonflat serial position functions in the timing task in the ungrouped condition in the timing task (see Figure 5). These latency serial position functions from the serial recall task are usually considered\nto be measures of the time taken to retrieve, and initiate report of, successive items (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002, 2004; Maybery et al., 2002). The similar inverse U-shaped latency functions for the order task (see Figure 4) and the timing task (see Figure 5), though flatter in Experiment 3, suggest that the same process of retrieving and reporting item information was used in both tasks. Finally, the assumption that durations form part of the content of memory is also suggested by the patterns of transpositions observed in the timing task in some of the conditions considered here (see Figure 6). For both grouping conditions in Experiment 3, and the ungrouped condition of Experiment 2, it was found that the transposition gradients were fit significantly (or marginally significantly) better by a model (the perturbation model; Estes, 1972) in which intervals presented closer together in the list would be more likely to be confused than those further apart in the list. Such a locality constraint on transpositions is a benchmark of serial recall performance and is taken to directly reflect the operation of the mechanism responsible for ordering in serial recall (Brown et al., 2000; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002; Page & Norris, 1998). The transposition data reported here must stand as suggestive, as the locality constraint did not apply to all conditions and was only weakly observed in the conditions when the pattern of transpositions deviated significantly from chance. These weak effects are unsurprising given the implied high confusability of temporal durations implied by the pit estimates in the modeling; future researchers might consider minimizing these confusions by using a recognition task (cf. Farrell & McLaughlin, in press) and thus limiting the contribution of reproduction errors to the timing output.\nWhy is information about the temporal nature of items accessed and incorporated into the dynamics of serial recall of those items? Several possibilities immediately present themselves. One possibility is that durational information is useful information for distinguishing between items additional to other aspects of their identity. A common assumption in models of serial recall, and memory generally, is that the more detailed the available information about an event, the higher probability of recovery of any missing information (all other things being equal; e.g., Brown & Hulme, 1995; Lewandowsky & Farrell, 2000; Nairne, 1990). It may be then that by attempting to reinstate the timing of items, the participants in these experiments, particularly Experiment 3, are supplying temporal information as additional cues to the identities of items. The stronger claim that different types of information (including positional and temporal information) are bound together into integral short-term memory representations may also explain these results and the common effects of grouping on order and timing recall. One question is whether this binding occurs automatically or was witnessed in Experiments 1 and 2 because of the requirement that both order and timing information be attended to.8 If order and timing information are stored in an integrated fashion regardless of task demands, this predicts that manipulations of either type of information should have effects on recall of the other type of information. For example, in a paradigm in which recognition memory for a sequence of order or timing information is tested with a probe sequence (e.g., Farrell & McLaughlin, in press), if integrated representations are formed, we would predict\n8 I thank Fabrice Parmentier for raising this issue.\nthat varying the temporal arrangement of items between presentation and test (independent of order) would affect recognition of order, and vice versa. If the relationship between ordering and timing is more hierarchical in nature, with ordering giving access to timing information, then we would predict that varying timing information should have no effect on order recognition, whereas varying order should affect the recognition memory for timing information.\nA second, alternative possibility is that the incorporation of timing information into the dynamics of serial recall reflects the deployment of an integrated \u201caction plan.\u201d D. M. Jones, Macken, and Nicholls (2004) and Macken and Jones (2003) have argued that what appears to be a specialized system for short-term memory of phonological information is actually the co-opting of perceptual and motor processes to perform sequence production. From this perspective, many phenomena associated with shortterm memory\u2014such as the effects of phonological similarity, modality, and irrelevant speech\u2014are all attributed to perception and motor planning. Recently, Tubau, Hommel, and Lo\u0301pezMoliner (2007) have suggested that action plans formed in sequential learning tasks involve the integration of order information and relative timing; this follows from Tubau et al.\u2019s observation that the performance of participants who appeared to be explicitly learning action plans was adversely affected by disrupting the timing of the response sequence. The input\u2013output timing coupling witnessed in the experiments here may reflect the partial integration of order and timing information in such action plans.9 In any case, the significant coupling of input and output timing in the order task, along with the transposition gradients of temporal confusions, suggests a role for the information about individual durations.\nTemporal Isolation Effects\nA final finding of interest was a temporal isolation effect in Experiment 3. That a temporal isolation effect was observed at all is surprising, given repeated failures to find such an effect in the serial recall task (Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005; Nimmo & Lewandowsky, 2005, 2006; Parmentier, King, & Dennis, 2006). One possible explanation, in line with previous findings of apparent temporal isolation effects (Lewandowsky & Brown, 2005), might be that participants in Experiment 3 took advantage of the durations between items for additional rehearsal of the preceding item. However, this would not explain the enhanced performance for items preceded by longer durations, particularly in the grouped condition. Another explanation for the difference between these results and previous failures to observe temporal isolation effects might be that the context of the experiment, in which participants were sometimes required to attend to the timing of items, led participants to attend more to the timing of items than in previous experiments. This is an unlikely explanation, as Experiment 2, in which attention to time was explicitly required, did not produce any evidence of a temporal isolation effect. Similarly, Farrell and McLaughlin (in press) failed to observe a temporal isolation effect in a recognition experiment in which the type of information on which the recognition decision was to be made, ordinal or temporal, was postcued. Indeed, the finding that a temporal isolation effect was not observed when requiring participants to attend to time, and was observed when attention to time was not required,\nreinforces the conclusion that there are several types of temporal information that might be drawn on in the various short-term memory tasks.\nA plausible explanation for the difference in results between Experiments 2 and 3 is a trade-off between the dimensions of time (or position) in the list and durations of items, such that in Experiment 3, participants were paying more attention to the ordinal or temporal placement of items and less to duration or interval information relating to individual items. This would leave unexplained the reason for participants weighting the time-in-list dimension where others have failed to observe a temporal isolation effect. Lewandowsky et al. (in press) have argued that temporal isolation effects are observed when the order of recall of information is unconstrained, whether that information is about the identity of items or their placement in a sequence. The observation of a temporal isolation effect here in the serial recall task, in which output order is necessarily forward, questions the completeness of this account and suggests other factors might be at play in such tasks. A hint about one such factor is the observation that a temporal isolation effect in Experiment 3 was observed more strongly in grouped lists (see Table 3). One explanation for this grouping effect is that, in grouped lists, participants make use of two dimensions, a temporal dimension and a positional in-group dimension. Thus, grouping lists forces participants to rely on a time-based representation of position in the list, giving rise to a clear temporal isolation effect;10 as suggested above, this may relate to shifting of reliance on a lateral premotor cortical timing mechanism to involvement of an additional timing mechanism associated with right IFG (cf. Henson et al., 2003)."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Overall, the results call into question the notion of a single timing signal driving serial recall and point to a variety of temporal representations at play in working memory (cf. Glenberg & Jona, 1991). Such a conclusion is not inconsistent with models\u2014such as those of Brown et al. (2000, 2007) and Burgess and Hitch (1999)\u2014that assume a hierarchical temporal signal drives ordered recall (see also Henson et al., 2003). However, the results here, along with others, suggest that ordinal information may be used to perform sequence ordering and that participants may freely switch between the use of different types of information about the timing of a sequence (Brown et al., 2006, 2007; Lewandowsky et al., in press). In particular, the results suggest that time is represented\n9 Neither of these possibilities accounts for the failure to observe coupling of input\u2013output times in the experiments of Ng and Maybery (2002b) and Maybery et al. (2002) and the grouped condition of Experiment 3 here, all of which involved presentation of grouped lists. One speculative explanation, again in the framework of the SIMPLE model (Brown et al., 2007), would be that weighting both a temporal within-list dimension and an ordinal within-group dimension would result in minimal weighting being given to duration information, except in cases in which that information will later be required for recall (Experiments 1 and 2). This explanation is more speculative, however, as SIMPLE does not currently account for the dynamics of recall (Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004).\n10 A planned experiment in our laboratory will test this suggestion by replicating the serial recall trials of Experiment 3 in conditions where recall of temporal information is never required.\nboth at the level of the entire sequence and at the level of individual durations (cf. Glenberg et al., 1989) and that this information may be incorporated into the dynamics of recall. The challenge for current models of short-term memory is to recognize such flexibility while specifying in detail the mechanisms and representations supporting such performance (cf. Lewandowsky et al., in press); in particular, the data here emphasize the importance of considering output times as constraining data on models of serial recall (see also Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2004).\nReferences\nAnderson, J.

These results are consonant with current theories positing that attention is a necessary condition for learning. More important, the results provide support for a more radical conception, in which the joint attentional processing of 2 events is also a sufficient condition for learning the relation between them. The well-documented effect of contiguity could be a by-product of the fact that attention generally focuses on contiguous events. This reappraisal considerably extends the scope of approaches based on associative or statistical processes.\nKeywords: attention, statistical computation, associative learning, language\nThe past 2 decades or so have been the theater of an attempt to account for a growing number of higher cognitive activities in a framework rooted in the notions of associative (or statistical) learning. This line of research has been especially lively in language, where the so-called statistical/distributional approaches are sometimes construed as viable alternatives to the more conventional rule-based perspective (e.g., Redington & Chater, 1998; Seidenberg & MacDonald, 1999; for brief overviews, see Perruchet, 2005; Perruchet & Pacton, 2006).\nBy and large, such approaches have focused on the human abilities to detect and exploit the relations between adjacent elements. This focus is consistent with the traditional literature on associative learning. In considering the domain of animal conditioning, or studies on paired-associate learning in humans, we observe that, in all cases, the items to be associated are displayed in close temporal or spatial proximity. This is also true for the more recent studies on implicit learning (e.g., Stadler & Frensch, 1998). For instance, the finite-state grammars that are commonly used in artificial grammar studies govern relations between contiguous elements. As a consequence, the models of implicit learn-\ning relying on the formation of chunks of adjacent events have proved to be especially successful in those situations (e.g., Perruchet, Vinter, Pacteau, & Gallego, 2002; Servan-Schreiber & Anderson, 1990).\nSeveral studies have shown that adjacent relations are far more relevant for language acquisition than has been claimed in the past. In a series of oft-cited experiments, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin (1996) showed that the formation of the lexicon partly relied on statistical relations between adjacent syllables. Moreover, Redington, Chater, and Finch (1998) showed that highly local context provided a considerable amount of information about the syntactic categories of words. However, linguistic structures also embed remote dependencies. That is to say, a relation exists between two events, A and C, irrespective of the intervening events (hereinafter, this structure is referred to as AXC, where X stands for a variable event, which is statistically independent of both A and C). Such relations are found at different levels, from the subsyllabic level (e.g., the short vs. long pronunciations of vowels according to the presence of a \u201csilent e\u201d ending, irrespective of the intermediary consonant, as in CAP\u2013CAPE, CAR\u2013CARE; Stanback, 1992) to morphosyntactic relationships (e.g., between auxiliaries and inflectional morphemes, as in \u201cis writing,\u201d irrespective of the verb stem) and hierarchical structures (e.g., in center-embedded sentences, such as \u201cthe rat the cat ate stole the cheese\u201d; Perruchet & Rey, 2005). Nonadjacent dependencies are also present in other domains of high-level knowledge, such as music. Likewise, capturing the relationships between distant objects seems essential. As claimed by Turk-Browne, Junge\u0301, and Scholl (2005), \u201cpeople are constantly bombarded with noise in space and time that needs to be segregated in order to extract a coherent representation of the world, and people rarely encounter a sequence of relevant stimuli without any interruptions\u201d (p. 562).\nIn the past few years, this state of affairs has given rise to a set of studies investigating the possibility of learning nonadjacent dependencies in artificial languages (Bonatti, Pen\u0303a, Nespor, &\nSe\u0301bastien Pacton, Institut de Psychologie, Laboratoire de Psychologie et Neurosciences Cognitives, Universite\u0301 Paris Descartes, Paris, France, and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France; Pierre Perruchet, Laboratoire d\u2019Etude de l\u2019Apprentissage et du De\u0301veloppement / Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite\u0301 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.\nThis work was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS; Formation de Recherche en Evolution [FRE] 2987 and Unite\u0301 Mixte de Recherches 5022), the Universite\u0301 Paris Descartes, and the Universite\u0301 de Bourgogne.\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Se\u0301bastien Pacton, Institut de Psychologie, Laboratoire de Psychologie et Neurosciences Cognitives, Universite\u0301 Paris Descartes (CNRS, FRE-2987), 71 Avenue Edouard Vaillant, 92774, Boulogne-Billancourt, Cedex, France.

The question to be debated is, What is the nature of these constraints? More specifically, can these constraints be encompassed within a general theory of associative learning, or are they specific enough to suggest that learning adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies constitutes radically different forms of learning?\nAn Overview of Earlier Studies\nIn an initial attempt to address the questions outlined above, Go\u0301mez (2002) showed that, in a situation where the successive AXC units were perceptually distinct, the degree to which the A_C relationships were learned depended on the variability of the middle element (X). More precisely, participants were presented with 2, 6, 12, or 24 different X elements, and learning was observed to increase markedly under conditions of greatest variability in both adults and infants (see also Go\u0301mez, 2006; Onnis, Christiansen, Chater, & Go\u0301mez, 2003). According to Go\u0301mez, when X is variable, the adjacent relations (i.e., AX and XC) are not stable enough to be learned, and thus people shift their focus onto the only stable relation available in the language, namely, that between A and C.\nFor Creel, Newport, and Aslin (2004), the crucial factor is the similarity between A and C, more precisely, the higher level of similarity existing between A and C than between A (or C), on the one hand, and X, on the other hand. Similarity can be assessed on an acoustic dimension. Using musical tone sequences, Creel et al. (2004) showed that nonadjacent dependencies were not acquired when all of the elements differed equally one from one another, whereas learning was successful when A and C were similar in pitch or timbre, and different from X. The role of acoustic similarity was also emphasized by Onnis et al. (2005), who concluded from their studies of artificial language that no learning was obtained without some degree of phonological similarity between A and C syllables. To account for their results, Newport and Aslin (2004) invoked the perceptual grouping principles identified by Gestalt psychologists and, notably, the law of similarity. In other studies from the same laboratory, similarity was assessed in terms of categorical classification. Newport and Aslin (2004) failed to observe learning with nonadjacent syllables (i.e., A, X, and C were syllables), whereas learning occurred when A and C were consonants and X was a vowel and, conversely, when A and C were vowels and X was a consonant.\nAccording to Bonatti et al. (2005), consonants and vowels do not serve the same function in language, with consonants giving cues about the lexicon and vowels being tied more closely to syntax. Starting from the postulate that statistical analyses mainly serve to build a lexicon, Bonatti et al. predicted that nonadjacent relations between consonants would be learned, whereas nonadjacent relations between vowels would remain undetected. The authors provided some experimental support for their prediction. This proposal suggests that the conditions allowing the learning of\nnonadjacent dependencies are linked to language-specific features and, thus, are different from the general purpose mechanisms serving to discover the relations between contiguous events. Indeed, Pen\u0303a et al. (2002) argued that a statistical or distributional approach is unable to account for the discovery of nonadjacent dependencies. As experimental support, Pen\u0303a et al. showed that this form of learning was only possible when short pauses were introduced between the AXC words during the familiarization phase. The role of these pauses, Pen\u0303a et al. asserted, was to make the speech stream more similar to natural language. By doing so, the pauses trigger computational processes oriented toward the discovery of the speech structure, which the authors argued are entirely different from those involved in the discovery of statistical patterns.\nThis brief overview leaves a somewhat fuzzy picture. Considering the different studies jointly suggests that none of the learning conditions that have been a focus up until now may be taken as decisive. For instance, the emphasis of Go\u0301mez (2002) and Onnis et al. (2003) on the need for a highly variable intervening event is challenged by the positive results obtained by other contributors, who generally used only two or three different Xs (e.g., Newport & Aslin, 2004; Perruchet et al., 2004). Likewise, the emphasis on the learning of relationships between consonants (Bonatti et al., 2005) or the need for pauses between A and C units cannot be taken as universal prerequisites given the studies showing that relations between vowels are learned as well and that pauses are unnecessary (Newport & Aslin, 2004). As a consequence, the issue of whether learning nonadjacent dependencies actually requires conditions that are qualitatively different from those required for learning adjacent dependencies remains an open question.\nA Unitary View of Adjacent and Nonadjacent Dependency Learning\nThe view proposed here is aimed at accounting for the learning of both adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies within a unified theoretical framework. Our framework relies heavily on the role of attentional processes. Emphasizing the role of attention in associative learning is far from new. Although the initial theories of conditioning mostly focused on the contiguity of the stimuli (Guthrie, 1930), a number of studies in the 1960s and 1970s showed that contiguity was not sufficient to trigger the learning of associations. Those studies led to the emergence of models centered on the need for learners\u2019 attentional involvement (e.g., Mackintosh, 1975). Since then, empirical data suggesting that learning does not occur without a minimal level of attention have accumulated, especially in the area of implicit, nonintentional forms of learning, which has\n1 Turk-Browne et al. (2005) reported successful learning of relationships between visual shapes of a given color when the related items are interrupted by irrelevant items from another color stream. Turk-Browne et al.\u2019s study was not directly aimed at studying nonadjacent dependencies, and as discussed by the authors, the results are only suggestive of the possibility of what they called \u201cinterrupted statistical learning.\u201d Indeed, the occurrence of the intervening events was randomly determined, hence occasionally allowing the presentation of relevant events in immediate succession. However, a subsequent study by the same authors, currently published in abstract form (Junge\u0301, Turk-Browne, & Scholl, 2005), suggests that learning persists when the \u201cinterrupting\u201d elements are perfectly interleaved.\nbeen a primary focus of recent research (e.g., Frensch, Buchner, & Lin, 1994; Hoffman & Sebald, 2005; Hsiao & Reber, 1998; Jimenez & Mendez, 1999; Whittlesea & Dorken, 1993). We consider this research in more detail in the General Discussion. It is sufficient here to point out that all of these studies converge toward the conclusion that attention is a necessary condition for learning. Indeed, what is shown is that even when the objective conditions that are, in principle, conducive to learning are fulfilled (especially those concerning the contiguity of events), learning may fail to occur whenever the learner\u2019s attention is not focused on the relevant events.\nAs such, a learning model positing the necessity of attention remains unable to account for the learning of nonadjacent relations. Indeed, the need for attentional involvement does not preclude other conditions from being effective, especially those concerning the temporal or spatial adjacency of events. To account for nonadjacent dependency learning within an attentional model, one must postulate, in addition, that attention is a sufficient condition for learning to occur. The claim that attention is a sufficient condition means that no other condition is required, neither in participants\u2019 dispositions (such as their intention to learn) nor in the external display (such as the spatial or temporal relationships between events). Thus the critical postulate of our model is that the joint attention given to a pair of events is a necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of associative learning and memory. In line with this postulate, several authors have proposed that associative learning is an automatic process that links together all of the components that are present in the attentional focus at a given point (Frensch & Miner, 1994; Logan & Etherton, 1994; Perruchet & Vinter, 2002; Stadler, 1995; Treisman & Gelade, 1980). However, to the best of our knowledge, the potential of this proposal to account for nonadjacent dependency learning has yet to be exploited.\nIf the spatial or temporal contiguity of the relevant events is not a mandatory condition for associative learning and memory, one may wonder why this condition has received such considerable (and once exclusive; see Guthrie, 1930) attention throughout the past research on learning. It may be that, in an overwhelming proportion of earlier associative learning studies, the objective contiguity of the to-be-associated elements and the joint attentional processing of those elements were confounded. For instance, in standard classical conditioning studies, the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli were generally displayed within a temporal window of 500 ms or so, with a long blank interval between successive pairings. In those conditions, there is no doubt that the two relevant events are attentionally processed together, and this leaves open the possibility that the causal factor was the joint attentional processing, not the contiguity per se. More generally, the mental content composing the attentional focus at a given moment has a high chance of representing events that are close on spatial and/or temporal dimensions in the environment. Certainly, the attentional content may also encompass events that are not adjacent in the environment, but some specific reasons are needed to pay joint attention to those events. Thus, our attention-based view accounts for both the easy formation of associations between contiguous events (those events are generally represented as mental chunks) and the far more limited ability to build associations between nonadjacent events (the joint attentional processing of those events requires some special conditions). In this view, the conditions\npromoting learning nonadjacent dependencies are the same as those that allow the joint attentional processing of the relevant events.\nThis theoretical proposal appears to be compatible with the available findings on nonadjacent dependency learning. For instance, the variability of the intervening event (X) may draw participants\u2019 attention toward the repeated elements (A and C) as a result of their relative frequencies, hence favoring the discovery of their relations, as observed by Go\u0301mez (2002)2 and Onnis et al. (2003). The factors revealed in the studies by Creel et al. (2004) and Newport and Aslin (2004; see also Onnis et al., 2005) originally accounted for by reference to the Gestalt law of similarity, may also be encompassed in a view centered on attentional processing. Indeed, as has been occasionally suggested (e.g., Driver & Baylis, 1998; Scholl, 2001), an equivalent claim could be made that an array of elements forms a perceptual group, as defined by the traditional Gestalt principles, with the assertion that attention automatically spreads across those elements, hence integrating them within a single chunk. More indirectly, an attention-based interpretation is also consistent with Pen\u0303a et al.\u2019s (2002) data. Indeed, Pen\u0303a et al. failed to observe learning when the AXC words were played as an unbroken stream, whereas successful learning of nonadjacent dependencies was obtained when the speech stream was perceived as a succession of AXC words (as shown in Perruchet et al., 2004). Without pauses between the AXC units, there is no reason to jointly focus on A and C rather than on any other subset of syllables. By contrast, when participants perceive the auditory stream as a succession of AXC words, they pay more attention to the first and last syllables than to the intervening ones, because the start and the end of a sequence capture more attention than do the intermediary events (e.g., Cowan, 1991).\nThe Present Study\nThe fact that, by and large, an attention-based model of associative learning is able to provide an a posteriori account for earlier results provides only partial support for the model. This is especially true given that the nature of the features likely to capture attention is open to debate, and there is a risk of circularly defining these features as those that promote associative learning. Stronger evidence would be provided if one were able to draw new predictions from our model. It is worth noting in this context that attention can be captured by the intrinsic features of the environment but can also be internally driven. That is to say, attention can be oriented toward adjacent or nonadjacent aspects of the very same physical display as a function of task demands. This property allows original predictions, as is illustrated after a brief outline of our experimental approach.\n2 Go\u0301mez (2002) also conferred a role to attention, but in a different way. Indeed, Go\u0301mez assumed that attentional processes are captured by a stable relation. This means that detecting the stability of the relation is a prerequisite for this relation to fall into the focus of attention. Note, however, that Go\u0301mez\u2019s interpretation leaves open the question of the mechanisms allowing the detection of stable relations, which may be thought of as the hallmark of learning. By contrast, we assume that certain events capture attention, for instance, because of their intrinsic properties, with the detection of their relations being a by-product of the joint attentional processing of those events.\nIn the experiments described below, participants were faced with a set of problems, each consisting of a sequence of digits embedding both adjacent and nonadjacent regularities. The participants\u2019 task involved (a) the sequential processing of each individual digit of the sequence and (b) the joint processing of two selected digits. These two digits were adjacent for a first group of participants and nonadjacent for a second group. A subsequent recognition test explored how well participants from the two groups learned both adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. The predictions of different theories are represented in Table 1. We reasoned as follows: If learning depends exclusively on the contiguity between elements, then participants should learn adjacent relations, irrespective of the task they have to perform. If learning depends on both attention and contiguity, then participants should learn only adjacent relations in the condition in which the task demand leads to a focus on those relations. This second possibility would be consistent with the prevalent associative learning theories, which posit that attention is necessary without concurrently relaxing the condition of contiguity. Finally, if learning depends exclusively on attention, irrespective of the objective relations between elements, then participants would learn adjacent relations when they focus on adjacent relations and nonadjacent relations when they focus on nonadjacent relations. In other words, when contiguity and attention are manipulated orthogonally, participants should learn the relations between the elements on which they focus to meet the task demand, irrespective of their objective contiguity. Our hypothesis was in keeping with this third possibility.\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, participants were presented with a set of 20 problems. Each problem consisted of a digit on the left, which indicated the target for this problem, followed by a sequence of 20 digits. Each sequence consisted of two occurrences of an adjacent dependency (e.g., the digit 4 systematically followed the digit 6) and two occurrences of a nonadjacent dependency (e.g., the digit 7 systematically followed the digit 3, with a variable digit intervening between the digits 3 and 7). An example of a sequence is: 5 8 5 6 4 3 9 7 1 0 8 6 4 9 3 0 7 2 2 1 (see Figure 1). Participants had to browse the 20-digit sequences, from left to right, in order to detect the targets. When participants detected a target, they had to\ncalculate the difference between two digits, either the two digits that immediately followed the target or the two digits that immediately surrounded the target. All of the participants had to circle the target and the two digits they had to subtract from each other when the absolute value of their difference equaled three. It is worth noting that participants never had to circle the elements forming the adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies, as neither the difference between 6 and 4 nor the difference between 3 and 7 equals 3 (or 3). After this study phase, the same recognition test was used in the two groups to assess the learning of both adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies.\nAn attention-based model predicts an interaction between the type of dependency and the task demand. Indeed, adjacent dependencies, but not nonadjacent dependencies, should be learned when participants have to process adjacent items, whereas the reverse is expected when participants have to process nonadjacent items. Note that this pattern of results cannot be attributed to intrinsic properties of the material, as the material included the very same dependencies for all of the participants.\nNote. The table shows predictions of three theoretical models of learning as a function of whether the task focuses participants\u2019 attention on adjacent or nonadjacent dependencies. A plus sign indicates that learning should occur, and a minus sign indicates that learning should not occur."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. A total of 192 undergraduate students from the Universite\u0301 Paris Descartes, Paris, France, participated in the experiment in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. All participants were native French speakers. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four Dependency Type Digit Combination experimental groups (n 48 for each group).\nMaterials. The stimuli used in the study phase consisted of 20 problems composed of a target digit inside a rectangle on the left (which indicated the value of the target for this problem) and a sequence of 20 digits on the right (see Figure 1). In every sequence, (a) each of the 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) occurred twice, (b) a pair of digits forming an adjacent dependency (e.g., 64) occurred twice, and (c) a pair of digits forming a nonadjacent dependency (e.g., 3X7) occurred twice. The adjacent and nonadjacent pairs were identical for all of the problems presented to a given participant. For each problem, the target digit was selected randomly among the digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9, that is, those digits that were not elements of the pairs forming the adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. When the task involved a subtraction between adjacent digits, the target digit occurred once just before one of the two pairs of digits forming an adjacent dependency and once in another position. When the task involved a subtraction between nonadjacent digits, the target digit occurred once between the two pairs of digits forming a nonadjacent dependency and once in another position. Figure 1a shows three problems with the adjacent pair 64, and with the nonadjacent pair 3X7, when the task consisted in deciding whether the difference between the two digits following the target digit equals three (this is the case for the second problem in which the digits 8 and 5 follow the target 1). Figure 1b shows three problems with the adjacent pair 64, and with the nonadjacent pair 3X7, when the task consists in deciding whether the difference between the two digits surrounding the target digit equals three (this is the case for the second problem in which the digits 4 and 1 surround the target 2).\nFor each participant, a set of 20 problems was generated. For each problem, the value of the target digit, the position of the two pairs forming the adjacent dependency, the position of the two pairs forming the nonadjacent dependency, and the position of the residual digits were determined randomly. Different randomizations were used for each participant. This led to the construction of 192 different sets of 20 problems. For half of the problems, the adjacent dependencies were 64 and the nonadjacent dependencies were 3X7, and for the other half, the adjacent dependencies were 37 and the nonadjacent dependencies were 6X4. Each of the 192 sets of 20 problems was printed in Verdana font, size 12, on a single A4 sheet of paper (21.0 29.7 cm). The distances were 1.5 cm between the target digit inside the rectangle and the first digit of the sequence and 0.7 cm between two successive digits of the sequence. There was a distance of 1.0 cm between two successive problems.\nA two-choice recognition test was used to assess participants\u2019 learning of adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. The stimuli used in this test consisted of 16 pairs of three-digit strings. Each pair contained a legal string and an illegal string. Eight pairs were used to assess the learning of adjacent dependencies. For the participants who were exposed to 64 as the adjacent dependency and 3X7 as the nonadjacent dependency during the study phase, the\nlegal string was 64X for four pairs and X64 for four other pairs. The illegal string resulted from a spacing violation in four pairs 6X4 and from an order violation in four other pairs 46X or X46. Eight other pairs were used to assess the learning of nonadjacent dependencies. The legal string was 3X7 for the eight pairs. The illegal string resulted from a spacing violation in four pairs 37X or X37 and from an order violation in four other pairs 7X3. Pairs were elaborated on the basis of the same principle for the participants who were exposed to the opposite digit combination, that is, 37 as the adjacent dependency and 6X4 as the nonadjacent dependency during the study phase. The digit X was always selected randomly among the six digits used as target digits in the study phase (0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9). The digit X was the same in the legal string and in the illegal string of a pair (e.g., 640 \u2013 604; 387 \u2013 378). For each participant, the 16 pairs of three-digit strings were printed in Verdana font, size 12, on a single A4 sheet of paper. The distances were 0.7 cm between two successive digits of a sequence and 2.0 cm between the third digit of the left string and the first digit of the right string of a pair. There was a distance of 1.5 cm between two pairs.\nProcedure. The experiment was carried out with groups of 15 to 20 participants. In the study phase, the participants were provided with the sheet of paper containing the 20 problems. Participants were asked to look for the target digit within each sequence of 20 digits while going through the sequence from left to right. They were informed that the target digit could occur more than once within a sequence. At this point, half of the participants were asked to calculate whether the absolute value of the difference between the two digits following the target digit equaled 3 (i.e., was 3 or 3), a task that entails the processing of two adjacent digits. The other half of the participants were asked to calculate whether the absolute difference between the two digits surrounding the target digit equaled 3, a task that entails the processing of two nonadjacent digits. The two groups had to circle the target and the two digits when this condition was fulfilled (this condition was fulfilled in at least two problems for each participant). The participants were not informed that they would have to perform a recognition test after the study phase. Completing the 20 problems of the study phase usually took less than 10 min.\nAfter this task, the sheets of paper used in the study phase were withdrawn and replaced by those for the recognition test. All of the participants, regardless of the group to which they were assigned, were asked to select which of two strings of three digits was part of the digit sequences viewed in the study phase of the experiment. Participants were told that they had to make a choice for each of the 16 pairs, even if they sometimes felt that they were guessing."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Figure 2 shows the mean percentage of correct responses in the recognition test for items evaluating the learning of adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies as a function of the task performed during the study phase.

Participants who focused on adjacent elements learned adjacent dependencies but did not learn nonadjacent dependencies. As shown in Table 1, this result was expected irrespective of whether contiguity and/or attention is construed as the causal factor. The crucial results concerned the performance of the participants who focused on nonadjacent dependencies. First, it appears that these participants learned nonadjacent dependencies. It is noteworthy that the recognition score of these participants was not significantly lower than the recognition score on adjacent dependencies reached by the participants who focused on adjacent dependencies. As illustrated in Table 1, only a model positing that attention is a necessary and sufficient condition for learning made this prediction. Second, there was no evidence for adjacent dependencies learning when the participants in the nonadjacent dependencies group were not in the attentional focus. This learning failure occurred despite the fact that (a) adjacent dependencies (e.g., 64 for half of the participants) were displayed twice within each problem (and hence 40 times on the whole study phase) and (b) the target searching task ensured that each digit of the sequences was individually processed. This result runs counter to any models focusing on event contiguity, whether contiguity is considered in isolation or in conjunction with attention.\nThus, overall, these results support the idea that the type of dependencies that are learned crucially hinges on the elements on which participants have focused during the study phase to meet the task demand. There was no evidence that the objective adjacency\nof the events in the display played any role in and of itself when attentional factors were controlled.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 explored whether the prior results obtained by the participants asked to process nonadjacent events could be replicated in a still more stringent condition. In summary, each problem used in Experiment 1 included two occurrences of the nonadjacent pairs (e.g., 3X7). However, the task requirement ensured the attentional processing of only one of the two occurrences. For instance, in our example, the target was displayed only once between 3 and 7 within a problem. One may wonder what role, if any, was served by the 3X7 sequence in which X was not the target.\nIn Experiment 2, the problems were the same as those of Experiment 1, except that the nonadjacent dependency occurred only once per problem instead of twice. In this case, the target always served as the intervening event. To prevent any frequency bias in the sequence, the individual digits forming the nonadjacent dependency were nevertheless displayed twice (as any other digits in the 0\u20139 range), but on their second occurrence, they were displayed in random locations in the sequence.\nThe consequences of this change on the statistical properties of the materials are straightforward. Indeed, the change decreased (in fact halved) the frequency of the nonadjacent relations. Moreover, the decoupled presentation of the elements composing the dependency decreased their contingency, and contingency has been shown to be crucial for associative learning (e.g., Perruchet & Peereman, 2004). For instance, each of the digits composing the relevant association may become associated with other digits when they are displayed in isolation, hence generating competition and interference.\nHowever, an attentional theory of associative learning does not predict a difference between Experiments 1 and 2. Indeed, the exposure to the AXC sequence when X is not the target (in\nExperiment 1) should have no positive effect on the learning of the A_C relationships, and likewise, the exposure to the decoupled A and C components (in Experiment 2) should have no detrimental effect, given that, in each case, the joint processing of the A and C elements was not required by the task instructions."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

Their location in the sequence was randomly determined, with a different randomization for each problem and each participant.\nFigure 1c shows three problems, with the adjacent pair 64, which occurred twice; the nonadjacent pair 3X7, which occurred once; and the digits forming the nonadjacent pair (3 and 7) displayed in random locations in the sequence, to prevent any frequency bias."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Figure 3 shows the mean percentage of correct responses on the recognition test for items involving adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies.

First, participants who performed a task leading them to focus on nonadjacent digits learned nonadjacent dependencies. This result was obtained despite the fact that the nonadjacent dependency occurred only once in each problem and despite the decoupled presentation of the digits composing this dependency elsewhere in the sequences. It is worth noting that performances were very close to the corresponding results of Experiment 1,3 in which the nonadjacent dependency occurred twice. This indicates that whether the A and C digits are displayed in their AXC format is inconsequential whenever X is not a target. Second, participants failed to learn adjacent dependencies. Taken together, these results are all the more striking, as nonadjacent dependencies were presented half as frequently as adjacent dependencies. The results strongly strengthen the view that the crucial factor in associative learning is the attentional processing of the stimuli during the study phase and not the objective contiguity of the events.\nExperiment 3\nDo the results reported in Experiments 1 and 2 persist over a transfer procedure? In the prior experiments, the intervening digits in the nonadjacent dependencies used during the test phase were the same as those seen during the study phase. This procedure has been used in prior studies (e.g., Go\u0301mez, 2002) and is commonly considered as providing a valid measure of nonadjacent dependency learning. However, as noted above, we defined nonadjacent dependency learning as the learning of the relation between two events, A and C, irrespective of the intervening events (X). The test used up until now does not fit exactly with this definition, because it is possible that performance improvement is conditioned on the use of the specific intervening events that were seen during the study phase. For instance, the possibility exists that participants simply memorized the AXC strings of digits as a whole, without extracting the A_C relations. To rule out this hypothesis, a transfer situation is needed, in which the X events seen in the test phase differ from the X events seen in the study phase. Prior studies have shown that such a change may have dramatic effects on performance. For instance, in Pen\u0303a et al. (2002), the conditions promoting learning when the same intervening events were used in the study and test phases turned out to be no longer efficient when a transfer test was involved (but see Perruchet et al., 2004).\nIn Experiment 3, we explored the extent to which participants whose task leads them to focus on nonadjacent elements truly learned the association between disjoint elements, irrespective of the intervening events. The study task was the same as in Experiment 2, except that the target of the problems given to a participant could take only three values instead of six; hence, the X events seen in the test phase could differ from the X events seen in the study phase. In the recognition test, the digit intervening between two nonadjacent digits of a legal three-digit string was one of the three digits used as the target in the study phase for half of the test items (familiar test items). In the other half, one of the other three digits that were not used as target in the study phase (transfer test items) served this role. If participants have learned the association between nonadjacent digits irrespective of the digit embedded between these two nonadjacent digits, their performance should remain above chance level for transfer items. By contrast, if participants have simply memorized AXC strings of digits, their performance should be significantly above chance level for the familiar items (as observed in Experiments 1 and 2) but should not differ from chance for transfer items."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

Second, this experiment showed that performance in the test of nonadjacent dependencies remained above chance level when the digit intervening between two nonadjacent digits of a legal three-digit string was not a digit used as a target in the study phase. Even though performance was poorer with these unfamiliar items than with familiar items, this finding provides especially compelling evidence that genuine learning of the A_C relationships occurred in this situation.\nExperiments 4a and 4b\nTaken together, Experiments 1 through 3 show that when participants are faced with stimuli embedding relations between both adjacent and nonadjacent elements, they learn exclusively the type of relation they had to actively process in order to meet the task demands, irrespective of the spatial contiguity of the paired elements. The learning score for nonadjacent dependencies when the task required the processing of adjacent digits (Experiment 1) and, more crucially, the learning score for the adjacent dependencies when the task required the processing of nonadjacent digits (Experiments 1, 2, and 3) were never above chance level.\nA postulate underpinning these experiments was that all individual items are processed. If some items were not actually processed, the observed failure of participants to learn their relations would be trivial. Up until now, we have taken for granted that the processing of all individual items occurred, because participants had to scan the digit strings in order to detect the target. However, this postulate can be challenged.4\nFirst, it is possible that participants quickly discover that each problem includes two, and only two, targets. Once participants have processed the second target, they might stop scanning the digit string to move on to the next one. Note that, although this possibility can hardly be ruled out, its consequences on our line of argumentation would be limited. If participants had decided to stop scanning the sequences after the second target, they would have been exposed to only a part of the materials. However, this remains substantial (namely, two thirds of each digit string, on average, for the digit strings occurring after the point in the session where participants noticed that there were two targets per problem), and it provides an unbiased sample of the whole strings (notably with regard to the type of displayed dependency).\nAnother, a priori more devastating possibility, is that the target pops out from the digit strings, without any of the other digits actually being scanned. This possibility is suggested by experiments in visual-search tasks: Typically, participants are asked to search for a line segment of which the orientation differs from the common orientation of the surrounding distractors. In this situation, the detection time is independent of the number of distractors, a result suggesting that the display was processed at a preattentive level (Treisman & Gelade, 1980).\nAt least two reasons militate against this alternative explanation. First, it has been suggested that the early conclusion according to which the distractors in a standard visual-search task were processed at a preattentive level may have been an overstatement, with a more appropriate conclusion being that they received relatively little attention (e.g., Joseph, Chun, & Nakayama, 1997). Second, our procedure differs strikingly from the standard situations used to investigate the pop-out phenomenon. In particular, in our task, the targets differed from one sequence to the next, and the same digits were used alternatively as target and distractor across trials. This makes the possibility that the nontarget digits were processed at a preattentive level somewhat unlikely (e.g. Ahissar & Hochstein, 1996). However, it remains possible that the digits that were not involved in the subtraction task were processed very cursorily and, crucially, faster than the digits that had to be subtracted from one another. If the amount of time allocated to two task-irrelevant digits was shorter than that allocated to the joint processing of two task-relevant digits, then the relevant factor\ncould be the overall duration of processing rather than the fact of processing jointly, instead of separately, the two events at hand.\nIn two additional experiments, we investigated whether our results could be replicated using a task that ensures a more extensive processing of the items not involved in the subtraction task. Experiments 4a and 4b presented the same problems as in Experiment 3, but the sequence of digits appeared progressively, from left to right, instead of being displayed all at once. In Experiment 4a, the occurrence of each digit was self-paced by participants. In Experiment 4b, the digits appeared sequentially on the computer screen, with a fixed 500-ms interval between each digit. Other changes were minor and were a consequence of the necessary shift from group pencil-and-paper experiments to individual computer-controlled experiments. Notably, participants were now asked to report orally to the experimenter, on each target occurrence, whether the difference between the two digits surrounding the target equaled 3 or 3.\nExperiment 4a"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

Before the study phase, participants were informed that at the beginning of each problem, a digit displayed at the top left of the screen indicated the value of the target for the problem; they were instructed to press the space bar to reveal each digit of a sequence of digits that would appear progressively from left to right, in the middle of the screen. The participants were told that when the digit displayed after a keystroke was revealed to be a target, they would have to calculate whether the difference between the two digits surrounding the target equaled 3 or 3. Participants were asked to provide their answer orally (yes or no; note that before responding, participants had to press the key once more to reveal the digit situated on the right of the target). Finally, as in prior experiments, participants were informed that the target digit could occur more than once within a sequence. At the end of each problem, a message invited participants to press the space bar to proceed to the next problem.\n4 We thank Brian Scholl and two anonymous reviewers of a draft of this article for drawing our attention to this problem.\nOnce the 20 problems of the study phase were completed, participants performed the recognition test. They were instructed to select which of two strings of three digits was among the digit sequences viewed in the study phase of the experiment. As in prior experiments, participants were told that they had to make a choice for each of the 16 pairs, even if they sometimes felt that they were guessing. They were to press the Q key of the (French) AZERTY keyboard if they felt that the correct answer was the string on the left and the M key if they felt that the correct answer was the string on the right. The screen was cleared immediately after the participant\u2019s keystroke, and there was a 2-s delay before the presentation of the following pair.

As in Experiment 3, the recognition scores for the test items embedding the nonadjacent dependency were significantly above chance, even when the intermediary digits were not seen in the training phase. However, the difference in performance according to whether the intermediary digits of the test items were seen or not seen during training was somewhat inconsistent across experiments. Although this difference never reached significance, Experiment 4a tended to replicate the transfer decrement observed in Experiment 3, whereas the trend was reversed in Experiment 4b. Given that the only difference between Experiments 4a and 4b concerned the fact that the successive appearance of the digits was self-paced and computer-paced, respectively, this discrepancy is hardly interpretable. It is likely that the apparent reversal of the transfer decrement in Experiment 4b\u2014namely, descriptively better performance in the transfer than in the familiar situation\u2014should be attributed to noise in the data. Note that other studies in the implicit learning domain have also reported discordant results regarding the transfer decrement effect.\nConsidering the learning of an invariant as an example, we note that the use of transfer in place of familiar test stimuli in prior research usually has yielded no significant effect (e.g., McGeorge & Burton, 1990). However, both poorer (Stadler, Warren, & Lesch, 2000) and better (Newell & Bright, 2002, p. 1110) performance in transfer, as compared with familiar, situations occasionally has been reported.\nThe procedural changes introduced in Experiments 4a and 4b were devised to increase the amount of attentional processing devoted to the individual nontarget digits, which included those forming the adjacent dependency. These changes were intended to test our hypothesis that even adjacent relations are not learned when the task does not require the joint processing of the relevant elements, even though the duration of exposure to individual elements is controlled. The results were clear-cut: There was no evidence of learning in either experiment, even at a descriptive level. It is worth stressing, however, that we controlled the objective duration of the visual displays and not the amount of time actually allocated by the participants to the active processing of those displays. It remains possible that processing duration varies despite the equalized duration of objective exposure. A posteriori control over the actual processing engaged by the participants should be carried out in future studies, perhaps with eye-tracking measures. If eye-tracking measures reveal a sizable disproportion in the duration of processing allocated to the different items, then ruling out the hypothesis that the amount of processing time is a causal factor would certainly require a more radical change in the experimental procedure.\nGeneral Discussion"}, {"heading": "A Summary of Results", "text": "Participants who were asked to process adjacent elements learned adjacent dependencies but did not learn nonadjacent de-\npendencies. As shown in Table 1, this pattern of results does not discriminate among the predictions of different theories. Indeed, this was expected irrespective of whether contiguity or attention is construed as the causal factor. The performance of the participants who processed nonadjacent digits to fulfill the task requirements was much more informative. Two main results emerged.\nFirst, there was no evidence for adjacent dependency learning in the participants processing nonadjacent digits. This learning failure occurred despite the fact that (a) in each of the five reported experiments, adjacent dependencies were presented 40 times over the course of the entire study phase and (b) the target searching task ensured the individual processing of each digit of the sequences. Although processing may have been somewhat limited in the first three experiments, in which the digit strings were displayed as a whole, the digit-by-digit presentation of the problems used for Experiments 4a and 4b prompted a more extensive processing of each item.\nSecond, participants processing nonadjacent dependencies for meeting the task demand learned them in five independent experiments. It is noteworthy that the participants\u2019 recognition score was not significantly lower than the recognition score for adjacent dependencies reached by the participants who focused on adjacent dependencies in Experiment 1. This remained true when nonadjacent dependencies were displayed twice less frequently than adjacent dependencies in Experiment 2. Experiments 3, 4a, and 4b, showed that performance was also above chance level in a transfer test, in which the intervening events were changed between the study phase and the test phase. Performance was lower when the intervening events were changed between the study phase and the test phase than when the same intervening events were used in both phases in Experiment 3, although Experiments 4a and 4b showed no significant difference (and contradictory trends) according to whether the intervening items in the test were old or new.\nAs shown in Table 1, this pattern of results is only consistent with the attention-based theory of associative learning outlined in the introduction, which posits that selective attention is a necessary and sufficient condition for learning to occur. In this discussion, we first elaborate further on this theory and how it may be articulated with the extant literature on learning. Next, we focus on the sense in which our study and the theoretical conclusions it supports concern implicit, rather than explicit, forms of learning. Finally, we outline some of the problems that arise when attempting to apply the theory to specific domains, such as language, music, and visual perception."}, {"heading": "An Attentional Account of Adjacent and Nonadjacent Dependency Learning", "text": "The failure to observe learning of adjacent dependencies when the instructions drew participants\u2019 attention toward nonadjacent dependencies provides new support for the models of learning positing that attention is a necessary condition for learning to occur. The earlier accounts of conditioning (e.g., Guthrie, 1930) focused exclusively on the contiguity of the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (CS and US, respectively). However, further studies made it obvious that the repeated exposure to a pair of contiguous events is not sufficient to trigger associative learning. The well-documented effect of blocking (Kamin, 1968) illustrates\nthis point. In the first phase of a blocking experiment, a CS, namely A, is followed by a US. In the second phase, A is always followed by the same US, but it is systematically presented with another cue, B. The phenomenon of blocking designates the fact that the relation between B and the US is not learned in those conditions, or at least is not learned to the same extent as if B had been associated with the US in standard conditions. In other words, the contiguity of B and the outcome is not sufficient for learning to occur. The phenomenon is important in and of itself but also because it provides a simple explanation for other, apparently more complex, phenomena. For instance, Rescorla (1968) showed that adding an unpaired US during training decreased conditioning, although the level of contiguity (i.e., the number of CS\u2013US pairings) was kept constant. This result was initially conceived of as a demonstration that animals are able to assess the genuine contingency between events. However, a few years later, Rescorla and Wagner (1972) suggested that the phenomenon of blocking could account for the results of Rescorla (1968), because the unpaired occurrences of the US elicit conditioning to some background stimuli, which in turn, blocks the conditioning to the experimental CS.\nOf special interest for our concern, the phenomenon of blocking has been accounted for by a framework based on attention (Mackintosh, 1975). The relation between B and the outcome is not processed attentionally, it was argued, because the predictive value of A captures all of the learner\u2019s available attention. Associative blocking, and a few other related phenomena, such as the CS preexposure effect (Lubow, 1989) and, more recently, highlighting (Kruschke, 2001), have led contemporary researchers to emphasize the crucial role of attention in associative learning and to elaborate various attention-based models (see Kruschke, 2003, 2005).\nThe need for learners\u2019 attentional involvement has been confirmed by a number of studies in other experimental arrangements as well. In recent research on implicit learning, for instance (see Perruchet, in press; Perruchet & Pacton, 2006; Shanks, 2005, for reviews), the principle of these studies consists of adding a concurrent secondary task during the training session, then observing whether performance improvement is equivalent to that observed in a single-task, standard procedure. With regard to artificial grammars, Dienes, Broadbent, and Berry (1991) demonstrated that the accuracy of grammaticality judgments was lowered when participants had to perform a concurrent random number generation task during the familiarization phase. The studies carried out on dynamic system control tasks provide a more contrasting picture. The theory surrounding the early studies on these tasks posited a distinction between two forms of learning: selective (i.e., with attention) and unselective (i.e., without attention; e.g., Berry & Broadbent, 1988), and some initial studies seemingly supported this view. However, subsequent studies (e.g., Green & Shanks, 1993) failed to replicate earlier results despite extensive attempts to do so and found that, as a rule, the secondary task impaired performance irrespective of the complexity of the task. A similar story happened with serial reaction time tasks, with a few initial studies (e.g., A. Cohen, Ivry, & Keele, 1990) claiming that nonattentional learning is efficient for the simplest forms of sequential dependencies. The secondary task typically used in this context is a tone-counting task, in which a high- or low-pitched tone sound is emitted after each trial, and participants are required to keep a\nrunning count of one of them (e.g., high-pitched tones). Performance in these conditions typically remains above chance. However, observing performance improvement under dual-task conditions does not imply the existence of a nonattentional form of learning, because the secondary task may not deplete the attentional resources completely. As claimed by Stadler (1995), \u201ceven when implicit serial learning is observed in conjunction with the tone-counting task, . . . it cannot be said that learning occurred without attentional capacity\u2014the participants certainly devoted attention to the serial RT task\u201d (p. 683). Closing their survey of the role of attention in implicit sequence learning, Hsiao and Reber (1998) concluded, \u201cWe view sequence learning as occurring in the background of the residual attention after the cost of the tonecounting task and the key-pressing task. If there is still sufficient attention available to the encoding of the sequence, learning will be successful; otherwise, failure will result\u201d (p. 487; for other approaches that emphasize the role of attention, see Frensch et al., 1994; Jimenez & Mendez, 1999).\nThe role played by selective attention in acquisition processes also has been identified in, for instance, the literature on automatisms (e.g., Fisk & Schneider, 1984), covariation learning (Hoffman & Sebald, 2005), word segmentation (Toro, Sinnett, & SotoFaraco, 2005), visual perception (e.g., Baker, Olson, & Behrmann, 2004; Turk-Browne et al., 2005), contextual cueing (Jiang & Chun, 2001; Jiang & Leung, 2005), and memory (e.g., Roediger, 1990). This contention holds even for the so-called implicit memory phenomena, in which performance does not involve the recollection of the initial episodes. There is now overwhelming evidence that attention to the material at the time of encoding is a necessary condition for the observation of improved performance in subsequent implicit memory tests, such as word completion and perceptual identification tasks (e.g., Crabb & Dark, 1999), reading tasks (MacDonald & MacLeod, 1998), and object decision tasks (Ganor-Stern, Seamon, & Carrasco, 1998).\nAs noted in the introduction, however, acknowledging the necessity of attention in learning does not provide, as such, an account for nonadjacent dependency learning. In all of the studies evoked above, the conditions of contiguity are met, and hence their results are compatible with the claim that associative learning requires both the contiguity of events and the learner\u2019s attention. To account for nonadjacent dependency learning, learners\u2019 attentional involvement needs to be construed as a sufficient condition. This proposal is consonant with the position taken by several authors, who have construed associative learning as an automatic process that associates all the components that are simultaneously present in the attentional focus (Frensch & Miner, 1994; Logan & Etherton, 1994; Perruchet & Vinter, 2002; Stadler, 1995; Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Our result that participants learned nonadjacent dependencies when asked to process them provides a striking confirmation of this view. The objective adjacency of the events in the display would play no role in itself when attentional factors are controlled. Indeed, when contiguity and attentional processing were pitted against each other, there was no residual role for contiguity. The relation between two nonadjacent events can be learned whenever there is some reason for processing the two events jointly.\nPrior studies also showed the possibility of learning nonadjacent dependencies, but only when the to-be-learned material possessed specific properties, such as a high variability of the X events (e.g.,\nGo\u0301mez, 2002), a high level of similarity between A and C events (e.g., Onnis et al., 2005), or the presence of pauses between the AXC sequences (Pen\u0303a et al., 2002). On the basis of those results, one could argue that this form of learning requires quite specific conditions, which are qualitatively different from the conditions required to learn adjacent relations. We suggest, instead, as noted in the introduction, that such variables could be effective because they facilitate the attentional processing of the relevant events. Our demonstration that participants\u2019 performance may change drastically as a function of task instructions, while the objective properties of the material are kept constant, provides especially strong evidence for this interpretation of the earlier literature."}, {"heading": "Attention and Implicitness", "text": "The fact that our procedure involved a manipulation of participants\u2019 attentional allocation through the instructions they received could suggest that we actually contrasted incidental and intentional learning. In this account, learning either adjacent or nonadjacent dependencies would be possible only when participants intentionally search for those regularities. It is worth stressing that this is not our intended conclusion. Although we have no concerns with the claim that such learning can result from an analytic, explicit search, we were interested in the possibility of learning in incidental conditions, in keeping with the current focus of most learning researchers. Was our procedure actually well-suited to meeting this objective?\nOur task was nominally incidental because, although the task involved the joint attentional processing of two digits, the instructions required neither a search for the repeated occurrences of some pairs of digits nor the explicit memorization of those digits. Beyond the instructions, however, it is important to examine whether participants could have shifted themselves to a strategy of memorization. A reasonable assumption is that participants could have done so if they had some reason to believe that learning the digits would help them to perform the task demands, which primarily consisted of detecting the target among an array of distractors. In fact, this is not the case because the repeated patterns provided a quite unreliable cue for the presence of a target. One of the two repeated patterns was never associated with the target (e.g., the adjacent dependencies for participants dealing with nonadjacent digits). Moreover, even if one restricts the analysis to the repeated pattern with which participants dealt while performing the task, half of the occurrences of this pattern happened without the target and half of the targets occurred outside this pattern. As a consequence, a strategy consisting of searching for this pattern in order to guide target detection would lead to missing half of the targets and to having attention drawn toward an irrelevant part of the strings in half of the cases. All of these characteristics make it quite unlikely that participants were engaged in an explicit search of the statistical regularities of the digit sequences.\nThe discussion above makes it clear that learning was certainly implicit in the sense that it was incidental. It is worth adding that we do not claim that the resulting knowledge of the dependencies was implicit in the sense that it was unavailable to consciousness. Although the possibility that some form of knowledge may affect performance without being available to consciousness cannot be ruled out, several authors have emphasized the lack of empirical support for such a claim (for reviews, see, e.g., Dulany, 1997;\nShanks & St. John, 1994). Irrespective of this possibility, restricting a priori the manifestation of implicit learning to some uninformed guessing, similar in some ways to the vague feeling elicited in subliminal perception, appears to be unproductively restrictive and to leave behind the most important expressions of implicit learning in real-world settings. We subscribe here to the view that implicit learning processes primarily shape conscious percepts and representations (e.g., Perruchet & Vinter, 2002; Perruchet, Vinter, & Gallego, 1997). In keeping with this position, we measured learning through a forced-choice recognition test, which is traditionally construed as an explicit test. Note that this measure can hardly be conceived of as a departure from the current practice in implicit learning research. For instance, all of the studies on word segmentation following the seminal articles of Saffran and collaborators (Saffran et al., 1996; e.g., Newport & Aslin, 2004; Onnis et al., 2005) have also used a forced-choice recognition test to assess learning. To our best knowledge, this procedure has never been construed as preventing the consensual embodiment of this literature within the context of implicit learning research (for a review, see Perruchet & Pacton, 2006)."}, {"heading": "Questions for Further Research", "text": "A theory of associative learning positing that joint attention on the relevant events is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for learning associations provides a forceful argument for extending the relevance of associative learning principles to complex domains, such as natural language, music, and object perception. Indeed, the theory allows us to account for the learning of remote dependencies, which occur routinely in those domains, while avoiding the apparently intractable problem of combinatorial explosion, given that the number of possible associations to be scrutinized grows exponentially with the number of authorized intervening events. The problem, in principle, is avoided here because potential associations are preselected by attentional mechanisms.\nHowever, a gap remains to be bridged between theory and the potential domains of application. The main problem concerns the question of the features that are able to capture attention in each domain. Certainly, attention may be guided by explicit instructions, as in the experiments described above. However, this cannot be considered a general solution. At best, explicit instructions can play a role in supervised learning, but they cannot account for the much more frequent situations in which people learn from their own experience, without instructional guidance. Of course, a number of environmental features are known to be naturally prone to capturing attention. This is the case of certain acoustic properties of language or music, or visual features such as movement. However, for the explanation to be viable, those features should have a high chance of guiding attention toward the relevant events. The deep issue is, then, Why should those features be a priori relevant? Why, for instance, should the acoustic and prosodic cues that are most predisposed to capturing attention in language utterances provide a guide toward the relevant aspects of the language, given that those aspects are presumably syntactic or semantic in nature?\nAlthough this issue stands out of the scope of this article, we submit that two general, and nonexclusive, responses may be put forth. The first solution consists of invoking innateness: Evolution would have made us sensitive to some specific features of our environment because of their relevance for adaptive purposes. Another solution,\nwhich applies only to those aspects that are a product of human culture, with language as the main target, relies on the concept of reversed evolution. Instead of positing that the human species has evolved to deal with complex linguistic structures, it is possible to conceive that language has evolved to be learned by humans, given the general abilities they have developed in response to adaptive constraints preceding language appearance (Newport, 1990). Further research is needed to deepen these issues."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The detection of remote dependencies represents an apparent challenge for a framework based on associative or statistical mechanisms. Indeed, most of the literature on associative learning has focused on adjacent dependencies, whereas there is evidence that higher cognitive activities, such as language, music, and object perception, also exploit the existence of nonadjacent dependencies in their material. We have provided experimental support for an associative learning model positing attention as a necessary and sufficient condition, which accounts for both adjacent and nonadjacent dependency learning in the very same terms.\nReferences\nAhissar, M., & Hochstein, S.

Jiang Harvard University and University of Minnesota\nGiven a changing visual environment, and the limited capacity of visual working memory (VWM), the contents of VWM must be in constant flux. Using a change detection task, the authors show that VWM is subject to obligatory updating in the face of new information. Change detection performance is enhanced when the item that may change is retrospectively cued 1 s after memory encoding and 0.5 s before testing. The retro-cue benefit cannot be explained by memory decay or by a reduction in interference from other items held in VWM. Rather, orienting attention to a single memory item makes VWM more resistant to interference from the test probe. The authors conclude that the content of VWM is volatile unless it receives focused attention, and that the standard change detection task underestimates VWM capacity.\nKeywords: visual working memory, visual attention, memory decay, memory interference, change detection\nIn a classic study, Sperling (1960) flashed an array of letters in three rows and four columns and asked his participants to recall the letters. He found that participants could report about four to five letters, even though they had a subjective impression that more letters were available immediately after display offset. Sperling then used a partial-report procedure in which participants were cued by an auditory beep to report a randomly selected row, signified by the pitch of the beep. If the beep was played right when the letters disappeared, participants usually could report nearly all the letters from the cued row, suggesting that they indeed had immediate access to a large number of letters. If the beep was played after a delay of 500 ms or so, reports for a given row reduced greatly, resulting in an estimate of about 1.5 letters per row. This study was instrumental to cognitive research. First, it revealed the presence of a high-capacity iconic memory (Neisser, 1967) that dissipates within half a second or so. After the memory dissipates, information is stored in visual or verbal short-term memory, which is relatively stable over time. Second, it showed that the testing procedure can significantly influence the estimation of memory capacity. Partial report is superior to whole report if memory degrades during the testing process. The degradation may arise from simple decay of information, as is the case in the\noriginal Sperling study, or it may arise from interference, as is the case in a later study in which a visual probe at the location of the original memory item induced backward masking (Averbach & Coriell, 1961).\nAlthough Sperling\u2019s (1960) study is now a classic in textbook materials, recent research on visual working memory (VWM) has reverted back to the use of whole-report procedures to probe memory capacity. VWM buffers visual information for a few seconds after its disappearance. It is used frequently in everyday visual tasks, such as crossing a busy street, speaking to a large audience, or playing in team sports. It is considered to be more robust than iconic memory. To measure the capacity of VWM, most studies use the standard change detection task (Rensink, 2002), in which an array of visual objects is first presented for memory encoding. After a retention interval of 1 s or so, a probe array of objects is shown, which may be either the same as the memory array or different in one object. Accuracy to report the presence or absence of a change at different memory loads is used to estimate VWM capacity (Pashler, 1988; Phillips, 1974). There are reasons why the whole-report procedure has been standard practice in VWM studies. First, revising the procedure into a partial-report procedure has not revealed a consistent advantage. For example, if a single test probe is shown, accuracy can sometimes be worse than when the whole-array probe is shown, perhaps because the single probe eliminates retrieval context (Jiang, Olson, & Chun, 2000). Second, adding a partial-report cue to the entire probe array, such as flagging out one of the test objects as the relevant comparison object, often leads to no improvement in comparison with the whole-array condition (Luck & Vogel, 1997). The partial-report procedure can sometimes be advantageous, particularly when the array is complex and the comparison process across the entire array is laborious (Hollingworth, 2003).

This characterization has contributed to the proposed function of VWM as a bridge across temporal discontinuities and as a mechanism for mentally manipulating visual information after its disappearance (Courtney, Petit, Haxby, & Ungerleider, 1998). In light of these findings, it is perplexing that some recent studies have revealed a partial-report advantage (Griffin & Nobre, 2003; Landman, Spekreijse, & Lamme, 2003; Lepsien, Griffin, Devlin, & Nobre, 2005; Lepsien & Nobre, 2007; Makovski & Jiang, 2007). For example, Landman et al. (2003) presented a partialreport cue\u2014a centrally presented arrow that pointed at the location of one of the eight memory items\u2014and asked participants to judge whether the cued item matched a test probe that followed the partial-report cue. Unlike the cues used in earlier studies (Averbach & Coriell, 1961; Sperling, 1960), the partial-report cue was delivered long after the memory array had disappeared,1 so it could not have salvaged the cued item from iconic memory or from the transition between iconic memory and VWM (Vogel, Woodman, & Luck, 2006). This procedure was otherwise similar to the other partial-report procedures used in previous VWM studies, in which only a single memorized item needed to be compared with the test\nprobe. However, with this procedure, Landman et al. found a significant benefit of the partial-report cue that was not observed in other VWM partial-report procedures. Similarly, Griffin and Nobre (2003) found that if observers were allowed to orient attention to a single item in VWM prior to the onset of the probe array, they performed better than if the orienting cue was absent. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the whole-report procedure and several partial-report procedures used in VWM studies.\nWhy does the partial-report cue enhance performance in Landman et al.\u2019s (2003) procedure but not in other procedures? First, the memory retention interval is different. Although the interval between the initial memory display and the final test display is 1,600 ms in all conditions shown in Figure 1, the partial-report cue is delivered in the middle of that interval in Landman et al.\u2019s procedure. If observers start using the cue right away, then the effective retention interval\u2014that from memory display offset to the refreshing of the cued item\u2014is shorter in Landman et al.\u2019s study than in the other procedures. If VWM decays during that time (the memory decay hypothesis), then performance in the whole-report procedure should be worse than that in the retro-cue procedure.\nSecond, the cuing procedure used in Landman et al.\u2019s (2003) study may be particularly effective at directing focused attention to the critical item in VWM. The act of attending to the critical item reduces the relevant memory load. This can enhance performance\n1 The timing of the partial-report cue delivery was 2\u201312 s in Lepsien et al. (2005).\nfor the following reasons. First, it may restrict the comparison between memory and probe to a single comparison (the simplifiedcomparison hypothesis) and eliminate the need to exhaustively compare every probe item with the corresponding memory item. Consequently, any change blindness originating from a comparison failure or decision noise is reduced (Hollingworth, 2003; Simons, Chabris, Schnur, & Levin, 2002). Second, multiple memory items may compete for memory resources and suppress each other\u2019s representation (Bahcall & Kowler, 1999). Directing attention to a single memory item can release the interference from other memory items (interitem interference), enhancing memory performance of the critical item. Third, when attention is broadly distributed across multiple memory items, memory for these items may be labile and may be overwritten by the probe array. Focusing attention on a critical memory item solidifies its memory, making it more resistant to interference from the probe array (the probe interference hypothesis). These three sources of enhancement will be jointly referred to as the attentional enhancement hypothesis.\nThe current study focuses on the retro-cue advantage in measuring VWM. We are interested in this effect because if confirmed, it can potentially change the way VWM is conceptualized. It would suggest that the contents of VWM are not static but can degrade over time or with delivery of new stimuli. The following experiments are designed to test which of the hypotheses laid out above best account for the cuing benefit\u2014henceforth referred to as the retro-cue benefit (Griffin & Nobre, 2003; Landman et al., 2003; Lepsien et al., 2005; Makovski & Jiang, 2007).2 It is important to note that the different hypotheses need not be mutually exclusive. It is possible that VWM is sensitive to decay, to the complexity of memory probe comparison, to interference from the other items in memory, and to interference from the probe. Our experiments are designed to test which combination of these hypotheses best accounts for the effect. Experiment 1 distinguishes between the decay and the broader attentional enhancement hypotheses. Experiments 2 and 3 will address the different forms of the attentional enhancement hypothesis.\nExperiment 1\nThis experiment aims to test the memory decay hypothesis by eliminating differences in retention intervals across conditions. If the retro-cue benefit remains, then the decay hypothesis can be largely ruled out. Our experiment is unique in several respects. First, participants completed the task under articulatory suppression. On each trial they quickly rehearsed a prespecified word out loud to reduce verbal recoding (Baddeley, 1986). Second, we tried to equate the duration of memory retention by keeping constant the interval between the initial encoding and the memory refreshing. In the retro-cue condition, after an initial memory array and a blank retention interval of 1 s, a central arrow cue was presented for 100 ms, pointing to the location of a memory item that might later change. Assuming that participants started to refresh their VWM of the target item upon the onset of the cue, the effective memory retention interval would be 1,000 ms. The probe array was further delayed by 400 ms, such that the interstimulus interval (ISI) between memory and probe arrays was 1,500 ms. In the simultaneous-cue condition, after the initial memory array and a blank retention interval of 1 s, the probe array along with a central arrow cue was presented, pointing to the critical item that might\nchange. The effective retention interval was also 1,000 ms, but the ISI between memory and probe arrays was 500 ms shorter than in the retro-cue condition, so any advantage in the retro-cue condition cannot be accounted for by differences in retention interval. Finally, in the no-cue condition, the trial sequence was the same as in the simultaneous-cue condition except that the central arrow was absent. Figure 2 illustrates a schematic trial sequence used in the three different conditions. Note that the no-cue condition was essentially a whole-report procedure, whereas the other two conditions were both partial-report procedures, with the retro-cue condition being similar to Landman et al.\u2019s (2003) method.\nExperiment 1 went beyond a simple replication of a retro-cue benefit. We also tested whether the effect was seen when the memory and probe arrays did not overlap in screen locations (Griffin & Nobre 2003; Lepsien et al., 2005). Specifically, items on the probe array might occupy the same screen locations as items on the memory display, or they might occupy locations that were 1.5 times expanded toward the periphery. As noted in the introduction, one explanation of the retro-cue benefit can be found in the probe interference account, which states that VWM is vulnerable to interference from subsequent visual input unless attention has already focused on the critical memory. This account does not specify whether or not interference from the probe array is screen based. If it is, expanding the probe array should reduce interference on VWM, and consequently the no-cue and simultaneous-cue performance should improve to match that of the retro-cue.\nFinally, Experiment 1 tested both color VWM and shape VWM to ensure that the same pattern of results holds for different memory tasks. Because VWM for color is typically better than VWM for shape (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004; Eng, Chen, & Jiang, 2005), we used different memory loads for the two tasks (six colors and four shapes)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Participants tested in this study were volunteers from Harvard University and its community. They provided informed consent and received one course credit or $10/hr. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal color vision. They ranged from 18 to 31 years old. There were 18 participants in Experiment 1.\nEquipment. Participants were tested individually in a room with normal interior lighting. They sat approximately 57 cm away from a 19 computer monitor. The experiment was programmed with psychophysical toolbox software (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) implemented in MATLAB, which can be accessed at the following website: http://www.mathworks.com.\nMaterials and trial sequence. On each trial, six unique color disks (diameter 1.31\u00b0) and four unique novel shapes (1.31\u00b0) were placed equidistantly on an imaginary circle (radius 4.92\u00b0) centered at fixation. The background of the display was black. The number of items was selected to exceed the conventional VWM capacity (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004; Luck & Vogel, 1997). Colors were selected randomly from nine different colors, and\n2 Following Griffin and Nobre\u2019s (2003) terminology, we used \u201cretrocue\u201d to capture the retrospective nature of the cue in bringing to mind information that has disappeared. This term is sometimes contrasted with \u201cpre-cue,\u201d which precedes memory encoding (Makovski & Jiang, 2007).\nshapes were selected from 10 novel shapes (Shuman & Kanwisher, 2004). The memory display was presented for 300 ms and followed by a blank retention interval of 1,000 ms. In the retro-cue condition, a central white arrow (1.44\u00b0 in length) was presented for 100 ms, followed by a blank interval of 400 ms, before the presentation of the probe array. In the simultaneous-cue condition, after the 1,000-ms blank interval, the central arrow was presented simultaneously with the probe array for 100 ms, after which only the probe array remained. The probe array contained six colors or four shapes placed equidistantly on an imaginary circle whose radius was either the same as the memory array or 1.5 times greater, creating an overlapped condition and an expanded condition, respectively. Finally, in the no-cue condition, the presentation sequence was the same as that of the simultaneous-cue condition, except that the central arrow was absent.\nIn all conditions, participants were told to determine whether the probe array was identical to the memory array or whether one of the items had changed color (in the color blocks) or shape (in the shape blocks) by pressing the S key for \u201csame\u201d and the D key for \u201cdifferent.\u201d They were told that when the central arrow cue was presented, it was always 100% valid, in that items not cued would never change. Participants were also informed that if a change occurred to the cued item, which happened 50% of time, it would be a new color (or shape) not presented on the memory array. Participants were free to move their eyes.\nDesign. In both the color and shape tasks, we used a 3 2 2 design with cue condition (retro-cue, simultaneous cue, or no cue), spatial relation (overlapped or expanded), and item change (present or absent) manipulated orthogonally. There were 240 trials in color VWM and 240 trials in shape VWM. Half of the\nparticipants completed the color task first, while the other half completed the shape task first. Trials within the color (or shape) task were randomly intermixed in presentation order. Unlike accuracy, speed of response was not emphasized.\nArticulatory suppression. To minimize verbal recoding, participants were required to rehearse out loud a three-letter word as quickly as they could throughout a block of trials. The word they had to rehearse was specified at the beginning of each block of 48 trials.\nData analysis. In this experiment and subsequent ones, we calculated the percentage of correct responses, d , and A (Grier, 1971; MacMillan & Creelman, 2004). Because statistical results were the same for all indices, we report only the percentage of correct presses. A results and mean reaction time (RT) for correct responses for all three Experiments are listed in Tables A1, A2, and A3 the Appendix."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Figure 3 plots the mean accuracy for the color and shape tasks separately. In both tasks, even when articulatory suppression was used and the effective interval between encoding and retrieval was comparable across conditions, accuracy in the retro-cue condition was still significantly higher than that in the simultaneous-cue and no-cue conditions, replicating Landman et al.\u2019s (2003) results.\nA repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on cue condition (retro-cue, simultaneous cue, or no cue) and spatial relation (overlapped vs. expanded) revealed a significant main effect of cue condition in accuracy: for color VWM, F(2, 34) 19.87, p .001, and for shape VWM, F(2, 34) 8.63, p .001.\nThe retro-cue condition was significantly more accurate than the simultaneous-cue condition: in color VWM, F(1, 17) 11.18, p .004, and in shape VWM, F(1, 17) 9.13, p .006. Similarly, the retro-cue condition was significantly more accurate than the nocue condition: in color VWM, F(1, 17) 43.78, p .001, and in shape VWM, F(1, 17) 11.84, p .001. The presentation of a cue simultaneously with the test display also conveyed a significant advantage in comparison with no-cue trials in color VWM, F(1, 17) 7.81, p .02, but not in shape VWM, F 1. This advantage may be related to simplified memory comparison: With a cue, participants only needed to make one comparison; without a cue, they needed to make multiple comparisons (Hollingworth, 2003). This advantage was more significant for color VWM than for shape VWM, perhaps because we used different set sizes for color and shape tasks (i.e., without a cue, participants may need to make six comparisons in color VWM and only four comparisons in shape VWM).\nThe above analyses combined data across overlapped and expanded test conditions. Was there any difference between overlapping and expanded test displays? The ANOVA test showed that there was not: The main effect of the memory\u2013test spatial relationship was not significant in either color VWM, F(1, 17) 1.66, p .20, or shape VWM, F 1. Neither did this factor interact with cue conditions: for color VWM, F(2, 34) 1.34, p .25, and for shape VWM, F 1. Simple t tests showed that the advantage of a retro-cue over a simultaneous cue and no cue held for color VWM as well as for shape VWM, both when the probe array overlapped with the memory array, t(17) 2.71, ps .02, and when the probe array was expanded and spatially not overlapping with the memory array, t(17) 2.21, ps .05.\nThe retro-cue not only enhanced accuracy but also sped up RT (see the Appendix for RT data). Even though the task instruction emphasized accuracy and not RT, participants were faster making a same\u2013different judgment when the cue was presented before the probe array than when it was presented simultaneously with the probe array. This facilitation was seen for both the overlapped displays and the expanded displays. The facilitation was on the order of 150 ms (retro-cue vs. simultaneous cue) and has also been\nseen in other studies (Griffin & Nobre, 2003; Makovski & Jiang, 2007). Because results from RT are generally consistent with those from accuracy (or A ), we will no longer present RT in later experiments."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Experiment 1 showed that performance in a VWM task, as measured by change detection, differed significantly for different testing procedures. In comparison with a whole-report procedure in which participants matched an entire probe array with their memory, a partial-report procedure can lead to better performance, but only under certain conditions. When the cue that narrowed the whole report into a partial report was delivered simultaneously with the probe array, it did not consistently facilitate performance. But when the cue preceded the probe array by 500 ms, it enhanced performance in comparison with the whole-report procedure. These results held whether the memory array and the probe array overlapped in screen locations or did not overlap, suggesting that the potential interference from the probe array is not screen or viewer based.\nThe findings from Experiment 1 departed from many previous studies on the partial-report procedure, primarily in the timing of the partial-report cue. In classic studies on iconic memory, the partial-report cue was delivered immediately after the offset of the memory display, allowing participants to extract information from iconic memory (Averbach & Coriell, 1961; Becker, Pashler, & Anstis, 2000; Sperling, 1960). In more recent studies on the consolidation of information into VWM, Vogel et al. (2006) also used a cue that trailed the memory display by less than 500 ms, salvaging iconic memory or enhancing the transition between iconic memory and VWM. In contrast, in Experiment 1 the cue was delivered 1,000 ms after the initial memory encoding, when iconic memory had decayed (Dilollo, 1980).\nThe retro-cue advantage shown in Experiment 1 cannot be accounted for by a simple memory decay hypothesis. We equated the interval between encoding and the refreshing of VWM across different conditions. Indeed, the ISI between the memory and\nprobe displays was longer in the retro-cue condition than in the other conditions, so one could not explain the retro-cue benefit as reflecting less decay of VWM in the retro-cue condition than in the other conditions.\nExperiment 2\nWhy does focusing attention on the critical memory item enhance VWM performance? There are several possibilities. The simplest possibility is that cuing simplified the memory probe comparison process. Instead of a comparison of each probe item with each memory item at the corresponding locations, cuing simplified the process to a single comparison. The simplified comparison reduces decision noise inherent to an exhaustive comparison task and reduces the kind of change blindness from a failure to compare (Hollingworth, 2003; Simons et al., 2002). Earlier studies had used the simultaneous-cue condition to try to rule out the simplified-comparison hypothesis. However, there are several reasons why participants may have not effectively used the simultaneous cue. First, the cue is less salient when presented concurrently with the probe array, so comparison across the whole array may have already started before the cue was used. Second, the presentation of the entire probe array provides a retrieval context that may have encouraged participants to do a whole-array comparison rather than a single-item comparison (Jiang et al., 2000).\nTo test whether attentional cue enhances performance by simplifying the comparison process, in Experiment 2 we simplified the\ncomparison process in all conditions by eliminating irrelevant items on the probe display. Figure 4 shows four conditions tested in this experiment. In all conditions the probe display contained a single test object. Participants\u2019 task was to determine whether this object was the same as or different from the memory object shown previously in the same location. Because only a single comparison needs to be made, the simplified-comparison account predicted that the retro-cue should no longer enhance performance."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Fifteen new participants from the same general subject pool as that described for Experiment 1 completed Experiment 2.\nMaterials. Similar to Experiment 1, we tested color VWM and shape VWM, but this time we randomly intermixed color and shape trials to further remove strategic differences between the two tasks. Memory load was six for color VWM and four for shape VWM. The initial memory display was presented for 1,000 ms to ensure adequate encoding time (Eng et al., 2005).\nDesign and procedure. In both color and shape VWM tasks, we orthogonally manipulated whether or not there was a retro-cue presented 500 ms before the probe display (retro-cue vs. no retrocue) and whether or not there was a central arrow cue presented simultaneously with the probe display (simultaneous cue vs. no simultaneous cue). With this design we can separate the effects of a retro-cue preceding the probe display from the effects of a simultaneous cue presented concurrently with the probe display.\nFigure 4 shows a schematic illustration of the four conditions. The design was otherwise similar to Experiment 1\u2019s overlapped conditions, except that the probe display contained only a single probe object that always coincided with the location of the critical memory item. Participants were asked to press the S key if the probe object was the same as the memory object at that location before or to press the D key if it was not the same.\nEach participant completed 320 experimental trials, divided randomly and evenly into different conditions: 2 tasks (color or shape) 2 retro-cues (present vs. absent) 2 simultaneous cues (present vs. absent) 2 item changes (present vs. absent) 20 cases.

The presentation of a central arrow cue simultaneously with the probe array did not alter performance, p .25 for color VWM and p .35 for shape VWM."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Experiment 2 showed that VWM performance was better when the critical item was retrospectively cued. This advantage was seen even when the probe display contained a single probe item, which only required a single memory probe comparison. Direct comparisons across Experiments 1 and 2 revealed no interaction between retro-cue (retro-cue vs. no cue) and experiment (whole-probe array vs. single-probe array), F 1. Given that the single probe already simplified the comparison process, it should have enhanced performance whether or not it was preceded by a retro-cue. Nonetheless, we still found an attentional cuing effect, suggesting that\nsimplified comparison cannot fully account for the advantage of attentional cuing.\nExperiment 3\nWhy does attentional cuing enhance VWM performance, and why is this enhancement restricted to retro-cuing? One critical difference between retro-cuing and simultaneous cuing or singleprobe cuing is the timing of attentional allocation. With retrocuing, attention is already directed to the critical memory before the presentation of the probe display. In contrast, it takes time for attention to move to the cued item when the cue is concurrent with the probe. Even when the cue is the single probe itself, it takes at least 100 ms for attention to move to the cued location (Posner, 1980). The sensitivity of memory performance to the timing of the cue suggests that VWM of multiple items is susceptible to degradation and that the degradation is reduced only when focused attention is delivered without much delay.\nWhat is the source of memory degradation? There are at least two possibilities. First, VWM may be degraded because multiple items in VWM may interfere with one another. This interitem interference may result from the suppression of nearby memory items (Bahcall & Kowler, 1999) or from incorrect binding of different memory attributes to their proper locations (Treisman & Zhang, 2006). Interitem degradation is removed when attention is cued to the critical item, resulting in enhanced performance. Second, VWM can be degraded by the presentation of the probe stimulus, which may interfere with VWM of multiple items (probe interference). As new visual input, the probe may overwrite or degrade the representation of memory items (Simons, 2000). It may also disrupt the rehearsal of memory information, leading to reduced memory performance. Focused attention on the critical memory can reduce probe interference by consolidating the critical memory into a durable format.\nSo what is the primary source of memory degradation that is reduced by attentional cuing? We test this question by manipulating memory load from one to six items. Both interitem interference and probe task interference accounts predict that the retro-cue should not enhance performance when memory load is one, as attention has already been focused on the single memory item.\nHowever, the two accounts differ in their prediction about the cuing benefit as a function of memory load. Because interitem competition is more dramatic for higher memory load, release from interitem interference should be greater at higher memory loads. In turn, attentional cuing should be greater at higher loads. In contrast, if attentional cuing acts by reducing probe interference, the size of the interference should be determined by the probe stimulus, which is constant across all memory loads. The cuing benefit should not scale with memory load.\nTo contrast these hypotheses, in Experiment 3 we varied memory load from one to six. Because VWM load is affected not only by set size but also by item complexity (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004; Eng et al., 2005), we tested shape (a complex property) as well as color (a simple property)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Twelve participants from the same general subject pool as that described for Experiment 1 completed Experiment 3.\nDesign and procedure. We manipulated three factors orthogonally: the type of stimulus tested (color or shape), the number of items on the memory display (from one to six, presented equidistantly along the circumference of an imaginary circle), and the timing of the cue (retro-cue or simultaneous cue). In the retro-cue condition, after an initial memory array (1,000 ms) and a blank retention interval (1,000 ms), the retro-cue was presented for 100 ms, followed by a blank lag of 400 ms, before the presentation of a test item. In the simultaneous-cue condition, the cue was presented simultaneously with the test item. Figure 6 (left) shows a schematic illustration of the trial sequence.\nEach participant completed 1,248 experimental trials (divided into 26 blocks of 48 trials each), carried out in two 1-hr sessions. The trials were randomly and evenly divided into different conditions. Participants completed the experiment under articulatory\nsuppression. In all other respects the experiment was identical to Experiment 2."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Figure 6 (right) shows mean accuracy for color and shape tasks at different memory loads. An ANOVA confirmed that overall accuracy was higher in the color task than in the shape task, higher at lower memory loads, and higher with a retro-cue, all ps .01. The interaction between stimulus type and memory set size was significant, F(5, 55) 11.51, p .01, driven by ceiling performance at a memory load of one for both color and shape VWM but lower performance for shape than color at higher memory load. The benefit provided by a retro-cue interacted marginally with memory load, F(5, 55) 2.21, p .07. The other interactions were not significant, ps .25.\nFollow-up tests showed that the retro-cue enhanced performance at all memory loads ( ps .05) except for Load 1 ( p .70). The retro-cue enhanced performance even when there were only two items in the memory array, p .02 (Lepsien et al., 2005). Most important, when a memory load of one was removed from the analysis, the interaction between retro-cue and memory load was not significant, F 1. Is this lack of interaction due to insufficient statistical power? Apparently not: When comparing the cue effect between Set Size 1 and Set Size 2, a significant interaction was found, F(1, 11) 4.80, p .05, with an observed power of 0.61. However, when comparing Load 2 with any other load, including Load 4 (twice that of Load 2) and Load 6 (the most extreme value), no interaction was detected (Fs 1). This suggests that any load effect from Load 2 or a higher load must be substantially smaller than that from Load 1 to Load 2. Moreover, individual data analysis revealed that the interaction between load (Loads 2 to 6) and cue was not significant in 11 of the 12 participants. Finally, we tested the linear contrast interaction of load and cue; that too was insignificant, F 1. In other words, the\nretro-cue benefit did not scale with memory load, even though the attentional advantage conveyed by the release of interitem competition and suppression should be greater at higher memory load. These results held when the dependent measure was log transformed for accuracy (Schweickert, 1985).\nFinally, we calculated memory capacity on the basis of Cowan\u2019s K measure (Cowan, 2001), where K is an index of the estimated number of items participants held in VWM at different memory load. The equation for calculating K was as follows: K memory load (hit correct rejection 1). The estimated color VWM capacity was 2.73 in the simultaneous-cue condition and 3.5 in the retro-cue condition. The estimated shape VWM capacity was 1.8 in the simultaneous-cue condition and 2.5 in the retro-cue condition. By this measure, the estimated capacity is 25%\u201328% lower if one uses the simultaneous-cue procedure rather than the retro-cue procedure."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In Experiment 3, we compared the size of the retro-cue benefit across different memory set sizes and for color and shape VWM. We found no evidence that the retro-cue benefit increased at higher memory loads. A significant retro-cue advantage was seen when memory load exceeded one, but it did not change for Set Sizes 2 to 6. These results were inconsistent with the idea that attentional cuing enhanced VWM representation by releasing interitem interference. The inter-item interference view is also inconsistent with findings from a recent study (Makovski & Jiang, 2007), which found no retro-cue benefit when attention was retro-cued to two of the six memory items. Even though this condition also involved a reduction in memory load and interitem interference, it did not improve performance. Similarly, Sperling (1960) did not find a retro-cue benefit when attention was cued to a row of items (rather than to a single item) after a delay of 500 ms. Together, these results show that the key factor for producing a retro-cue benefit is not the reduction of memory load per se, but a fundamental change of VWM property when attention is focused on a single memory item. These results are better explained by the probe interference hypothesis, according to which focused attention increased the robustness of VWM to interference from probe displays. At Memory Load 1, attention had already been focused on the critical item, leading to a robust form of memory. Further refreshing of its memory provided no additional benefit. When attentional load was greater than one, attention was initially distributed among multiple memory items. Memory for these items is not fully consolidated in the absence of focused attention. This memory can be degraded by new visual input. The retro-cue focused attention on the critical item, allowing its memory to be more resistant to probe interference.\nGeneral Discussion\nVWM is usually considered a robust form of visual memory that does not quickly decay (Makovski & Jiang, 2007; Phillips, 1974; Vogel, Woodman, & Luck, 2001) and can be maintained across changes in eye position (Irwin, 1992; Phillips, 1974) or across presentation of new visual input (Miller et al., 1996). However, recent studies using the retro-cue paradigm have challenged this view (Griffin & Nobre, 2003; Landman et al., 2003; Lepsien et al.,\n2005; Makovski & Jiang, 2007). Retrospectively cuing attention to one of the memory items long after iconic memory has decayed and transmission to VWM has completed can enhance VWM performance. The current study clarifies the nature of the retro-cue benefit by testing the memory decay and the attentional enhancement hypotheses. We have shown that the retro-cue benefit is not due to memory decay, as it is observed even when the interval between memory encoding and refreshing is longer in the retro-cue condition than in the other conditions. Performance is enhanced by attentional cuing, and this enhancement cannot be simply explained by reducing decision noise during the comparison process: The use of a single test probe reduced the number of comparisons to one without removing the retro-cue benefit. We believe that the effect reflects an interaction between attention and VWM, in which focused attention enhances the durability of VWM. Our experiments further rule out the possibility that attention simply made VWM more resistant to interference from concurrent memory load, as the attentional enhancement effect does not increase with heavier memory load, which would have produced greater interitem interference. Instead, we believe that the effect reflects a change in the durability of VWM to probe interference as a function of attentional allocation. Previous studies that use rapid serial visual presentation have shown that the consolidation of information into VWM relies significantly on attention. Without focused attention, memory for a perceived stimulus is highly vulnerable to interference from subsequent input (Chun & Potter, 1995). Orienting attention to a single item in VWM consolidates the memory and reduces the interference produced by the probe task. This orienting effect is accompanied by a cost to VWM of the uncued items. Griffin and Nobre (2003) found that after attention has been cued to one of the memory items, participants\u2019 memory of the other, uncued items is poor.\nThese results have significant theoretical and methodological implications. At the theoretical level, they suggest a modification to the dominant view of VWM as a robust form of visual memory. VWM is typically considered a window into cognitive control, as successful maintenance and retrieval of information online depends significantly on central executive processes (Baddeley, 2003; Makovski, Shim, & Jiang, 2006; Vogel, Woodman, & Luck,\n3 Performance in the no-cue (or simultaneous-cue) condition was lower than that seen in other studies (Luck & Vogel, 1997), most likely because the colors used in this study were less saturated and distinctive in comparison with those used in other studies. However, as noted by a reviewer, one might argue that the low performance was driven by intermixing different cue trials, which might have led to the adoption of strategies detrimental to the no-cue (or simultaneous-cue) condition. To rule out this possibility, we tested 7 observers in an experiment in which the retro-cue and simultaneous-cue conditions were either randomly mixed in presentation order or tested in separate blocks. If participants adopted strategies detrimental to the no-cue (or simultaneous-cue) condition in the mixed design, then the cue effect should be eliminated in the blocked design, and performance in the no-cue (or simultaneous-cue) condition should be better in the blocked than the mixed conditions. This, however, was not what we found. Accuracy in the mixed design was comparable to accuracy in the blocked design in both the no-cue conditions (64.6% vs. 65.4%, respectively) and the retro-cue conditions (73.2 % vs. 74.6%, respectively). The main effect of cue was significant, p .01, but the main effect of blocking type (mixed or blocked) or their interaction was not significant.\n2005). This view of VWM as a reflection of top-down control has dominated the conception of VWM, buttressed in part by the observation that VWM does not quickly decay and that it can be maintained across interruptions. However, several studies in VWM have already shown that VWM is also sensitive to bottom-up input. For example, VWM shows a dramatic recency effect, in which the trailing array is much better retained than the preceding arrays (Broadbent & Broadbent, 1981; Brockmole, Wang, & Irwin, 2002; Jiang & Kumar, 2004; Phillips & Christie, 1977; Song & Jiang, 2006a). In neurophysiology, Miller and colleagues have shown that, whereas cells in the prefrontal cortex can maintain their selectivity over filled delays, cells in the inferior temporal cortex do not maintain their memory selectivity over filled delays (Miller & Desimone, 1994; Miller et al., 1996). In human functional brain imaging, although the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices show VWM-related activity for various types of input (Song & Jiang, 2006b; Todd & Marois, 2004; Xu & Chun, 2006), the inferior temporal cortex is selective to specific stimulus type. For example, the fusiform face area shows VWM activity for faces but not for scenes during the retention interval (Druzgal & D\u2019Esposito, 2003). These studies suggest that the access to VWM may be guarded both by top-down control and by bottom-up inputs. This view of VWM can be partly mapped onto Baddeley (1986) and Logie\u2019s (1995) models of working memory, in which the central executive works in tandem with \u201csubsidiary systems.\u201d The subsidiary systems, such as the visual\u2013spatial sketchpad, may be sensitive to obligatory updating by new input. Although the current study does not fundamentally change the Baddeley or Logie model of VWM, it has highlighted the need to consider bottom-up influences, such as obligatory updating of VWM, and this is something that has largely been neglected in existing VWM models.\nAt the methodological level, this study shows that the estimation of VWM capacity can depend significantly on the testing procedure. The standard change detection task uses a whole-report procedure and can underestimate VWM capacity by 25%. The retro-cue procedure, in which the critical memory item is retrospectively cued prior to probe presentation, can be considered a better procedure, especially if one\u2019s interest is to characterize the upper capacity limit. Indeed, even the retro-cue procedure used here may have underestimated VWM capacity. Although the retrocue did not overlap with the memory items in spatial locations, it may have produced some interference, as interference from new input is not screen or viewer based (Experiment 1). This interference must be less than that produced by the probe; otherwise, the interference by the cue would have swamped any advantage of attentional cuing. The lower interference by the retro-cue than by the probe item may originate from differences in spatial location (central vs. peripheral; far away from vs. near the initial memory item) or differences in similarity to VWM contents.\nThe benefit of a retro-cue observed here is much less than that seen in Landman et al.\u2019s (2003) original study. Even with the retro-cue procedure, we did not find evidence for a high-capacity system. Two differences between our methods and those of Landman et al. (2003) could explain the disparity in results. First, the Landman et al. study tested memory for orientation, while we tested memory for color and shape. Strategies such as grouping oriented lines to form a configuration may be more successful than similar strategies for color memory or shape memory. Second,\nthere were only two possible orientations tested in the Landman et al. study, and these two orientations were easily distinguished (they were horizontal and vertical). In contrast, our experiment tested a total of 9 colors and 10 shapes, which were probably more similar. Given that the veridicality of VWM representation may be graded, the ease of distinguishing items in memory can affect memory capacity (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004; Eng et al., 2005; Olsson & Poom, 2005). Thus, it is perhaps not meaningful to talk about a magic number for VWM capacity; that number may be highly variable, depending on the feature values selected to test VWM (Jiang, Shim, & Makovski, 2007; Wilken & Ma, 2004).\nOur study complements previous research by showing that visual attention significantly influences VWM. Information that is selectively attended during encoding of the prechange display gains access to VWM (Griffin & Nobre, 2003; Lepsien et al., 2005; Rensink, Oregan, & Clark, 1997; Schmidt, Vogel, Woodman, & Luck, 2002). After VWM encoding, attention is continuously needed to maintain information in VWM. VWM is severely impaired if a secondary task is conducted during the delay interval (Fougnie & Marois, 2006; Makovski et al., 2006). This interference largely arises from amodal, central attention, because an attended auditory secondary task impairs VWM, but a passively viewed visual stimulus barely affects VWM (Makovski et al., 2006). What our study has added to the understanding of attention and VWM is that attention also modulates the durability of VWM. Memory consolidation is thus not just a matter of time (Vogel et al., 2006) but also an act of selective attention. If attention is distributed across multiple items, such that several items are simultaneously retained in VWM, then memory for these items is vulnerable to interference from the test display. But the distribution of attention can change such that one of the memorized items becomes selectively attended, in which case memory for that item becomes more robust (Makovski & Jiang, 2007). Thus, focusing attention retrospectively on a single item in VWM can solidify that memory. Whether this act of attention qualitatively changes the format of VWM is an interesting question to test in the future.\nReferences\nAlvarez, G. A., & Cavanagh, P. (2004).

Keith Payne University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nMelissa A. Burkley Oklahoma State University\nMark B. Stokes University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nImplicit and explicit attitude tests are often weakly correlated, leading some theorists to conclude that implicit and explicit cognition are independent. Popular implicit and explicit tests, however, differ in many ways beyond implicit and explicit cognition. The authors examined in 4 studies whether correlations between implicit and explicit tests were influenced by the similarity in task demands (i.e., structural fit) and, hence, the processes engaged by each test. Using an affect misattribution procedure, they systematically varied the structural fit of implicit and explicit tests of racial attitudes. As test formats became more similar, the implicit\u2013explicit correlation increased until it became higher than in most previous research. When tests differ in structure, they may underestimate the relationship between implicit and explicit cognition. The authors propose a solution that uses procedures to maximize structural fit.\nKeywords: implicit, attitude, automatic, measurement, prejudice\nImplicit tests have been compared with such revolutionary inventions as the telescope and the microscope. The hope is that implicit tests, too, can make clear what is invisible to the naked eye. In many studies, implicit tests have created images of attitudes and beliefs that look very different from those reported on questionnaires. This kind of divergence is especially common for tests of racial attitudes and stereotypes. But what exactly does it mean when a person reports one attitude yet scores differently on an implicit test of race bias? The answer to that question is controversial, but it is important. It will shape not only theories of attitudes and stereotypes, but also the way that men and women taking the tests understand their own minds (see Arkes & Tetlock, 2004, and commentaries; Blanton & Jaccard, 2006, and commentaries).\nIn a typical study of this sort, a sample of research volunteers is compared on two tests of racial attitudes. One test is explicit, asking them to report their attitudes on a questionnaire. The other test is implicit. Rather than asking for self-report, it uses performance on another task to reveal attitudes. Readers familiar with implicit social-cognition research over the past decade will have no trouble predicting that in this kind of study, the two measures will likely diverge, capturing two very different snapshots of racial\nattitudes (Fazio & Olson, 2003; Hofmann, Gawronski, Gschwendner, Le, & Schmitt, 2005).\nBut why do implicit and explicit measures diverge? One view is that the two kinds of measures reflect separate attitude representations (Devine, 1989; Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000). By this account, people hold multiple attitudes toward a topic at the same time. When attitudes change, a new attitude is layered on top of older attitudes. When people introspect they report the most contemporary attitudes, but the ruins of older layers can be unearthed by probing deeper, using implicit tests.\nA different view is that a lack of correlation between measures does not turn up separate attitudes at all. Instead, the two kinds of measures allow people to edit their responses to different degrees. From this point of view, measuring implicit responses is less like an archeological dig and more like fishing in a river. Implicit tests tap attitudes upstream, but explicit tests catch what flows downstream, muddied in the editing for public report (Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, & Williams, 1995; Nier, 2005).\nBoth perspectives assume that the chief reason for the implicit\u2013 explicit divide can be found in the distinction between \u201cimplicitness\u201d and \u201cexplicitness.\u201d Either implicit measures tap something unconscious and explicit measures tap something conscious, or implicit measures tap automatic responses and explicit measures tap intentionally edited responses. It may seem obvious that the principal difference between implicit and explicit tests is that one is implicit and the other is explicit. To see what other possibilities exist, it helps to shift perspectives and ask how implicit and explicit tests differ beyond implicit and explicit cognition. We propose that, independent of differences in underlying cognitive processes, when implicit and explicit tests have radically different structures, they will correlate with each other only weakly.

First, it would call into question whether the many null or weak implicit\u2013explicit correlations that have been reported should be interpreted as evidence that underlying implicit and explicit cognitions are independent. Second, to draw conclusions about implicit and explicit thought processes from divergence between implicit and explicit tests, one must first equate the tests on extraneous differences while systematically varying the differences of interest. Our aim is not, therefore, to test whether the archeological metaphor or the river metaphor is correct. Our aim is, instead, to show that poor structural fit creates a stumbling block for investigating such theories with implicit tests and to propose a way around this obstacle.\nStructural Fit Between Implicit and Explicit Tests\nBy the structure of a test, we mean the parts that make it up and how they work together to measure attitudes. Most explicit attitude tests share several structural elements. The items are usually verbal statements. For example, an item on the Likert-style Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale (ATB) reads, \u201cRacial integration (of schools, businesses, residences, etc.) has benefited both Blacks and Whites\u201d (Brigham, 1993, p. 1942). In a semantic differential, participants might be asked to rate racial groups on traits such as \u201cpleasant,\u201d \u201caggressive,\u201d and \u201cfriendly.\u201d And on a feeling thermometer, participants might be presented with several racial groups and asked to rate their feelings toward each group from very cold and unfavorable to very warm and favorable. In each of these cases, participants read a verbal phrase or sentence. They must either retrieve a previously stored attitude from memory or construct a new evaluation in the moment. Finally, they must decide how to best express their response to each statement on a numerical scale.\nIf explicit attitude measures involve considering statements, evaluating one\u2019s response, and formulating it on a scale, implicit measures avoid all of these. Although the structures of implicit tests differ from one procedure to another, certain commonalities are clear. Complex propositions are replaced with simple words or pictures. In the implicit association test, for example, words or pictures denote the target items to be evaluated (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Participants are asked to classify that item using four categories mapped onto only two overlapping response keys (e.g., White or good, Black or bad, White or bad, Black or good). In evaluative priming (Fazio et al., 1995), a prime word or picture is flashed briefly before a target word or picture. The target item is then evaluated as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Similar items are presented for many other kinds of tasks (e.g., De Houwer, 2003; Wittenbrink, Judd, & Park, 1997).\nWhen presented with a word or a picture, implicit test takers are asked to simply evaluate it, categorize it, or decide whether it is a word. This does not typically require the formulation of any opinion, as there is usually a correct answer (e.g., death is bad). In response-latency tasks, which make up the bulk of implicit measurement, the content of the response is irrelevant (incorrect answers are typically excluded). The measure of interest is the time it takes to register a response.\nThe list of differences described here between implicit and explicit tests is not intended to be exhaustive; these examples\nmerely highlight some key ways that implicit and explicit tasks differ. They include the stimuli presented (e.g., propositions vs. simple words or pictures), the level of abstractness of the judgments to be made (e.g., broad social opinions vs. concrete classifications), and the metric in which responses are measured (e.g., numerical scales vs. response latencies). It is an important fact that none of these differences is inherently related to consciousness or unconsciousness, automaticity or voluntary control. Instead, they are incidental properties that are confounded with the implicit\u2013 explicit distinction as it has been instantiated in popular methods.\nAre these methodological differences important for understanding implicit\u2013explicit correlations? The issue calls to mind earlier debates about the predictive value of attitudes in general. Faced with many failures to detect relationships between attitudes and behaviors (Wicker, 1969), attitude theorists uncovered a number of moderating factors that determined when attitudes and behaviors are likely to be related and when they are not. One key factor was conceptual correspondence (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977).\nWhen attitudes and behaviors are measured at the same level of abstractness and with the same degree of specificity, they are said to be conceptually correspondent. Under these conditions, attitudes and behavior tend to be related. Attitudes toward good health, for example, are not strongly related to how often a person jogs, but attitudes toward jogging are more likely to be related. A recent review supports the notion that implicit and explicit attitude measures are more likely to be related when they are conceptually correspondent (Hofmann et al., 2005). Of course, conceptual correspondence is only one aspect of the structural differences we describe between implicit and explicit tests. Differences such as reaction times versus Likert scales are important parts of a test\u2019s structure but are unrelated to conceptual correspondence. For a more inclusive and accurate description of our purposes, we refer to the degree of methodological similarity between different tests as structural fit.\nThe attitude\u2013behavior relationship is not the only field of study in which issues of test structure have proved important. Early studies of implicit memory compared implicit and explicit memory tasks that differed in many ways. For example, recall and recognition tasks measured explicit memory. In contrast, implicit memory was measured with a range of tasks, including word-fragment completion, word identification, and lexical decision (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Tulving, Schacter, & Stark, 1982; Warrington & Weiskrantz, 1974). Researchers using this approach found many variables that selectively influenced one kind of test but not the other. These dissociations, however, only begged more questions about their underlying reasons. Given all the structural differences between, for example, a recall test and a lexical-decision test, it was not clear whether a dissociation reflected implicit versus explicit forms of memory or other differences in the operations that each task requires (Roediger, 1990). Ambiguities in how to interpret implicit tests led Schacter, Bowers, and Booker (1989) to propose a principle they called the retrieval intentionality criterion.\nThe retrieval intentionality criterion says that to isolate implicit and explicit forms of memory in a way that is empirically verifiable, implicit and explicit memory should be measured in a way that holds everything about the memory tests constant except the intention to remember. The intention to remember is then manipulated. For example, rather than comparing cued recall to lexical\ndecision, a study should present the same word-fragment cues for both implicit and explicit tests. In the implicit test, instructions should require participants to complete them in a way that does not refer back to a studied event (e.g., \u201ccomplete the fragment with the first word completion that comes to mind\u201d). In the explicit test, participants should complete the same items under instructions to remember the previous event (e.g., \u201ccomplete the fragment with a word that you studied\u201d).\nWhen some variable affects one kind of test but not the other, the dissociation provides evidence for a selective effect on intentional versus unintentional uses of memory. This approach links the operational definition of implicit memory to its conceptual definition, because implicit memory is defined as an effect of past experience that does not require the intent to remember. Jacoby (1991) later provided a more conservative definition in which participants in the implicit test condition are told to complete the fragment with a word that they did not study. In this case, participants would produce a studied word only if it came to mind but was not consciously remembered. This exclusion instruction defines implicit memory as an effect of past experience that influences performance despite a conscious intention to the contrary.\nThe retrieval intentionality criterion is based on a fundamental principle of experimental design: Isolating a particular variable requires that all other variables be held constant. Doing otherwise allows a confound in the design. Although the retrieval intentionality criterion soon became a gold standard for implicit memory research, studies of implicit attitudes have not followed the same route. Research on the attitude\u2013behavior link and on implicit memory have both shown how important it can be to hold extraneous factors constant. The studies reported here explore how the relationships between implicit and explicit attitude tests change when the test structures are matched.\nOverview of the Present Research\nTo test whether structural fit influenced implicit\u2013explicit correlations, we manipulated how well these features were equated. We reasoned that if extraneous structural differences led to underestimated correlations, then the more closely tests were equated on these features, the stronger the correlations would be. It is difficult to use response-latency methods with this approach, because the structure of the test is essential to the function of the test. It would be impossible to overcome problems such as comparing response latencies to Likert scales without changing the nature of the tasks. Several authors have observed, in various ways, that methodological differences might reduce the relationships between reactiontime tests and self-report tests (e.g., Hofmann et al., 2005; Kawakami & Dovidio, 2001; Wittenbrink et al., 1997). But the question is far from settled, because there has generally been no alternative available. As a result, there has been no way to gauge the effect of these differences and no way to know what the relationships would be in their absence. In this article, we gauge how much of an effect structural fit may have, and we propose an approach for greatly reducing extraneous differences.\nAn important step in understanding implicit\u2013explicit correlations is the finding that a latent-variable approach can greatly increase the implicit\u2013explicit correlation by removing measurement error (Cunningham, Preacher, & Banaji, 2001). The question addressed in the present research, however, is different. Latent-\nvariable analyses can estimate what relationships would be in the absence of random error, but the method differences on which we focus represent systematic method differences that cannot be removed with a latent-variable approach. Instead, multiple measures are needed to compare the systematic influence of different methods (Bagozzi & Yi, 1991; Campbell & Fiske, 1959; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003).\nTo solve this problem, we took advantage of the recently developed affect misattribution procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005), because it does not rely on response latencies. Instead, it produces an implicit measure of attitudes in which the response metric is an evaluation. The AMP is an approach to implicit measurement that depends on evaluation of ambiguous items. When an ambiguous object, such as a Chinese pictograph, is preceded with a pleasant or unpleasant picture, the picture alters impressions of the pictograph (Murphy & Zajonc, 1993). People tend to misattribute their affective reaction from the prime picture to the target pictograph. As a result, participants asked to rate the pleasantness of the pictograph tend to rate it as more pleasant following a smiling face as compared with a frowning face. The measure of interest is not reaction time but the pictograph\u2019s rated pleasantness.\nParticipants showed strong misattribution effects even when directly warned to avoid any influence from the prime photos (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). A key aspect of the AMP is that participants are warned specifically that the prime photos may bias their evaluations of pictographs, and they are instructed that their task is to avoid any influence from the photos. Providing such a warning sets intentional response strategies in opposition to the automatic influence of the primes (an exclusion instruction; Jacoby, 1991). If participants respond as intended, they will evaluate the pictographs without influence from the primes. They will judge the pictographs on the basis of the primes only to the extent that the prime activates some evaluation and they are unable to control that influence on their judgments. By arranging the task in this way, any misattributions that persist despite the intended task requirements provide evidence of automatic responses to the primes.\nIn a series of validation studies, misattributions provided valid estimates of attitudes (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). The AMP is notable in that it shows high reliability, and in those conditions in which high implicit\u2013explicit correlations were theoretically expected, high correlations have been found. Moreover, in conditions in which implicit and explicit tests were expected to diverge, the AMP showed clear dissociations. These properties make the procedure well-suited for studying relationships between implicit and explicit evaluations. Using an implicit test with a metric that is an evaluation provides a basis for equating many structural differences.\nIn Studies 1 and 2, we showed that the implicit\u2013explicit correlation increased as structural fit increased. In Study 3, we used a multitrait, multimethod approach to rule out the possibility that high correlations produced by structural fit were artificially inflated by common method variance. Finally, in Study 4, we found that implicit and explicit tests with high structural fit still showed theoretically predicted dissociations, ruling out the idea that high structural fit renders the tests redundant.\nStudy 1\nOur goal in the first study was to compare performance on implicit and explicit tests that varied in structural fit. We expected\nthat the measures with the greatest structural fit would show the highest implicit\u2013explicit correlations. We surveyed participants using two commonly used explicit measures, the Modern Racism Scale (MRS; McConahay, 1983) and the ATB (Brigham, 1993). We also administered the AMP to measure implicit racial evaluations. The primes for the task consisted of photos of White and Black persons\u2019 faces. Participants were shown face primes, followed by Chinese pictographs that they were asked to rate for pleasantness. Unlike the method used in previous studies, participants made their ratings on a continuous 4-point scale from very unpleasant to very pleasant. This change provided a basis for structural fit with the explicit measures, as will be described in more detail below. As in previous research using the AMP, participants were instructed to evaluate the Chinese pictograph and to avoid being influenced by the primes.\nEquating Implicit and Explicit Test Structures\nThe design described so far is similar to many previous studies assessing implicit\u2013explicit correlations. Although the response metric for the implicit and explicit tasks is the same, the implicit and explicit tasks differ in the kinds of stimuli presented and the processes in which participants must engage. That is, in the questionnaires, participants were asked to endorse or reject complex verbal propositions about racial groups. In the AMP, participants were asked to evaluate the pleasantness of Chinese pictographs after being primed with the faces of White and Black individuals. To equate these features, a second version of the AMP was included. In this version, participants were shown the same prime\u2013 target sequences as in the original AMP. However, rather than being told to avoid influence from the prime and evaluate the pictograph, participants were told to avoid the pictograph and evaluate the prime. Figure 1 illustrates the procedure.\nWe use indirect evaluation to refer to the original version of the AMP in which participants evaluate pictographs, because this task provides an indirect measure of reactions toward the primes. In contrast, we use direct evaluation to refer to the alternative version, in which participants directly express their evaluations of the primes. The advantage of comparing indirect and direct evalua-\ntions in this way is that the tasks are equated on many extraneous factors. In the indirect task, participants intend not to display any evaluation of the prime objects. In the direct task, they intend to express evaluations of those same objects. The tasks are equated on the stimuli presented and the type of judgment to be made. They differ only in intent.\nBy arranging tasks in this way, one can compare the self-report questionnaires with indirect AMP evaluations, which differ both in \u201cimplicitness\u201d and in structure. The questionnaires can also be compared with direct AMP evaluations, which differ in structure but are both explicit measures. Finally, we can compare indirect and direct AMP evaluations, which differ in implicitness but are structurally matched. The structural-fit hypothesis predicts that measures with the most similar structures will show the greatest correlations.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were seventy-five undergraduates (62 women and 13 men) who participated for partial course credit.

For the indirect rating trials, participants were presented with one of three kinds of primes: a Black face, a\nWhite face, or a gray square that served as a neutral prime. The face primes were 12 Black men and 12 White men. The pictures showed only the model\u2019s face, with a neutral facial expression. Based on pilot testing, the Black and White photos were matched on attractiveness and were selected to be highly prototypical of their respective racial category.\nThe prime appeared in the center of the screen for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen for 100 ms and then a Chinese pictograph for 100 ms (see Figure 1). Following the pictograph, a patterned mask of black and white \u201cnoise\u201d appeared. At the bottom of the screen was a 4-point rating scale that included 2 (very unpleasant), 1 (slightly unpleasant), 1 (slightly pleasant), and 2 (very pleasant). After participants provided their evaluation of the pictograph, the next trial began. A total of 72 randomly ordered trials were presented, with 24 neutral, 24 Black, and 24 White primes paired with 72 unique Chinese pictographs. For each participant, the computer paired a pictograph with a prime in a new random order.\nParticipants were told that the task was about making judgments while avoiding distraction. They were instructed to rate the pleasantness of the Chinese pictographs using the rating scale. Participants were warned to not let their rating of the pictographs be influenced by the preceding photo. This warning was included to ensure that AMP responses represented the effect of the prime, despite participants\u2019 attempts at correction, thereby serving as an indication of the automatic influence of prime-invoked attitudes (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). The instructions read as follows:\nFor this round of judgments you should rate the Chinese characters.

The first and most important difference was that participants were instructed to rate their evaluations of the prime photographs and to avoid being influenced by the Chinese pictographs. Because the pictographs were ambiguous and randomly paired with the primes, they could not actually exert any systematic influence on ratings of the primes. The instructions read as follows:\nFor this round of judgments you should rate the photos of people. Please note that sometimes the Chinese characters flashed after the photos can influence people\u2019s ratings of the photos. Please try your best not to be influenced by the characters. Instead, please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each person\u2019s photo. Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. Just report your \u201cgut reaction.\u201d\nThe second difference was that no neutral primes were included, because direct evaluations of a gray square would be uninformative. The third difference was that only 24 trials were included, one trial for each unique prime photo. In the direct rating blocks, each prime photo was rated only once for the same reason that each item is only presented once on questionnaires. Because participants were directly expressing their attitudes toward the attitude objects, there was little need for repetitive judgments of the same items."}, {"heading": "Self-Report Attitude Measures", "text": "Two self-report measures of racial attitudes were used: the MRS (McConahay, 1983) and the ATB (Brigham, 1993).

The mean score for the MRS was 2.63 (SD 1.25). Higher scores on the ATB reflect more positive attitudes toward Black people, whereas higher scores on the MRS reflect more negative attitudes toward Black people. For the purpose of the following analyses, the ATB scale was reverse-scored so that all measures were scored in the same direction, with higher scores reflecting more negative attitudes toward Black people.\nWe calculated reliability for indirect ratings by taking a difference score between pleasantness ratings on each White-prime trial and the rating on a randomly paired Black-prime trial. This produced 24 difference scores that were treated as items in a reliability analysis (for a fuller description, see Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). Reliability for direct ratings was computed in the same way. Reliability was acceptable for all measures (indirect .69; direct .71; ATB .80; MRS .90).\nCorrelations. We hypothesized that over and above the implicit\u2013explicit distinction, the attitude tests with greatest structural fit would show the strongest correlations. The two tests with the highest degree of fit were the two explicit questionnaires (ATB and MRS). These questionnaires were matched in both structural fit (i.e., they asked similar kinds of questions) and in the fact that both were explicit measures. Table 1 displays the correlations among all tests. As expected, the questionnaires were strongly correlated with each other. In contrast, the ATB and MRS were only weakly, though significantly, correlated with indirect evaluations. These findings are consistent with much previous research that has showed small implicit\u2013explicit correlations for racial attitudes. The traditional way to interpret this finding is that implicit and explicit tests reflected different attitudes or different processes. That is, the reason for implicit\u2013explicit divergence is said to lie in the difference between implicitness and explicitness. However, the questionnaires differed from the indirect ratings not only in implicitness, but also in structure (e.g., pictures vs. verbal statements, exemplars vs. groups, simple pleasantness judgments vs. opinions on broad policies, etc.). Because they shared neither implicit\u2013explicitness nor structural features, the low correlations may result from either kind of difference.\nThe traditional interpretation would predict that direct evaluations should be highly correlated with the ATB and MRS because they are all explicit measures. However, as shown in Table 1, direct ratings were no more strongly correlated with these questionnaires than the indirect ratings were. We suggest these low\ncorrelations reflect the lack of structural fit between the direct ratings and the questionnaires. If this hypothesis is correct, then the direct and indirect tests should be strongly correlated, because despite differing in implicitness, they are equated in structure. In fact, the correlation between direct and indirect tests (r .64) was nearly as large as the correlation between the ATB and MRS scales (r .68), which were equated on both dimensions. These two correlations were not significantly different from each other. They were both, however, significantly greater than the other four correlations (all ps .05). This pattern of correlations supports the proposal that structural fit is an important factor influencing the size of the correlation between implicit and explicit tests."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Some aspects of these results replicated commonly observed findings. The two explicit questionnaires were highly correlated with each other. They were also quite weakly correlated with an indirect test of race attitudes. Both of these facts can be explained by two accounts. The traditional account is that the two questionnaires were strongly related because both tests explicitly asked participants to report their attitudes. In contrast, the questionnaires were not strongly related to the indirect test because the questionnaires are explicit measures, whereas the indirect test is an implicit measure.\nThe structural-fit account can also explain these findings. By that account, the questionnaires were strongly related to each other because they were well-matched on measurement features. For example, they both asked participants to endorse or reject propositions about Black people as a group in American society. In contrast, the questionnaires were weakly related to the indirect test because they differed in measurement features. Unlike the questionnaires, the indirect test asked participants to make simple feeling-based judgments of pleasantness. And the primes were faces of individuals, not social-group labels. So both a traditional account based on implicitness and a structural-fit account can explain the strong correlation between questionnaires and the weak correlation between the questionnaires and the indirect rating.\nWe must account for two other cells in our design. First is the correlation between the questionnaires and the direct test. If the implicit\u2013explicit distinction were the only factor at work, then we would expect this correlation to be high because both are explicit tests. However, these weak correlations are more consistent with a structural-fit explanation. Although these tests are all explicit measures of race attitudes, they differ in their measurement features in much the same ways that the questionnaires differ from the indirect test. That is, rating feelings toward pictures of individuals is quite different from expressing attitudes toward social policies regarding racial groups. Finally, the strong correlation between indirect and direct tests presents a puzzle for any account based only on the implicit\u2013explicit distinction. This correlation is, however, consistent with the structural-fit account. These results suggest that when implicit and explicit tests are equated on extraneous measurement features, they may be much more highly correlated than previously thought."}, {"heading": "Some Notes on Scaling", "text": "Despite using the same response scale, indirect and direct AMP ratings tend to differ in extremity.

As a result, indirect ratings will tend toward neutral values at the mean level. Participants are also instructed to avoid any influence of the primes. Although participants cannot do so completely (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005), partial success will tend to reduce the magnitude of differences between Black- and White-prime trials. These features make the task a conservative test of racial bias and also increase confidence that any race bias that persists is beyond voluntary control. At the same time, these considerations mean that a 1.5 indirect rating (of a pictograph) does not necessarily mean the same as a 1.5 direct rating (of a human face). For this reason, it would be inappropriate to directly compare the mean levels across the two tasks. The value of making the task structures more matched is not found in simply comparing raw numbers across tasks. Instead, the value is in encouraging similar cognitive processes on the two tasks, except for the systematic differences of interest. Individual-difference correlations are more informative for testing our hypotheses than are the absolute mean levels. (The two tasks can, of course, be standardized, which removes any meaningful mean difference and does not change the correlations). The correlations observed here confirm that the individual differences were systematic and interpretable."}, {"heading": "Broadening the Conclusion", "text": "In Study 1, we took a first step toward exploring the importance of structural correspondence. But there are some idiosyncratic aspects of the measures that need to be broadened. For example, all of the explicit measures were verbal, whereas the implicit measure was based on pictures. This difference was chosen as a way to manipulate structural correspondence, but it is important to show that the strong implicit\u2013explicit correlation observed is not limited to pictorial methods. Our structural-fit analysis leads us to predict that when verbal group labels such as \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cWhite\u201d are used as primes, both indirect and direct ratings should be correlated with other measures that ask participants to evaluate similar verbal categories. In Study 2, we aimed to replicate these findings and extend them by manipulating structural fit across a wider range of items to be evaluated, including group labels.\nStudy 2\nStudy 2 was designed to incorporate one of the most popular ways to measure attitudes: the \u201cfeeling thermometer.\u201d In this simple method, participants are asked to rate their feelings toward, say, African Americans, on a scale ranging from very cold and unfavorable to very warm and favorable. If the same verbal labels and rating scale are used for direct ratings using the AMP, we have essentially re-created a feeling thermometer. And if the same labels and scales are used for indirect AMP ratings, we have an implicit feeling thermometer. The two measures can be matched on all the relevant features as already described, and they differ only in the intent to express an evaluation of the primes. In this study, we manipulated structural fit by comparing evaluations on the basis of (a) faces, (b) group labels, (c) the ATB and MRS scales, and (d) a traditional feeling thermometer.

Task similarity ranged, then, from pictures of group members to verbal labels for the groups to more abstract policy-focused scales.

To answer this question, we reverse scored the rank orders so that higher values represent greater structural fit. We then plotted the size of the implicit\u2013explicit correlation (including both indirect tests) against the degree of structural fit. The results are shown in Figure 2. Each point on this scatter plot represents one of the implicit\u2013explicit correlations in Tables 2 and 3. We tested the correlation between structural fit and the size of implicit\u2013explicit correlations using Spearman\u2019s rank-order coefficient, which showed a very strong relationship, rs (10) .90, p .001. The degree of relationship between implicit and explicit tests was tightly linked to their structural fit.\nOther correlations. The correlation between the two indirect AMP tests was r .50, p .001. This correlation is higher than is often seen when comparing different implicit measures, but it is similar to that reported when latent variable analysis was used to correct for random measurement error (Cunningham et al., 2001). Table 4 shows the correlations among explicit tests. Although the effects of structural fit theoretically apply to explicit\u2013explicit correlations also, it is difficult to know how to clearly rank their structural similarities. These tests were selected so that they clearly varied in similarity to the implicit tests, but they were not selected to be clearly ranked in similarity to each other. In general, measures that were highly similar, such as ATB and MRS, were highly correlated. The correlation between the thermometer and the direct/group-labels task was also high. The direct/picture task tended to have lower correlations with the verbal measures, which were less similar. Because it is difficult to rank many of the other pairs, however, we remain cautious about drawing conclusions about interrelations among the explicit tests."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In Study 2, we tested the hypothesis that implicit and explicit measures of racial attitudes can be highly correlated when they are equated on structural features. The study, in which we used several measurement techniques, supported the hypothesis. The relation between implicit and explicit measures steadily increased as structural similarity increased. Phrased another way, comparing im-\nplicit and explicit measures that differed in irrelevant features undermined their correlation. Had we looked only at an implicit measure and an explicit measure that differed on many structural features (as is typically done), we would have wrongly concluded that the underlying attitudes were only weakly related.\nThe manipulation of the items to be evaluated is, of course, only one of many possible ways that tests may differ. Commonly used implicit and explicit tests often differ in several ways at once. The correlation between implicit and explicit tests is important because it has been a key piece of evidence for theories about the nature of implicit evaluation. The current findings shed new light on that evidence by suggesting that comparisons on the basis of these tests may severely underestimate the relationship between underlying implicit and explicit evaluations.\nOur argument that poor structural fit underestimates implicit\u2013 explicit correlations can be seen as an instance of unshared method variance. On the one hand, unshared method variance can cause true correlations to be underestimated (Bagozzi & Yi, 1991; Campbell & Fiske, 1959; Podsakoff et al., 2003). Our proposal to equate tests on structural features can help reduce that problem. On the other hand, creating tests with structural fit also increases shared method variance. Shared method variance, in turn, can potentially inflate correlations between measures. Are wellequated test structures a cause for concern?\nThere is reason to think that the risks of underestimating the implicit\u2013explicit correlation outweigh the risks of overestimating it. One reason is that comparing implicit and explicit tests can be thought of just as any other within-subjects experimental design. The ability to draw conclusions about a manipulated variable rests on the assumption that other variables do not also differ between conditions. Holding such extraneous factors constant across experimental conditions is rarely considered a threat to validity in other experimental research. Instead, it represents good experimental control.\nA second reason is that the methods used here control for some of the common sources of method variance that may inflate correlations. One common source of method variance is a general response bias. For example, some participants in our studies may simply like Chinese pictographs more than others. Or some people may simply use the higher range of a response scale, whereas\nNote. In parentheses are 95% confidence intervals for each correlation. Thermometer feeling thermometer; ATB Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale; MRS Modern Racism Scale. ** p .01. *** p .001.\nothers use the lower range. The scoring algorithm we have used in this article, however, controls for general response biases by comparing Black-prime trials with White-prime trials using a difference score. This approach avoids some sources of method bias in the same way that including control groups in experimental designs avoids systematic differences between conditions that are unrelated to the experimental manipulation.\nOf course, when methods in two conditions are matched, there are a potentially infinite number of ways that they could be similar. There is no way on conceptual grounds to rule out all possible sources of shared method variance that could inflate their relationships. So there remains a risk that structural fit may overestimate correlations. Therefore, we developed for Study 3 a multitrait, multimethod design to test whether these relationships are heavily influenced by shared method variance in practice.\nStudy 3\nFor this study, we selected a second attitude object that we expected to be unrelated to race attitudes. Previous research in our lab showed that implicit and explicit attitudes toward alcohol measured using the AMP showed correlations comparable to the correlations reported here for race attitudes (Payne, Govorun, & Arbuckle, in press). That is, implicit and explicit alcohol attitudes showed moderate correlations overall, which increased when social pressure encouraged honest reporting but decreased when social pressure encouraged underreporting drinking. Attitudes toward alcohol, however, seemed unlikely to be related to racial attitudes. Therefore, in this study we measured attitudes toward beer and race using direct and indirect AMP ratings. We expected direct and indirect tests of racial attitudes to correlate as in the previous studies. We also expected direct and indirect tests of alcohol attitudes to correlate with each other. If shared method variance artificially inflates the relationships between direct and indirect ratings, then the similar methods should produce large correlations between alcohol and race attitudes. But if not, then there should be evidence of discriminant validity.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 66 undergraduates (46 women and 20 men) who participated for partial course credit.

This analysis converged on a two-factor solution, with race attitudes loading highly on one factor and drink attitudes loading highly on the other factor (see Table 6). These two factors were uncorrelated, r .05. The pattern of correlations seems to provide clear evidence that correlations were not created simply by using similar methods."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In Study 3, we found evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. If the AMP inflated correlations simply because of shared method variance, then the correlations between beer and race attitudes measured with the same method should have been substantial. The results, however, showed no evidence for this account. This helps rule out the possibility that structurally equated measures correlate with each other spuriously because of shared method variance. Instead, this study showed that the measures cohered on the basis of the attitude object, not the method of measurement. The evidence suggests that structural fit removes barriers to correlations, but we found no evidence that it artificially inflates them.\nAlthough Study 3 addressed the potential concern of shared method variance, there is another potential concern that should be addressed. The concern is that structurally matched tests might not successfully differentiate implicit or automatic responses from explicit or controlled responses. On the one hand, it could be that the indirect ratings were not truly implicit. Perhaps participants disregarded the warning to avoid evaluating the primes and intentionally responded on the basis of their evaluations of the primes. If that is the case, then the correlations reported do not reflect implicit\u2013explicit relationships at all. On the other hand, it could be argued that the direct ratings were not fully explicit. Perhaps because the primes were flashed briefly, the direct ratings captured more automatic responses than is typical with self-report measures. If that is the case, then the direct picture ratings might be better regarded as a second implicit test.\nWe conducted a fourth study to rule out these alternative explanations by showing that direct ratings perform as we expect explicit attitude tests to perform, and indirect ratings perform as we expect implicit tests to perform. To do so, we selected a variable known to differentially affect explicit versus implicit tests: social pressure to avoid showing prejudice. If direct ratings operate as an explicit measure and indirect ratings act as an implicit measure, they should respond differently to such a manipulation. The vulnerability of explicit tests\u2014and the resistance of implicit tests\u2014to such pressure is one of the most common reasons for using an implicit test. In Study 4, we manipulated the amount of social pressure, with the expectation that it would affect direct ratings but not indirect ratings.\nStudy 4\nFor this study, we used only direct and indirect AMP ratings with faces as primes. During indirect ratings, participants evaluated pictographs while trying to avoid influence from the primes. For direct ratings, they rated the face primes themselves. The same prime and target stimuli were presented for both kinds of trials, and judgments were provided on identical scales. The only difference was that on direct ratings, participants intended to express their evaluations of the faces, whereas on indirect ratings, they intended not to. Because they had good structural fit, we expected these measures to be significantly related. But the key to this study was that one group of participants was encouraged to respond honestly and to ignore any social pressure to avoid bias. The other group was encouraged to be vigilant against the possibility of showing subtle race biases. We expected this manipulation to selectively\naffect direct ratings but not indirect ratings. As a result, we predicted a strong implicit\u2013explicit correlation only in the lowpressure condition, where participants could feel free to overtly express their attitudes.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 71 undergraduates (53 women and 18 men) who participated for partial course credit.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive the low-pressure or high-pressure instructions.

The instructions were as follows:\nRace relations are a very complex issue, and people vary widely in their opinions.

One way that people can overcome the scourge of prejudice is by continually being vigilant for biased tendencies in their own attitudes, opinions, and behavior. Your opinions are important to us. We ask that you express your own attitudes and opinions, keeping in mind the possibility that we are all vulnerable to racial biases.\nAfter completing the AMP phase of the study, participants provided demographic information and were debriefed."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Our hypothesis was that social pressure would affect direct ratings but not indirect ratings, resulting in higher implicit\u2013explicit correlations in the low-pressure condition than in the high-pressure condition. We tested this hypothesis with multiple-regression analyses. First, we gave each participant a score for indirect ratings by taking the difference between indirect ratings on Black- versus White-prime trials. We also gave each participant a score for direct ratings using the same procedure. For both, positive values reflect a preference for White over Black, whereas negative values represent a preference for Black, and zero represents no difference. At the mean level, there was a pro-White bias on both indirect ratings (M 0.11, SD 0.36) and direct ratings (M 0.29, SD 0.51). One-sample t tests showed that the difference from zero was significant for both indirect ratings, t(70) 2.59, p .05, and direct ratings, t(70) 4.75, p .01. Neither indirect nor direct ratings were significantly affected by the social pressure. The indirect test showed a similar preference for Whites over Blacks in the low-pressure condition (M 0.07, SD 0.35) and the highpressure condition (M 0.15, SD 0.38), t(69) .93, p .36. The direct test also showed a similar mean preference in lowpressure (M 0.26, SD 0.59) and high-pressure conditions (M 0.32, SD 0.42) t(69) .51, p .61. These means should, however, be interpreted in the context of the interaction reported below.\nOur hypothesis predicted a significant interaction between indirect ratings and social pressure, because the effect of social pressure should depend on participants\u2019 automatically activated attitudes. A majority of the sample (40 participants; 56.3%) showed some degree of pro-White bias on indirect ratings. A sizable minority, however, showed a pro-Black bias (24 participants; 33.8%). Seven participants (9.9%) showed exactly equal indirect ratings on Black and White trials. Participants with automatic pro-White biases were expected to adjust their responses on direct ratings in a pro-Black direction, toward equal ratings of Black and White faces. Participants with pro-Black automatic biases, however, were expected to adjust their responses in a more pro-White direction, again toward equal ratings (the social pressure instructions did not encourage pro-Black responses; they encouraged vigilance against bias of any kind). This pattern would result in a lower correlation between indirect and direct measures in the high-pressure condition, compared with the low-pressure condition.\nFigure 3 displays the results. The direct ratings are shown as a function of social-pressure group and indirect ratings. For both direct and indirect ratings, the figure displays raw difference scores, in which higher scores reflect pro-White bias, and a score of zero reflects equal ratings on Black and White trials. In the low-pressure condition, indirect ratings were strongly related to direct ratings, r(35) .71, p .001. In contrast, the relationship was much weaker in the high-pressure condition, r(36) .31, p .06. Direct and indirect ratings thus seem to have measured similar reactions in the low-pressure condition but very different reactions in the high-pressure condition.\nWe used multiple-regression analysis to test the effect of social pressure on direct ratings in interaction with indirect ratings. The dependent variable was direct ratings, with indirect ratings and social-pressure condition (contrast coded as 1 and 1) entered in the first step and their interaction entered in the second step. The analysis showed a main effect of indirect ratings, indicating that indirect and direct ratings were significantly correlated, .53, t(68) 5.10, p .01. The main effect of social pressure was not significant, .003, t(68) .03, p .98. That is, the socialpressure manipulation did not create an overall tendency to evaluate Black faces more favorably than White faces. Instead, the effect of social pressure to avoid prejudice depended on participants\u2019 automatic biases, as shown by a significant Indirect Social Pressure interaction, .31, t(67) 3.08, p .01. The inclusion of the interaction term in the second step produced a significant increment in R2, F(3, 70) 13.06, p .001, for a total R2 of .37. For participants with an automatic preference for White faces over Black faces (i.e., on the right side of Figure 3), social pressure reduced that bias on direct ratings, bringing them closer to zero. For those with a pro-Black preference (i.e., participants on the left of Figure 3), social pressure also reduced that bias, raising direct ratings closer to the neutral point of zero.\nTo better clarify the source of these differences, we ran the regression analysis again, analyzing direct ratings of Black faces and White faces separately. The Indirect Social Pressure interaction was significant for ratings of Black individuals, .24,\nt(67) 2.30, p .05, but not for ratings of White individuals, .12, t(67) .99, p .33. Responses to social pressure were thus driven mainly by ratings of Black individuals."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Social pressure had opposing effects, depending on participants\u2019 implicit biases. For participants with a pro-White bias, high social pressure led to expression of less bias on the direct ratings than did low pressure. This resulted in direct ratings closer to zero, reflecting equivalent evaluations of Black faces and White faces. In contrast, for those with a pro-Black implicit bias, high pressure led to higher scores on the direct ratings, again resulting in direct ratings closer to the neutral point of zero. In sum, social pressure to avoid prejudice pushed direct ratings toward the neutral point, at which White and Black faces were evaluated similarly.\nWhereas Studies 1\u20133 demonstrated that implicit and explicit tests show substantial correlations when equated in structure, Study 4 ruled out alternative explanations for those findings. There was no evidence that the indirect test could be easily controlled, nor that the direct test could not be controlled. The results of this study provide converging evidence that our methods reflect implicit and explicit evaluations, as they were designed to measure. Social pressure to avoid race bias produced more egalitarian responding on direct ratings of Black and White faces. As a result, direct and indirect ratings were strongly correlated when social pressure was minimized but weakly correlated when social pressure was heightened.\nAt first blush, it may seem counterintuitive that participants scoring low on the indirect test scored higher on the direct test under social pressure. It only seems counterintuitive, however, under the assumption that all participants have negative implicit attitudes toward Blacks. But a sizable minority of participants showed a pro-Black bias. For these participants, social pressure to avoid race bias meant responding more equally to White and Black faces, resulting in a higher, (i.e., less negative) score on the direct test. For both participants with pro-White biases and those with pro-Black biases, social pressure led to more egalitarian explicit responses, closer to the neutral point of no difference between Black and White faces.\nGeneral Discussion\nThese studies found that the kinds of items people judge and the kinds of judgments they make about them influence whether implicit and explicit evaluations will be related. These factors, among others, make up the structure of a test. Most implicit and explicit tests have very different structures, which may be one reason that they are often weakly correlated. Many of the differences between implicit and explicit tests, however, are unrelated to the conceptual distinctions between implicit and explicit cognition. The result is a confounding of test features with the concepts they are meant to measure (Payne, 2001, 2005; Payne, Jacoby, & Lambert, 2005).\nWhen a direct test with complex questions and Likert scales fails to correlate with an indirect test using reaction times to simple words or pictures, what are we to conclude? The most common conclusion is about distinctions between implicit and explicit cognition. But there are many other possible distinctions based on\nthese test structures that are overlooked. The present studies suggest that these structural differences have important consequences. We found that tests with poorly matched structures are likely to underestimate the implicit\u2013explicit correlation. But when implicit and explicit tests equate these features, the correlations can be quite high, even on the topic of racial attitudes.\nIn Studies 1 and 2, we introduced a novel method for measuring indirect and direct ratings while holding all else constant. Using that method, we compared implicitly measured responses to Black and White faces with explicit attitude tests that varied in structural fit. When comparing indirect ratings with traditional racial-attitude questionnaires, the correlations were low. But the correlations were much higher when the tests were equated in structure. In Study 3, we provided evidence that these correlations were not artificially inflated by shared method variance. Structural similarity also affected correlations between different explicit measures, a result that was originally found years ago (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977). But the novel finding that structural differences can obscure implicit\u2013explicit correlations and thus alter conclusions about implicit cognition has not been widely appreciated.\nStructural differences are not the only reason that implicit and explicit tests diverge. In Study 4, we tested the role of social pressure in controlling prejudice, one of the most common reasons for using implicit tests. Introducing social pressure produced more egalitarian responses on direct ratings, diminishing the correlation with indirect ratings. This pattern provides further evidence that direct and indirect ratings made on the same items differ in the degree to which they allow intentional control. Even when structurally matched, direct and indirect tests provided unique information. Because they were structurally matched, it was easier to pinpoint the sources of difference between the two tests."}, {"heading": "Test Sensitivity and the Ubiquity of Implicit Bias", "text": "The degree of race bias on indirect AMP ratings varied across our samples, sometimes showing a significant bias on average and in other samples showing no significant bias. To examine this issue more closely, we calculated the proportion of participants showing a relative preference for White faces over Black faces on the indirect AMP ratings across all four studies. For White participants (n 184), 54% showed more favorable indirect ratings for White trials than Black trials, whereas 46% showed no difference or a pro-Black preference. For Black participants (n 41), there was a pro-Black bias on average, with 61% showing a pro-Black bias and 39% showing no bias or pro-White bias. The difference for White participants was significant when aggregated across samples, but the difference for Black participants, given the small sample, was not. The relatively small average bias might be seen as evidence that the AMP was not sensitive to White participants\u2019 racial attitudes. That interpretation, however, rests on the assumption that our participants\u2019 true automatic evaluations were strongly antiBlack. It is also possible that their attitudes were genuinely closer to neutral, on average, and that the AMP accurately detected this.\nPrevious research using the implicit association test (Greenwald et al., 1998), for instance, has shown that large majorities of Americans tested show anti-Black bias (Nosek, Banaji, & Greenwald, 2002). Some researchers, however, have argued that this large average bias is inflated by other factors such as \u201cextrapersonal\u201d associations (Olson & Fazio, 2004; Karpinski & Hilton,\n2001). Research using other methods, such as evaluative priming, has shown that only about half of the individuals tested showed anti-Black bias (Fazio & Olson, 2003). Our results using the AMP suggest a slight majority of White participants in our college samples showed anti-Black bias. None of these figures, however, is very meaningful by itself. Effect size is an indicator of sensitivity only if the effect size is systematically related to the strength of the underlying attitude. A measure that shows large effect sizes on average without the ability to predict individual differences in behavior would not provide evidence of sensitivity.\nThe correlations demonstrated here provide evidence of sensitivity. In Studies 1 and 2, the positive correlations suggested that individuals who have strong preferences for White faces over Black faces do show large indirect AMP effects. This relationship can be seen most clearly when there is little motivation to avoid expressing prejudice, as shown in Study 4. Together, these data suggest that although anti-Black bias may be small on average (in college samples), the methods presented here capture bias effectively.\nDefining Implicit Cognition\nAn influential way to define implicit social cognition has been offered by Greenwald and Banaji (1995), who defined implicit attitudes as \u201cintrospectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects\u201d (p. 8). At the core of this conceptual definition are unobservable entities, \u201ctraces,\u201d that are said to mediate outwardly observable behaviors. But measurement can reach only the observable behaviors, leaving loose connections between conceptual and operational definitions, and plenty of room for controversies over the meaning of implicit tests. The AMP with direct and indirect instructions defines implicit evaluations as those evaluations that influence responses despite the intention to avoid that influence. In contrast, it defines explicit evaluations as those that are intentionally expressed. The advantage is that this method links operational and conceptual definitions in an empirically verifiable way while holding all else constant, in accordance with the \u201cintentionality criterion\u201d of Schacter et al. (1989). Explicit attitudes are those expressed intentionally; implicit attitudes are those expressed despite intentions."}, {"heading": "Implications for Theories of Implicit Attitudes", "text": "Theories of implicit attitudes have been developed mainly to explain dissociations between implicit and explicit measures. Reviews of the literature suggest that the average correlation between implicit and explicit attitude tests is quite low (Blair, 2001; Fazio & Olson, 2003; Hofmann et al., 2005). In the context of such findings, it stands to reason that theories would focus on the differences between implicit and explicit attitudes. However, the present research demonstrates that the correlation greatly increases when extraneous differences between implicit and explicit measures are eliminated. In light of these findings, future theories might take a different direction.\nConsider for example, how theories of implicit attitudes might change if in a future meta-analysis, researchers found, using structurally fitted methods, that the average correlation was actually .70. This may not be a far-fetched scenario, as we found in the\npresent studies strong correlations when features were matched, and the topic of racial attitudes typically elicits implicit\u2013explicit relationships that are lower than for many other topics. When examined across many topics, such a high average correlation may be realistic. Faced with high correlations, theorists might place a greater emphasis on the similarities between implicit and explicit attitudes. Those instances when implicit and explicit attitude tests diverge would become the exception to be explained by specific circumstances, rather than the rule.\nThe results of our studies do not mean, however, that implicit and explicit attitudes are identical. It is difficult to explain some research findings with method differences alone. For example, our studies showed that social pressure uncoupled the two tests even when they were equated in structure and that they correlated differently with person judgments. Other research shows that implicitly and explicitly measured attitudes may change at different rates (Gregg, Seibt, & Banaji, 2006; Petty, Tormala, Brin\u0303ol, & Jarvis, 2006) and that divergence between the two may lead people to seek out more information (Brinol, Petty, & Wheeler, 2006). These results provide evidence that the constructs being tapped by the implicit and explicit tests used in that research can have different determinants and different consequences. But even here, the conclusion that implicit and explicit cognition therefore have these different determinants and consequences relies on the assumption that the only difference between tests is the difference between implicit and explicit cognition. If the tests differ in multiple ways, then the differences observed might be due to any of them. Tests with high structural fit could help narrow the options to isolate the mechanisms that are most critical in this important research.\nEven when implicit and explicit tests are correlated in the .50 range (as they were in our studies, mean r .53 for structurally equated tests), there remains a great deal of variance for which researchers must account. As the correlation between implicit and explicit tests grows larger, however, the need for theories to explain divergence becomes smaller, and the need to explain similarities becomes greater. It is therefore important to sort out when low correlations between implicit and explicit measures reflect real differences between accurately measured constructs and when they reflect stronger correlations obscured by methodological differences. In many cases, researchers want to ask questions specifically about those situations in which implicit and explicit evaluations differ. In those cases especially, it is important to hold irrelevant aspects of attitude measurement constant so that dissociations can be traced to psychological differences rather than to method differences."}, {"heading": "Flaw or Feature?", "text": "We have treated many of the differences between implicit and explicit tests as flaws to be fixed to more cleanly make distinctions between implicit and explicit cognition. Readers may find some of these differences to be valuable features instead. For example, researchers might be interested in the different levels of complexity involved in responding to explicit attitude questionnaires versus simple items on an implicit test. Or the slow presentation of questionnaire items versus the fast presentation of priming stimuli might be of theoretical interest. One person\u2019s feature is another\u2019s flaw, and the answer depends on one\u2019s purpose.\nWe agree that such differences are potentially interesting and important. Our argument is not that implicit and explicit tests should always be equated on these features, regardless of the research question. Our argument is that more will be learned if researchers design implicit and explicit tests that differ specifically on those features that are relevant for their particular question, in the same way that experimental manipulations are targeted to answer a specific question.\nMental processes can be automatic or controlled in a variety of senses (Bargh, 1989), and the same applies to implicit versus explicit attitude tests (De Houwer & Moors, 2007). In this article, we have focused on intent, one feature essential to the implicit\u2013 explicit distinction. There are, of course, other important distinctions that researchers often wish to draw. For example, a researcher might wish to present the attitude objects slowly in the direct test to encourage participants to think elaborately about them. Of course, differences could be driven by intent, by processing time, or by both. These explanations could be teased apart, if desired, by varying them independently. Our recommendation on the basis of this research is that researchers should identify those cognitive processes that are most important to the research question (such as intent, elaboration, awareness of the attitude object, etc.) and manipulate those features. That requires some theory-guided choices about what factors researchers expect to make a difference and why. Although many measurement techniques do not allow for this possibility, we have proposed a method that allows researchers to manipulate many differences between implicit and explicit tests, one feature at a time. The critical point is that each important feature can be deliberately manipulated to test hypotheses, without confounding these features with extraneous differences. Doing so not only provides greater methodological precision but also encourages researchers to specify what mental processes they refer to when using terms such as \u201cimplicit\u201d and \u201cexplicit,\u201d as has been suggested by many authors (Bargh, 1989; Fazio & Olson, 2003; De Houwer & Moors, 2007)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Sometimes differences between test structures are mistaken for differences between implicit and explicit thought. We suggested one means for equating test structures to solve that problem. When the tests were equated, much of the divergence between them evaporated, leaving implicit and explicit tests highly correlated. But even when equated in structure, direct and indirect tests did not agree perfectly. A snug structural fit still leaves room for the kinds of differences predicted by dual process theories. In fact, those remaining divergences are all the more interesting because method-based explanations can be ruled out with greater confidence. As with microscopes and telescopes, implicit tests require delicate focusing. The more closely the tests are aligned, the easier it is to see their similarities. And that makes it easier to focus clearly on their differences.\nReferences\nAjzen, I., & Fishbein, M. (1977).

Studies 1\u20133 revealed that activating thoughts of one\u2019s parent in response to mortality salience (MS) reduced death-thought accessibility and worldview defense and increased feelings of self-worth. Studies 4\u20135 demonstrated that MS led to greater ease of recalling positive maternal interactions and greater difficulty recalling negative interactions, and increased attraction to a stranger who was described as being similar to one\u2019s parent. If reliance on parents for terror management purposes reflects the operation of attachment mechanisms, then such effects should vary on the basis of an individual\u2019s attachment style. Study 6 demonstrated that, after MS, insecure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with their parents, whereas secure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with romantic partners.\nKeywords: terror management, mortality salience, adult attachment, close relationships, parents\nResearch on adult attachment over the past 2 decades has provided general support for Bowlby\u2019s (1982) notion, based partly on Freud (1905/1957), that as people mature, their relationships with their romantic partners tend to take on many of the psychological functions formerly served by their relationships with their parents. The management of existential anxiety appears to be among these functions. A large body of evidence shows that close relationships serve a terror management function in that they help people cope with the awareness of the inevitability of death (Mikulincer, Florian, & Hirschberger, 2003, 2004). However, like much\nof the adult attachment literature, the extant research connecting terror management and attachment needs has focused extensively on romantic and other close peer relationships but not on the primary attachments that presumably form the impetus for later attachment representations. The present research explored the role that the original safe haven provided by one\u2019s parents plays as an ongoing psychological bulwark against the problem of death. Drawing from terror management theory (TMT; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986), in six experiments we examined whether parental attachment, even in young adulthood, continues to serve existential needs.\nAttachment and Managing Terror\nDespite somewhat different emphases, TMT and attachment theory share common roots (e.g., Freud, 1930/1939; Horney, 1937; Mead, 1934; Rank, 1929/1973; Sullivan, 1953) and provide complementary insights into the psychological processes that enable people to feel secure and manage their fears in a threatening world. Bowlby\u2019s (1982) attachment theory posits that because the helpless infant\u2019s survival is dependent on the care and protection of others, infants are predisposed to form attachment relationships with others (initially the parents) who offer care and protection against external threats (e.g., starvation). Thus, attachment theory views distress regulation as the primary impetus for the maintenance of the attachment bonds through which the child\u2019s survival is assured. A substantial empirical literature accordingly demon-\nCathy R.

The theory proposes that people manage this fear by securing self-esteem by believing in and living up to the standards of a cultural worldview that imbues life with meaning, order, value, and permanence. Empirical support for TMT is provided by converging evidence from over 350 experiments conducted in at least 15 countries testing variants of five basic hypotheses. This research has shown that (a) increasing self-esteem makes people less prone to anxiety in response to threats; (b) subtle reminders of death (mortality salience; MS) produce increased positive reactions to those who support one\u2019s worldview and negative reactions to those who threaten it, increased self-esteem striving, and greater preference for information that is well-structured or fits specific templates for meaning; these effects have been obtained relative to a diverse array of control conditions; (c) increasing self-esteem or validating one\u2019s worldview eliminates the effect of MS on self-esteem striving and worldview defense; (d) threats to self-esteem or one\u2019s worldview increase the accessibility of death-related thoughts, and boosts to self-esteem or faith in one\u2019s worldview reduce the accessibility of death-related thoughts; and (e) evidence of the existence of a literal afterlife eliminates the effect of MS on self-esteem striving and worldview defense. These effects have been observed across a multitude of different aspects of cultural worldviews and sources of self-esteem (for a recent review, see Greenberg, Solomon, & Arndt, 2008).\nIn the first presentation of TMT, Greenberg et al. (1986) briefly suggested a terror management function of close relationships due to the initial role of parents in offering protection from anxiety, and then later, the capacity of close relationships to bolster an individual\u2019s self-esteem and faith in his or her cultural worldview (i.e., worldview validation). Integrating TMT and attachment theory, Mikulincer and colleagues (2003, 2004) have argued that people pursue close relationships because they provide protection against existential concerns through a basic emotional attachment mechanism (Bowlby, 1982), as well as by providing self-esteem and validation of one\u2019s cultural beliefs.\nA considerable body of evidence supports this analysis. For example, reminders of death lead people to initiate interactions with other people (Taubman-Ben-Ari, Findler, & Mikulincer, 2002), heighten feelings of personal competence and reduce fear of rejection (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2002), and increase their desire for intimacy and commitment in romantic relationships (Florian, Mikulincer, & Hirschberger, 2002). Furthermore, death-related primes are among the types of threats that increase the accessibility of attachment constructs (Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002) and having participants imagine either a separation from or argument with a romantic partner increases the accessibility of death-related thoughts and instigates worldview defense (Florian et al., 2002; Mikulincer, Florian, Birnbaum, & Malishkevich, 2002). Building from this research, Hart, Shaver, and Goldenberg (2005) suggested that because close relationships, self-esteem, and cultural worldviews are developmentally intertwined, threats associated with one component of the security system result in compensatory activation of other components. Notably, although there is clear evidence\nfor the role of close relationships in terror management research, all of this research has focused on peer-to-peer relationships. Studies have yet to consider what role, if any, parental attachment plays in such processes.\nThe Present Research\nAlthough Bowlby (1982) focused on the importance of parents as attachment figures in the shaping and functioning of the attachment system during infancy and childhood, he also believed that a child\u2019s early relationship with his or her parents serves as a basis, or prototype, for subsequent relationships throughout the lifespan. Such prototype-like dynamics have been advanced in the attachment literature by findings that, in adulthood, there is some degree of overlap between attachment security in parental and romantic domains (e.g., Collins, 1996; Owens et al., 1995; Sroufe, Egeland, & Kreutzer, 1990; van IJzendoorn, 1996; also see Fraley, 2002, for meta-analysis on attachment stability from infancy to adulthood). This idea has also been advanced in a variety of studies indicating that as people mature, their attachment to and use of parents for emotional security gradually diminishes (e.g., Doherty & Feeney, 2004; Fraley & Davis, 1997; Furman & Buhrmester, 1992; Hazan & Zeifman, 1994; Mayseless, 2004; Trinke & Bartholomew, 1997), and their relationships with romantic and peer partners tend to take on many of the psychological functions formerly served by their relationships with their parents (see, e.g., Allen & Land, 1999; Cassidy & Shaver, 1999; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Mikulincer & Goodman, 2006; Simpson & Rholes, 1997; Weiss, 1986). Perhaps because of this, little attention has been paid in personality and social psychology to the influence of adult affectional ties to parents on psychological well-being across the lifespan.\nHowever, given that the relationship with one\u2019s parents is the initial attachment bond that creates cognitive models posited to influence all later relationships (Bowlby, 1982; Freud, 1930/ 1939), the question of whether one\u2019s parents continue to provide emotional security and buffer the existential concerns of the mature adult seems an especially important one for the continued integration of TMT and attachment theories. To the extent that parents represent the initial security bond, from a terror management perspective, they may remain helpful into adulthood when people need to allay their existential fears. In other words, if children\u2019s relationship to their parents influences relationships and attachment in later life, and if affectional ties to the parents are an enduring bond across the lifespan, then such attachment may play a pivotal role in how adults manage existential concerns about their mortality. The results of Mikulincer and Shaver (2004) suggest that parents may indeed play such a role. Parents were more frequently nominated as attachment figures than other relationships, and traits associated with parents (like those associated with other relationships) were likely to be internalized as part of the self. Further, Fraley and Davis (1997) found that a majority of their college-aged participants (60%) used their parents as primary attachment figures. However, in contrast to research examining the death-anxiety-buffering function of secondary attachment relationships (e.g., romantic partners, friends; for a review see\nMikulincer et al., 2003, 2004), to our knowledge the following experiments are the first to empirically explore whether people\u2019s primary attachment to their parents also serve a terror management function in response to intimations of mortality.\nIt is important to note that we are not suggesting that parental relationships uniquely serve terror management functions. The research cited in the preceding section is quite clear that close relationships (such as those with romantic partners or friends) are vital buffers against death-related cognition and play an important role in terror management processes. Rather, we suggest that an important question concerns whether for young adults, parents do so as well and therefore should be added to the lexicon of existential interpersonal resources.\nTo provide initial insights into whether parental attachments serve terror management functions, we assessed three basic hypotheses. First, if parental attachment buffers death-related concerns, then rendering salient parental representations should reduce the defensive consequences of death reminders that would otherwise occur. To examine this possibility, we followed the strategy of previous TMT research. That is, previous research has established that self-esteem buffers the consequences of concerns about death by finding that situational boosts to self-esteem as well as opportunities to affirm valued aspects of the self reduce worldview defense and death-thought accessibility after MS (e.g., Arndt & Greenberg 1999; Florian et al., 2002; Harmon-Jones et al., 1997). Building from this literature and seeking to provide an understanding of how parental attachment can impact terror management processes, we examined in our first line of inquiry whether the activation of parental representations would attenuate MS induced deaththought accessibility (Study 1) and worldview defense (Study 2). Study 3 extended the analysis by exploring whether the accessibility of thoughts of a parent would be an important resource people could use to boost their self-esteem in response to mortality concerns.\nFollowing the approach of previous research on the effects of MS on self-esteem and close relationship striving (e.g., Dechesne et al., 2003; Mikulincer & Florian, 2000; TaubmanBen-Ari et al., 2002), we focused in our second line of inquiry on parental attachment as a potential psychological resource to which people may turn when reminded of their death. That is, if parents serve an anxiety-buffering function for their adult offspring, then people should be more positive toward their parents after MS. This basic idea was examined in Study 4, which assessed the effect of MS on participants\u2019 ease or difficulty in recalling positive and negative interactions with their mother. Study 5 explored a further implication of the emerging theoretical synthesis of attachment theory and TMT (e.g., Hart et al., 2005; Mikulincer et al., 2003): that existential threat may affect evaluations of and interactions with others who share important characteristics with one\u2019s parents. Specifically, we utilized Andersen\u2019s (e.g., Andersen & Glassman, 1996) work on transference to examine people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors following thoughts of death toward a person who was described as being similar or dissimilar to a parent.\nThe final study (Study 6) explored the role of individual differences in attachment style in the way existential threats affect evaluations of parents. Specifically, contemporary re-\nsearch on individual differences in attachment refers to two orthogonal dimensions: attachment-related anxiety and avoidance (e.g., Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998). Research has consistently found that securely attached individuals (those scoring low on both dimensions), more than insecure persons, react to threats with an increased tendency to seek out close others for support (e.g., B. C. Feeney & Collins, 2001). This is also the case with regard to reactions elicited by reminders of death. For example, in Mikulincer and Florian (2000), secure persons reacted to MS with a heightened desire for intimacy in their romantic relationships, whereas anxious and avoidants persons did not (also see Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2002). Furthermore, making salient a romantic partner mitigated MSinduced worldview defense only for securely attached individuals.\nThe lack of effects among those high in attachment anxiety may reflect the specific focus of prior research on adult attachments. Anxiously attached individuals may be unlikely to rely on adult relationships to cope with existential threat because they lack the ability to maintain secure adult attachments (e.g., Hazan & Shaver, 1987). Further, although parents and peers can accomplish the same anxiety-buffering function in young adulthood for secure individuals (e.g., Doherty & Feeney, 2004; Fraley & Davis, 1997; Hazan & Zeifman, 1994; Trinke & Bartholomew, 1997), more anxious individuals may rely on parents because they have problems transferring attachment functions to extrafamilial figures (e.g., Allen & Land, 1999; Mayseless, 2004). Because no prior adult studies have compared preferences for the solace of different relationships after threat, in Study 6, we included such a comparison to assess the possibility that whereas romantic relationships best serve the terror management needs of securely attached adults, anxious adults will turn to parents when terror management is needed.\nSTUDIES 1\u20133: PARENTAL REPRESENTATIONS AS"}, {"heading": "A BUFFER OF MORTALITY SALIENCE EFFECTS", "text": "Study 1\nIf secure images of parental attachment offer protection from death-related concerns, activating positive cognitive representations of one\u2019s mother should attenuate the delayed increase in death-thought accessibility that has been found to follow reminders of death. To examine this possibility, in Study 1 we randomly assigned participants to a 2 (MS: death vs. dental pain) 4 (parent prime: positive parent, negative parent, positive acquaintance, or neutral acquaintance) factorial design, and we measured the accessibility of death-related thoughts with a word stem completion task. If parents fulfill an anxietybuffering role for their adult offspring, then people should complete fewer death-related words following a manipulation that emphasizes positive support from one\u2019s mother. To ascertain whether any activation of parental representations would attenuate post MS death-thought accessibility, we also included a condition in which participants were asked to visualize a critical, negative interaction with a parent. Finally, to assess whether the predicted effects are specific to activating thoughts of one\u2019s mother and not just a positive interaction with another\nperson, we included a condition in which participants were asked to write about a positive interaction with a recent acquaintance.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred and forty-three students (92 women and 50 men; 1 person did not report his or her age and gender but was included) from two universities participated in exchange for course credit. Ages ranged from 17 to 54 years (M 21.81, SD 6.71).1"}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "Participants completed a packet of materials described as a personality assessment. All questionnaires were identical except for the MS and parent prime manipulations.\nMortality salience. To maintain the cover story, we included in all packets filler questionnaires and then, following previous research (Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, & Lyon, 1989), we randomly assigned participants to answer questions related to either death or another aversive topic. In the MS conditions, the questions were \u201cPlease briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouse in you\u201d and \u201cJot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to you as you physically die and once you are physically dead.\u201d In the control condition, participants were asked parallel questions about experiencing dental pain. This has been the most commonly used aversive thought control condition, and prior research has shown that it yields results similar to other aversive thought control conditions concerning topics, such as uncertainty, upcoming exams, and social exclusion, and similar to neutral control conditions as well (e.g., Landau et al., 2004a, 2004b; Routledge, Arndt, & Goldenberg, 2004; Schimel et al., 1999).\nDelay\u2013distraction. Evidence suggests that distal MS effects occur when thoughts of death are highly accessible but outside of conscious awareness (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1999). Therefore, we asked participants to complete the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and a word search task to provide a 3- to 5-min delay. The word search puzzle was a 10 10 matrix of letters with instructions asking people to search and circle 10 neutral words (e.g., book, movie). We used the PANAS in subsequent analyses to determine whether MS influenced people\u2019s mood, although previous research indicates that it typically does not (see, e.g., Greenberg, Solomon, & Pyszczynski, 1997).2\nParent prime. The second independent variable consisted of a visualization task based on Baldwin and Sinclair\u2019s (1996) research. Specifically, participants were asked to imagine either a negative or positive interaction with a parent. In the positive condition participants were told \u201cPlease write about a time where your mother expressed a positive opinion of you. That is, write about a time when your mother was nonevaluative and simply accepted your for who you are.\u201d In the negative condition, participants were instructed to consider a time where their mother held a \u201csomewhat negative opinion\u201d and \u201cwas very evaluative and accepted you only to the extent that you lived up\nto certain standards.\u201d As in Baldwin and Sinclair, participants in a third control condition were asked to write about a recent acquaintance (i.e., \u201csomeone you recently met\u201d). Finally, we included a fourth condition wherein participants were asked to write about a positive interaction with a recent acquaintance. The instructions were identical to the positive parent condition except the word mother was replaced with someone you recently met. In all conditions, students were instructed to visualize being in the presence of this person (i.e., to imagine the person\u2019s eye color, hair color, sound of his or her voice) and to express their thoughts and feelings associated with this person by writing for the length of a page.\nDeath-thought accessibility. We used a word stem completion task to measure the accessibility of death-related thoughts; this served as the dependent variable. This task is similar to those used in other research (e.g., Bassili & Smith, 1986; Gilbert & Hixon, 1991; Steele & Aronson, 1995; Tulving, Schacter, & Stark, 1982) and presents participants with 25 word fragments, 5 of which could be completed with a neutral or death-related word. This measure has been used successfully in a many terror management studies (e.g., Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, & Breus, 1994; Mikulincer & Florian, 2000). Examples of the neutral words include TAB _ _ (table), _ _ OK (book), and WAT _ _ (water). The death completions were DE _ _ (dead or deed), GRA _ _ (grave or grape), SK _ _ L (skull or skill), COFF _ _ (coffin or coffee), and KI _ _ ED (killed or kissed). Death accessibility scores were the total number of death-related word completions."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Death-Thought Accessibility", "text": "The hypothesis that priming a positive interaction with one\u2019s mother would attenuate death-thought accessibility after reminders of death was tested with a 2 (MS: death vs. dental pain) 4 (parent prime: positive parent, negative parent, positive acquaintance, or neutral acquaintance) between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) on death-thought accessibility scores. The results revealed main effects for MS, F(1, 135) 18.09, p .001, d .99 (with greater accessibility in the MS condition), and parent prime conditions, F(3, 135) 3.14, p .03, d .72 (with less accessibility in the positive parent condition). These effects were qualified by the predicted two-way interaction, F(3, 135) 2.79, p .04, d .66 (see Figure 1).\nReplicating previous research, in the neutral acquaintance conditions, MS led to higher death-thought accessibility than the salience of dental pain, F(1, 135) 9.69, p .002, d .89.\n1 All studies began with an informed consent process and concluded with a demographic page requesting participants\u2019 age and gender (no gender or age effects were found, Fs 1), as well as a detailed debriefing.\n2 In all six experiments, we conducted a one-way ANOVA on the two subscales of the PANAS to examine whether the MS manipulation had an effect on people\u2019s mood, which would affect the dependent variables. Consistent with previous research, the results revealed no significant difference between death and the control conditions on the two subscales (Fs 1, ps .29).\nCritically, as expected, there was no significant difference between MS and dental pain conditions after participants were primed with an accepting, positive mother (F 1). A third comparison was conducted to determine whether priming a critical, negative mother would similarly attenuate the activation of death-related thought (reflecting perhaps a global buffering effect of the attachment system) or whether only positive memories of one\u2019s mother produce this effect. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, the results revealed that after being primed with a critical, negative mother, people in the MS condition completed more death-related words compared to the dental pain condition, F(1, 135) 11.23, p .001, d .92. A fourth comparison found that within the positive acquaintance condition, participants reported greater death-thought accessibility when primed with death (vs. dental pain), F(1, 135) 6.41, p .01, d .52.\nWe also assessed the effect of parent primes within MS conditions. There was a significant difference among cells in the death, F(3, 135) 5.78, p .001, d .87, but not dental pain conditions (F 1). Within the MS condition, activating a positive, accepting interaction with one\u2019s mother led to lower death-thought accessibility than a critical, negative interaction with one\u2019s mother, and either a positive or neutral interaction with a recent acquaintance (Fs 2.97, ps .03, ds .71). No significant differences emerged between the negative parent and acquaintance conditions or between the two acquaintance conditions (Fs 1).\nStudy 1 offers initial support for the hypothesis that positive cognitive representations of one\u2019s parents provide a buffer against the increased accessibility of death-related thoughts produced by reminders of one\u2019s mortality. When reminded of death, participants who were asked to think about a critical, negative interaction with their mother; a positive, accepting interaction with a recent acquaintance; or a neutral relationship with a recent acquaintance evidenced greater death-thought accessibility compared to those in other conditions. Importantly, however, recalling an accepting, positive interaction with their mother reduced participants\u2019 death-thought accessi-\nbility. Taken together, these results provide some insight into how parents play a critical role in defending against existential concerns. Further, the current study clearly demonstrates that any positive relationship (i.e., an acquaintance) will not reproduce the mitigation of death-thought accessibility, suggesting that the current results are not due to feelings of acceptance or positive thoughts in general.\nThere are, however, a few issues with this study. One limitation involves the parent prime manipulation that was used. Specifically, Baldwin and Sinclair (1996) designed the visualization task to determine whether priming interpersonal acceptance or rejection is an important factor in the social construction of self-esteem. Variants of this manipulation have subsequently been used to explore the consequences of different (intrinsic or extrinsic) contingencies of self-worth on general defensiveness (e.g., Arndt, Schimel, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 2002). This suggests that it is important to consider whether we were manipulating aspects of self-esteem rather than the salience of parental approval. But from a TMT perspective, positive feedback from the parent is an initial impetus for the development and desire for self-esteem (e.g., Solomon, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 1991). Because evaluations from one\u2019s parents are conceptually linked to self-esteem, teasing these variables apart would be exceedingly difficult. Therefore, in Studies 2 and 3, we adopted a different strategy for assessing the anxiety-buffering role of parents. First, instead of using a positively or negatively toned visualization task, participants were simply asked to write about a relationship with a parent. Second, unlike the previous experiments, participants were allowed to select which parent they chose to write about, allowing the opportunity to generalize results beyond the mother\u2013 child affectional bond.\nAnother issue is that Study 1 did not compare the buffering effects of parental relationships to other attachment relationships. The present analysis posits that, like other close relationships (Mikulincer et al., 2003), parents continue to provide a terror management resource for their young adult children. However, we have yet to determine whether priming parental and other close attachment figures engenders similar effects within the same study.\nStudy 2\nSimilar to Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to write about their thoughts and feelings associated with death or, in this case, the control topic of losing a limb, to provide another elicitation of a generally aversive cognition. In addition, as in the previous experiment, participants were randomly assigned to complete a visualization task in which they were asked to recall an interaction with a parent, an interaction with a close friend, or a neutral interaction with a recent acquaintance. The dependent measure asked people to evaluate a series of cultural transgressions, an approach that has been widely used in previous terror management research to assess worldview defense (e.g., Florian & Mikulincer, 1997). Consistent with previous research (see, e.g., Greenberg et al., 1997), we predicted that MS, relative to an aversive control, would lead people to respond more negatively to cultural transgressions in the absence of a parent and close friend prime. In contrast, to the extent that parents and close friends fulfill\na terror management function, we hypothesized that making salient such relationships would eliminate these effects. Of course, a critical contingency of this hypothesis is that the parent and close friend do indeed function as an important attachment relationship for the individual. To provide a check on this assumption, we had participants complete a variant of the WHOTO scale; a measure that has been previously used to establish the attachment status of a relationship (e.g., Fraley & Davis, 1997; Hazan & Zeifman, 1994).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 40 women and 20 men from the University of Missouri\u2014Columbia who volunteered to participate in exchange for credits toward a psychology course.

Following a series of personality fillers, participants answered the same open-ended questions about death described in Study 1. In the control condition, participants were asked parallel questions about losing a limb, thus providing a different aversive control group. Because, as noted above, MS effects occur when death thoughts are highly accessible but outside current conscious awareness, we had participants complete the PANAS and a word search to provide a delay.\nRelationship manipulation. We used a modified version of the visualization task described in Study 1. First, instead of using a positively versus negatively toned visualization task, we randomly assigned participants to write about a particular relationship partner. Second, participants were allowed to select which parent they chose to write about, allowing the opportunity to generalize beyond the mother\u2013 child affectional bond. Specifically, in the parent condition, participants were told to \u201cwrite about your parent or parent-like figure\u201d; in the friend condition, participants were told to \u201cwrite about your closest or best friend\u201d; whereas in the neutral condition, participants were told to \u201cwrite about someone you met recently.\u201d With these exceptions, the instructions were otherwise identical to those used in Study 1.\nWorldview defense. The dependent measure was a modified version of Florian and Mikulincer\u2019s (1997) Multidimensional Social Transgressions Scale consisting of four vignettes assessing reactions to both moral transgressions (i.e., an organizer running off with students\u2019 tuition money, a burglar destroying an artist\u2019s life masterpiece; also see Florian & Mikulincer, 1997) and participants\u2019 worldviews (i.e., an immigrant farm laborer criticizing the United States, students burning the American flag in protest; see also Cox, Goldenberg, Arndt, & Pyszczynski, 2007). For each scenario, participants were asked to indicate, \u201cHow severe was this wrongdoing?\u201d and \u201cHow heavily should this person be punished?\u201d All responses were made on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not at\nall) to 7 (very). To assess attitudes toward worldview threatening others, we averaged questions for the four transgression scenarios together to make a worldview defense score ( .74).\nWHOTO scale. To confirm whether parents and close friends serve as attachment figures, we had participants complete a modified version of the WHOTO scale (Fraley & Davis, 1997; Hazan & Zeifman, 1994; also see J. A. Feeney & Hohaus, 2001, for similar procedures). Specifically, participants were instructed to recall the person they were asked to write about earlier and answer a series of eight questions. Three questions tapped into the proximity-related function (e.g., \u201cI like to spend time with my parent\u201d), three items tapped into the safe-haven function (e.g., \u201cI turn to my parent for comfort and support when I am upset\u201d), and two items tapped into the secure base function (e.g., \u201cI can always count on my relationship with my parent\u201d). Instructions and questions substituted closest or best friend and someone you met recently for parent, depending on condition. For each statement, participants were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 9 (totally). Following previous research (e.g., Doherty & Feeney, 2004; Fraley & Davis, 1997; Hazan & Zeifman, 1994; Markiewicz, Lawford, Doyle, & Haggart, 2006), we calculated WHOTO scores by taking the mean response for the three separate subscales ( s .90)."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "WHOTO", "text": "We performed a 2 (MS: death vs. losing a limb) 3 (relationship: parent vs. friend vs. neutral) between-subjects ANOVA on the three subscales of the WHOTO. Across all analyses, the results showed a significant effect for relationship, Fs(2, 54) 8.85, ps .001, ds 1.00, but no significant effect of MS or interaction between relationship and MS (Fs 1.87, ps 16). Pairwise comparisons revealed that both a parent and friend were rated more highly as serving an attachment function (i.e., proximity seeking, safe haven, and secure base) than a neutral acquaintance (Fs 3.75, ps .05, ds 1.00). Further, there was no significant difference between parent and friend scores on secure base and safe haven functioning (Fs 2.84, ps 10); however, a friend (M 8.48, SD 0.73) was rated more highly than a parent (M 7.45, SD 1.75) on proximity seeking, F(1, 36) 5.68, p .02, d .64. These results are consistent with Hazan and Zeifman (1994), who found that components of attachment are transferred from parents to peers in a particular order with proximity seeking first. They are also in line with other work (e.g., Doherty & Feeney, 2004; Markiewicz et al., 2006) showing that although peers may be sought out more on a regular basis for attachment functions in late adolescence, parents continue to provide an important basis of security (safe haven and secure base) for their adult offspring."}, {"heading": "Worldview Defense", "text": "Preliminary analyses revealed that which parent participants wrote about did not affect the results, so this variable is not\nmentioned further.3 A 2 (MS: death vs. losing a limb) 3 (relationship: parent vs. friend vs. neutral) between-subjects ANOVA was performed on the mean transgression score. The results revealed a significant two-way interaction, F(2, 54) 4.15, p .02, d .71, but no main effects (Fs 1; see Figure 2).4 To explicate this interaction, we conducted tests for simple effects of MS within each relationship condition. As predicted and replicating many prior studies, MS (relative to losing a limb) increased defensive reactions to moral transgressors in the neutral acquaintance condition, F(1, 54) 6.46, p .01, d .60. In contrast, priming an interaction with a parent and a friend eliminated this effect (Fs 1). We also performed simple effects analyses within each level of the MS manipulation. After MS, participants primed with an acquaintance evidenced more negative responses to the transgressions than participants primed with either a parent or friend (both Fs 6.85, ps .02, d .70), but there was no significant difference between the parent and friend conditions (F 1). Within the control condition (losing a limb), there was no significant difference between relationships (Fs 1).\nThe results of Study 2 provide additional support for the hypothesis that parents serve an anxiety-buffering function for their adult offspring. First, as expected, in the neutral relationship condition, MS led participants to favor a more punitive stance toward moral transgressions, a finding in line with previous research (e.g., Cox et al., 2007; Florian & Mikulincer, 1997) examining worldview defense with such scenarios. Furthermore, as expected, asking people to visualize an interaction with a parent and a close friend eliminated this effect.\nOverall, these findings are important for three reasons. First, whereas Study 1 examined death-thought accessibility, this study extends the parental buffering effect to another well-documented consequence of MS (i.e., worldview defense). Second, whereas Study 1 only compared a parental prime to a recent acquaintance, here we were able to see that parents function similarly to other close relationships (e.g., a best friend). Third, although the first\nstudy shows that a parent might help people deal with distress, it is not clear whether these effects have anything to do with attachment mechanisms per se. Study 2 informed this issue and found that both parents and close friends received higher scores on the WHOTO scale, demonstrating that both relationships more strongly fulfill attachment needs for our participants. However, further evidence that parents are a part of their adult offspring\u2019s attachment matrix would be provided by showing similar effects when parents are primed as when another close relationship, such as that with a romantic partner, is primed. Study 3 was designed in part to test this possibility.\nStudy 3\nPrevious research has shown that reminders of death increase various forms of self-esteem striving (see Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Arndt, & Schimel, 2004, for a review). Interestingly, research investigating possible direct effects of MS on self-esteem scores have yielded null or inconsistent results (e.g., Koole, Dechesne, & van Knippenberg, 2001; Sowards, Moniz, & Harris, 1991). Pyszczynski et al. (2004) argued that this is because people are not free to believe anything they like, and must, to a certain extent, base their self-evaluations on some semblance of reality (i.e., they must maintain an illusion of objectivity about the manner in which their self-evaluations are derived; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987). This implies that when the need for self-esteem is increased by reminders of death, people will work especially hard to demonstrate their worth to both themselves and others, and will recruit whatever resources they have available to support positive feelings about themselves. To the extent that close interpersonal attachments are important sources of self-worth (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Brennan & Bosson, 1998; Brennan & Morris, 1997; Crocker, Luhtanen, Cooper, & Bouvrette, 2003; Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994a; Mikulincer, 1995; Murray, Griffin, Rose, &\n3 In both Studies 2 and 3, we checked to see if which parent participants chose to write about played a role in the effects of interest. In Study 2, 65% of participants chose to write about their mother, 30% of participants chose to write about their father, and 5% of participants chose to write about both, and WHOTO scores were not related to which parent was written about (F 1). In Study 3, 45% of the participants chose to write about their mother, 50% of participants chose to write about their father, and 5% of participants chose to write about both. In both studies, there was no effect of MS on which parent participants wrote about ( ps .41), and which parent was written about did not influence responses on the dependent measures (Fs 1).\n4 We conducted a series of analyses to determine whether individual differences on the WHOTO could explain the effects of the relationship prime on the evaluation of moral transgressions. Separate 2 (MS: death vs. losing a limb) x 3 (relationship: parent vs. friend vs. neutral) analyses of covariances (with WHOTO subscale scores entered as covariates in separate analyses) revealed no main effects of the WHOTO (Fs 1.88, ps .18). Further, including the separate subscales in the model did not affect the significant two-way interaction between MS and relationship primes on transgression scores (Fs 4.06, ps .02). Further, to determine whether more attached individuals reported less worldview defense after MS and the relationship primes, we examined within-cell correlations between the WHOTO and moral transgression scores. These analyses were nonsignificant (rs .45, ps .19).\nBellavia, 2003; Park, Crocker, & Mickelson, 2004), we would expect that the recent priming of caring attachment figures would make it easier to feel good about oneself when faced with existential threats.\nStudy 3 tested this hypothesis by reminding participants of either death or an aversive control topic, priming thoughts of relationship figures or neutral others, and then assessing selfesteem. We measured self-esteem at the implicit level by using a pen-and-paper implicit association task (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998).5 To continue our exploration of possible similarities and differences between parental attachment and other types of attachment relationships, we primed thoughts of either a parent, a romantic partner (the most commonly studied type of adult attachment figure), and a neutral other. To the extent that close relationships serve as a buffer against existential anxieties, activating parental and romantic relationships following reminders of death should lead people to feel secure and, thus, exhibit higher implicit feelings of self-worth.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Forty-nine women and 29 men recruited from introductory psychology classes at the University of Missouri\u2014Columbia participated in exchange for course credit. Ages ranged from 18 to 22 years (M 18.84, SD 0.91)."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "Participants completed questionnaire packets in a classroom setting and were given course credit for participation. At two times during the course of the study, participants were instructed to stop working by a \u201cstop\u201d page in the questionnaire packets to complete an IAT.\nPractice IAT. Greenwald et al. (1998) developed the IAT to measure automatic concept\u2013attribute associations. An assumption of the test is that strongly associated (compatible) attribute concept pairs (e.g., the concepts flower and pleasant) should be easier to classify together than weakly associated or opposed (incompatible) attribute concept pairs (flower and unpleasant). Strength of association is calculated by comparing one pairing (flower, pleasant) to another type of pairing (flower, unpleasant; Greenwald et al., 1998).\nIn the present study, IAT procedures were modeled closely after those used by Nosek and Lane (1999; also see Teachman, Gapinski, Brownell, Rawlins, & Jeyaram, 2003, for similar procedures with a pencil and paper version).6 Practice trials were included to teach participants the IAT procedure. The task was explained as an attitudes questionnaire, and participants were told they would be categorizing words on the basis of category labels presented at the top of each page. Participants were informed that this was a timed task and instructed to work as quickly as possible while making as few errors as possible. They were also instructed to place their pen or pencil in a box at the top of the page and wait for the experimenter\u2019s signal to begin. Participants were presented with the category labels and words for the task and were asked to briefly study the words they would be classifying. Finally, they were told\nto attend to the category labels presented at the top of each page because the categories changed from page to page.\nOnce participants read the instructions and were ready to begin the IAT, the experimenter told them to turn to the next page. Half of the participants were presented with insect or bad (flower or good) first, and the other half were presented with insect or good (flower or bad) first. Participants were given 20 s to classify 40 words. When the experimenter said \u201cstop,\u201d participants were instructed to turn the page and place their pen or pencil in a box at the top of the next page and wait for the signal to begin classifying the words on that page. On this next page, participants classified words with the opposing category labels (again 20 s to classify 40 words). We counterbalanced the two tasks to eliminate order effects. Following the first IAT, participants were told to work through the remainder of the packet at their own pace. An example of the pen-and-paper-based version of the IAT can be obtained at www.briannosek.com.\nMS. Following a series of personality fillers, participants were randomly assigned to write about death or experiencing personal failure. We adopted failure to control for the threat of self-relevant aversive cognition, and it has been used in a number of prior terror management studies (e.g., Arndt, Greenberg, & Cook, 2002). Following the MS manipulation, we had everyone complete the PANAS Mood scale (Watson et al., 1988) and a word search puzzle to provide a delay before assessment of the primary dependent measure.\nRelationship prime. Participants were asked to complete a visualization identical to the one described in Study 2. However, rather than having people imagine a relationship with a close friend, we randomly assigned participants to write about a romantic partner, a parent, or, in the control condition, a recent acquaintance. In the romantic partner condition, participants were instructed to write about their \u201ccurrent or most recent romantic partner.\u201d\nImplicit self-esteem. The dependent measure consisted of a pen-and-paper IAT designed to measure implicit self-esteem (see\n5 Although much of the research on attachment and self-esteem has relied on explicit self-report measures (e.g., Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Collins & Read, 1990; J. A. Feeney & Noller, 1990; Mickelson, Kessler, & Shaver, 1997), we decided to use an IAT in the current study for a couple of reasons. First, as already noted, previous TMT research on the effects of MS on (explicit) self-esteem has produced mixed results (e.g., Koole et al., 2001; Sowards et al., 1991). Since the current study was looking at the intersection between attachment, terror management, and self-esteem concerns, we decided to use the IAT procedure. Second, in light of previous work that has found that explicit self-esteem is a poor predictor of people\u2019s quality of relationship with their parents (see, e.g., Farnham, Greenwald, & Banaji, 1999, for a review), the IAT was useful in the present study to determine whether adult children\u2019s self-esteem is related to parental attachment.\n6 Since the study was conducted in a classroom setting (i.e., 10\u201315 students/session), we chose the pencil-and-paper-based version of the IAT because it could be administered to large groups of people at one time setting. Previous research on the similarities and differences between paper-and-pencil and computerized IAT tasks have found that the two measures are highly correlated with one another (r .91; Nosek & Lane, 1999).\nGreenwald & Farnham, 2000, for similar implicit self-esteem procedures). Following procedures outlined above, participants were given two categorization tasks in which they were given 20 s to classify 40 words that were presented on a list on a single page with categorization instructions printed on both the left and right side of the column of critical words. For one of these categorization tasks, the left column asked participants whether the words were related to either self (myself, me, my, self, mine) or good (wonderful, smile, happy, joy, pleasure), and the right column asked participants whether the words were related to either other (other, they, their, them, theirs) or bad ( pain, grief, agony, sickness, terrible). For the second task, the combination was reversed so that participants were to categorize words as either self-related or bad on the left side of the page while also categorizing these same words as either other-related or good on the right side of the page. We counterbalanced the two tasks to eliminate any order effects. As with the practice IAT, participants were asked to work as quickly and accurately as possible, and they were told to try to avoid making mistakes (e.g., misclassifying a word) but to continue without stopping if this was to occur.\nFollowing procedures outlined by Nosek and Lane (1999) and Teachman et al. (2003), we checked data to make sure that participants completed a minimum of five correctly identified items for each IAT page as evidence that they understood and attended to the task. Additionally, IAT pages were inspected for high error rates (i.e., 35% incorrectly classified items). Data for 2 women were excluded because of excessive errors, thereby bringing the total sample size down to 76 individuals. We calculated scores by counting the number of correctly classified words for each task (dropping all errors).7 Thus, the variable of interest was the difference in the number of correctly classified items under the two category pairings (i.e., the compatible block [self good] minus the incompatible block [self bad]). Therefore, a higher score indicates higher feelings of self-esteem."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "To examine whether reminders of mortality interact with parent and romantic partner primes to affect self-esteem, we performed a 2 (MS: death vs. failure) 3 (relationship: parent vs. romantic partner vs. neutral) between-subjects ANOVA on the IAT selfesteem scores.8 The results revealed a marginal effect for MS, F(1, 70) 3.64, p .06, d .47, with participants in the death condition (M 7.63, SD 4.92) manifesting higher selfesteem than participants in the failure control condition (M 5.50, SD 5.08). The results also showed the predicted MS Relationship Prime interaction, F(2, 70) 3.64, p .03, d .65 (see Figure 3).\nTests for simple main effects revealed that whereas there was no effect of MS in the neutral acquaintance prime condition, F(1, 10) 1.21, p .28, both parent and romantic partner prime participants evidenced higher implicit self-esteem after MS than failure salience, both Fs(1, 70) 4.23, ps .04, ds .42. Looked at differently, within the MS conditions, there was a significant effect for priming condition, F(2, 70) 4.35, p .02, d .74. Specific comparisons indicated that after being reminded of death, both parent and romantic partner primes, which did not differ from each other (F 1), led to higher self-esteem than the acquaintance\nprime, both Fs 7.61, ps .01, ds .76. There was no significant difference among the three relationships within the failure condition (Fs 1).\nAs would be expected if attachment figures are important sources of self-esteem that are used to buttress self-worth when the need for protection from existential concerns is heightened, participants who were reminded of death and primed with thoughts of either their parents or romantic partners showed elevated levels of implicit self-esteem. In the absence of priming to increase the accessibility of these persons as sources of self-esteem, MS had no effect on implicit self-esteem. This is consistent with previous findings that self-esteem is not increased after MS without a basis for feeling better about oneself. Similarly, in the absence of MS, priming thoughts of attachment figures did not influence selfesteem. This suggests that the findings of Study 3 reflect a combination of increased need for self-esteem produced by the reminder of death coupled with increased resources for self-esteem provided by the accessibility of thoughts of an attachment figure.\nAs with Study 2\u2019s finding regarding the role of thoughts of close friends in deflecting the impact of MS on worldview defense, the effects of priming thoughts of one\u2019s parents were equivalent to that of priming thoughts of another close relationship figure, in this case, a romantic partner. This implies, as most attachment theorists\n7 Following Nosek and Lane (1999) and Teachman et al. (2003), incorrectly identified items were not included in the difference score because errors indicate misunderstanding of the instructions or an effort to increase speed at the cost of accuracy, which would distort the actual implicit bias.\n8 In Studies 3 and 6, we examined whether the pattern of results varied depending on whether participants were currently involved in a romantic relationship. In Study 3, 40% of the participants indicated that they were in a romantic relationship (ranging from 1 to 84 months, M 14.91, SD 15.72); whereas in Study 6, 42% of the participants reported being in a current romantic relationship (ranging from 1 to 48 months, M 13.22, SD 11.73). Across both studies, that there were no significant effects of relationship status or interaction with relationship status on any of our analyses ( ps .19).\nhave suggested (e.g., Ainsworth, 1989, 1991; Bowlby, 1982; Shaver & Mikulincer, 2004), that a variety of different types of relationships, including parents, close friends, and romantic partners, function in similar ways to provide protection against existential fear. Most people probably use a variety of others for this purpose. This is not to imply, however, that these relationships are necessarily interchangeable or that all people use all of these types of relationships for terror management purposes. The question of who uses particular types of relationships for existential protection is an important one that is taken up in Study 6.\nSTUDIES 4\u20135: PARENTS AS TERROR"}, {"heading": "MANAGEMENT RESOURCES AND THEIR EFFECTS", "text": "ON INTERPERSONAL JUDGMENTS\nFollowing the approach of previous terror management research on the functions of self-esteem and close relationships, in our second set of studies we focused on the impact of MS on people\u2019s striving to use their cognitive representations of their parents for this purpose. Study 4 assessed the effect of MS on participants\u2019 momentary recollections of their mothers, and Study 5 assessed the effect of MS on people\u2019s evaluation of a novel other who was described as being similar or dissimilar to a parent.\nStudy 4\nJust as using self-esteem for effective anxiety-buffering requires that people recruit resources that make them feel good about themselves (as demonstrated in Study 3), we suspect that using cognitive representations of parents for these purposes requires that these representations remain positive. From a TMT perspective, the more favorable the cognitions about a source of security, the more effective that source becomes as a buffer against existential fear. This need for positive parental representations should be especially great when one\u2019s need for existential protection is elevated. Study 4 examined this possibility.\nInstead of using the parental visualization exercise as an independent variable as in Studies 1\u20133, here we used a variant of it as a dependent variable. After an MS manipulation, participants were asked to recall a positive, accepting interaction with their mother and a critical, negative interaction with her. Thus, we hypothesized that MS would bias people toward positive representations of their parents, making it easier to recall positive interactions with them and more difficult to recall negative interactions with them.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 24 women and 30 men from introductory psychology classes at the University of Missouri\u2014Columbia who participated in exchange for course credit.

The results revealed a significant main effect for evaluation, F(1, 52) 46.00, p .001, d 1.00, with participants having an easier time recalling a positive interaction with their mother (M 11.97, SD 3.47) than a negative one (M 6.77, SD 4.23). The MS main effect was not significant (F 1). The results also revealed the predicted interaction between MS and evaluation condition, F(1, 52) 8.53, p .005, d .82 (see Figure 4).9 Simple main effects analyses within the evaluation conditions revealed a significant difference between death and dental pain conditions for both positive, F(1, 52) 6.10, p .02, d .68, and negative, F(1, 52) 4.30, p .04, d .53, scores. After being reminded of their mortality, people had an easier time recalling a positive interaction with their mother and a more difficult time recalling a negative interaction with their mother compared to the dental pain condition.

In both cases, participants had an easier time recalling a positive interaction with their mother compared to a negative one, though as shown by the aforementioned comparisons, this effect was stronger in the MS condition. These effects were not moderated by order of the tasks (Fs 1).\nUtilizing the parent primes from the previous experiments, we intended in the present study to examine how reminders of mortality affect the repository of parental images that people can more easily bring to mind. The present results demonstrate that when intimations of one\u2019s inevitable death are rendered salient, this leads\n9 The presentation order of the visualization tasks did not affect the results (Fs 2.73, ps .11).\nto a cognitive orientation that disposes people to more easily recall positive accepting images of their mother. Such findings, in turn, provide further insight into the effects documented in the initial three studies and also suggest further avenues of empirical inquiry. That participants were more in tune with these positive motherly images after MS explains in part why the buffering effects were observed in Studies 1\u20133; that is, such parental images apparently reflect a desired source of solace for dealing with concerns about mortality. Moving forward, these findings also suggest that reminders of death may affect evaluations of and interactions with others who share important characteristics with one\u2019s parents. Study 5 was designed to provide more direct insight into this possibility.\nStudy 5\nThe idea that ideation about early relationships with one\u2019s parents may resurface in later relationships with others is common to a wide variety of psychological theories (e.g., attachment theory, Bowlby, 1982; objects relations theory, Winnicott, 1960; social learning theory, Bandura, 1977; Sullivan, 1953; attraction\u2013 similarity; Byrne, 1971). Of interest, the concept of transference, as originally proposed by Freud (1912/1958), refers to the phenomenon whereby aspects of past relationships with significant individuals resurface in and influence current interpersonal relations. More recently, Andersen and colleagues (e.g., Andersen & Baum 1994; Chen & Andersen, 1999) have applied these ideas to interpersonal relationships and have developed methods for studying transference in the laboratory. According to Chen and Andersen (1999), when something about a new person reminds the perceiver of a significant other, the stored representations of the significant individual are readily accessible, either consciously or unconsciously and, in turn, are applied to the new person, thereby influencing the perceiver\u2019s interpretations of and responses toward the new person.\nIn his analysis of what he referred to as \u201cthe spell cast by persons,\u201d Becker (1973) built on Freud\u2019s concept of transference and argued that other transference relationships play an important role in providing psychological protection against the awareness of death. He proposed that part of the reason people idealize meaningful others, including loved ones, leaders, and cult figures, is that they seek to use the power of others to protect them from existential fear. This implies that transference may be especially likely to occur when the problem of death is salient.\nBuilding on the work of Andersen and her colleagues (e.g., Andersen & Baum 1994; Chen & Andersen, 1999), in the present study we examined reactions to a potential interaction partner as a function of MS and positive characteristics shared with a significant other, specifically, one\u2019s opposite-gender parent. After being reminded of death (or not), participants were provided with a personality profile from an unknown partner with positive characteristics similar to either their own opposite-gender parent or someone else\u2019s parent. Our primary reason for choosing the opposite-gender parent was simply to hold that variable constant. However, we also thought that this would be a good choice because it has sometimes been suggested that people tend to be attracted to members of the opposite sex with characteristics similar to their opposite-gender parent (Freud, 1927; Geher, 2000; Little, Penton-Voak, Burt, & Perrett, 2003; Little & Perrett, 2002). We chose to examine the effect of shared positive characteristics because both attachment theory and the present Studies 1 and 4 show that it is positive parental representations that provide security and a buffer against death-related fear. Two primary dependent measures were assessed. First, we examined the participants\u2019 attitudinal evaluation of their potential partner. Second, we obtained a behavioral measure of physical proximity seeking by using a variant of the seating paradigm developed by Macrae and colleagues (Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, & Jetten, 1994). To the extent transference is especially likely to influence evaluations of others when existential threat is elevated, we hypothesized that MS would lead people to evaluate a target person who resembled their parent more positively and to sit closer to that person in an anticipated interaction task.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Seventy-five participants (49 women and 26 men) from the University of Missouri\u2014Columbia participated in exchange for course credit for their introductory psychology classes. Ages ranged from 18 to 22 years (M 18.70, SD 0.89)."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "The experiment took place over two different time periods. Participants signed up for each study separately, and the studies were conducted at different locations on campus. The content and order of the materials for each session are described below.\nSession 1: Generating significant-other characteristics. Participants completed a questionnaire packet described as a personality and relationship assessment in a classroom setting. To obtain the characteristics for the second phase of the experiment, we\nasked participants to provide information about their mothers and fathers. The actual purpose of this exercise was of course not revealed at the initial session. Following Andersen and Baum (1994), we told participants,\nTake a moment to think about your mother. Consider characteristics that you feel uniquely describe your mother and distinguish her from other people (i.e., think about what stands out about your mother in your mind). Next, we want you to generate seven sentences that describe your mother.\nParticipants were also asked to think about and generate a parallel set of sentences about their father. After listing these characteristics, they were asked to rank order each list in terms of their importance for distinguishing each parent from other people. The rank-ordered items were used to construct target descriptions for the partner evaluation task described in Session 2 (following Andersen & Baum, 1994, we selected items ranked 4\u20137 for the task). In addition to general trait characteristics, participants provided demographic information about both parents including age, date of birth, and general hobbies\u2013interests; in addition, as in Andersen and Baum (1994), they were asked to evaluate 42 experimenter provided adjectives for each parent in order to get a reasonable number of irrelevant characteristics for the person perception task described in Session 2. At the end of the session, participants were asked to provide demographic information about themselves, including their age and gender.\nSession 2: Person perception. The actual experiment was conducted in a person perception study that was held at least 2 weeks after the initial session by a different experimenter. This phase of the experiment was conducted in individual sessions in a laboratory setting. These precautions (i.e., different experimenter, individual testing in a lab setting) were included to reduce the connection between the two sessions. Participants were told that the second study was interested in how people form first impressions about one another. The experimenter (who was blind to conditions) explained that the study involved filling out a couple of questionnaires and doing a task with a partner in another room (i.e., briefly talking with another student about a topic chosen at random, e.g., being in college). Participants were randomly assigned to complete one of two different questionnaire packets. The only difference between the packets was the MS manipulation.\nPersonality profile. Participants were asked to complete a personality profile as part of the cover story for the experiment, and participants were told that they would be exchanging this information with their partner prior to the interaction task. The personality profile asked participants to answer a series of questions, including their birthday, major, interests\u2013hobbies, and a few words to describe themselves.\nMortality salience. Participants completed the same MS\u2013 dental pain and delay materials described in the previous studies.\nPartner evaluation. Participants were given a personality profile describing their fictitious partner in the next room. Half of the participants received a profile that resembled their own parent (women received a profile with characteristics that resembled their father, men received a profile with characteristics that resembled their mother) or someone else\u2019s parent. In the own parent condition, the participant\u2019s partner had the same birthday as his or her parent (i.e., the month and day but not year), participated in similar hobbies (i.e., two of the four\nhobbies listed were similar to ones generated by participants in Session 1 to describe their parents), and read a series of characteristics used to describe the target person. As previously mentioned, these included the items ranked 4\u20137 on their forms from Session 1. The remaining three characteristics were obtained from experimentersupplied adjectives also collected at Session 1. In light of previous work that finds that people are able to discern a writer\u2019s sex with better-than-chance accuracy (Hayes, 1996; Sappington & Money, 2003), the partner\u2019s ostensible handwriting was designed to be consistent with the sex of the participant\u2019s opposite-gender parent. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions prior to their participation, and separate experimenters were used to generate the personality profiles.\nParticipants were then asked to evaluate their partner with the assurance that their partners would not have access to their evaluations. The dependent measure consisted of 12 items with scales ranging from not at all to totally, including, \u201cHow much do you think that you would like this person?\u201d \u201cIn general, how positive is your impression of this person?\u201d \u201cHow comfortable do you think you would feel interacting with this person?\u201d and \u201cHow much are you looking forward to completing the task with your partner?\u201d Similar to Study 4, responses were measured with a ruler. The possible range of scores was 1 to 16. We calculated partner evaluation scores by taking the mean response across all 12 items ( .91).\nDistancing task. Once participants finished their partner evaluations, the experimenter directed the participants into another room to complete the interaction task with their partner. This room was much larger than the previous lab space, and the room was completely empty except for two folding chairs left leaning against a wall. The experimenter informed the participant that she was going to check on his or her partner and asked the participant to set up the folding chairs for the task. When the experimenter returned, the participant was told that his or her partner was not ready and was asked to return to their original lab room to complete additional questionnaire forms. Once the participant had left the room, the experiment measured the distance (in inches) between the two chairs (see Macrae et al., 1994, for similar procedures).\nManipulation checks. Participants completed two manipulation checks as part of the second questionnaire packet. First, to make sure that participants read their partner\u2019s personality profile, we asked them to list four things that they remembered about their partner. Next, to determine whether their partner reminded them of their parent, we asked three questions, \u201cDoes your partner remind you of someone that you know?\u201d \u201cTo what extent does this person remind you of your mother?\u201d and \u201cTo what extent does this person remind you of your father?\u201d Responses were indicated on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 9 (totally). These questions were analyzed separately for the manipulation check.\nAt the end of the study, participants were extensively debriefed and probed about the nature of study and whether they saw any connection between the two separate sessions."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Manipulation Check", "text": "Participants recalled, on average, 2.7 items from their partners\u2019 profile, suggesting that they did indeed read the profile.

Since participants were presented with characteristics based on the gender of their parents (i.e., women received their father\u2019s characteristics, men received their mother\u2019s characteristics), separate analyses were performed on the remaining two items (\u201cTo what extent does this person remind you of your mother\u2013father?\u201d).

Following MS, participants who received parent-like descriptions moved the chairs closer together compared to those who received non-parent-like descriptions.\nStudy 5 demonstrated that MS increased attraction and physical proximity to a novel person who shared positive characteristics with the participants\u2019 opposite-gender parent. Because the effect of MS did not extend to a control other who resembled another person\u2019s parent, it cannot be interpreted as a general increase in positivity of evaluations or proximity seeking brought on by the death reminder. Because this preference for others who resemble one\u2019s parent did not emerge in the absence of MS, this result cannot be attributed to a general positivity effect of people viewing the characteristics of their parents as especially desirable. Rather, these results suggest that, as hypothesized, reminders of death increase the appeal of others who resemble one\u2019s parents. Thus, transference reactions to those who share positive features with one\u2019s parents appear to be especially likely when one\u2019s need for existential protection is elevated. Presumably such others are especially attractive under conditions of MS because their similarity to one\u2019s primary attachment figures implies, probably at an unconscious experiential level, that they will be comforting and esteem enhancing and thus useful for terror management purposes.\nUnlike the findings of Andersen and colleagues (e.g., Andersen & Baum, 1994), Study 5 did not find any hint of an effect of similarity to parent in the absence of MS. Given Andersen et al.\u2019s (e.g., Andersen & Baum, 1994) previous findings of transference\neffects in the absence of MS, it is obvious that MS is not a prerequisite for such effects to occur. We suspect that the similarity between parent and novel other in the present study may have been more subtle than that in these previous studies. For example, in Andersen\u2019s work on transference (see, e.g., Andersen & Baum, 1994), partner characteristics are presented one at a time on an index card and participants are asked to memorize each trait for a memory test at the end of the study. Conversely, in the present study participants were simply asked to read a short personality profile about the target person. Although our participants did rate the transference target person as more similar to their parents than the control target person, they did not differentiate between target persons on the more subtle item asking if this person \u201creminds you of someone you know.\u201d In contrast, Andersen et al. (Andersen & Baum, 1994; Hinkley & Andersen, 1996) did find differences on measures similar to this item. This suggests that although transference processes may affect evaluations of those who are highly similar to important others in one\u2019s life on a relatively routine and regular basis, heightened motivation may be necessary for transference effects to occur when the level of similarity between the novel other and transference object is relatively subtle.\nThe present finding that transference effects are increased when mortality is salient are consistent with the ideas of Freud (1958) and others (e.g., Becker, 1973; Sullivan, 1953; Winnicott, 1960) who posit that transference is often used to serve pressing and largely unconscious psychological needs. It is also generally consistent with theories that posit that romantic attraction to those who resemble one\u2019s opposite-gender parent is driven by needs for psychological security (e.g., Freud, 1912/1958). And perhaps most relevant for present purposes, these findings support the attachment theory proposition (e.g., Bowlby, 1982; Brumbaugh & Fraley, 2006; Hazan & Shaver, 1987) that attraction to those who are similar to attachment figures is driven by the security and potential for a safe haven that such others provide.\nThe findings of Study 5 also raise some important questions worthy of additional research. Are these effects specific to reactions to members of the opposite sex who are similar to one\u2019s opposite sex parent? Previous theorists from Freud on (e.g., Daly & Wilson, 1990; Geher, 2000; Little et al., 2003) have speculated about a possible romantic preference for those who share features with one\u2019s opposite-gender parents, and the present study demonstrates that MS increases attraction to such others. The question of whether this effect would generalize to others who are similar to same-sex parents is an important one, but because it is not directly pertinent to the theoretical ideas the present set of studies was designed to test, it is not pursued further here.\nSecond, because the current study only used positive trait adjectives to describe the target person, it is unclear what effect MS would have on evaluations of those who share negative characteristics with one\u2019s parents. Andersen and Baum (1994) found a significant transference effect (evaluating a novel other who resembles an important person from one\u2019s past in a way that reflects one\u2019s feelings about the past other) regardless of whether the similarity was on positive or negative features. This suggests that the transference probably operates on both positive and negative dimensions. However, because our interest here was in MSinduced attraction to those who resemble attachment figures, and because Studies 1 and 4 demonstrate that only positive attachment representations are useful for terror management purposes, this question is beyond the scope of the present work and is not explored further here. Still, how people relate to others who share negative characteristics with attachment figures is an important and intriguing issue for future research on motivated transference processes.\nSTUDY 6: THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ATTACHMENT STYLE\nStudy 6\nStudies 1\u20135 provide converging evidence that parental attachment can play an important role in terror management processes. However, in Studies 2 and 3, both parental primes and close friend or romantic partner primes were found to mitigate the consequences of MS. This leads to the question of how parental attachment relates to other types of attachments and what leads a person to preferentially rely on one or the other type of attachment when his or her need for security is heightened. Although all attachment theories posit that the initial bond with one\u2019s parents or primary caregivers forms the basis on which later relationships are founded, the present studies are the first to document the continued use of these primary attachment relationships to control existential anxiety in adult life. But given that young adults have now been shown to use their romantic partners, close friends, and parents as bulwarks against death-related anxiety, questions about the determinants of which others are selected for such protection must be addressed. As an initial step in this direction, Study 6 explored the role of attachment security in producing such preferences.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore relative preferences for different attachment figures in response to threat. After a copious literature search, we could find no studies that compared preferences for the solace of different relationship types\nas a function of an individuals\u2019 attachment style. Addressing this question poses a methodological challenge: How to assess participants\u2019 relationship preferences among a number of simultaneously available options. To this end, we created a purported marketing survey wherein participants were asked to allocate minutes on a cell phone calling plan to each of four different relationship persons (i.e., parent, sibling, romantic partner, close friend). Following previous TMT research (Mikulincer & Florian, 2000), we hypothesized that low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance (attachment security) would predict increased preference for close relationships with romantic partners. Conversely, after MS, insecurely attached individuals should report increased preference for a parent. However, we predicted that this effect would be specific to those with high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, since previous research has found that such individuals have problems transferring attachment functions from parents to subsequent relationships (e.g., Allen & Land, 1999; Mayseless, 2004). Highly avoidant individuals seem not to value attachments generally (Fraley, Davis, & Shaver, 1998), so we doubted whether they would rely on parents or any other attachment figures after MS.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 100 students (56 women, 44 men) recruited from introductory psychology classes at the University of Missouri\u2014Columbia in exchange for partial course credit.

All packets were identical in content except for the MS manipulation.\nAttachment. Participants completed Griffin and Bartholomew\u2019s (1994b) 30-item Relationship Scales Questionnaire as part of a mass screening session approximately 2 weeks prior to their participation in the study. Previous research attests to the scale\u2019s reliability and validity (e.g., Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994a, 1994b; Kurdek, 2002). Given the present interest in preferences among different relationships, one advantage of this particular scale is that it measures general attachment styles as opposed to those tied to a specific type of (e.g., romantic) relationship. Items were presented on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very like me). Since most researchers currently suggest that attachment should be measured in relation to two distinct attachment dimensions (see, e.g., Fraley & Waller, 1998), we calculated separate anxiety (e.g., \u201cI worry about being abandoned\u201d; .81) and avoidant (e.g., \u201cI find it difficult to trust others completely\u201d; .72) scores following procedures recommended by Kurdek (2002; see also Simpson, Rholes, & Nelligan, 1992).\nMS manipulation. Following filler measures to maintain the cover story, participants completed the same MS\u2013dental pain manipulation and delay tasks described previously.\nCell phone task. The dependent measure was a cell phone minute allocation task that we created to assess preference for\nvarious relationships. Specifically, participants were presented with a questionnaire described as a \u201cConsumer Behavior and Marketing Survey.\u201d To maintain the cover story for the task, we told participants,\nRecent evidence suggests that observing people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors toward certain products can be very informative. By having a fuller sense of how people use a product, researchers gain important insight into how people make decisions and what they look for.\nThe instructions further stated that everyone was randomly assigned to evaluate a common, everyday household product; actually, all participants completed the same cell phone calling plan evaluation. The instructions read,\nImagine you are given a cell phone with 100 minutes allotted to you per week. These are whenever minutes, so you can call anyone at anytime without additional fees or penalties; however, you must partition these minutes in advance. In the space below, indicate how you would partition (or breakdown) your 100 minutes. That is, please indicate how many minutes that you would use to call each of the following people. Keep in mind that your total time should add up to 100 minutes.\nFollowing the instructions, participants were presented with four relationships: parent, sibling, romantic partner, and a close friend. A blank space was placed next to each relationship, and participants were asked to indicate the number of minutes they would use to call each person. We counterbalanced the presentation order of relationships to control for order effects. The dependent measure consisted of the number of minutes allocated to each of the four relationships."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Separate regression analyses were performed on minutes allocated to each relationship (parent, romantic partner, sibling, and close friend). For each analysis, MS (dummy coded) and attachment anxiety and avoidance (centered) were entered simultaneously as predictors in the first step, followed by all two-way interactions in the second step, and the three-way interaction in the third step (Aiken & West, 1991). To ensure participant\u2019s relationship status did not affect the results, we included the amount of time in a romantic relationship (centered) as a covariate (entering zero for people not in a romantic relationship).\nWhereas there were no effects for time allocated to a close friend or sibling (both ps .21), there was an Avoidance Anxiety MS interaction on people\u2019s time allocations to a romantic partner (b \u201316.58, SE 7.17, t \u20132.31, p .02, R2 .18. In order to examine simple slopes, we needed to split the data; thus, we inspected the two-way interaction between MS and anxiety among those above and below the median on avoidance. There were no significant effects among high-avoidant individuals ( ps .34). However, there was an interaction between MS and anxiety among low-avoidant individuals (b 34.76, SE 9.94, t 3.50, p .001, R2 .22; Figure 7). Simple slope tests (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1985) revealed that, after MS, lower attachment anxiety predicted higher time allocations to a romantic partner (b \u201327.54, SE 8.46, t \u20133.25, p .002). No such relationship was present in the dental pain condition ( p .17).\nTo further elucidate this interaction, we examined the effects of MS (vs. dental pain) at 1 SD above and below the mean on continuous attachment anxiety and avoidance scores (cf. Aiken & West, 1991). At high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, reminders of death led to fewer minutes allocated to a romantic partner than did reminders of dental pain (b 50.47, SE 22.40, t 2.25, p .03). As expected, at low levels of anxious and avoidant attachment, however, MS increased the amount of time allotted to a romantic partner relative to the dental pain condition (b \u201316.38, SE 6.83), t \u20132.40, p .02).\nThere was also an MS, anxiety, and avoidance interaction on parent time allocations (b 15.42, SE 5.66, t 2.73, p .01, R2 .15. The Death Anxiety interaction was examined for those scoring above and below the median on avoidance, and the result revealed no significant effects among high-avoidant individuals ( ps .65). However, among low-avoidant individuals, the results revealed an MS Anxiety interaction (b \u201328.62, SE 7.07, t \u20134.05, p .001, R2 .32; Figure 8). Simple slope tests revealed that, after MS, higher attachment anxiety predicted more time being allocated to a parent (b 26.71, SE 6.02, t 4.44, p .001). There was no linear relationship in the dental pain condition ( p .61).\nWe again examined the effects of MS at 1 SD above and below the mean on attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (both continuous). At high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, MS participants allocated significantly more time to a parent than did their dental pain condition counterparts (b \u201332.04, SE 14.47, t \u20132.22, p .03).\nExperiment 6 provides initial evidence of the role of attachment style in determining which of several potential attachment figures one is most interested in interacting with after being reminded of their mortality. Specifically, those scoring low on attachment anxiety and avoidance (i.e., secure individuals) reported increased relative preference for a romantic partner (as measured by the amount of cell phone time allocated to this person) after MS than a control condition. In contrast, for those scoring low on avoidance and high on anxiety (i.e., highly anxious persons), MS led to an increased relative preference for a parent. Finally, there was no\nsignificant relationship between MS and anxiety for those scoring high on attachment avoidance.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate how a person\u2019s attachment style influences the preference for different attachment relationships in response to threat. In so doing, the study replicates, reconciles, and extends the previous studies reported here as well as in the prior work of Mikulincer and Florian (2000). Whereas Mikulincer and Florian found that MS increased a desire for romantic relationship intimacy primarily among securely attached individuals, the present study replicates that finding but also shows that MS increased relational striving toward one\u2019s parents among anxious individuals (i.e., people scoring high on attachment anxiety, low on attachment avoidance). By using a dependent measure that allowed participants to evaluate different relationships, we were able to see that the preferred object of relational strivings after MS differ in theoretically meaningful ways as a function of an individual\u2019s preexisting levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance.\nOne area of ambiguity concerns the responses of those scoring low on both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (i.e., secure individuals). In this study, there was no effect of MS for such individuals on the amount of time allocated to a parent. In Studies 1\u20135, however, we found that parental representations generally served an anxiety-buffering function following reminders of death. One possible explanation for this apparent inconsistency is that the lower preference for parents in Study 6 could have been caused by secure individuals\u2019 higher preference for romantic partners. Indeed, secure individuals on average allocated 79.45 of their 100 minutes to a romantic partner, leaving very few minutes to allocate to the other relationships (i.e., a parent, sibling, and/or close friend). In light of previous research that has found that secure persons react to MS with a heightened desire for close relationships (Mikulincer & Florian, 2000), it makes sense that they would express an increased relative preference for a romantic partner over a parent when given the opportunity to do so. Although the current study provides the first step in examining people\u2019s preferences for relationships as a function of MS and attachment style differences, future research should continue to examine when, where, under what circumstances, and for whom such preferences are more likely to occur."}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "TMT has long posited that the capacity for self-esteem and cultural worldviews to protect people from fears about death develops out of the security provided by early attachment relationships. Although research has examined the role that close romantic relationships (e.g., Mikulincer & Florian, 2000) and other social identifications (e.g., Arndt, Greenberg, Schimel, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 2002; Castano, 2004; Pyszczynski et al., 1996) play in terror management processes, questions about whether one\u2019s more rudimentary attachment to one\u2019s parents continue to provide protection against mortality concerns into young adulthood have not yet been empirically examined. The present series of studies addressed these questions.\nSummary of the Main Findings\nIn the present work, we followed diverse strategies used in previous terror management research to uncover the psychological protection afforded by parental attachments. Specifically, the first series of studies tested whether parents serve an anxiety-buffering function. Study 1 showed that visualizing a positive interaction with a parent eliminated the delayed increase in death-thought accessibility otherwise produced by a reminder of one\u2019s mortality. Study 2 showed that visualizing an interaction with a parent or a close friend eliminated the oft-replicated effect of MS on worldview defense. Study 3 revealed that combining MS and parent or romantic relationship primes led to increased feelings of selfworth. These studies thus attest to the capacity for parental representations to buffer the consequences of thoughts of death.\nThe second series of studies examined specific ways in which people use their parents as a resource for managing mortality concerns. From a TMT perspective, the more favorable the evaluation of a source of security, the more effective that source becomes as a buffer against existential fear. In Study 4, MS increased the ease with which individuals were able to recall positive interactions with their mother and the difficulty they had recalling negative interactions with her. Study 5 demonstrated that MS led to increased (behavioral and evaluative) attraction to a stranger who was similar to one\u2019s opposite-gender parent but had no effect on reactions to a positively described stranger who was not similar to one\u2019s parent.\nFinally, Study 6 explored how variations in attachment style influence people\u2019s reactions toward different personal relationships following MS. This study found that intimations of mortality motivated anxious individuals to show increased relative preference for a parent, whereas secure individuals showed increased preference for romantic partners. Taken together, the results of six studies, using markedly different approaches, suggest that adult offspring continue to use internal representations of their parents as a means of coping with the inevitability of death.\nFrom the perspective of attachment theory (Bowlby, 1982), close relationships are important because they are an effective means for dealing with basic anxieties and as a resource for adjustment. The present findings converge with previous research (see, e.g., Mikulincer et al., 2003) to extend these formulations to the existential fear of death. It seems that close relationships not only protect individuals from real or actual threats but also provide\na symbolic shield against reminders of one\u2019s finitude. As the current research demonstrates, following MS, people are motivated to strengthen their relationship with a parent, who, in turn, may help them manage and diffuse the sense of threat. However, unlike most other threats, the threat of one\u2019s mortality is inescapable, and support from others cannot remove the threat entirely, though it can provide some comfort. That is, mere thoughts of failure (Study 3), pain (Studies 1, 4, 5, and 6), and loss of a limb (Study 2) can be easily dismissed because they can be viewed as unlikely to happen or experiences that people can move past, whereas thoughts of one\u2019s mortality cannot be easily dismissed and death is not so surmountable. Therefore, whereas a number of aversive experiences when relevant are likely to activate the attachment system, the mere thought of them may not do so to the same extent as thoughts of death. In addition, in some of the present work (e.g., Studies 1\u20132), the control condition was not expected to elicit any defensive responses (e.g., worldview defense), and thus there was nothing for the activation of the attachment system to mitigate.\nIssues With the Intersection Between Terror Management and Attachment\nAlthough this work provides insight into the role of parental attachment in terror management, there are some remaining issues that should be noted. Although the present studies examined the role that parents play in buffering concerns about death, there are theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that attachment style would interact with MS to influence the findings (Studies 1\u20135). For example, one would expect individual differences in the ease with which people are able to recall positive interactions with their mothers, as well as the positivity of the interaction, and the vividness of the memory. Although we did not examine attachment-style differences in all of the studies, we feel that the current research is important because it integrates the normative (Studies 1\u20135) and intraindividual (Study 6) aspects of attachment. Hundreds of studies have documented the role of attachment in adulthood, focusing primarily on the domain of individual differences. The primary focus here was on the general role of parental attachment in coping with the threat of mortality. Still, Study 6 did support a moderating role of attachment style, suggesting that when given choices, securely attached people tend to rely on romantic partners, whereas anxious but not avoidant people tend to rely on parents.\nFurther, whereas Studies 1 and 4 focused on perhaps the more basic maternal relationship, fathers can also serve as a source of meaning and security. Although Studies 2, 3, 5, and 6 explored people\u2019s reactions to parent in place of one\u2019s mother, we cannot confidently generalize all of the results to both parents. However, in Studies 2 and 3, we coded the relationship primes for whether people wrote about their mother or father and found that the gender of the parent did not affect the results. Future research should continue to explore when and how people use their fathers, in addition to their mothers, as a source of solace and protection against existential anxieties. Indeed, for certain individuals, fathers may have a more potent influence on attachment processes and psychological security (Shaver, Belsky, & Brennan, 2000).\nThis distinction between parental attachments may be seen as part of a larger issue of how primary attachment fits into the matrix of young adults\u2019 social networks. Studies have shown that under certain conditions, after reminders of mortality, people will seek generalized social affiliation (Wisman & Koole, 2003), attitudinal consensus with larger nationalistic groups (e.g., Pyszczynski et al., 1996), commitment to romantic relationships (Florian et al., 2002), and, now, parental attachment as well. However, what has yet to be explored are the conditions under which people seek the security of particular attachment representations over others. Study 6 provides an initial answer to this question, demonstrating that choice among relationships in response to threat depends on preexisting attachment styles, with securely attached persons showing increased preference for romantic partners, anxiously attached persons showing increased preference for parents, and avoidantly attached persons not showing any increased desire for contact with these persons or their siblings or close friends in response to MS. Although Study 6 provides an important first step toward exploring the determinants of preferences among different attachment figures in response to existential threat, more research is needed to explore the determinants of such relationship hierarchies and preferences.\nOne can adopt an even broader vantage point and conceptualize attachment as one form of existential protection within a larger security system. In accord with this view, Hart et al. (2005) provided evidence of compensatory responses among attachment, self-esteem, and worldview defense mechanisms. The relative preference for utilizing these different resources, however, remains to be investigated. While there may indeed be a tripartite security system, it is likely that as people navigate through life, they prefer to use certain resources over others. Such preferences might vary depending not only on dispositional factors such as attachment style but situational factors as well. For example, one question is whether some types of threats may be more prone to elicit relational striving, whereas other threats may be more prone to elicit self-esteem or worldview relevant responses (Arndt, Greenberg, & Cook, 2002). Further, even within a type of threat, contextual factors may render a particular domain more appealing than others. Overall, in light of the results of Study 3 and that of other research (e.g., Hart et al., 2005), more research is needed into the mechanism by which attachment buffers mortality concerns.\nThe present analysis also provides a foundation from which to consider how the intersection between terror management and attachment relate to lifespan development. Attachment has been much studied as a theoretical concept explaining a child\u2019s relational ties to his or her parents or caregivers; however, there have been relatively few empirical studies of attachment processes in adult children\u2019s relationships and their aging parents (however, see Cicirelli, 1991), as well as the processes that unfold once the tables are turned and the child has children of his or her own. In regard to the former, one possibility is that given the increased vulnerability of parents to illness with increasing age, parents may indeed be more problematic and perceived less as attachment figures for their older children. Although Study 1 found that parents served an anxiety-buffering function for their adult children regardless of age (i.e., participants ranged in age between 17 and 54 years), we were unable to determine whether parents served the attachment needs (as assessed on the WHOTO) of our participants despite age\ndifferences. A second possibility is that watching one\u2019s parents grow old and approach death might actually increase the salience of one\u2019s mortality. Martens, Greenberg, Schimel, and Landau (2004) can be seen as consistent with this view. In this research, similar to reactions to disabled persons observed by Hirschberger, Florian, and Mikulincer (2005), exposure to elderly persons increased death thought accessibility among younger individuals, and reminding younger adults of their mortality resulted in distancing from and derogation of elderly people.\nOf course, there may be important differences between typical elderly persons and one\u2019s parents in terms of their capacity to stimulate thoughts of personal mortality and associated existential dynamics. Perhaps because of the existential protection they provide, in many cases people seem reticent to accept their parents\u2019 aging and increasing vulnerability to mortality. And when such revelations are made, do they also prompt concerns with personal mortality and its consequent defensive reactions? It is worth noting that, while not focused on one\u2019s parents per se, Greenberg et al. (1994) found that thoughts of the death of a loved one did not elicit as strong an effect on worldview defense as thinking about one\u2019s own mortality. Nonetheless, by drawing attention to existential issues and parental attachment, the present studies invite further inquiry into the conditions under which (and the interaction between) parents\u2019 capacity to serve as anxiety buffers and reminders of the transience of life across the lifespan.\nJust as there are important questions to consider when people approach the end of life, so too are there critical questions about the juxtaposition of terror management and attachment as new life begins. Research is needed to explore the existential and attachment dynamics that emerge when children become parents. Wisman and Goldenberg (2005) found that reminders of mortality can increase the desire for offspring, as long as the desire for offspring was not seen by participants as inconsistent with pursuing career choices that might garner prestige and self-esteem. This finding invites consideration of how people juggle the different motives that reminders of death can provoke. The integration of attachment style into this topic (e.g., Rholes, Simpson, & Friedman, 2006), in turn, may help to elucidate how people prioritize different terror management motives across the changing landscape of one\u2019s lifetime.\nConclusion\nThe present research contributes to the growing body of evidence examining the continuation of the parent\u2013child affectional bond across the lifespan (Cicirelli, 1991). Previous attachment research in personality and social psychology has predominately focused on people\u2019s relationships with their romantic partners (e.g., Bartholomew, 1993; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994b; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003; Shaver, Hazan, & Bradshaw, 1988; Simpson, 1990). The current studies build from this work to provide the first empirical demonstration of how adults continue to derive existential security from their continued attachment to parents. Following Freud (1966/1977, Bowlby (1982), and Ainsworth (1989), the present results suggest that parents remain an important source of comfort and security to their adult offspring, enabling their children to deal with basic human\nfears and anxieties\u2014the safe haven of parental comfort does indeed endure.\nReferences\nAiken, L.

Amodio New York University\nPatricia G. Devine University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison\nEddie Harmon-Jones Texas A&M University\nLow-prejudice people vary considerably in their ability to regulate intergroup responses. The authors hypothesized that this variability arises from a neural mechanism for monitoring conflict between automatic race-biased tendencies and egalitarian intentions. In Study 1, they found that low-prejudice participants whose nonprejudiced responses are motivated by internal (but not external) factors exhibited better control on a stereotype-inhibition task than did participants motivated by a combination of internal and external factors. This difference was associated with greater conflict-monitoring activity, measured by event-related potentials, when responses required stereotype inhibition. Study 2 demonstrated that group differences were specific to response control in the domain of prejudice. Results indicate that conflict monitoring, a preconscious component of response control, accounts for variability in intergroup bias among low-prejudice participants.\nKeywords: prejudice, control, ERP, ERN, conflict monitoring\nEspecially when inner conflict is present, people put brakes upon their prejudices. They do not act them out\u2014or they act them out only up to a certain point. Something stops the logical progression somewhere. (Allport, 1954, p. 332)\nSince the publication of The Nature of Prejudice in 1954, Allport\u2019s observation that intergroup responses often require regulation has received volumes of empirical support (Devine & Monteith, 1999). Yet half a century later, the mechanisms through which regulatory processes inhibit unwanted racial biases remain\nunclear. The present research builds on recent advances in cognitive neuroscience to illuminate this mechanism and to apply it to an issue that has long perplexed researchers of prejudice: Why are some egalitarians better than others at responding without prejudice? To date, the prejudice and stereotyping literature has paid little attention to individual differences among low-prejudice people\u2019s ability to respond without bias and has been virtually silent on the mechanism that underlies these differences.\nIndividual Differences in Responding Without Prejudice\nSocial psychological research on prejudice control has traditionally focused on how attitudes of high- versus low-prejudice people affect their behaviors. In this literature, prejudice control refers to responding with one\u2019s egalitarian intention despite the activation of countervailing racial stereotypes. Generally speaking, low-prejudice people are motivated to exert control in their intergroup responses, whereas high-prejudice people are not (Devine, 1989). However, growing evidence suggests that low-prejudice people vary substantially in their effectiveness in regulating expressions of race bias (Devine, Monteith, Zuwerink, & Elliot, 1991; Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002; Gaertner & Dovidio, 1986). For example, when asked how one should respond toward a Black person versus how one actually would respond in an interaction, many low-prejudice people reveal substantial discrepancies between how they should and would behave (Devine et al., 1991). Low-prejudice participants with large should/would discrepancies are more prone to unintentional expressions of bias, especially in situations involving high cognitive load, in which reguDavid M.

These studies provided strong evidence that many low-prejudice people lack the regulatory abilities to inhibit effects of implicit racial bias, especially in situations that limit their opportunity to deliberate when making a response.\nInternal and External Motivations to Respond Without Prejudice\nRecent research on issues of prejudice control suggests that differences in regulatory ability among low-prejudice people may be linked to their motivations to respond without prejudice. Plant and Devine (1998) observed that nonprejudiced responses are typically driven by a combination of two independent sources of motivation: internal (personal) and external (normative; see also Dunton & Fazio, 1997). Plant and Devine developed the internal motivation scale (IMS) and external motivation scale (EMS) to assess these two motivations and found scores on the IMS and EMS to be uncorrelated across several samples. IMS was strongly associated with low-prejudice attitudes and predicted participants\u2019 explicit responses when in private. Although EMS was not associated with domain-general measures of social desirability (e.g., Social Desirability Scale, Crowne & Marlowe, 1960; SelfMonitoring Scale, Snyder & Gangestad, 1986), it predicted higher anxiety and less-biased behavior when intergroup responses were to be made in public. Additional research has addressed the possibility that people who report strong external motivations are not sincere when they also report strong internal motivations. However, these studies demonstrated that high-IMS/high-EMS participants\u2019 intentions to respond in an egalitarian manner are experienced as a moral responsibility that cuts across situations and leads to efforts to control bias even in the absence of external pressure (Plant & Devine, 1998; Plant, Devine, & Brazy, 2003; Plant, Vance, & Devine, 2007). The overarching program of research conducted by Plant, Devine, and their colleagues has shown that the IMS/EMS framework is able to explain a wider range of intergroup behaviors than traditional attitude measures of prejudice. For the present purposes, the IMS/EMS framework is useful for understanding why some low-prejudice people are more effective regulators of intergroup responses than are others.\nAccording to the IMS/EMS framework, all low-prejudice people are highly internally motivated to respond without prejudice, but they vary in their sensitivity to normative proscriptions of bias. Research by Devine, Plant, Amodio, Harmon-Jones, and Vance (2002) explored the possibility that the variance in external motivations among high-IMS participants is associated with differences in their ability to regulate intergroup response. Devine et al. (2002) theorized that different combinations of internal and external motivations corresponded to people\u2019s internalization of nonprejudiced standards into their automatic response tendencies. In building their proposal, they drew upon theorizing in the goals and motivation literature that describes how an extrinsically motivated behavior transitions to being one that is intrinsically motivated. According to self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), behaviors motivated by purely extrinsic reasons are implemented only under external pressures. Thus, extrinsic behaviors are not internalized and tend to be inconsistent across situations. As an individual begins to adopt an intrinsic motivation for the same behavior, their behavior becomes motivated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic motives. This dual-motive state is charac-\nterized by having a behavioral intention that is held consciously and implemented in highly deliberative responses but not entrained at more automatic levels and thus not effectively implemented in less deliberative responses. Finally, behaviors motivated by purely intrinsic reasons are characterized as highly internalized and wellrehearsed and are effectively implemented and highly stable across situations. The motivational profiles provided by selfdetermination theory correspond closely with the IMS/EMS framework and suggest that low-prejudice people motivated primarily for internal reasons should be more effective regulators of intergroup responses than those motivated for a combination of internal and external reasons.\nConsistent with this hypothesis, Devine et al. (2002) found that among low-prejudice people, those who were primarily internally motivated (high-IMS/low-EMS participants) were effective in responding without prejudice when their responses were easy to control (e.g., self-report) as well as those that are difficult to control (e.g., physiological and reaction-time measures of bias; Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002). By contrast, those motivated by a combination of internal and external motivations (high-IMS/high-EMS participants) were effective in responding without prejudice when their responses were easy to control but showed unintentional expressions of bias when their responses were more difficult to control. A third group of individuals, who were not internally motivated (low-IMS participants), exhibited bias on all measures, irrespective of their external concerns (given that responses were made privately). With regard to our central question, this research suggests that high-IMS/low-EMS individuals are good regulators across measures because they have a strong internalized sense for when control is needed, whereas high-IMS/high-EMS individuals are comparatively poor regulators because this internal impetus to control is weaker. This is consistent with the self-determination-theory position that these individuals are still in the process of internalizing egalitarian responses into their dominant response set.\nThe findings and theoretical analysis of Devine et al. (2002; also Amodio et al., 2003) imply that low-prejudice people who are poor regulators of intergroup responses may have trouble determining when control is needed, particularly in situations that do not afford deliberative responding. This analysis suggests that these individuals may be impaired in a nondeliberative aspect of control that is not addressed in extant social psychological models (e.g., Wegener & Petty, 1997; Wilson & Brekke, 1994). In the next section, we describe a neurocognitive model of control that distinguishes between a nondeliberative process of determining the need for control and a more deliberative process of implementing control.\nNeurocognitive Model of Control\nRecent theorizing in the cognitive neuroscience literature suggests that response control involves two distinct processing components, each associated with activity of separate neural structures (Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001). The first is an evaluative component that monitors ongoing responses and is sensitive to conflict between alternative response tendencies. Research suggests that this conflict-monitoring process is constantly active, requires few cognitive resources, and operates below conscious awareness (Berns, Cohen, & Mintun, 1997; Nieuwenhuis, Ridderinkhof, Blom, Band, & Kok, 2001). When conflicting re-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nsponse tendencies are activated, this process alerts a second, resource-dependent regulative component to override the unwanted tendency with an intentional response. The activity level of the conflict-monitoring process is commensurate with the degree of response conflict, and as such, this model represents a \u201cnonhomuncular\u201d mechanism for signaling the need for control. Eventrelated potential (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging research have associated the conflict-monitoring process with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the regulative component with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Botvinick, Nystrom, Fissel, Carter, & Cohen, 1999; Carter et al., 1998). Tests of this model have shown that activation of the ACC is high when prepotent responses are at odds with one\u2019s consciously intended response, such as in the color-naming Stroop task (MacDonald, Cohen, Stenger, & Carter, 2000), the go/no-go task (Kiehl, Liddle, & Hopfinger, 2001), and the Eriksen flankers task (Botvinick et al., 1999).\nWhen applied to the question of why high-IMS/high-EMS individuals have difficulty regulating their intergroup responses, the neurocognitive model suggests the possibility that the conflictmonitoring process of these individuals is not sufficiently engaged when an automatic stereotyping tendency is activated. A lack of conflict at this basic neural level would occur if egalitarian intentions are not strongly represented at a basic, automatic level and thus do not come into competition with the automatic-level stereotyping tendency. It is also possible that the regulative component of control may contribute to regulatory failures. However, this system tends to be linked to more deliberative, consciously guided behaviors. Given past work showing that high-IMS/high-EMS participants and high-IMS/low-EMS participants are equally effective at regulating intergroup responses when deliberation is possible, it is unlikely that the regulative component would explain differences in their ability to regulate nondeliberative behaviors, as observed by Devine et al. (2002) and Amodio et al. (2003). Following this line of reasoning, we hypothesized that differential sensitivity of the conflict-monitoring process to stereotype-related conflict may account for differences in intergroup response regulation between low-prejudice people characterized by high IMS/ low EMS and those characterized by high IMS/high EMS.\nMeasuring Conflict Monitoring With ERPs\nConflict-monitoring processes associated with the ACC may be measured in real time with ERPs. ERPs are electroencephalographic (EEG) signals that reflect a concerted firing of neurons associated with a discrete psychological event (Coles, Gratton, & Fabiani, 1990). The high temporal resolution of ERPs, when measured at high sampling rates, permits researchers to examine the neural activity of a psychological response as it unfolds over milliseconds. The error-related negativity (ERN) component of the ERP has been used as an index of conflict monitoring in much research (Gehring & Fencsik, 2001; Luu, Collins, & Tucker, 2000; Yeung, Botvinick, & Cohen, 2004). The ERN is a response-locked negative-polarity wave that peaks approximately at the time a response is made (Gehring, Goss, Coles, Meyer, & Donchin, 1993). It is most strongly pronounced at the frontocentral midline scalp region and has been demonstrated to originate from the dorsal ACC (Dehaene, Posner, & Tucker, 1994; van Veen & Carter, 2002). ERNs are sensitive to conflicts resulting in errors\n(i.e., failed control) and are therefore useful for examining the role of conflict monitoring when attempts to respond without bias fail. The ERN reflects neural sensitivity to conflict between an intended response and an alternative (incorrect) response that is in the process of being executed. The conflict-monitoring signal is stronger for errors than for correct responses, because for an error, the conflicting behavior is further along in its implementation, and the net level of conflict is therefore much greater (Yeung et al., 2004).\nThe Role of Conflict Monitoring in Race-Bias Control\nAmodio et al. (2004) identified the conflict-monitoring process as an important mechanism for regulating racial responses. Participants in their study completed a sequential priming task designed to assess stereotypic associations, called the weapons identification task (Payne, 2001), while EEG was collected. On each trial of the weapons identification task, a Black or a White face prime was presented briefly, followed by a target picture of either a handgun or a hand tool. Participants\u2019 task was to quickly categorize targets as a gun or tool within a 500-ms response deadline. As in past research involving this task, Black face primes facilitated responses to guns and interfered with responses to tools, suggesting the automatic activation of the violence-related African American stereotype (Lambert et al., 2003; Payne, 2001; Payne, Lambert, & Jacoby, 2002). Given the prepotent tendency to choose \u201cgun\u201d following a Black face, enhanced response control was needed to override this tendency when the target was a tool. To examine the role of conflict monitoring in behavioral control, we computed independent estimates of automatic and controlled processing using the process-dissociation (PD) procedure (Payne, 2001; Jacoby, 1991) and compared these behavioral indices with ERNs associated with responses on high-stereotype-conflict (e.g., Black\u2013tool) versus low-stereotype-conflict (Black\u2013gun) trials. Results showed that ERNs were larger on Black\u2013tool trials, in which stereotype inhibition was required, compared with Black\u2013gun trials, in which the correct response was congruent with the stereotype (and thus, inhibition was not needed). In addition, greater sensitivity of the conflict-monitoring system to race-bias conflict, as indicated by larger ERNs on Black\u2013tool trials, was correlated with higher PD estimates of control but was unrelated to PD estimates of automatic stereotyping (see also Amodio, Kubota, Harmon-Jones, & Devine, 2006). For the present purposes, Amodio et al. (2004, 2006) established a paradigm for examining the conflictmonitoring process in the context of intergroup bias. Here, we applied this paradigm to test our hypothesis that differences in regulatory ability among low-prejudice people are due to differences in the ability of neural systems to detect race-biased conflict.\nStudy 1\nWe examined ERNs associated with stereotype-response control among low-prejudice participants characterized by high internal motivation (but low external motivation) versus those with a combination of high internal and high external motivation, as well as highprejudice participants characterized by low internal motivation. To create groups that were highly representative of these profiles, we recruited participants with IMS and EMS scores in the upper or lower thirds of the participant pool (Alloy, Abramson, Raniere, & Dyller, 1999; Amodio et al., 2003). The extreme-groups approach was critical\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nfor obtaining a true low-IMS group, because IMS scores were highly positively skewed in this sample. In addition, we combined low-IMS participants who reported either high or low levels of EMS, because their responses, which were to be made in private (i.e., without external pressures), were not theorized to differ (Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002; Plant & Devine, 1998). We predicted that highIMS/low-EMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants would report similar pro-Black attitudes, yet high-IMS/low-EMS participants would exhibit greater response control on the weapons-identification task relative to high-IMS/high-EMS participants. Furthermore, we predicted that this difference would be explained by the degree of conflict-monitoring activity during responses in which automatic stereotypes conflicted with intentions. We expected to observe relatively low activity of the conflict-monitoring process among high-IMS/highEMS participants when automatic stereotypes are activated, because their egalitarian intentions are not believed to be represented at the same automatic level of processing and thus would not create conflict. Last, low-IMS participants were expected to show a low degree of response control, coupled with low engagement of conflictmonitoring processes on stereotype-related trials. A low degree of conflict was expected because stereotypic responses are consistent with their prejudiced beliefs.\nTo conduct a strong test of our hypothesis, it was important to use a task that would elicit similar levels of automatic race-biased tendencies across groups. Our past work showed that high-IMS/ low-EMS participants exhibited lower levels of implicit bias than other groups on measures assessing affective/evaluative forms of bias (Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002). However, highIMS/low-EMS participants did not differ from other participants when implicit stereotype associations were measured (Amodio, Stahlhut, & Devine, 2002). This distinction is consistent with research suggesting that implicit stereotyping reflects different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms than do affect-driven forms of implicit bias (Amodio & Devine, 2006). Because the weapons identification task elicits response biases that are driven primarily by stereotype associations rather than by affective responses, it was particularly well-suited for testing our hypothesis (Judd, Blair, & Champleau, 2004). In addition, we chose to focus on PD estimates of automaticity and control as our primary behavioral outcomes. Although reaction times and error rates have been used to indicate automatic and controlled response patterns in much past work, it is likely that any given response involves some combination of automatic and controlled processes, and thus raw measures of reaction time and accuracy do not provide processpure indicators of automaticity and control (Jacoby, 1991). The validity of the PD procedure in the context of prejudice has been established in several published articles (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004; Judd et al., 2004; Payne et al., 2002; Lambert et al., 2003), and the assumption of independent processes for automaticity and control is consistent with research identifying their separate neural substrates (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004, 2006; Cunningham et al., 2004).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Seventy-three psychology students at the University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison participated individually in exchange for extra course credit.

Stimuli included pictures of two Black and two White male faces, four handguns, and four hand tools (drill, ratchet, wrench, pliers), digitized at 228 172 pixels. Stimuli were presented sequentially in the center of the computer screen, and trial order was randomized. Each trial began with a cross-hatched pattern mask (1 s), followed by the prime (Black or White face; 200 ms), the target (gun or tool; 200 ms), and then a second pattern mask (see Figure 1). Participants were instructed to classify targets as guns or tools as quickly and accurately as possible using buttons labeled \u201cgun\u201d and \u201ctool.\u201d The second mask remained onscreen until the participant responded or until 2 s had elapsed. Participants received a warning to respond more quickly following responses exceeding 500 ms. Reaction times for all responses were recorded, even when they exceeded the deadline.

A 2 (Prime: Black vs. White) 2 (Target: gun vs. tool) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on response latencies produced the expected interaction, F(1, 44) 20.92, p .001. It indicated that Black faces facilitated responses to guns but interfered with responses to tools, compared with White faces (see Figure 2A). A 2 (Prime) 2 (Target) ANOVA of error rates also produced the expected interaction, F(1, 44) 20.64, p .001. It indicated that participants had more difficulty responding to tools than guns when preceded by a Black face, compared with White prime trials (see Figure 2B). Together, these analyses showed that the task created race-biased response conflict on Black\u2013tool trials and thus a need for greater control on such trials, compared with Black\u2013gun trials, replicating previous research (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004, 2006; Payne, 2001, 2005)."}, {"heading": "Hypothesis Testing Strategy", "text": "To establish support for our primary hypothesis that regulatoryability differences among low-prejudice people are due to conflictmonitoring effects, we tested a specific set of predictions.

A significant effect for prime race emerged, F(1, 42) 19.19, p .001, indicating greater automatic stereotyping bias for Black faces than for White faces (see Table 2). Significant effects were not obtained for group, F(2, 42) 1.60, p .21, or for the interaction, F 1. PD-automatic estimates for Black and White faces were not significantly correlated (see Table 3). This pattern of results revealed that automatic race biases were activated at similar levels across groups, supporting Prediction 2 and replicating past work. Given the positive attitudes toward Black people reported by highIMS/low-EMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants, these results revealed an inherent conflict between their consciously held beliefs and their automatic tendencies.\nPrediction 3: Race-Bias Control\nThe hallmark of successful control is intention-driven behavior that is not affected by extraneous countervailing influences (Baddeley, 1986; Shallice, 1982). In the context of the weapons identification task, control should be evident in accurate classification of targets, despite the presence of automatic stereotyping associated with Black faces (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004; Lambert et al., 2003; Payne, 2001, 2005; Payne et al., 2002). In contrast to the stimulus-driven automatic responses to Black and White faces, which yielded uncorrelated PD-automatic estimates, PD control for both Black- and White-face trials reflects the engagement of an accuracy goal in the task. Because the accuracy goal applies across Black- and White-face trials, the two PD-control estimates should be strongly associated (Amodio et al., 2004, 2006; Payne, 2005). Indeed, these estimates were highly correlated (see Table 3).\nTo test Prediction 3, PD-control scores were submitted to a 3 (Group) 2 (Prime Race) mixed-factorial ANOVA. A significant effect for group emerged, F(2, 42) 15.09, p .001. Neither\neffects for prime race or the interaction reached significance, Fs 1. Simple analyses confirmed that PD-control scores for high-IMS/ low-EMS participants were significantly larger than those of highIMS/high-EMS participants, who exhibited greater control than did low-IMS participants (see Table 2). These analyses supported Prediction 3. Given that PD-control scores for Black and White trials were collinear (see Table 3) and appeared to reflect a common goal of response accuracy irrespective of race, they were averaged together to form a single index of control for subsequent analyses (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001).\nPrediction 4: Group Differences in Race-Bias Conflict"}, {"heading": "Monitoring", "text": "Neural signals for conflict-monitoring processes were indexed by ERN amplitudes.

This analysis produced a significant four-way interaction, F(2, 42) 3.02, p .05. Because our predictions pertained specifically to responses to Black targets, we examined lowerorder effects separately for Black and White faces.\nA 3 (Group) 2 (Target) 2 (Accuracy) ANOVA for trials involving Black faces produced a main effect for accuracy, F(1, 42) 171.66, p .001, indicating that ERNs were larger (i.e., more negative) when responses were incorrect (M 9.69, SD 4.28) than when they were correct (M 1.69, SD 2.43). This effect was qualified by a significant three-way interaction, F(2, 42) 3.70, p .04 (see Figure 3A). To understand this interaction, we analyzed ERNs associated with correct versus incorrect responses separately. The analysis of correct responses did not produce significant effects, Fs 1.35, ps .25.

Hence, only high-IMS/low-EMS participants exhibited enhanced ERNs when automatic stereotyping tendencies were inconsistent with their intended responses. This pattern of results supported Prediction 4.1\nWe next examined ERN responses to White faces. However, it is important to note that White people are not associated with either guns or tools. This is reflected by the lack of reaction time differences on White\u2013gun and White\u2013tool trials. Given the reaction-time results, the differential error rates found for White\u2013gun versus White\u2013tool trials appear to be artifacts of the gun (vs. tool) associations with Black faces. Thus, it is not clear how to interpret error-related ERP effects for White-face trials. With these interpretational ambiguities in mind, we examined ERN amplitudes on trials involving White faces (see Figure 3B). A 3 (Group) 2 (Target) 2 (Accuracy) mixed-factorial ANOVA produced a main effect for accuracy, F(2, 42) 202.33, p .001, indicating larger negative amplitudes on error trials (M 9.42, SD 4.40) than on correct trials (M 1.51, SD 2.48). This effect was qualified by a Group Accuracy interaction, F(2, 42) 4.61, p .02. Simple-effect analyses suggested that the groups\u2019 ERN amplitudes differed on incorrect trials only, F(2, 42) 7.01, p .005, such that ERNs were larger for high-IMS/low-EMS participants (M 12.35, SD 3.91) than for high-IMS/high-EMS participants (M 9.08, SD 2.69), F(1, 42) 6.79, p .02, and low-IMS participants, (M 7.60, SD 3.34), F(1, 42) 11.56, p .005. The ERN amplitudes of high-IMS/high-EMS participants did not differ significantly from those of low-IMS participants, F(1, 42) 1.99, p .17. These effects were not moderated by target (i.e., guns vs. tools), however, and therefore could not be interpreted as evidencing conflict monitoring related to stereotyping. Additional analyses compared ERNs on critical Black\u2013tool trials with ERNs of the other trial types. These analyses revealed a significant difference\namong high-IMS/low-EMS participants, F(1, 42) 9.61, p .005, but not among the other groups, Fs 1.03.\nThis set of analyses showed that conflict-monitoring processing is more strongly engaged in response to race-biased tendencies\n1 Recently, the correct-related negativity (CRN) component of the ERP has been used to measure conflict-monitoring processes that lead to successful response control (i.e., correct responses on high-conflict trials; e.g., Bartholow et al., 2005; see also N2correct; Yeung et al., 2004). The CRN is a negativepolarity waveform that is strongest at frontocentral midline scalp sites and, like the ERN, has been associated with an ACC neural generator (van Veen & Carter, 2002). CRN effects tend to be more subtle than those of ERNs and thus do not provide as strong of an indicator of conflict monitoring, but we include analyses of the response-locked CRN as a supplement.\nThe CRN has been examined as both a response-locked and stimulus-locked component. Here, CRN amplitudes were scored as the peak negative deflection occurring 75\u2013150 ms prior to correct responses and were submitted to a 3 (Group: high IMS/low EMS vs. high IMS/high EMS vs. low IMS) 2 (Prime: Black vs. White) 2 (Target: gun vs. tool) ANOVA. A significant Prime Target interaction, F(1, 42) 13.75, p .001, indicated larger CRN amplitudes for Black\u2013tool trials than for each of the other trial types, ts(44) 2.42, ps .02, replicating Amodio et al. (2004). This effect was not moderated by group. However, planned comparisons following from ERN analyses indicated that the CRN enhancement on Black\u2013tool trials, relative to Black\u2013 gun trials, was significant for high-IMS/low-EMS participants (Ms 5.90 and 3.20, respectively), F(1, 42) 7.74, p .01, and high-IMS/high-EMS participants (Ms 5.75 and 3.47, respectively), F(1, 42) 12.32, p .01, but not for low-IMS participants (Ms 5.12 and 3.84, respectively), F(1, 42) 2.42, p .13. Finally, Black\u2013tool CRN amplitudes were associated with accuracy on tool trials, r(43) .33, p .03, and PD control, r(43) .33, p .03, in partial correlations covarying Black\u2013gun CRN amplitudes. These results suggest that when highly internally motivated individuals (irrespective of external motivation) succeed in overriding stereotyping effects, their success may be attributed to effective conflict-monitoring activity.\nFigure 3.

Black\u2013gun ERN amplitudes were covaried from Black\u2013tool ERN amplitudes so that partial correlations could be examined. These analyses indicated that Black\u2013tool ERN amplitudes predicted higher PD-control scores, r(42) .51, p .001, and greater posterror accuracy, r(42) .54, p .001, beyond any effect of Black\u2013gun ERNs. Black\u2013tool ERNs were not correlated with the PD-automatic estimates for Black or White faces.\nAdditional analyses indicated that greater control across trials was predicted uniquely by ERNs associated with Black faces but not with White faces. After partialling the ERN amplitude from White\u2013tool trials, larger Black\u2013tool ERNs predicted greater PDcontrol estimates for both Black and White faces, rs .42, ps .005. By contrast, after partialling Black\u2013tool ERNs, White\u2013tool ERNs were not significantly associated with PD-control estimates for Black or White faces, rs .21, ps .18. These results demonstrated that conflict-monitoring signals were activated specifically in response to the need for stereotype inhibition (i.e., on Black\u2013tool trials) and subsequently engaged a control mechanism that enhanced response regulation across trials, supporting Prediction 5.\nNext, using regression with dummy codes, as recommended for the analysis of categorical group data (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003), we examined whether the relationship between ERN amplitude and response control varied as a function of group. These analyses revealed that the association of ERN amplitudes and PD control did not differ significantly between high-IMS/lowEMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants, B 0.09, t(39) 1.45, p .16, high-IMS/low-EMS and low-IMS participants, B 0.08, t(39) 1.49, p .15, or high-IMS/high-EMS and low-IMS participants, B .01, t(39) 0.18, p .87. These findings suggest that, although the absolute level of activity of the conflict-monitoring system differed by group, greater conflict-\nmonitoring activity was tightly linked to enhanced behavioral control across groups.\nPrediction 6: Mediation Analyses\nOur central hypothesis was that the conflict-monitoring process explains individual differences in regulatory ability among lowprejudice people. This hypothesis was directly tested with a mediation analysis. As an initial test of mediation, we created a group contrast whereby high-IMS/low-EMS participants were assigned a value of 1, and the other two groups were each assigned a value of .5. Mediation was assessed by testing four regression models (Baron & Kenny, 1986). These revealed that (a) the group contrast predicted Black\u2013tool ERN amplitude, .48, t(43) 3.63, p .001 (see Prediction 4), (b) the group contrast predicted PD control, .49, t(43) 3.69, p .001, and (c) Black\u2013tool ERN amplitude predicted accuracy on PD control, .59, t(43) 4.73, p .001. When ERN amplitude was included as a covariate, the group contrast was reduced to marginal significance, .25, t(42) 1.88, p .07; Sobel\u2019s z 2.45, p .04.\nTo more directly test our main hypothesis regarding high-IMS/ low-EMS participants versus high-IMS/high-EMS participants, we created a group contrast comparing these groups (coded 1 vs. 1, respectively). Regression analyses indicated that (a) the contrast predicted Black\u2013tool ERN amplitudes, .53, t(27) 3.28, p .005 (see Prediction 4 results), (b) the contrast predicted PD control, .40, t(27) 2.29, p .02, and (c) Black\u2013tool ERN amplitude predicted PD control, .53, t(26) 3.24, p .005. A final regression supported the mediation hypothesis, such that this contrast variable no longer predicted PD control when race-bias ERN amplitudes were covaried, .17, t(26) 0.87, p .39, Sobel\u2019s z 1.79, p .07 (see Figure 4). However, the contrast effect on PD control was not mediated by ERNs from Black\u2013gun trials, Sobel\u2019s z .37, p .71. These results supported our main hypothesis that the conflict-monitoring processes could explain differences in prejudice control between high-IMS/lowEMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In Study 1, we tested a specific set of hypotheses to determine whether conflict-monitoring process might account for why some\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nlow-prejudice people are more effective at regulating intergroup responses than others (e.g., Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002). As in past work, we found that high-IMS/low-EMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants reported positive explicit attitudes toward Black people while also exhibiting automatic stereotyping effects. Despite an equivalent discrepancy between automatic and intentional responses, high-IMS/low-EMS participants exhibited significantly greater control over stereotype-driven tendencies on the weapons identification task than did high-IMS/ high-EMS participants. Measures of neural activity revealed that these differences in control were due to differential conflictmonitoring activity. That is, high-IMS/high-EMS participants were less effective in regulating their behavior because their conflict-monitoring systems were not engaged in response to unwanted stereotyping tendencies. Low-IMS participants did not show enhanced conflict monitoring or behavioral control when responses held the potential for revealing race bias, as was expected given their highly prejudiced attitudes. In addition, although low-IMS participants who reported high versus low EMS were combined for theoretical reasons, analyses comparing these two subgroups found no differences on key variables, including Black\u2013tool ERNs ( 8.71 vs. 8.60), F 1, and PD-control scores (.37 vs. .28), F(1, 14) 1.20, p .29. In sum, this study identified the conflict-monitoring process as a mechanism that explains variability in low-prejudice people\u2019s ability to effectively regulate race-biased behavior.\nOur interpretation of the ERN as representing a conflictmonitoring function is in line with the predominant view of current theorists, although alternative interpretations exist. One is that the ERN represents the conscious detection that an error was made (e.g., Falkenstein, Hohnsbein, Hoorman, & Blanke, 1991; Gehring et al., 1993). However, subsequent research has shown that the ERN is not dependent on awareness (Nieuwenhuis et al. 2001) and that an ERN-like deflection with a similar ACC substrate is also seen for correct responses to high-conflict stimuli (see Footnote 1; also, Bartholow et al., 2005). Furthermore, because high-IMS/lowEMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants would presumably both be sensitive to errors, this error-detection interpretation does not fit our data. Another interpretation of the ERN is that it represents a feedback signal for surprising events, which functions to tune learning systems linked to the mesencephalic dopamine system (Holroyd & Coles, 2002). This feedback interpretation is complementary to the conflict-monitoring account, and it is possible that both functions characterize individuals with high internal motivation and low external motivation. Although our research was not designed to test the feedback account, it would be fruitful to examine the interplay of these functions in future work.\nWe were careful in Study 1 to address several alternative explanations. Our hypothesis was that enhanced conflictmonitoring processes should be triggered specifically on trials on which automatic biases and intentions were incongruent (Black\u2013tool trials) but not on trials on which they were congruent (Black\u2013 gun trials), and that this effect would be especially evident for individuals with high internal/low external motivation. On the basis of theories of cognitive control (e.g., Baddeley, 1986; Shallice, 1982), we further hypothesized that, once triggered, this mechanism of control should affect responses across trials (Payne, 2005). Indeed, ERN amplitudes were uniquely enhanced on Black\u2013tool trials among high-IMS/\nlow-EMS participants but predicted the implementation of response control across all trial types, suggesting a shift toward an accuracy-based (i.e., individuated) processing style (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990). Nevertheless, it may still be possible that patterns of conflict monitoring observed in Study 1 were related to more general differences in cognitive-control abilities between groups. The strongest test of this alternative hypothesis would be to examine whether these groups differ in their performance on a basic cognitive task commonly used to assess general conflict processing and cognitive control. If the group differences observed in Study 1 on the weapons identification task reflect domain-general effects, we would expect to find the same group differences on a general cognitive-control task. We tested this possibility in Study 2, in which participants completed the Eriksen flankers task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974), a widely-used behavioral measure of response-conflict processing, in addition to the weapons identification task. The flankers task was chosen because it is conceptually similar to the weapons identification task in that it requires responses that are either congruent or incongruent with prepotent response tendencies. Our primary hypothesis focused on the responses of high-IMS/low-EMS versus those of high-IMS/high-EMS participants, such that they were expected to differ in controlled processing on the weapons identification task, as in Study 1, but not on the flankers task.\nStudy 2\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Fifty-nine introductory-psychology students at New York University volunteered to participate in exchange for course credit.

On a given trial, a row of five arrows is presented, and the participant\u2019s task is to press a button indicating whether the center arrow points left ( ) or right ( ) while ignoring the outer arrows (i.e., the \u201cflankers\u201d).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nOn 60% of the trials (congruent condition), the center arrow pointed in the same direction as the flankers.

The discrepancy in trial frequencies was designed to entrain a habitual congruentflankers response, so that incongruent trials created response conflict and required control.

However, the hypothesized IMS/EMS group differences should be evident in the variance of PD control on the weapons identification task that is attributable only to the race-specific component of control. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) examining regulation-group differences in race-specific controlled processing while controlling for domain-general aspects of controlled processing. PD-control scores from the weapons identification task were submitted to a 3 (Group: high IMS/low EMS vs. high IMS/high EMS vs. low IMS) 2 (Race Prime: Black vs. White) ANCOVA, with PD-control scores from the flankers task included as the covariate. This analysis produced a significant effect for the covariate, F(1, 44) 12.37, p .001, which reflected a significant degree of overlap in controlled processing on the two tasks that is attributable to domain-general regulatory ability. However, the group difference in PD control on the weapons identification task continued to be significant, F(2, 44) 4.53, p .02, indicating that the observed IMS/EMS group differences in the control of race-related responses were independent of general regulatory abilities."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of Study 2 showed that although the groups differed in their degree of response control in the context of race, as in Study 1, they did not differ on a domain-general measure of response control. Thus, the individual differences in conflict monitoring observed in Study 1 likely reflected regulatory abilities specific to nonprejudiced intentions and the context of race and were not due to more fundamental differences in cognitive abilities.\nGeneral Discussion\nTheorists have long acknowledged the challenges associated with regulating race-biased responses. Allport (1954) wrote that\n\u201cprejudiced attitudes are almost certain to collide with deep-seated values that are often equally or more central to the personality,\u201d and as a result, many Americans live in a \u201cstate of conflict\u201d (p. 326). Since Allport made this prescient observation, researchers have accumulated numerous examples of conflict between automatic race biases and consciously held egalitarian beliefs. The present research is the first to examine the way this conflict plays out in neural processes over the course of a race-biased response among different individuals.\nConsistent with past research (Amodio et al., 2003; Devine et al., 2002), we found that high-IMS/low-EMS participants were more effective regulators of behavior on a stereotype-inhibition task than were high-IMS/high-EMS participants, despite their equally low-prejudice attitudes and equivalent baseline levels of automatic stereotyping. Here, we extended past findings by showing that neural conflict-monitoring processes accounted for the difference in control between these groups. These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that individuals with high internal motivation and high external motivation are less effective in responding without bias because the conflict between automatic stereotypes and egalitarian intentions is not strongly represented at the neural level while individuals form their responses.\nAlthough the present findings show strong support for the hypothesis that differences in conflict monitoring explain why some egalitarians are worse regulators of bias than others, some potential limitations are worth considering. Our use of an allfemale sample in Study 1 raises the possibility that our results would not have been observed for men. However, the behavioral effects of Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, in which gender effects were not observed. Furthermore, there are no known gender effects on ACC processing or on the ERN, and it is therefore unlikely that the results of Study 1 only pertain to women. A second potential limitation is that by telling participants that the weapons identification task could affect their use of stereotypes (albeit confidentially, to boost motivation to respond accurately), our results may have been driven by external motivations. This possibility would predict that high-IMS/high-EMS participants and a subset of low-IMS participants (those with high EMS) would have shown a high degree of behavioral control and large ERNs, but they did not."}, {"heading": "Comparing Social Psychological and Neuroscientific Models of Control", "text": "Previous social psychological models have identified bias detection as an important step toward regulating behavior but differ from the present approach in their explanation for how the detection of bias is accomplished. Most previous models (e.g., Wegener & Petty, 1997; Wilson & Brekke, 1994) focus on the deliberative process of detecting the presence of bias and deciding to initiate control (but see Gollwitzer, 1999). In contrast, the neurocognitive model proposes that control is elicited when activations in an associative network come into conflict, requiring neither the conscious awareness of bias nor a homunculus who \u201cjust knows\u201d when control is needed (Botvinick et al., 2001; Miller & Cohen, 2001). This model is consistent with data showing that mechanisms of control are set in motion very early in the response stream and do not require conscious appraisals (Berns et al., 1997; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2001; see also Moskowitz, Gollwitzer, Wasel, &\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nSchaal, 1999). By using ERPs to track this process, we were able to show evidence of conflict-processing before a response was actually made. In cases where automatic race-biased tendencies were detected and quickly inhibited during the course of a single response, conflict processing was observed approximately 100 ms before a successfully regulated response (see Footnote 1; also Amodio et al., 2004). These findings show that effective response control may be deployed without a person\u2019s awareness that a race-biased response was averted.\nOur focus on the conflict-monitoring component of control complements other research on the regulative component of control that is signaled by conflict-monitoring activity (Kerns et al., 2004). For example, Bartholow, Dickter, and Sestir (2006) examined the regulative component of control in the context of race bias using an ERP component called the negative slow wave that is believed to reflect prefrontal cortical activity. The authors observed higher negative slow-wave amplitudes on trials in which stereotyping tendencies were successfully inhibited. This research extended the findings of Amodio et al. (2004) to demonstrate that control of racial bias involves both conflict-monitoring and regulative aspects of control, associated with the ACC and prefrontal cortex, respectively. However, researchers have not examined individual differences in the role of the regulative component of control in the context of race bias. Although the ERN mediated behavioral differences between high-IMS/low-EMS and highIMS/high-EMS participants in Study 1, it is possible that a measure of the regulative component might further account for this group difference.\nOur findings also complement research on more \u201cdownstream\u201d aspects of race-bias regulation, such as the thoughts and feelings experienced after the commission of prejudice and their effects on future behavior (e.g., Amodio, Devine, & Harmon-Jones, 2007; Monteith, 1993; Monteith, Ashburn-Nardo, Voils, & Czopp, 2002). For example, Monteith\u2019s (1993) model of prejudice control was designed to predict patterns of cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes that are elicited when an individual becomes aware of having made a prejudiced response. More recent work by Amodio et al. (2007) demonstrated the role of prefrontal cortical activity in the regulation of behavior following awareness that one has responded with prejudice. Thus, the present work and the research of Monteith and colleagues focuses on two different stages of prejudice control, namely, pre- and postconscious processing. Whereas the present analysis focuses on the rapid processes that function to regulate a potentially race-biased response as it unfolds, Monteith\u2019s (1993) model focuses primarily on how people regulate future race-related behavior after a race-biased response has been committed (see also Amodio et al., 2007). However, because efforts to regulate future behaviors are typically more deliberative, our theoretical analysis suggests that individuals with both high internal/low external and high internal/high external motivational profiles would be effective in implementing this form of control."}, {"heading": "Strategies for Increasing Race-Bias Control", "text": "By using ERP measures and applying a neurocognitive model of control, we provide unique insights into methods of prejudice reduction. For example, our findings suggest that the regulation of intergroup responses could be improved by enhancing the sensi-\ntivity of the conflict-monitoring system in situations in which bias may occur. Techniques have previously been shown to reduce the effect of automatic stereotyping on behavior, although not with the conflict-monitoring model in mind. For example, Kawakami, Dovidio, Moll, Hermsen, and Russin (2000) showed that stereotyping effects on behavior could be reduced by training participants to negate stereotypic associations with African Americans across hundreds of trials. In light of the present findings, we suggest that Kawakami et al.\u2019s negation training may have amplified the conflict-monitoring process by producing concurrent activation of stereotypic and counterstereotypic responses when participants viewed a Black face, in addition to the authors\u2019 interpretation that the training weakened participants\u2019 automatic stereotyped associations. Given the present findings that individuals with a profile of high internal motivation and high external motivation may lack concurrent activation of automatic stereotypic and counterstereotypic responses, the prejudice-reduction strategies used by Kawakami et al. (2000) would be especially effective for enhancing conflict-monitoring responses in these individuals."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Understanding the intrapsychic conflict between countervailing prepotent and intended responses has captured psychologists\u2019 attention for much of the field\u2019s history.

Our results indicate that prejudice control depends on the sensitivity of the conflict-monitoring system to unwanted race bias and suggests that a proneness to unintentional expressions of prejudice among some low-prejudice people is due in part to a deficit in this system.\nReferences\nAlloy, L.

Lemay, Jr. and Margaret S. Clark Yale University\nThe authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner\u2019s acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners\u2019 inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner\u2019s authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance\u2019s expressions of emotion (Study 5). Relational insecurity may be perpetuated via the intrapersonal cognitive consequences of expressing it.\nKeywords: close relationships, egocentrism, relationship security, acceptance, emotion expression\nPeople have a strong need to belong in stable and caring relationships (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Reis, Clark, & Holmes, 2004). The perception that a relationship partner values and has positive regard for the self is critical to the perception that one has such relationships, as it fosters confidence in the partner\u2019s motivation to maintain the relationship and to attend to one\u2019s needs (Holmes & Rempel, 1989; Murray, Holmes, & Collins, 2006; Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). Unfortunately, this belief is not a feature of all close relationships. Instead, in some relationships, people chronically doubt that their partners value, accept, and care for them. This is the case even when these doubts are not reflected in the partner\u2019s actual thoughts and affections; many people seem to underestimate a close partner\u2019s acceptance of and regard for the self (Murray, Holmes, Griffin, Bellavia, & Rose, 2001; Murray, Holmes, MacDonald, & Ellsworth, 1998). When it persists, this pessimistic interpretation of a partner\u2019s thoughts and feelings undermines the quality of the relationship both for the self and for the partner (Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri, 1998; Lemay,\nClark, & Feeney, 2007; Murray, Bellavia, Rose, & Griffin, 2003). Moreover, it deprives the self of a potentially important source of self-esteem and affirmation (Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Murray et al., 1998). The current research proposed and tested a theoretical model of a normative process explaining how this type of relationship insecurity persists, even when it is confronted with a truly valuing, loving, and accepting partner.\nThe Expression-Based Authenticity Doubts Model\nWe posit a model of expression-based authenticity doubts. According to this model, when people are, for whatever reason, insecure about a partner\u2019s regard and acceptance, they typically believe that they have behaved in ways that have communicated insecurity and emotional vulnerability to the partner. These beliefs about expressing insecurities and vulnerabilities trigger other cognitions that ultimately perpetuate relationship insecurity. In particular, the knowledge that one has communicated interpersonal vulnerabilities regarding acceptance and rejection in the past causes reflected appraisals of vulnerability, which are beliefs that a partner views the self as interpersonally vulnerable\u2014easily hurt, emotionally volatile, and overly dependent on approval and positive feedback. These reflected appraisals of vulnerability in turn create authenticity doubts\u2014that is, beliefs that a partner expresses more positive regard than he or she truly feels and conceals negative regard. In other words, partners who are presumed to be aware of one\u2019s vulnerabilities are thought to \u201cwalk on eggshells.\u201d These authenticity doubts encourage underestimation of the partner\u2019s actual acceptance and perpetuate the experience of insecurity and expression of vulnerability that initiated this process. Although it is inspired, in part, by research on individual differences, this model posits a normative relationship process; feelings of insecurity in a particular relationship should trigger this process indeEdward P.

This in turn causes her to believe that Jerry is walking on eggshells around her, feigning more positive regard and acceptance than he truly feels, and concealing negative sentiments. In other words, when interpreting his positive expressions, Amanda tends to think that Jerry is \u201cjust saying that\u201d because he views her as sensitive. Ultimately, these doubts about the authenticity of Jerry\u2019s expressions of regard maintain those insecurities regarding Jerry\u2019s acceptance that Amanda initially expressed. Our model is displayed in Figure 1. We describe each path in detail."}, {"heading": "Path a: Insecure Individuals Believe That They Express Vulnerability", "text": "When people feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance\u2014that is, when they doubt whether they are truly accepted by a partner and when they feel especially emotionally vulnerable to the prospect of rejection by the partner\u2014they often behave in ways that express this insecurity and vulnerability to the partner. During times of high threat, when rejection is currently perceived, they often do so by defensively rejecting the partner in return. Indeed, according to Murray and Holmes\u2019s dependency-regulation model, when people anticipate rejection by a partner, they tend to protect themselves by distancing from the partner and the relationship, which is thought to blunt the pain of rejection (see Murray et al., 2006, for a review). Supporting this model are studies showing that people who doubt a partner\u2019s regard and love react to these insecurities by self-protectively derogating their partner and denying the importance of the relationship (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000; Murray et al., 2001). This self-protection also appears to be expressed behaviorally. For example, those with chronic doubts about a partner\u2019s regard appear to enact cold and hurtful behaviors toward the partner (e.g., criticizing or insulting the partner; Murray et al., 2003) and engage in more conflict (Murray et al., 2000).\nOther indices of insecurity regarding acceptance also predict behavioral expressions of insecurity. Those with attachmentrelated anxiety, who tend to worry about rejection and abandonment from their close relationship partners, appear especially emotionally and behaviorally volatile in response to partner transgressions. They report feelings of anger and hostility and\nappear anxious and stressed when discussing major relationship conflicts with their romantic partners (Simpson, Rholes, & Phillips, 1996). They express intense anger when their partners do not respond supportively to their anxiety (Rholes, Simpson, & Orina, 1999; see also Mikulincer, 1998), and they intend to punish or hurt the partner when the partner responds in ways that may not be seen as supportive (Collins, 1996). Similarly, men high in rejection sensitivity\u2014a disposition to anxiously expect rejection from others\u2014are perceived by their partners as jealous, and rejectionsensitive women are perceived as hostile and unsupportive (Downey & Feldman, 1996, Study 3). Although some of these reactions to felt insecurity may blunt the pain of rejection in the present or provide a short-term sense of vindication, we consider these reactions to be expressions of one\u2019s vulnerability that, when reflected upon later, may initiate cognitions that ultimately perpetuate insecurity.\nDuring times of low threat (when people are willing to risk dependency on a partner because a partner\u2019s rejection is not perceived to be certain), those who feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance may express their vulnerabilities by seeking reassurance regarding their personal qualities and the partner\u2019s affections. According to Coyne\u2019s (1976) interpersonal model of depression, depressed individuals regularly seek this type of reassurance from their relationship partners, and many studies have revealed a strong relationship between depressive symptoms and reassurance seeking (Joiner, Metalsky, Katz, & Beach, 1999). In addition, other indices of chronic insecurity about acceptance, such as anxious attachment (Davila, 2001; Shaver, Schachner, & Mikulincer, 2005) and low self-esteem (Joiner, Katz, & Lew, 1999), also predict seemingly excessive reassurance seeking. In our view, although this behavior may sometimes assuage insecurities about a partner\u2019s regard and affections in the present, upon reflection, it likely initiates cognitions that perpetuate the insecurity.\nOf course, some reactions to relational insecurity may be unconscious (DeHart, Pelham, & Murray, 2004; Sommer & Baumeister, 2002). However, this does not negate our model\u2019s assumption that people are usually aware that they have expressed some of their vulnerabilities in the past. Their awareness can derive from situations in which they consciously expressed vulnerabilities, from reactions of their partners or third-party observers, or from their own reflections on their past reactions. Indeed, the fact that many of the studies reviewed above utilized selfreports supports our assumption that, when people tend to feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance, they often believe that they have expressed their insecurity and emotional vulnerability to the partner."}, {"heading": "Path b: Expressions of Vulnerability Cause Reflected Appraisals of Vulnerability", "text": "The knowledge that one has expressed vulnerability in the past ought to promote reflected appraisals of vulnerability\u2014beliefs that a partner views the self as especially interpersonally vulnerable, including easily hurt, emotionally volatile, and overly dependent on approval and affection.

First, their partners may not have noticed the expressions of vulnerability. Instead, reflected appraisals of vulnerability may arise from egocentric biases such as the spotlight effect and the illusion of transparency. The spotlight effect refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others attend to their behavior (Gilovich & Savitsky, 1999). This bias presumably arises because people presume that what is salient to them\u2014their own behavior\u2014is salient to others (Gilovich, Medvec, & Savitsky, 2000). Similarly, the illusion of transparency refers to the tendency for people to presume that their emotional reactions are more observable than they are (Gilovich & Savitsky, 1999; Gilovich, Savitsky, & Medvec, 1998), an illusion that might be pronounced in close relationships (Vorauer & Cameron, 2002). For those who believe that they have expressed vulnerabilities in the past, these biases may cause them to believe that they are viewed as vulnerable independently of whether the partner actually attended to those expressions.\nSecond, their partners may have attended to the expressions but may not have interpreted them as expressions of an underlying vulnerability. Although perceivers often do infer dispositions from observable behavior, people think that perceivers do this much more than perceivers actually do it (Van Boven, Kamada, & Gilovich, 1999). Indeed, people tend to overestimate the extent to which others make dispositional attributions regarding their attitudes (Van Boven et al., 1999, Study 1) and personality traits (Van Boven et al., 1999, Study 2), and they overestimate the effects of their social blunders or failures on observers\u2019 evaluations (Savitsky, Epley, & Gilovich, 2001).\nThese egocentric processes are likely to mediate the link between expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability. One\u2019s behavioral reactions to insecurity regarding a partner\u2019s acceptance\u2014whether fishing for a compliment, privately derogating the partner following a perceived transgression, avoiding the partner, directly seeking reassurance about the partner\u2019s affections, or openly insulting the partner\u2014are likely salient responses to insecurity in one\u2019s own mind, but the partner may not notice or remember the behavior, may draw fewer dispositional inferences than one assumes, or may interpret the behavior not as an expression of interpersonal vulnerability but rather as evidence of a temporary state caused by situational factors (\u201cshe just had a bad day\u201d). Nevertheless, a focus on one\u2019s own reactions to insecurity may cause one to believe that one is viewed as especially vulnerable. This is not to say that partners do not sometimes detect one\u2019s vulnerabilities. Indeed, there appears to be a kernel of truth in such perceptions (Ruvolo & Fabin, 1999). Rather, our point is that the process by which people conclude that they are viewed as vulnerable and insecure may not depend on the partner\u2019s actual views and often may operate through egocentric perception."}, {"heading": "Path c: Reflected Appraisals of Vulnerability Cause Doubts About the Authenticity of a Partner\u2019s Expressions of Positive Regard", "text": "The belief that a partner views the self as vulnerable should in turn produce authenticity doubts\u2014suspicion that the partner expresses insincere positive thoughts and feelings, conceals negative thoughts and feelings, and is generally cautious during interaction.\nThis is likely to be the case because people have shared expectations regarding how others react to interpersonally insecure and vulnerable individuals. These expectations, colloquially referred to as walking on eggshells, involve caution about behaving in a manner that would cause the individual to feel rejected. People may expect this type of reaction because of normative desires to have rewarding interactions and avoid negative interactions (see Kelley & Thibaut, 1978; Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996) and to adhere to norms dictating that people should care about and avoid hurting partners\u2019 feelings (see Clark & Mills, 1993). When interacting with an individual who is especially insecure and vulnerable regarding rejection and acceptance, these goals may be facilitated by expressing positive regard, concealing negative thoughts or feelings, and maintaining a cautious stance. Supporting the idea that people perceive others\u2019 expressions as cautious when such caution seems warranted are empirical studies suggesting that people doubt a person\u2019s authenticity when the person appears dependent on incentives controlled by others (e.g., Jones, Jones, & Gergen, 1963; Vonk, 1998, 2002) or when the person appears motivated to avoid hurting others\u2019 feelings (DePaulo & Bell, 1996; Pataki & Clark, 2004).\nThus, people may have prototypes that one person\u2019s interpersonal vulnerability elicits his or her interaction partner\u2019s caution. Such prototypes may become relevant to interpreting a partner\u2019s behavior for those who, as a result of their own prior expressions, believe they are viewed as vulnerable and insecure. Applying such prototypes to their own relationships, they may suspect that their partner is walking on eggshells around them, cautiously suppressing negative thoughts and feelings, and exaggerating their positive thoughts and feelings. By frequently expressing heightened insecurity and emotional vulnerability, what was once a na\u0131\u0308ve theory about how people react to fragile, volatile individuals has become a suspicion about the partner\u2019s behavior."}, {"heading": "Path d: Doubting the Authenticity of a Partner\u2019s Expressions of Regard Undermines Relationship Security", "text": "Doubts about the authenticity of a partner\u2019s expressions of regard can undermine confidence in the partner\u2019s regard by creating a disjuncture between the partner\u2019s positive expressions and one\u2019s inferences of the partner\u2019s true thoughts and feelings. Specifically, beliefs that a partner is concealing some negative sentiment or is feigning some positive sentiment allow and even encourage people to perceive more negative regard and less positive regard than is indicated by the actual features of the partner\u2019s behavior.\nIndeed, a tenant of attribution theory is that people view another person\u2019s behavior as a product of his or her dispositions and the external factors that constrain or facilitate that behavior (Heider, 1958; Jones & Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967). People are less likely to infer corresponding attitudes or traits from a target\u2019s behavior if there is another plausible explanation for the behavior, such as a situational constraint on the behavior or a perceived ulterior motive (e.g., Fein, Hilton, & Miller, 1990; Gilbert, Krull, & Pelham, 1988; Jones & Harris, 1967; Miller, Visser, & Staub, 2005). More specifically relevant to the present point, studies suggest people discount expressions of positive feedback when situational factors appear to render targets motivated to provide false feedback (e.g., DePaulo & Bell, 1996; Major, Carrington, & Carnevale, 1984).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nThus, when people believe that their partners are behaving cautiously, they may discount the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard and acceptance as due to this caution rather than seeing such expressions as reflecting authentic positive sentiment. That is, in response to a partner\u2019s compliment or expression of affection, they may think the partner is \u201cjust being nice.\u201d\nLikewise, mundane acts that could signal the partner\u2019s negative regard (i.e., a negative mood) may be perceived as implying more negative regard than is the case because they are thought to occur in a relational context that impedes such behavior. Behaviors are perceived as especially diagnostic of internal dispositions when they contradict observed situational pressures (Gilbert, Krull, & Pelham, 1988; Gilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1988; Jones, Davis, & Gergen, 1961; Kelley, 1967; Schwarz et al., 1991). Thus, when one believes that a partner sees oneself as vulnerable and believes that the partner is cautious about communicating negative regard, partner behaviors that nonetheless are seen as communicating even a tinge of negative sentiment are perceived as indicative of the partner\u2019s more extremely negative latent sentiment (i.e., acting in an apparently cold way despite the presumed countervailing forces).\nIn addition, authenticity doubts may threaten relational security even when the partner\u2019s behavior cannot be perceived as communicating any negative regard whatsoever. People often imagine the presence of dispositions that are perceived to be behaviorally extinguished by situational constraints (Miller et al., 2005). That is, people infer dispositions from behavior in which actors did not engage but very well might have had the situation permitted. The belief that one\u2019s own vulnerability has caused partners to be cautious about communicating any negative thoughts or feelings may serve as a perceived relational constraint that evokes this counterfactual correspondence bias, causing those who believe that partners are cautious to perceive that partners have more threatening sentiments lurking below a constrained congenial surface."}, {"heading": "The Role of Trait Insecurity", "text": "We suggest a distinction between the interpersonal processes posited by our model and effects of relatively chronic tendencies to feel secure or insecure regarding acceptance by others in general. Indeed, prior research supports such a distinction. Beyond individual differences in tendencies to feel secure in relationships, people seem differentially (in)secure about acceptance and care from one relationship partner to the next (Barry, Lakey, & Orehek, 2007; Lakey, McCabe, Fisicaro, & Drew, 1996; Lemay & Clark, in press). Moreover, insecurity regarding a particular partner\u2019s acceptance and care tends to predict behavioral expressions of that insecurity independently of individual differences in self-esteem (Murray et al., 2003), which are thought to reflect general tendencies to be secure or insecure about others\u2019 acceptance (Leary & Baumeister, 2000).\nNevertheless, individual differences in interpersonal security are likely to affect our model variables. Indeed, our model is in part derived from and inspired by research involving individualdifferences variables. Individual-differences variables reflecting chronic insecurity about acceptance in general do predict doubts about a specific partner\u2019s regard (Downey & Feldman, 1996; Murray et al., 2000, 2001), expressions of insecurity and vulnerability to partners (Downey & Feldman, 1996; Murray, Rose,\nBellavia, Holmes, & Kusche, 2002; Shaver et al., 2005; Simpson et al., 1996), and discounting of others\u2019 expressions of acceptance (Collins, Ford, Guichard, & Allard, 2006; Marigold, Holmes, & Ross, 2007; Stroebe, Eagly, & Stroebe, 1974). Those who are chronically insecure also may assume that their insecurity is known by partners without thinking that they have previously expressed it, perhaps through a process of projecting their own self-views onto the views others hold of them (Kenny & DePaulo, 1993). Although not the primary focus of our model, we illustrate the possible effect of individual differences (trait insecurity) on model variables in Figure 1. We expect to find evidence for the paths of our process model (Paths a, b, c, and d in Figure 1) even after controlling for these individual differences. In the current research, we tested model paths while controlling for individual differences in self-esteem and attachment-related anxiety."}, {"heading": "Summary and Research Overview", "text": "We posit that when people are insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance, they believe that they have expressed vulnerabilities to partners, which causes them to believe that they are viewed as vulnerable by partners. The belief that they are viewed as vulnerable in turn casts doubt on the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard and acceptance, which is likely to cause individuals who hold such doubts to underestimate their partner\u2019s true regard for and acceptance of them, perpetuating the insecurities and vulnerabilities that they initially expressed.\nWe present six studies testing our model. In Study 1, we tested whether inauthentic expression of regard toward interpersonally vulnerable partners is a normative belief. That is, do people think others in general walk on eggshells around insecure and vulnerable individuals? We expected that people do think this, regardless of whether they themselves tend to be secure or insecure in relationships. In Studies 2A and 2B, we tested effects of knowledge that one has expressed vulnerabilities on reflected appraisals of vulnerability and in turn authenticity doubts, controlling for individual differences in self-esteem (Study 2A) and attachment-related anxiety (Study 2B). In Study 3, we examined effects of authenticity doubts on perceived rejection in romantic and nonromantic relationships, controlling for individual differences in self-esteem. In Study 4, we tested the effects implied by our model using longitudinal data and examined effects after controlling for individual differences in self-esteem and the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity, and regard. In Study 5, we tested one aspect of the model using an experimental methodology, expecting to find effects of experimentally manipulated reflected appraisals of vulnerability on doubts about the authenticity of a new relationship partner\u2019s expressions of emotion.\nStudy 1: Do People Think Others Walk on Eggshells Around Vulnerable Individuals?\nOur model presumes people believe that expressions of regard toward those who are especially insecure and emotionally vulnerable to rejection lack authenticity. This should be the case regardless of whether people themselves tend to be vulnerable (i.e., low self-esteem). Thus, before testing the specific paths of the model in Figure 1, in Study 1, we tested whether people do associate interpersonal vulnerability with partners walking on eggshells.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred and fifty-four participants (128 women, 24 men, 2 who did not report their gender; M age 32 years) completed an electronic survey in exchange for entry into a $100 raffle."}, {"heading": "Measures and Procedure", "text": "Participants completed all measures in the order presented below.\nOpen-ended descriptions of reactions to an interpersonally vulnerable individual. Participants read the following description of an individual who is especially insecure and emotionally vulnerable in regard to interpersonal acceptance:\nSuppose that there is a person who appears to be very insecure. He or she appears to worry about what other people think about him/her. He/she often \u201creads into things,\u201d thinking that other people see him or her negatively when they actually might not. His/her feelings are easily hurt and he/she often gets angry or upset with others.\nThen, they provided written responses to the prompts \u201cIn your own words, please describe how most people would act around such a person\u201d and \u201cWhy do you think people act this way around this type of individual?\u201d\nPerceptions of general authenticity with a vulnerable individual. Participants read the description presented above and completed a 10-item measure assessing their perceptions of others\u2019 authenticity with this individual using 7-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 7 strongly agree). The items included five that assessed authentic responses (i.e., \u201cPeople would freely express any negative thoughts they have about this person,\u201d \u201cPeople would freely give this person negative feedback or criticism,\u201d \u201cPeople would be honest about how positively they view this person,\u201d \u201cPeople would not worry about upsetting this person,\u201d and \u201cPeople would not really think twice about what they say to this person\u201d) and five that assessed inauthentic responses (\u201cPeople would hide any negative thoughts they have about this person,\u201d \u201cPeople would be reluctant to give this person negative feedback or criticism,\u201d \u201cPeople would pretend that they view this person more positively than they actually do,\u201d \u201cPeople would be cautious about upsetting this person,\u201d and \u201cPeople would be overly careful not to say anything that would upset this person\u201d). The order of items was determined randomly for each participant. Responses to items were averaged to create authentic responding ( .68) and inauthentic responding ( .81) indices.\nPerceptions of general authenticity with a secure individual. Participants were asked to imagine a secure individual using the following instructions:\nSuppose that there is a person who appears to be very confident. He or she does not appear to be overly concerned about what other people think about him/her. He/she tends to assume that other people see him/her positively. He/she tends to not let what other people say bother him/her.\nThen, participants completed the same five authentic items ( .79) and five inauthentic items ( .81) described above.\nPerceptions of specific authenticity with vulnerable individuals. We also included measures to assess the perceived likelihood of specific authentic and inauthentic responses in specific situations.\nParticipants read the following three scenarios depicting interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals: \u201cImagine that someone is very sensitive about his/her appearance. On one particular day, this person doesn\u2019t look all that attractive\u201d; \u201cImagine that someone is very sensitive about whether or not other people like him/her. This person tells a joke that is not very funny\u201d; and \u201cImagine that someone is very sensitive about whether or not other people like him/her. This person says something that offends his/her friend.\u201d For each scenario, two potential responses of the interaction partner were provided, one that was authentic and negative and the other that was inauthentic and more positive. Participants indicated the likelihood of an authentic response (i.e., \u201cHis/her boyfriend/girlfriend tells the truth and tells him/her that he/she doesn\u2019t look attractive,\u201d \u201cHis/her friend doesn\u2019t laugh,\u201d and \u201cThe friend tells this person that he/she was upset,\u201d respectively) and an inauthentic response (i.e., \u201cHis/her boyfriend/girlfriend lies and tells him/her that he/she looks attractive,\u201d \u201cHis/her friend forces a laugh, pretending that it was funny,\u201d and \u201cThe friend says nothing to this person about the incident,\u201d respectively) using 4-point rating scales (1 very unlikely; 2 unlikely; 3 likely; 4 very likely). Whether the authentic or inauthentic response was presented first was randomly determined for each participant and scenario.\nPerceptions of specific authenticity with secure individuals. The same scenarios as described above were presented again, except that the individual was depicted as secure (i.e., \u201cImagine that someone is not overly concerned about his/her appearance,\u201d \u201cImagine that someone is not very worried about what other people think of him/her,\u201d and \u201cImagine that someone is not overly concerned about what other people think of him/her,\u201d respectively).

Feigning positivity was defined as statements reflecting a belief that people are overly polite, nice, or complimentary to the vulnerable individual. Caution was defined as statements reflecting a belief that people are cautious about upsetting the vulnerable individual or tailor their communications in such a way as to avoid upsetting the individual. For purposes of comparison, two other types of responses\u2014support and avoidance\u2014also were tallied. These were chosen because other theoretical perspectives suggest that they also may be common reactions to a partner\u2019s insecurity (Clark & Mills, 1993; Collins & Feeney, 2000; Coyne, 1976). Support was defined as statements reflecting a belief that people would provide help or desire to help the insecure person, including behavior (e.g., trying to help the person with his or her insecurity, providing reassurance), motivation (i.e., a desire to help the person or a concern for the other\u2019s welfare), and emotion (i.e., feeling sym-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npathetic or empathic). Avoidance was defined as statements positing that others would avoid interaction or intimacy with the individual. These categories were not exclusive; a participant\u2019s response could be coded as indicating more than one type of reaction. Intercoder reliability was moderate to substantial for feigning positivity (percent agreement .85; Cohen\u2019s .43), caution (percent agreement .85; Cohen\u2019s .78), avoidance (percent agreement .88; Cohen\u2019s .81), and support (percent agreement .84; Cohen\u2019s .57). The coders subsequently discussed and reconciled their disagreements.\nAs expected, a large proportion of participants (45%) freely indicated that people would behave in a cautious manner around the vulnerable individual. A smaller proportion (18%) freely indicated that people would feign positive sentiment. Many participants (50%) also claimed that others would desire to avoid the insecure individual, and a smaller proportion (21%) indicated that people would be supportive. Thus, cautious responding was perceived to be a common reaction to insecurity, just as common as the outright avoidance emphasized in other models of reactions to insecure and vulnerable individuals (e.g., Coyne, 1976; Downey et al., 1998; Joiner, Metalsky, et al., 1999). Examples of cautious responses include \u201cWould be overly nice to the person so they would not get upset\u201d; \u201cI think most people would be extra careful around this person, as if they were walking on eggshells. I think they would treat this person with \u2018kid gloves\u2019\u201d; \u201cI think most people would tend to either \u2018tip-toe\u2019 around someone like this, trying not to upset them OR be frustrated and just ignore that aspect of the person\u201d; \u201cI would probably act very diplomatically and make a point to choose my words very carefully\u201d; \u201cMost people will treat the person in the same way as one would treat a child- lightly\u201d; and \u201cMost people would be nervous\u2014afraid of doing or saying the wrong thing and \u2018setting him/her off.\u2019\u201d\nA limitation to these data is that most participants provided only one response, likely the most accessible response.

People appear to believe that others are less willing to express negative thoughts and feelings and are more likely to feign positive thoughts and feelings to especially interpersonally insecure and vulnerable people than to secure people. This was the case using both abstract measures of responding and perceived likelihood of providing specific forms of authentic and inauthentic responses in specific situations. These beliefs were held by people with low and high self-esteem, suggesting that people believe that others walk on eggshells and sugarcoat their responses around interpersonally vulnerable individuals regardless of their own tendencies for interpersonal vulnerability and insecurity.1\nStudies 2A and 2B: Expression and Reflected Appraisals of Vulnerability Predict Authenticity Doubts\nStudy 1 revealed that people tend to expect expressions of regard toward vulnerable individuals to lack authenticity. Our model posits that these expectations are applied to existing relationships when people believe that they have expressed their insecurity and vulnerability to partners. That is, when people believe that they have expressed a high degree of insecurity and vulnerability to partners, they tend to believe that they are viewed as especially vulnerable, volatile, and insecure by the partner (Path b in Figure 1). These reflected appraisals of vulnerability then render these expectations or prototypes relevant to interpreting the partner\u2019s behavior, stirring doubts about the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard (Path c in Figure 1). We expect these effects even after controlling for individual differences in trait insecurity. In Study 2A, we tested these predictions using reports of romantic and nonromantic relationships while controlling for trait self-esteem. In Study 2B, we controlled for attachment-related anxiety\u2014that is, individual differences in worries about abandonment and rejection from close relationship partners (e.g., Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Collins & Read, 1990)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Procedure", "text": "Study 2A.

Participants completed a 5-item measure assessing knowledge of their prior expressions of vulnerability and insecurity to the relationship partner they identified. Two items assessed expressions of negative emotion (i.e., \u201cI have frequently expressed hurt or angry feelings toward this person,\u201d and \u201cI have often acted upset or angry toward this person because of something he/she did or said\u201d); two assessed knowledge of reassurance seeking (i.e., \u201cI often ask this person how he/she truly feels about me,\u201d and \u201cI frequently seek reassurance from this person as to whether he/she really cares about me\u201d), adapted from the reassurance-seeking subscale of the Depressive Interpersonal Relationships Inventory (Joiner & Metalsky, 2001); and one assessed general expression of vulnerability (i.e., \u201cI have often reacted to this person in ways that suggest that I am sensitive about rejection\u201d). Items were completed on 6-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 6 strongly agree; Study 2A .82; Study 2B .86).2\nReflected appraisals of vulnerability. Participants completed a 3-item measure assessing their beliefs that the partner views them as vulnerable and insecure (i.e., \u201cThis person thinks I am easily upset with him/her,\u201d \u201cThis person thinks I am sensitive to his/her opinions of me,\u201d and \u201cThis person views me as vulnerable or easily hurt\u201d) using 6-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 6 strongly agree; Study 2A .80; Study 2B .72).\nAuthenticity doubts. Participants completed a 4-item measure of authenticity doubts. Items assessed hiding negative regard (\u201cThis person censors his/her thoughts and feelings in order to avoid hurting my feelings,\u201d and \u201cThis person walks on eggshells [is overly cautious] around me\u201d) and feigning positive regard (\u201cThis person exaggerates how positively he thinks or feels about me,\u201d and \u201cThis person often says things he/she doesn\u2019t mean in order to make me feel good\u201d) using 6-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 6 strongly agree; Study 2A .79; Study 2B .79).3\nAttachment-related anxiety (Study 2B). Participants completed a shortened version of the Experiences in Close Relationships\u2014 Revised Adult Attachment Questionnaire (Fraley, Waller, & Brennan, 2000). This scale measures attachment-related anxiety (tendencies to worry about rejection and abandonment) and attachment-related avoidance (discomfort with closeness and intimacy). The five items with responses that were most weakly related to their respective subscale during scale development (see Tables 2 and 3 in Fraley et al., 2000) were eliminated from the questionnaire. The remaining items were completed in a random order. The anxiety measure exhibited adequate internal consistency in Study 2B (anxiety .95). The avoidance scale was not used in the current analyses (but it should be noted that controlling for avoidance did not eliminate any of the effects predicted by our model).

A hierarchical regression analysis tested effects of expressions of vulnerability on authenticity doubts in Step 1. We then added reflected appraisals of vulnerability in Step 2. Selfesteem or attachment-related anxiety was controlled in both steps. Results are displayed in Table 1.\nIn both studies, expressions of vulnerability predicted increased authenticity doubts in the first step (Study 2A expression of vulnerability, f 2 0.15; Study 2B expression of vulnerability, f 2 0.03). These effects were eliminated after controlling for reflected appraisals of vulnerability in the second step ( ps .29; Study 2A reflected appraisals of vulnerability, f 2 0.09; Study 2B reflected appraisals of vulnerability, f 2 0.25). Sobel tests confirmed the significance of the indirect effects of expressing vulnerability on authenticity doubts via reflected appraisals of vulnerability (Study 2A, z 4.05, p .001; Study 2B, z 3.66, p .001).

This alternative model posits that authenticity doubts account for the relationship between expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability.

In conducting these analyses, we also continued to control for self-esteem (in Study 2A) and attachment anxiety (in Study 2B). Contrary to this alternative model, expressions of vulnerability continued to predict reflected appraisals of vulnerability when controlling for authenticity doubts (Study 2A, .63, p .001; Study 2B, .46, p .001).

Indeed, when we regressed perceived rejection on both self-esteem and general authenticity doubts, general authenticity doubts predicted perceived rejection ( .29, p .05) independently of self-esteem, which was also predictive ( .34, p .01; general authenticity doubts, Cohen\u2019s f 2 0.10).

First, we assessed each partner\u2019s regard and care for the other partner. This allowed us to test whether authenticity doubts predict underestimation of the partner\u2019s regard and care (which we expected; Path d in Figure 1). This also allowed us to test whether the subjective perceptions of negative regard and lack of care that are thought to occur as a result of authenticity doubts (Path d in Figure 1) in turn predict derogation of and reduced care for the partner. Derogating and distancing from a partner as a result of relationship threats appear to reflect attempts to protect the self from impending rejection. They co-occur with behavioral forms of distancing, such as responding in a hostile, unsupportive manner (Murray et al., 2006). This distancing response to the insecurity brought about by authenticity doubts may be one means by which relationship-specific insecurity feeds back to affect subjectively felt expressions of vulnerability that initiate our hypothesized cycle (Path a in Figure 1). We controlled for trait self-esteem when testing these links.\nSecond, the longitudinal aspect of Study 4 permitted a test of the cyclical aspect of our model. We expected that the reduced security in the partner\u2019s acceptance presumably brought about by authenticity doubts (Path d in Figure 1) would be carried into the future, perpetuating the cycle by promoting subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Path a in Figure 1). In turn, these subsequent expressions of vulnerability should predict temporal increases in reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts.\nThird, in addition to assessing each partner\u2019s authenticity doubts, we assessed each partner\u2019s appraisals of the other\u2019s vulnerability and each partner\u2019s felt authenticity of his or her own expressions. This allowed us to test our expectations that those who think that they have expressed vulnerabilities believe that they are viewed as vulnerable independently of the partner\u2019s actual views (Path b in Figure 1) and that those who believe they are viewed as vulnerable subjectively construct an inauthentic partner independently of the partner\u2019s reported authenticity (Path c in Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Procedure", "text": "Sixty dyads were recruited for a study on friendship from local electronic bulletin boards and newspaper advertisements.

These items were presented in a random order that varied across participants.\nSelf-esteem. Participants completed the Rosenberg (1965) Self-Esteem Scale using identical response scales (T1 .92, T2 .90).\nPerceived caring and regard. Participants indicated their perception of the friend\u2019s regard for them on a series of traits taken from the Interpersonal Qualities Scale (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996). The traits included nine positive traits (witty and humorous, considerate, kind and affectionate, forgiving, warm, open and disclosing, understanding, patient, tolerant and accepting) and seven negative traits (critical and judgmental, thoughtless, controlling and dominant, complaining, distant, emotional or moody, demanding), presented in a random order. Using 9-point response scales (1 not at all characteristic; 9 completely characteristic) participants indicated the extent to which they believed that their friend saw each trait as characteristic of them (T1 .84, T2 .83). Perceived partner caring was measured by four items (i.e., \u201cThis person cares about me,\u201d \u201cThis person would give up a lot to help me,\u201d \u201cThis person would go out of his/her way to help me,\u201d and \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t care about me\u201d) answered on 6-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 6 strongly agree; T1 .84, T2 .85). Most analyses using each of these variables produced similar results (except where noted), and responses to these two measures were moderately to highly correlated (T1 r .38, T2 r .55). To simplify presentation of results, they were standardized and averaged to create composite indices of perceived caring and regard (i.e., relationship security) for use in most analyses.\nCaring and regard for partner. Participants also indicated their perceptions of the partner on the same 16 traits using the same 9-point response scales (T1 .82, T2 .85), and they completed an analogous measure of their own caring for the partner (e.g., \u201cI care about this person\u201d; T1 .86, T2 .81). Responses to the two measures were highly correlated (T1 r .45, T2 r .56), and analyses using each of these variables produced similar results. Thus, responses were standardized and averaged to create composite indices of own regard and caring for partner for use in most analyses."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Path Analysis Strategy", "text": "A series of path analyses (tested with the SAS CALIS procedure; Hatcher, 1994; SAS Institute, 2002) was used to test our primary hypotheses. Responses were standardized to facilitate comparison of the effects of variables measured on different scales (and doing so did not affect any of our conclusions). First we present concurrent analyses testing hypothesized links among expressions of vulnerability, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity doubts, underestimation of the partner\u2019s caring and regard, and caring and regard for the partner. Second, we tested longitudinal predictions. Third, we tested whether effects of expressions of vulnerability on reflected appraisals of vulnerability\nare independent of the partner\u2019s actual appraisals of vulnerability and whether reflected appraisals of vulnerability in turn predict authenticity doubts independently of the partner\u2019s reported authenticity.\nThe current dyadic dataset involves interchangeable dyad members. That is, there is no consistent, unequivocal way to separate the two members of each dyad. We adopted recommendations by Olsen and Kenny (2006) to test path models involving interchangeable dyads. Specifically, we constrained intercepts, paths, variances, error terms, and any modeled within-member and across-member covariances to be equal for the two members. This appropriately models the members as interchangeable. We initially modeled covariances of the same variable across partners to account for dyadic nonindependence of responses, although insignificant covariances were deleted from the final models (noted as we proceed).\nAs further suggested by Olsen and Kenny (2006), fit indices were modified to remove from the final estimate of fit the influence of modeling interchangeability. The traditional model chisquare test implicitly compares the specified model with a saturated model, one in which all variances and covariances are modeled. An insignificant chi-square typically indicates that the fit of the specified model does not differ significantly from the observed variance\u2013covariance matrix. For interchangeable dyads, the comparison is changed from the observed sample variance\u2013 covariance matrix to a variance\u2013covariance matrix with equality constraints on all covariances, variances, and intercepts across partners (and modeling dyadic interdependence by including cross-partner covariances), termed the I-SAT model (for interchangeable saturated model) by Olsen and Kenny. The modified model chi-square, 2 , is obtained by subtracting the chi-square for the I-SAT model from the chi-square of the tested model, and the modified model degrees of freedom, df , are similarly obtained by subtracting the degrees of freedom of the I-SAT model from the degrees of freedom of the tested model. Hence, this modified chi-square test essentially removes from the fit estimate the effect of modeling interchangeability, and it does so by comparing the specified model with the saturated model after parameters have been constrained to be equal across partners in both models. An insignificant 2 suggests that the estimated model adequately fits the equality-constrained data. Likewise, the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), a measure of model misspecification, must be adjusted for our modeling of dyadic interchangeability by reducing the model 2 and df upon which the test is based by the 2 and df of I-SAT. The modified index, RMSEA , suggests a close approximate fit of the estimated model to the equality-constrained observed data if it is less than or equal to .05, and it suggests a reasonable fit if it is less than or equal to .08 (see Kline, 2005). 2 and df also must be used when computing incremental fit indices that compare the specified model with an independence model specifying no relations among model variables. The independence model also must be revised. For instance, the modified Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI ; also called the nonnormed fit index) compares the fit of the tested model (reduced by the I-SAT model) with the fit of an adjusted independence model, which specifies no relations among model variables but constrains intercepts and variances to be equal across partners (also reduced by the I-SAT model). A TLI greater than or equal to .90 suggests a good fit of the model (see Kline, 2005).

We included paths from self-esteem to all model variables to control for effects of self-esteem, and we modeled perceived caring and regard as having some degree of truth, predicted by the partner\u2019s caring and regard. Controlling for this degree of truth allowed us to test our expectation that authenticity doubts predict subjective perceptions of the partner\u2019s caring and regard independently of the partner\u2019s actual caring and regard. We also modeled an effect of perceived partner caring and regard on own caring and regard for the partner to test whether the relational insecurity that is presumably brought about by authenticity doubts in turn evokes a distancing response and reduces one\u2019s own responsiveness to the partner (see Murray et al., 2006).8\nThe effects were consistent with our model at both assessment waves. Participants\u2019 beliefs that they had expressed vulnerability predicted their reflected appraisals of vulnerability (Path b in Figure 1). That is, when people believed they had expressed vulnerability and insecurity to a partner in the past, they believed the partner viewed them as vulnerable and insecure. In turn, these reflected appraisals of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts (Path c in Figure 1). In other words, those who believed that they were viewed as vulnerable and insecure thought that partners were walking on eggshells around them through hiding negative regard and feigning positive regard. Authenticity doubts in turn predicted insecurity in the partner\u2019s caring and regard (Path d in Figure 1), suggesting that, through discounting expressions of acceptance and inferring more rejection than is expressed, these doubts undermine security in the partner\u2019s affections. This was the case after controlling for trait self-esteem, which had independent effects. This was also the case after controlling for the partner\u2019s reported caring and regard, suggesting that authenticity doubts lead to unwarranted insecurity in the partner\u2019s caring and regard, independently of the partner\u2019s claimed caring and regard. In addition to being predicted by authenticity doubts, perceived caring and regard also was predicted by the partner\u2019s reported caring and\nregard, suggesting that insecurity also held some degree of truth (see Lemay et al., 2007; Murray et al., 2000). Moreover, doubts about the partner\u2019s caring and regard in turn predicted one\u2019s own reduced caring and regard for the partner, suggesting that the undermining of security due to authenticity doubts might further promote the reactivity to insecurities that initiated the process (Path a in Figure 1). This model was an acceptable fit to the data at T1 (TLI .98, RMSEA .05, 2 26.28, df 23, ns) and at T2 (TLI .99, RMSEA .04, 2 25.15, df 24, ns).9\n7 Our sample size may be considered somewhat small in light of conventional recommendations for path analysis (see Kline, 2005). With smaller samples, chi-square tests may lack the power needed to reject the specified model, although the other goodness-of-fit tests are less affected by sample size (Bentler, 1990; Hu & Bentler, 1998). Moreover, because each dyad contributes two observations to the modeled effects, the true sample size is somewhere between the number of dyads and the number of individuals (Olsen & Kenny, 2006). For the interchangeable dyadic analyses that we used, Olsen and Kenny (2006) recommended that, at minimum, the number of dyads plus one should be twice as great as the number of variables in the model. Our models meet this criterion. Reassuringly, a series of multilevel models (modeling the two individuals nested within dyads) testing each path in isolation produced similar support for our model.\n8 Although it is not immediately apparent, the model displayed in Figure 4 posits a feedback loop (one\u2019s perceptions of the partner\u2019s caring and regard affect one\u2019s own caring and regard for the partner, which is detected by the partner, which affects the partner\u2019s reciprocation of caring and regard, which affects one\u2019s perceptions of the partner\u2019s caring and regard). We followed recommendations for testing nonrecursive models (Berry, 1984; Kline, 2005), including initially modeling the four covariances of the error terms of the four variables in the loop. In both T1 and T2 models, these covariances were not significant and were dropped.\n9 Several insignificant cross-partner covariances (initially included to test dyadic nonindependence of all model variables) have been deleted from the models presented in Figure 4. In the T1 model, these include reflected appraisals of vulnerability, perceived caring and regard, caring and regard for partner, and self-esteem. In the T2 model, they include authenticity doubts and perceived caring and regard. The T1 model also estimates the residual covariance between expression of vulnerability and authenticity doubts.\n-.28**/ -.18\u2020\n-.26**/ -.34**.27 **/ .59***\n.37***/ .19*\n.20*/ .29** -.24***/ ns\n.73***/ .75*** Perceived\npartner's caring and regard\nCaring and regard for partner Authenticity doubts\nPartner's caring and regard\n.57***/ .66***\n-.32***/-.26* -.14\u2020/ns\nExpresson of vulnerability\nReflected appraisals of vulnerability\nSelf-esteem\nFigure 4.

We also modeled all T2 variables as predicted by their T1 assessments. Doing so renders T2 variables reflective of residualized temporal change.\nResults of the analysis involving the perceived regard measure are displayed in Figure 5.10 The pattern of effects regarding relations among T1 variables is similar to that displayed in Figure 4. In addition, Figure 5 suggests that the T1 insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard that was predicted by authenticity doubts in turn predicted T2 insecurity, which then predicted residual change in expressions of vulnerability (Path a in Figure 1).

We continued to control for trait selfesteem in these analyses.\nWe regressed the partner\u2019s appraisals of one\u2019s vulnerability on one\u2019s expressions of vulnerability to test whether those who expressed vulnerabilities had partners who viewed them as vulnerable. At both assessment waves, significant positive effects of\nexpressing vulnerabilities suggested that partners did appraise such individuals as vulnerable, T1 .35, t(117) 3.80, p .001; T2 .33, t(71) 2.82, p .01. These effects suggest that those who claimed to express vulnerabilities did have partners who detected those vulnerabilities to some degree. Next, we regressed own reflected appraisals of vulnerability on own expressions of vulnerability and the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability to test whether the partner\u2019s appraisals mediated the link between own expressions and own reflected appraisals. This mediation was not found; one\u2019s own felt expressions of vulnerability remained a strong and significant predictor of reflected appraisals of vulnerability at both assessment waves, T1 .50, t(116) 6.47, p .001; T2 .66, t(70) 7.18, p .001; although the partner\u2019s appraisal of vulnerability also was significant at T1, .20, t(116) 2.65, p .01, but not at T2 ( p .23). These findings support our model\u2019s assumption that reflected appraisals of vulnerability can originate from one\u2019s own felt expressions of vulnerability independently of the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability.\nNext, we regressed the partner\u2019s claimed authenticity on one\u2019s expressions of vulnerability to test whether those who expressed vulnerability had partners who claimed to be less authentic. Expression of vulnerability did not predict the partner\u2019s authenticity at T1 ( p .26) or at T2 ( p .49). We also regressed the partner\u2019s authenticity on one\u2019s reflected appraisals of vulnerability.

Analyses involving the composite index produced an effect of T2 perceived caring and regard on T2 expressions of vulnerability that was in the predicted direction but did not reach conventional levels of significance ( .12, two-tailed p .16, one-tailed p .08). This was due to a null effect of perceived partner caring on expressions of vulnerability, which might suggest that some degree of perceived caring is necessary before one expresses vulnerabilities. All other effects in the model that included the composite measure are similar to the effects displayed in Figure 5.\n11 Several insignificant cross-partner covariances (initially included to model dyadic interdependence) have been deleted from the final model displayed in Figure 5. These include T1 reflected appraisals of vulnerability, T1 authenticity doubts, T2 authenticity doubts, and T2 perceived regard.

These analyses suggest two distinct biases that are consistent with our model. First, those who claimed to express vulnerabilities appeared to believe that they were viewed as vulnerable independently of whether partners actually viewed them as vulnerable. Second, those who thought they were viewed as vulnerable appeared to doubt partners\u2019 authenticity independently of whether partners actually claimed to be inauthentic."}, {"heading": "Alternative Models", "text": "We tested several alternative mediation models. First, we tested six alternative models by changing the modeled sequence. That is, we switched the position of expression of vulnerability, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity doubts, or perceived care and regard with one of these other variables. All other aspects of the models remained the same as the models depicted in Figure 4; we continued to model the effect of perceived care and regard on care and regard for partner, the effect of partner\u2019s care and regard on perceived care and regard, the effect of self-esteem on all variables, and all residual covariances that were estimated in the original models. The models did not adequately fit the data after switching expression of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability (T1, 2 46.90, df 23, p .01; T2, 2 36.31, df 22, p .05), after switching expression of vulnerability and authenticity doubts (T1, 2 46.07, df 23, p .01; T2, 2 38.78, df 22, p .05), after switching expression of vulnerability and perceived care and regard (T1, 2 54.27, df 23, p .001; T2, 2 54.05, df 22, p .001), after switching reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts (T1, 2 64.53, df 23, p .001; T2, 2 61.57, df 22, p .001), after switching reflected appraisals of vulnerability and perceived care and regard (T1, 2 64.43, df 23, p .001; T2, 2 71.24, df 22, p .001), and after switching authenticity doubts and perceived care and regard (T1, 2 38.72, df 23, p .05; T2, 2 56.54, df 22, p .001). Hence, these alternative models could not account for the observed (equality-constrained) covariance matrix.\nSecond, we tested a more parsimonious model positing that the effects that support our model (those linking expressions of vulnerability to reflected appraisals of vulnerability, reflected appraisals to authenticity doubts, and authenticity doubts to perceived caring and regard) are all simply explained by shared variance with perceived care and regard. In other words, as direct consequences of relational insecurity, people might express vulnerability, think they are viewed as insecure, and doubt authenticity. In this model, perceived care and regard is specified as a predictor of expressions of vulnerability, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, and authenticity doubts, and we eliminated paths directly linking these three latter variables. All other aspects of the model remained the same as described above. This model was not a good fit to the data at T1\n( 2 85.48, df 23, p .001) or at T2 ( 2 96.20, df 22, p .001). Hence, it seems as if this more parsimonious model positing that all effects are simply due to shared variance with insecurity about the partner\u2019s care and regard is not supported.\nFinally, a problem with testing these alternative models is that they eliminate several model paths simultaneously. As a result, the poor-fitting alternative models do not necessarily indicate that each model path is properly specified. To test whether the model paths that are central to our theoretical model could be explained by other variables in our model, we tested multilevel models in which each critical model path was tested while controlling for other model variables, whether theoretically upstream or theoretically downstream. Controlling for self-esteem, authenticity doubts, and perceived caring and regard, expression of vulnerability predicted reflected appraisals of vulnerability, T1 .48, t(115) 5.85, p .001; T2 .50, t(63) 5.31, p .001. Controlling for self-esteem, expression of vulnerability, and perceived caring and regard, reflected appraisals of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts, T1 .22, t(110) 2.42, p .05; T2 .47, t(66) 3.96, p .001. Controlling for self-esteem, expression of vulnerability, and reflected appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity doubts predicted perceived caring and regard, T1 .19, t(110) 1.85, p .07; T2 .41, t(69) 3.06, p .01. Hence, even at the level of individual model paths, alternative mediation models were not supported by the data. For instance, it was not the case that insecurity about a partner\u2019s caring and regard explained the relation between expression of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability or the relation between reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts."}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "This study provides additional support for our model. Independently of self-esteem, when people claimed to have expressed their interpersonal vulnerabilities and insecurities to their friends, they believed that their friends viewed them as easily hurt and volatile (Path b in Figure 1). In turn, the belief that one was viewed in this way predicted doubts about the authenticity of the friend\u2019s expressions of regard and acceptance (Path c in Figure 1). In turn, these authenticity doubts predicted insecurity about the friend\u2019s caring and regard (Path d in Figure 1). Importantly, these effects were observed even when controlling for the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity, caring, and regard, suggesting the operation of cognitive processes linking expressions of vulnerability to authenticity doubts and insecurity, as posited by our model. Doubts about the partner\u2019s regard in turn appeared to perpetuate the doubter\u2019s reactivity that initiated the process. That is, these doubts about the partner\u2019s regard predicted derogation of and reduced care for the partner and predicted subsequent insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard, which in turn predicted temporal changes in expressions of vulnerabilities (Path a in Figure 1). These changes in expressions of vulnerabilities then predicted changes in reflected appraisals of vulnerabilities, which in turn predicted changes in authenticity doubts. Such a pattern suggests a cyclical process in which expressing heightened interpersonal vulnerability and insecurity is an indirect cause and direct consequence of felt relational insecurity.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nStudy 5: Experimental Manipulation of Reflected Appraisals of Interpersonal Vulnerability\nThe last study examined effects of experimentally manipulated reflected appraisals of vulnerability on doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance\u2019s emotional expression. Pataki and Clark (2004) hypothesized and found evidence that people publicly express more happiness than they privately feel to unattractive targets and that unattractive targets are aware of this. They posited that expressions of happiness ordinarily serve as expressions of social interest but that people may tailor these expressions to avoid hurting others\u2019 feelings. Moreover, as this is a normative tendency, targets of these exaggerated expressions of happiness, such as unattractive individuals, typically know that people tend to do this and, consequently, discount the meaningfulness of these expressions. We expected similar effects with reflected appraisals of vulnerability\u2014people induced to believe that another person views them as especially insecure about and emotionally vulnerable to rejection should believe that the other expressed more happiness than he or she felt (a specific authenticity doubt; Path c in Figure 1).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Overview", "text": "Participants were told that they would interact with another participant (really a confederate) and that this other person would be given information that may or may not be true about them beforehand. After a 10-min interaction, some participants were informed that the confederate had been told that the participant was especially insecure and emotionally vulnerable to rejection; some were not. We then measured participants\u2019 perceptions of the confederate\u2019s authenticity of expressions of happiness during the prior interaction."}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred and eighty-six participants (86 men, 98 women, 2 who did not report gender; M age 22 years), primarily college students, were recruited via campus advertisements, research experiment websites, and from a Psychology participant pool."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "As they arrived at the laboratory, participants walked by one of three confederates (two women, one man) who was apparently waiting in the hallway for an appointment. The experimenter ushered the participant into a laboratory room and then provided a cover story, explaining that the experiment was about how first impressions can affect perceptions of social interactions, that the participant would have a brief interaction with another participant (really a confederate), and that the procedure required one of the two participants to receive information about the other participant before the interaction to examine the effects of first impressions. The experimenter further explained to the true participant that, because he or she was the first to arrive at that session, the other participant (the confederate) would be the one to receive this information and that this information may or may not be true of the participant. The experimenter also added that, to preserve the\nvalidity of the study, he could not disclose the details of the information (to the true participant) until the interaction was over but that he would be sure to explain the nature of the information at that time. After assuring that participants understood this information, the experimenter left the room, ostensibly to wait for the other participant and provide him or her the information. In reality, the confederate was not given any information about the participant and was unaware of the experimental condition.\nA few minutes later, the experimenter returned to the room and ushered the confederate into a seat across from the participant. The experimenter explained that the study was about how people perceive their social interactions, that they would have a semistructured 10-min interaction, and that they then would go to separate rooms to complete measures of their perceptions of the interaction. After completing consent forms, participants completed a short questionnaire in which they provided demographic information and responses to a self-esteem scale. The confederate acted as if he or she also was completing the consent forms and questionnaire.\nFollowing this, the participant and confederate took part in the Relationship Closeness Induction Task (RCIT), a 9-min guided and timed interaction task designed to induce feelings of closeness (Sedikides, Campbell, Reeder, & Elliot, 1999). The task consists of three lists of questions presented on three separate pages. The questions gradually become more personal, with questions regarding things such as name, age, and hometown appearing on the first page, hobbies and personal goals on the second page, and childhood memories and emotional experiences on the third page. Participants and confederates took turns asking and answering each question. When they reached the time limit for the page, the experimenter returned to the room to prompt them to turn to the next page.\nOnce the participants were finished with the RCIT, the experimenter returned and explained that the interaction was over and that now participants would go to separate rooms to complete a survey assessing perceptions of the interaction. He then ushered the confederate out of the room.\nAt this point, the procedure varied depending on random assignment to one of three experimental conditions. For participants assigned to the no-information control condition (n 62), the experimenter returned and administered the final questionnaire without saying anything about the information that had ostensibly been given to the other participant before the interaction.\nFor those assigned to the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition (n 63), the experimenter returned and explained that, now that the interaction was over, he could describe the information that he had given the other participant before the interaction. He then explained, \u201cI told the other participant that you were sensitive about what other people think about you, that you care a lot about that sort of thing.\u201d The experimenter then explained that the other participant had read a memo conveying this same information and provided the participant with a copy of the memo. On university letterhead, the memo read as follows:\nDear participant, you are about to interact with a very sensitive person. Based on prior in-depth interviews and completion of personality inventories, it appears that the participant with whom you are about to interact is extremely sensitive about how he/she comes across to others. This person constantly worries about what other people think, whether other people accept him/her, and whether other people\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nwill want to start a friendship. This person tends to perceive signs of rejection even in situations where people are accepting. In addition, this person is easily hurt and angered by signs of rejection from others. Sincerely, Research Staff.\nThe experimenter explained that the other participant was in a room completing a survey assessing his or her perceptions of the interaction. The experimenter added that he also wanted to assess the (real) participant\u2019s perceptions so that he could compare them with the other participant\u2019s responses. He then administered the final questionnaire.\nA second control condition also was administered to control for other differences between the two conditions described above (n 61). For instance, factors such as activation of constructs related to vulnerability, sensitivity, and insecurity; suspicion or demand due to disclosure of information ostensibly given to the other participant; and a longer duration between the interaction and completion of dependent measures might serve as alternative explanations of our expected effect. Thus, we also desired to compare the vulnerable condition with an invulnerable condition that differed in terms of the reflected appraisal but did not differ in terms of these other factors. In addition, this condition allowed us to examine effects of inducing reflected appraisals of invulnerability, but we did not have strong predictions regarding such effects because participants in the no-information condition likely assumed that they were not viewed as vulnerable, which is what participants in the invulnerable condition were explicitly told. The experimenter explained that he had told the other participant before the interaction that \u201cyou were not sensitive to what other people think about you, that you could really care less about that sort of thing.\u201d The memo read as follows:\nYou are about to interact with a very insensitive person. Based on prior in-depth interviews and completion of personality inventories, it appears that the participant with whom you are about to interact is extremely insensitive to social cues. This person is oblivious to what others are thinking, is largely unaware of social norms, and cares little about appearance. This person tends to be unaware of signs of rejection and acceptance from others. In addition, this person appears to be unaffected by what other people think, has little ability to take others\u2019 perspectives on things, and does not understand others\u2019 feelings.\nFollowing completion of the final questionnaire, all participants were debriefed. One participant (in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition) expressed suspicion regarding the cover story. Preliminary analyses revealed that exclusion of this participant\u2019s responses did not alter the pattern of results. Thus, his responses were included in the analyses presented below."}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "Self-esteem.

A significant main effect for type of rating, F(1, 182) 47.65, p .001, suggesting that, on average, participants viewed the confederate as expressing more happiness than was truly felt, was qualified by the Type of Rating Condition interaction, F(1, 182) 5.24, p .05, 2 .03. As expected, in the vulnerable condition, participants believed that the confederate\u2019s expressions (M 5.14) were happier than the confederate\u2019s private feelings (M 4.7), t(62) 5.50, p .001, d .46. This tendency was reduced in the control conditions (Ms 4.8 and 4.6, respectively), t(120) 4.01, p .001, d .23. Thus, consistent with our expectations (Path c in Figure 1), participants perceived the confederate\u2019s expressions of happiness as less authentic when they were told, after the interaction, that the confederate had been informed beforehand that participants were especially vulnerable to rejection.12\nThis result is particularly impressive given that (a) participants could not use reflected appraisals of vulnerability to bias their online perceptions during the interaction but instead had to retrospect in light of information received after the interaction, (b) reflected appraisals of vulnerability were communicated via a third party, and (c) these manipulated reflected appraisals competed with any behavior expressed by the confederate that may have communicated authenticity. Indeed, many other studies suggest that, when causes are presented sequentially, people tend to anchor their judgments on the initial cause and fail to sufficiently discount the initial cause when presented with the alternative cause (see McClure, 1998, for a review). Our effects might have been stronger if participants held reflected appraisals during encoding of the other\u2019s behavior, if reflected appraisals were derived naturally from one\u2019s self-perceived vulnerability-expressive behavior, and if the other\u2019s behavior was constrained so that authenticity was more\n12 Additional analyses also compared the vulnerable condition with each of the other conditions. The interaction was marginal for the analysis comparing the vulnerable condition with the no-information control condition, F(1, 122) 3.47, p .065. The interaction was significant for the analysis comparing the vulnerable condition with the invulnerable condition, F(1, 121) 4.22, p .042. With one-tailed tests, both effects would be significant. The obtained interaction pattern was the same in both of these analyses. Additional mixed ANOVAs comparing the invulnerable condition with the other two conditions or with only the control condition produced no significant interactions ( ps .21). These results suggest that it was participants\u2019 beliefs that they were viewed as vulnerable, rather than factors such as activation of insecurity-related constructs, differences in time to complete dependent measures, or suspicion due to receiving information about what the confederate ostensibly had been told, that caused authenticity doubts.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nambiguous.13 However, as the manipulation was administered after the interaction, our design eliminates the alternative explanation that participants in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition elicited inauthentic expressions of happiness from the confederate.\nGeneral Discussion\nWhy do some individuals chronically feel insecure about a particular partner\u2019s regard and acceptance? We have proposed that individuals\u2019 own reactions to their insecurity initiate cognitions that perpetuate that insecurity. Specifically, our model posits that, when people feel insecure about a partner\u2019s regard and acceptance, they often judge their own prior behavior as having communicated insecurity and emotional vulnerability to the partner. Consequently, they come to believe that they are viewed as especially insecure and vulnerable. Then, due to shared beliefs that people walk on eggshells around insecure, vulnerable others, such reflected appraisals of vulnerability elicit doubts about the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard and acceptance. Once authenticity is doubted, positive expressions are discounted, negative expressions are augmented, and hidden negative regard is inferred even when partners are accepting and actually hold positive regard. This results in continued insecurity in the relationship. Hence, one reason why some people chronically feel insecure in particular relationships is because their own prior reactions to their insecurity have undermined their capacity to trust the partner\u2019s expressions of acceptance and positive regard.\nStudy 1 demonstrated that people believe expressions of regard toward interpersonally insecure and vulnerable others are relatively inauthentic. That is, walking on eggshells does appear to be a common perception of what people do when confronted with especially vulnerable and insecure interaction partners. Studies 2A, 2B, and 4 suggest that, when people believe they have expressed vulnerabilities to a romantic partner or friend, they believe they are viewed as especially vulnerable, which in turn predicts their suspicion regarding the authenticity of the other\u2019s expressions of positive regard and acceptance (Paths b and c in Figure 1). Independently of self-esteem and attachment anxiety, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, induced by one\u2019s own prior expressions of vulnerability, appear to turn the expectation of walking on eggshells around vulnerable and insecure individuals into suspicion about the partner\u2019s behavior.\nStudy 4 suggests that this process can operate independently of the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability and reported authenticity. Study 5 provides additional evidence for the role of subjective reflected appraisals of vulnerability in producing authenticity doubts, showing that directly inducing these reflected appraisals caused participants to doubt a new acquaintance\u2019s expressions of happiness despite the fact that the new acquaintance actually did not view them as especially vulnerable. According to our model, egocentric biases to focus on one\u2019s own behavior and internal experiences and to believe that others make more dispositional attributions for one\u2019s behavior than they actually do cause individuals who feel especially insecure in a relationship to believe that they are viewed as vulnerable by partners independently of whether partners actually view them this way. Once this belief is in place, the corresponding belief that others walk on eggshells around vulnerable individuals (demonstrated in Study 1) incites\ndoubts about the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard, even if partners have not responded by delivering inauthentic feedback.\nIn turn, Studies 3 and 4 showed that these doubts about the authenticity of a romantic partner\u2019s or a friend\u2019s regard predicted more pessimistic perceptions of the other\u2019s regard and caring (Path d in Figure 1). In Study 4, this effect was obtained after controlling for the friend\u2019s reports of regard and caring, suggesting that authenticity doubts initiate cognitive processes that undermine felt interpersonal security independently of partners\u2019 actual thoughts and feelings. According to our model, an individual\u2019s authenticity doubts create a disconnection between the partner\u2019s valuing and accepting behavior and the individual\u2019s inferences of value and acceptance. In particular, authenticity doubts may result in a downward estimation of the partner\u2019s true regard and acceptance, as expressions of positive regard are presumed to be exaggerated and clandestine rejection can be inferred from the partner\u2019s presumed cautious orientation. Thus, our findings suggest that one way in which people unwittingly remain insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance is that they behave in ways that ultimately and subjectively invalidate the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard and foster perceptions of negative regard despite the lack of confirmatory behavioral evidence and even in the presence of contradictory evidence.\nAlthough our studies support our model, we are not positing that our theorized predictors of each model variable are the only predictors. For instance, in addition to insecurity about a partner\u2019s regard and acceptance, perhaps insecure self-esteem engenders reactivity to esteem-threatening events (Kernis, 2003), which independently predicts reflected appraisals of vulnerability and, in turn, authenticity doubts. We found evidence for our model while controlling for low self-esteem, and insecurity about a partner\u2019s regard in particular did predict expressions of vulnerability and was predicted by authenticity doubts, but it may be the case that our model applies to events that threaten self-esteem just as well as it does to events that threaten relational security. Indeed, these two types of events seem to be highly confounded (MacDonald, Saltzman, & Leary, 2003; Murray et al., 1998, 2001). That is, events that threaten self-esteem tend to be events that threaten relational security and vice versa."}, {"heading": "Why Do Individuals Perpetuate Their Insecurity?", "text": "We certainly do not believe that people consciously wish to undermine their own security. Rather, when people are insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance, they are likely unaware of how their behavioral responses can perpetuate their insecurity. During social interaction, those who feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance and regard may often focus on present needs for security or\n13 Additional analyses examined whether self-esteem, gender, or confederate further moderated the two-way interaction. They did not ( ps .81). Additional mixed ANOVAs found no effects of condition on evaluation of the vulnerable or invulnerable feedback, more positive evaluations of the vulnerable feedback than of the invulnerable feedback in all conditions, and the same interaction after controlling for evaluation of the vulnerable feedback and its interaction with expressed versus felt happiness. These results suggest that negative evaluation of the feedback involved in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability manipulation did not account for the effects.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nself-protection. They may protect the self from perceived impending rejection by derogating the partner and the relationship (Murray et al., 2006) or seek reassurance to alleviate self-doubt (Coyne, 1999; Joiner, Metalsky, et al., 1999). In addition, vulnerabilities may be strategically expressed in an effort to suppress a partner\u2019s negative feedback, especially when one anticipates negative feedback and fears that it will be painful.\nHowever, whatever emotional gratification is conferred by such strategies may be only temporary. Responding to insecurity with use of these short-term emotion-regulation strategies may increase the probability of experiencing threats that create a need for similar regulation responses in the future. That is, by lashing out in response to perceived rejection or by seeming especially desirous of or dependent on a partner\u2019s approval, people cannot be sure whether subsequent apologies, affections, or approval reflect the partner\u2019s private sentiments. Burdened with this distrust, similar threats and insecurities are all the more forthcoming. Indeed, Study 4 showed that initial insecurity about a partner\u2019s regard, which was predicted by authenticity doubts, in turn predicted derogation of the partner and indirectly predicted later expressions of vulnerability, suggesting that authenticity doubts contribute to the experience and expression of insecurity that initially produced them (Path a in Figure 1). Seeking self-protection by derogating or punishing a partner (see Murray et al., 2006) or seeking interpersonal security by asking for reassurance, accompanied by inadvertent expressions of heightened insecurity and vulnerability to rejection, appears to be an example of a self-defeating tendency to prioritize short-term emotion regulation over self-regulation that promotes long-term interpersonal well-being (see Baumeister & Scher, 1988, for a review).\nShould Insecurities Be Suppressed?\nOur model and findings suggest that expressing interpersonal insecurities can perpetuate them. Does this mean that those who feel insecure within particular relationships should avoid disclosing their concerns to their partners? We believe the answer is no.\nSuppressing insecurities could result in those who are insecure never testing the reality of their partner\u2019s affections. In addition, by suggesting to the self that the partner cannot be trusted and by not sharing important aspects of the self, the suppression likely undermines feelings of intimacy. Other theoretical perspectives and findings suggest that self-disclosure, especially disclosure of emotions, enhances felt intimacy (Laurenceau, Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998; Reis & Shaver, 1988) and that emotional disclosure is more likely, is more desired, and elicits helping more in communal relationships than in noncommunal relationships (Clark, Fitness, & Brissette, 2000; Clark, Ouellette, Powell, & Milberg, 1987; Clark & Taraban, 1991). Suppressing insecurities and vulnerabilities, then, may deprive both partners of an intimate and optimally communal relationship. Moreover, actively attempting to suppress insecurities may have the ironic effect of making them all the more salient (Wenzlaff & Wegner, 2000).\nInstead, the cognitive consequences of expressions may need to be changed. Self-disclosure builds communal and intimate relationships when partners respond to the disclosure in ways that leave disclosers feeling valued and cared for (Reis & Shaver, 1988). We have argued that perceiving that one has expressed vulnerabilities causes authenticity doubts that interfere with such\nfeelings. However, the cycle of insecurity perpetuation that we have emphasized might be undermined by modifying the links between disclosure and authenticity doubts. If this were possible, those who express their vulnerabilities might be better able to perceive their partners as responding supportively. An accumulation of such interactions may then reduce the experience of relationship insecurities and, consequently, their expression.\nHow might these links be changed? We have posited particular cognitive distortions as mediating mechanisms. These distortions include a tendency to believe that one\u2019s behavior and internal experiences are more observable than they are and a tendency to exaggerate the extent to which others respond with dispositional attributions. Indeed, beliefs about being perceived as vulnerable largely accounted for the link between expressions of vulnerability and authenticity doubts. Thus, altering these cognitive distortions seems to be a promising strategy.\nMoreover, this strategy appears possible. Savtisky et al. (2001) argued that the illusion of transparency may be due to a focusing illusion\u2014the tendency to focus on specific stimuli and give undue weight to other stimuli when making predictions. That is, people mistakenly assume that their own behavior is just as salient to observers as it is to the self. Manipulations designed to eliminate this focusing illusion can change the way people believe they are viewed by others. For example, the tendency to feel negatively evaluated by others following public display of inadequacies or social blunders was reduced by instructing participants to defocus\u2014to consider the many factors that might affect the observer\u2019s evaluations (Savitsky et al., 2001, Studies 3 and 4). In addition, relative to control participants, those who were informed about the illusion of transparency\u2014in this case, the tendency to overestimate the extent to which others can observe one\u2019s anxiety\u2014gave better speeches and appeared more relaxed both from their own perspective and from the audience\u2019s perspective (Savitsky & Gilovich, 2003, Study 2). Perhaps those who are insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance can learn to broaden their focus and consider the many other factors that may determine whether partners perceive them as excessively interpersonally vulnerable. This may convince them that their interpersonal vulnerability is not as salient to their partners as they have presumed.\nFurther in the posited cycle, perhaps insecure individuals can learn to trust their partner\u2019s expressions of acceptance and positive regard despite the reflected appraisals of vulnerability. Although walking on eggshells appears to be a widely held belief about how people respond to others\u2019 insecurity, there may be individual differences. For example, people who are chronically attentive to social cues appear better able to detect others\u2019 ingratiating behavior (Jones & Baumeister, 1976). Such individuals are likely aware of the situational factors that motivate deceptive social behavior. Perhaps insecure individuals can learn to attend to and later remember cues suggesting the partner\u2019s authenticity. For example, they could take a partner\u2019s willingness to sometimes behave badly (i.e., selfishness, irritability) as evidence that their partners are authentic, rather than presuming rejection and maintaining authenticity doubts. They also could view relationship longevity and the partner\u2019s tolerance of one\u2019s transgressions as evidence that the partner must truly accept the self and value the relationship. These tactics also may involve a form of broadening one\u2019s focus, actively considering the partner\u2019s motives for authentic responding (e.g., the partner\u2019s desire for intimacy, the partner\u2019s values, or the\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npartner\u2019s desire to provide help through honest feedback) that may be operating alongside the presumed motive to provide inauthentic feedback."}, {"heading": "Implications for Research on Relationship Security", "text": "Our model is distinct from other perspectives on the maintenance of insecurity. Prior perspectives have posited either a perceptual confirmation process biased by individual differences or a behavioral confirmation process. A perceptual confirmation process occurs when prior expectations bias attention to and processing of social information in a manner that confirms those initial expectations (Snyder & Stukas, 1999). Several models positing that this type of bias is driven by individual differences have been proposed and empirically supported. For example, the sociometer model construes trait self-esteem as a barometer of one\u2019s value as a relationship partner over the long run (Leary & Baumeister, 2000). Moreover, because people with low self-esteem have a history of rejection, they are thought to be particularly vigilant for and likely to detect social rejection. Indeed, people with low self-esteem tend to perceive others as less accepting than do people with high self-esteem (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs, 1995; Lemay & Ashmore, 2006; Srivastava & Beer, 2005), and they substantially underestimate their romantic partner\u2019s love and regard for them (Murray et al., 2000, 2001). Individual differences in attachment-related anxiety and rejection sensitivity also have been viewed as sources of bias in perceiving rejection (e.g., Collins, 1996; Downey & Feldman, 1996).\nOther models have posited that insecurity is perpetuated through behavioral confirmation, such that insecure individuals behave in a manner that actually brings about rejection from relationship partners. Doubting a dating partner\u2019s regard, for example, predicts temporal decreases in that partner\u2019s trust and satisfaction (Murray et al., 2000), and rejection-sensitive individuals have partners who report less satisfaction and commitment and more anger following conflict (Downey et al., 1998). Coyne\u2019s (1976) interpersonal model of depression similarly posits that depressed individuals\u2019 excessive reassurance seeking is distressing to partners and may cause them to reject depressed individuals.\nOur model suggests another type of process that may perpetuate insecurity. In particular, although individual differences in general expectancies for rejection may predict felt insecurity and behavioral reactions to that insecurity, these reactions may exert effects on subsequent feelings of security independently of those initial expectancies and independently of the partner\u2019s reactions. This view is distinct from the individual-differences view in its emphasis on the biasing effects of one\u2019s own behavior within particular relationships. Moreover, our studies provide an empirical distinction; one\u2019s own expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts, and authenticity doubts predicted perceived rejection, independently of the general expectations for rejection reflected in low self-esteem and attachment-related anxiety. This view also is distinct from a behavioral confirmation view. Although both views emphasize the role of behavior in perpetuating insecurity, our model suggests that behavior may be a source of perceptual bias in addition to bringing about actual rejection by a partner. Our findings that one\u2019s own expressions of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts and per-\nceived rejection independently of the partner\u2019s reactions support this distinction, as does our experimental study.\nThe current research is just one example of how people\u2019s own interpersonal behaviors and their cognitions about their behaviors can influence their felt security. Some of our other findings also fit with this view\u2014people induced to believe that they have not been responsive to the needs of relationship partners and people who chronically felt that they were not responsive perceived that their relationship partners did not care for them (Lemay & Clark, in press; Lemay et al., 2007) independently of their partners\u2019 reports of their actual caring and independently of depression, self-esteem, and attachment-related anxiety and avoidance. That is, selfperceptions of one\u2019s own communal behavior affected perceptions of the other\u2019s caring even after accounting for the effects predicted by perceptual confirmation guided by individual differences and behavioral confirmation. A full understanding of how security is perpetuated may require use of several models, considering that individual differences in expectations for rejection may exert a direct bias on perceptions of rejection, that they may guide behavior that actually elicits rejection from others, and that they may guide behavior that itself independently biases subsequent perceptions.\nAlthough our model posits a normative relationship process that is initiated by and perpetuates relationship-specific insecurity, individual differences are likely to be important. Individual differences in proclivities to feel secure or insecure in relationships, such as low self-esteem, attachment-related anxiety, or rejection sensitivity, do predict felt security in particular relationships. They also likely predict reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts. Hence, these individual differences may act as distal predictors of any of our model components, which may then trigger the normative, cyclical relationship process we have emphasized. For example, those with low self-esteem or attachment anxiety may project their own insecurity onto the views they believe their partners hold of them. Once they believe they are viewed as highly insecure and vulnerable, the normative process we have emphasized may become operative; they may discount the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard, infer less positive regard than is the case, and express this insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard to the partner, which only reaffirms their belief that they are viewed as insecure. Indeed, in addition to finding evidence in support for our normative process model, we also found that low self-esteem and attachment anxiety predicted expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability. Low selfesteem also predicted authenticity doubts and insecurity about a partner\u2019s caring and regard. Hence, all else being equal, our normative model may especially pertain to the relationship dynamics of those who tend to be insecure in relationships generally because, through other processes not emphasized in the current research, such individuals are especially likely to intensely and frequently express vulnerabilities, believe they are viewed as vulnerable, and doubt authenticity. However, the process we have emphasized may describe specific relationships involving individuals who nevertheless tend to be secure in their other relationships."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Although people strongly desire involvement in caring, stable relationships, some individuals have difficulty maintaining their\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nconfidence that particular partners value, accept, and care for them. An important source of this difficulty may be the ways in which they attempt to achieve these types of relationships. By seeking security or self-protection in ways that express heightened vulnerabilities to rejection, they, at least in their own minds, have given their partners reason to be inauthentic, which only causes them to continue doubting their partners\u2019 sentiments. In this way, reactions to relationship threats in the present may impede relational security and necessitate similar reactions in the future.\nReferences\nBarry, R. A., Lakey, B., & Orehek, E.

Mikels, Sarah J. Sullivan, and Laura L. Carstensen Stanford University\nThe experience of mixed emotions increases with age. Socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that mixed emotions are associated with shifting time horizons. Theoretically, perceived constraints on future time increase appreciation for life, which, in turn, elicits positive emotions such as happiness. Yet, the very same temporal constraints heighten awareness that these positive experiences come to an end, thus yielding mixed emotional states. In 2 studies, the authors examined the link between the awareness of anticipated endings and mixed emotional experience. In Study 1, participants repeatedly imagined being in a meaningful location. Participants in the experimental condition imagined being in the meaningful location for the final time. Only participants who imagined \u201clast times\u201d at meaningful locations experienced more mixed emotions. In Study 2, college seniors reported their emotions on graduation day. Mixed emotions were higher when participants were reminded of the ending that they were experiencing. Findings suggest that poignancy is an emotional experience associated with meaningful endings.\nKeywords: mixed emotions, poignancy, endings, aging, socioemotional selectivity theory\nWhen John Updike described baseball legend Ted Williams\u2019 last time at bat, he wrote that the experience \u201ccrowd[ed] the throat with joy\u201d (Updike, 1960, p. 112). In doing so, Updike eloquently captured the phenomenon of poignancy: Watching his baseball hero\u2019s final swing simultaneously evoked positive and negative emotions. Recent research has shown that in everyday life, older people experience mixed emotions, such as happiness and sadness, more so than their younger counterparts and that this cooccurrence of positive and negative emotion becomes more frequent with age (Carstensen, Pasupathi, Mayr, & Nesselroade, 2000; Ong & Bergeman, 2004). In socioemotional selectivity theory (SST), Carstensen and colleagues (2000) argued that this occurs because older adults are more aware of limited time than younger adults and that the experience of \u201clast times\u201d increases with age (Carstensen, 2006; Carstensen, Fung, & Charles, 2003; Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). Consequently, even relatively positive everyday events become tinged with mixed emotions. However, a causal link between limited time and emotional experience has not been documented. The present studies\noffer evidence that limited time in the context of meaningful experience gives rise to poignancy.\nAging, Emotion, and Limited Time\nOver the past two decades, research on emotional functioning and emotional experience reveal more consistency than change in aging individuals. Most aspects of emotional experience are quite stable. Older adults do not differ from younger adults in the subjective intensities of self-reported emotions (see Levenson, 2000, for a review) or in the profiles of physiological reactivity (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991; Levenson, Carstensen, & Gottman, 1994). The spontaneous production of emotional faces and other aspects of emotional expressive behavior (Levenson et al., 1991; Tsai, Levenson, & Carstensen, 2000) also appear to change little.1 However, despite stability in the experience of elicited emotions, everyday emotional experience does change with age. Most notably, relative to their younger counterparts, older adults report fewer negative emotional experiences (Carstensen et al., 2000; Gross et al., 1997; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998), especially reductions in anger (Lawton, Kleban, & Dean, 1993; Magai, 1999), coupled with increases in positive affect (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998) or sustained levels of positive emotions (Carstensen et al., 2000). Furthermore, there is some evidence that older adults experience more complex emotional experiences. For example, among the young\u2013old, written descriptions of emotion are more complex (Labouvie-Vief, DeVoe, & Bulka, 1989), and positive and negative emotions co-occur more frequently (Carstensen et al., 2000; Ong & Bergeman, 2004).\nSST is a life-span theory of motivation that maintains that as time passes and people approach endings, activities that are devoid\n1 Note, however, that Malatesta-Magai, Jonas, Shepard, and Culvert (1992) found older adults to be more expressive.\nHal Ersner-Hershfield, Joseph A.

Interest in novel information\u2014because it is closely linked to future needs\u2014 declines. Instead, the increasing awareness of time constraints focuses attention on the present, and this temporal shift increases the value that people place on the most important aspects of life. Thus, SST posits that when the future is seen as expansive and endings are not acutely anticipated, greater focus is placed on knowledge-related goals and information seeking. By contrast, when individuals approach endings, they are motivated to pursue emotionally meaningful goals and focus more on the here and now (Carstensen, 1995; Carstensen et al., 1999). This increased focus on pursuing emotionally meaningful goals in the present leads to an intensified desire for and ultimate experience of more positive emotion and less negative emotion over time, as is observed with older adults. However, when time is constrained and people become progressively aware of the finitude of life, emotional experiences become increasingly more complex. Such states are positive given the pursuit of emotional goals but come to entail a mix of negative emotions because endings, by their very nature, also increase the anticipation of last times.\nMixed Emotions\nThe concept of poignancy presumes the experience of mixed emotions. Evidence exists that positive and negative emotions do occur closely together, if not simultaneously.2 At an empirical level, Williams and Aaker (2002), for instance, found that participants felt both happy and sad after viewing certain advertisements. Additionally, Larsen, McGraw, and Cacioppo (2001) demonstrated that participants felt both happy and sad on move-out day, on graduation day, and after watching the movie Life is Beautiful. Thus, although most emotional experiences are either positive or negative, there appear to be circumstances that give rise to mixed emotional experiences.\nDefining Poignancy\nMixed emotions can take on many different forms, be it a combination of anger and joy, disgust and satisfaction, or embarrassment and sadness. But unlike these other instances of mixed emotions, poignancy seems to be particular to the experience of endings, of no longer having something that one once had. And, we maintain that whereas the anticipation of an ending is not a necessary component of other mixed emotions, it is integral to the experience of poignancy. For example, nostalgia (Wildschut, Sedikides, Arndt, & Routledge, 2006), which although also composed of mixed emotions, involves thinking back on momentous experiences that have already occurred, rather than experiencing or anticipating endings. Our view is consistent with that of philosopher Karl Duncker, who argued that poignancy results from recognizing that something once possessed is or will no longer be present: \u201cA feeling of not having takes on a greater poignancy if it is a no-longer-having, a loss (whether of something actually or almost possessed)\u201d (Duncker, 1941, p. 418). In Duncker\u2019s framework, then, it is the awareness or anticipation of not having something that one once had that breeds poignancy. Duncker\u2019s theorizing speaks directly to the intimate relationship between poignancy and endings in life that mark the passage of time. The heightened sense of mortality that occurs naturally as individuals\nprogress through life gives rise to an appreciation of life\u2019s fragility along with an awareness that the most cherished aspects of life are fleeting. Lazarus\u2019s (1991) appraisal theory suggests that such a sense of loss is normally associated with sadness. However, because feelings of poignancy also involve the knowledge that one is progressing through life, a sense of happiness is evoked as well. Accordingly, we postulate that poignancy comprises a mixture of happiness and sadness that occurs when one faces meaningful endings.\nTo date, causal relationships among aging, anticipated endings, and mixed emotions remain theoretical. In particular, SST posits that the associations between aging and poignancy are accounted for by perceived constraints on time. If the sense of limited time rather than changes in processes associated with aging causes changes in emotional experience, then younger adults in limitedtime situations should also, theoretically, experience comparable emotional states as older adults under experimental conditions that constrain time.\nAlthough previous research has demonstrated that older adults experience poignancy more frequently than younger adults (Carstensen et al., 2000; Ong & Bergeman, 2004), there is no empirical evidence to suggest that older adults experience poignancy in an ever-present ubiquitous fashion. Mailing a letter or brushing one\u2019s teeth may be no more likely to elicit poignancy in an older person than a younger person. Seeing an old friend, however, may generate different experiences for the old and the young. In theoretical terms, poignancy occurs in the face of significant endings that signify the passage of time. SST suggests that a sense of limited time causes an individual to focus on emotionally meaningful aspects of life. Poignancy, then, may arise not only when time is limited but also when individuals are faced with the potential loss of something emotionally meaningful.\nOverview of the Present Research\nIn the present studies, we tested the link between limited-time horizons and the experience of mixed emotions. In Study 1, participants in one of two conditions were induced through systematic imagery to imagine that they were in a meaningful location. Limited time was manipulated by instructing participants in the experimental condition to imagine that they were in the location for the final time. In Study 2, participants were asked to report their emotions during the real-life ending of college graduation.\nWe sought to test two hypotheses: First, under controlled conditions in a laboratory setting, does limited time give rise to the experience of poignancy? If poignancy results from appreciating the fragility of life through the lens of limited time, then imagining doing something meaningful for the final time, such as spending time at a favorite location, should produce poignancy, regardless of age. Accordingly, in Study 1, we expected that participants in the experimental condition would experience more poignancy dur-\n2 Although it remains contested whether differently valenced emotions can co-occur (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Russell & Carroll, 1999), it should be noted that the plausibility of mixed emotional experiences does not play a role in this debate. Rather, the central question in this dispute concerns whether individual positive and negative emotions can co-occur at the exact same moment in time (Feldman Barrett & Russell, 1998).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\ning the limited-time guided imagery induction than participants in the control condition.\nSecond, we examined whether a real-life ending could produce the experience of poignancy and whether placing emphasis on this ending could heighten the experience of poignancy. As such, in Study 2, we hypothesized that college seniors would experience poignancy on their graduation day and that drawing attention to the natural ending would increase this sense of poignancy.\nStudy 1"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Research Participants", "text": "Sixty younger participants (25 men, 35 women; M 19.62 years; 50% Caucasian, 25% African American, 25% \u201cother\u201d) and 60 older participants (26 men, 34 women; M 77.47 years; 81.67% Caucasian, 16.67% African American, 1.66% \u201cother\u201d) took part in the study.

To eliminate variation in the experimental induction, instructions for each scenario were recorded using iTunes software and were played for participants. Participants were seated in front of the computer and were instructed to do the following: \u201cThink of a place that has personal significance to you. Please think of a specific, meaningful location that you go to with people whom you care about.\u201d After the participant had selected a meaningful location, the experimenter recorded the location.\nParticipants were then taken through three guided imagery induction trials. In the first trial, participants were given the following instructions:\nPlease close your eyes. Now please take a moment to imagine being at the location that you just described. As best you can, place yourself in the location. Notice your surroundings. Notice any people whom you are with, their faces, and voices. Take in everything that you see. Listen carefully to the sounds of your surroundings. Take a deep breath and notice the smells. Notice the air on your skin. Now take whatever time you need to fully experience the sights, sounds, and smells of the environment and the overall experience of the location. When you are ready, please open your eyes.\nUpon completing this induction, all participants completed an emotion questionnaire on the computer in which they rated the degree to which they were experiencing each of 19 different emotions (positive: accomplishment, amusement, contentment, excitement, happiness, interest, joy, and pride; negative: anger, anxiety, boredom, disgust, embarrassment, fear, frustration, guilt, irritation, sadness, and shame) on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely).\nThe second guided imagery induction trial immediately followed this emotion questionnaire and was identical to the first trial in all but one respect: In this trial, participants were asked to imagine the experience of being at their favorite location as if they were there in 2 months\u2019 time. After this guided imagery induction, all participants completed the same emotion questionnaire again.\nIn the third guided imagery induction, participants in the control condition were asked to imagine the experience of being at their favorite location as if they were there in 4 months\u2019 time. Control participants then completed the emotion questionnaire for the final time. In the experimental limited-time condition, however, participants were asked to imagine the experience of being at their favorite location as if they were there in 4 months\u2019 time and, importantly, as though this would be the last time that they would be able to visit the meaningful location. After finishing the third trial, participants in the experimental condition then completed the emotion questionnaire for the final time. Thus, the experimental manipulation occurred during the third trial.\nTable 1 Participant Characteristic Information in Study 1\nVariable\nYounger (n 60)\nOlder (n 60)\nM SD M SD\nAge 19.63 1.40 77.47 6.88 Household income ($ in K) 63.39 59.77 63.58 47.80 Digit Span\nForward 9.88 2.42 7.88 2.19 Backward 8.72 2.73 6.15 2.41 Verbal Fluency Animal 21.92 4.73 14.95 4.83 F, A, S naming 14.88 3.45 11.78 3.60 Wahler Physical Symptoms 44.10 22.33 37.60 22.22\nNote.

To measure co-occurrence in their experience-sampling procedure study, Carstensen et al. (2000) computed, for each participant, a Pearson\u2019s r correlation between positive and negative emotion across 35 sampling occasions. Accordingly, r values near zero were associated with a greater degree of co-occurrence, whereas highly negative r values indicated that positive and negative emotion were not often present during the same sampling occasion. However, because the present investigation was concerned with one emotional reaction as a function of a specific time-limiting manipulation, a correlational analysis was not feasible. Rather, a more immediate measure of mixed emotions was needed.\nIn the literature on attitudinal ambivalence, Kaplan (1972) proposed a metric that could be used to assess the degree to which attitudes or feelings were mixed about an object or event. Recently, Kaplan\u2019s (1972) metric has been used to capture mixed emotions (Wildschut et al., 2006). Using Kaplan\u2019s (1972) formula, mixed emotions were defined as:\nME PA NA PA NA .\nIn this equation, ME refers to mixed emotions, PA to average positive affect, and NA to average negative affect. However, as noted by Priester and Petty (1996), Kaplan\u2019s (1972) formula can be reduced to simply two times the minimum amount of PA and NA. Thus, it is easier to conceptualize mixed emotions as the minimum of PA and NA. Such an approach has been taken by both Schimmack (2001) and Larsen, McGraw, Mellers, and Cacioppo (2004).\nMore important, the MIN formula assigns a high mixed emotion score to experiences in which positive and negative emotions are both relatively high. For example, if PA 3 and NA 2, then the mixed emotion score would equal 2; if PA 4 and NA 3, then the mixed emotion score would equal 3. Indeed, we have argued that a poignant experience represents such a mix of emotions, indicating that the MIN formula is appropriate for our purposes. Emotional experiences that are unidirectional in nature (i.e., cases\nin which the score of one emotion is very low and the other is moderate or high) receive the lowest possible mixed emotion score. So, for a case in which PA 3 and NA 1, the mixed emotion score would equal 1; likewise, for a case in which PA 5 and NA 1, the mixed emotion score would again equal 1. Both experiences are similarly unidirectional and, as such, receive low mixed emotion scores.\nHowever, because our conceptualization of poignancy involves the positive emotion of happiness3 and the negative emotion of sadness, the mixed emotions measure that we use here is defined as:\nME MIN Happiness, Sadness ,\nwhere ME refers to mixed emotions and MIN refers to minimum."}, {"heading": "Tests of Main Hypotheses", "text": "Changes in happiness and sadness. Before exploring the mixed emotion scores, we examined changes in happiness and sadness independently. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with two between-subjects factors (age group: young, old; condition: control, experimental) and two within-subjects factors (time: first imagery induction time trial, second imagery induction time trial, third imagery induction time trial; valence: positive, negative) was used to examine the effect of the experimental limited-time manipulation on happiness and sadness. Results indicated that there was a main effect of valence, such that all participants experienced a greater degree of happiness relative to sadness, F(1, 116) 218.35, p .001. There was no Age Group Valence interaction, indicating that older adults and younger adults experienced similar amounts of sadness and happiness. Table 2 depicts the happiness and sadness emotion mean scores for all three time trials for both conditions and age groups.\nMoreover, results indicated that the limited-time manipulation significantly affected participants\u2019 emotional experience. Specifically, a Time Valence interaction, F(2, 115) 48.43, p .001, was qualified by a significant Time Valence Condition three-way interaction, F(2, 115) 30.17, p .001. To examine the nature of this interaction, we ran paired samples t tests so that happiness and sadness before the experimental limited-time manipulation could be directly compared with happiness and sadness after the experimental limited-time manipulation. Specifically, participants in the control condition exhibited a significant decrease in happiness from the second imagery induction time trial to the third imagery induction time trial, t(59) 2.73, p .01. It is possible that this decrease in positive emotion was a function of simple habituation to the initial happiness experienced (Frijda, 1988). Tellingly, control condition participants showed no comparable change in terms of sadness, indicating that in the absence of a limited-time manipulation, the experience of this emotion does not change from the second imagery induction time trial to the third imagery induction time trial, t(59) 0.38, p .70. By contrast, the participants in the experimental condition showed changes in both happiness and sadness. These participants showed\n3 Although other emotions, such as joy, are closely related to happiness, for the sake of parsimony, we opted to use a single indicator of positive emotion (happiness) and a single indicator of negative emotion (sadness).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\na significant decrease in happiness from the second imagery trial to the third imagery trial, t(59) 4.81, p .001, and a significant increase in sadness from the second imagery trial to the third imagery trial, t(59) 10.20, p .001. As such, the paired samples t tests revealed that the limited-time manipulation caused participants to experience more sadness and less happiness. Note, however, that although experimental condition participants showed a trend toward experiencing more sadness than happiness, t(29) 1.99, p .052, these participants were nevertheless endorsing happiness at a level that was above the midpoint of the scale. Put another way, participants in the experimental condition maintained levels of happiness above the midpoint of the scale despite a spike in sadness. More important, there were no age group interactions, indicating that both older and younger adults were affected by the limited-time manipulation in similar ways. Again, see Table 2 for the happiness and sadness mean scores and standard deviations for all three time trials for both conditions and age groups.\nChanges in mixed emotions. The decrease in happiness and increase in sadness suggest a more mixed emotional experience as a function of the limited-time manipulation. But because these changes in emotional experience correspond to mean-level changes across participants, they do not speak to changes in emotional experience within individuals. To examine changes in emotional experience within individuals, we calculated mixed emotion scores for each participant, as described above, using the MIN measure. We ran a repeated measures ANOVA on these scores with two between-subjects factors (age group: young, old; condition: control, experimental) and one within-subjects factor (time: first imagery induction time trial, second imagery induction time trial, third imagery induction time trial). Results indicated that there was a main effect of time, such that mixed emotions increased over the course of the three imagery inductions, F(2, 115) 8.68, p .001. This main effect of time was qualified by a significant Time Condition interaction, F(2, 115) 12.33, p .001. To elucidate this Time Condition interaction, we ran paired samples t tests so that the experience of mixed emotions before the limited-time induction could be directly compared with the experience of mixed emotions after the limited-time induction. Participants in the control condition showed no significant change\nin mixed emotions from the second imagery induction trial to the third imagery induction trial, t(59) 0.64, p .53. Participants in the experimental condition, in contrast, showed a significant increase in mixed emotions from the second imagery induction trial to the third imagery induction trial, t(59) 5.03, p .001. This increase in mixed emotions, then, can be attributed to the limitedtime manipulation that occurred between the second guided imagery induction trial and the third guided imagery induction trial. Figure 1 depicts the mixed emotion scores for all three guided imagery induction time trials for both conditions. Finally, there was no significant Age Group Condition interaction, nor was there a Time Condition Age Group three-way interaction, indicating that both age groups responded to the limited-time manipulation in similar ways.\nExamining the relationship between happiness and sadness. As noted above, the limited-time manipulation caused participants\u2019 happiness to decrease and their sadness to increase, leading to a mixed emotional state. However, was this emotional experience reflective of a qualitatively distinct, \u201cmixed\u201d state? Or, was this result just a reflection of an inverse relationship between happiness and sadness? For participants in both conditions, there was no relationship between happiness and sadness on the first two guided imagery induction trials, control participants: r(58) .14, p .29 and r(58) .22, p .09; experimental participants: r(58) .23, p .08 and r(58) .16, p .23. However, for the third imagery induction, because of the changing nature of happiness and sadness, participants in both conditions exhibited moderate negative correlations between happiness and sadness, control participants: r(58) .36, p .005; experimental participants: r(58) .39, p .005.\nIn summary, we examined whether limited time resulted in the mixed emotional experience of poignancy. Results indicated that the limited-time manipulation gave rise to a significant increase in the experience of sadness and a significant decrease in the experience of happiness. Furthermore, upon examining the mixed emotions metric, we found that those participants in the experimental condition experienced an increase in mixed emotions as a function of the limited-time manipulation. More important, envisioning endings did not turn a positive experience into a negative experience; rather, it added a component of sadness to an already happy\nTable 2 Happiness and Sadness Means and Standard Deviations by Time Trial and Condition for Both Age Groups in Study 1\nVariable\nHappiness Sadness\nTime 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 1 Time 2 Time 3\nM SD M SD M SD M SD M SD M SD\nYounger Control 6.13 0.90 6.10 0.96 5.47 1.70 2.03 1.75 1.93 1.67 2.13 1.66 Exp. 6.00 1.05 5.87 1.50 4.60 1.55 2.77 1.63 2.63 1.71 5.43 1.72 Older Control 6.00 1.41 5.97 1.22 5.63 1.50 2.47 2.17 2.50 2.06 2.40 2.19 Exp. 6.23 1.04 5.73 1.34 4.47 2.39 1.87 1.41 2.03 1.47 5.33 2.25 Total Control 6.07 1.18 6.03 1.08 5.55 1.59 2.25 1.98 2.22 1.88 2.27 1.93 Exp. 6.12 1.04 5.80 1.41 4.53 2.00 2.32 1.58 2.33 1.61 5.38 1.94\nNote.

These findings held true for both younger and older age groups, suggesting that a meaningful limited-time situation4 such as an ending can produce poignancy regardless of age. However, this study was conducted in a laboratory setting using hypothetical endings. To what extent, then, does poignancy arise during an actual ending in the real world? To address this issue, we conducted a second study in which emotions were assessed during a real ending.\nStudy 2\nIn Study 1, we demonstrated that a meaningful ending gave rise to the experience of poignancy. In that study, we used a guided imagery induction in a laboratory setting to evoke poignancy. Although past research has demonstrated that guided imagery inductions can be used as an effective tool to generate an emotional experience (Gerrardshesse, Spies, & Hesse, 1994), a question remains: Do endings in a natural setting also elicit poignancy? Furthermore, can the salience of an ending be emphasized to amplify the feeling of poignancy? To answer these questions, in Study 2, we surveyed graduating college students about their emotional experiences on graduation day. For some participants, we emphasized the ending that they were experiencing (limitedtime condition), whereas for other participants, we did not emphasize the ending that they were experiencing (control condition). It is important to note that because all participants were experiencing an ending, we expected feelings of poignancy to be relatively high in both conditions. However, because we placed emphasis on the ending in the limited-time condition, we expected poignancy to be even higher in that condition than in the control condition.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred ten graduating seniors at Stanford University (49 men, M 22.06 years; 56 women, M 21.80 years, and 5 participants who failed to report their age or gender) participated in the study.

SST suggests that the sense of limited time causes an individual to focus on things in life that are emotionally meaningful. Do even mundane everyday experiences become meaningful under limited-time conditions? Alternatively, are mixed emotions restricted to emotionally meaningful situations? In order to disentangle these factors, we conducted a side study in which meaning and time limitations were experimentally manipulated. Results indicated that for participants imagining the experience of being at a nonmeaningful location, very little emotion was experienced, and, accordingly, a limited-time manipulation did not produce significant changes in emotional experience.\nFigure 1.

These results indicate that a natural ending can produce the experience of poignancy. Furthermore, when participants were reminded of the ending that they were experiencing, feelings of poignancy were heightened."}, {"heading": "Examining the Relationship Between Happiness and Sadness", "text": "In Study 1, we found a negative relationship between happiness and sadness for participants in both the control and experimental conditions. Because participants repeatedly imagined being at a meaningful location and were then asked to imagine a final time there, it is possible that a bias in affective forecasting might have led to this negative correlation. In previous studies, Gilbert, Wilson, and colleagues have demonstrated that when thinking about future events, people tend to overestimate how negative they will actually feel and underestimate how positive they will actually feel (Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, & Wheatley, 1998; Wilson & Gilbert, 2003, 2005). It is possible, then, that because participants in Study 1 were asked to make judgments regarding feelings they would experience during a hypothetical ending, they reported feeling more sadness and less happiness than they would when facing an actual ending in the real world. Such an inflation of sadness and deflation of happiness perhaps led to the negative correlation between the two emotions. Because our measure of emotion in Study 2 involved a real-world examination of poignancy, we did not expect there to be a strong negative relationship between happiness and sadness. Indeed, in Study 2, the correlations between happiness and sadness were nonsignificant, control condition: r(57) .17, p .21; experimental condition: r(49) .26, p .07. Unlike our hypothetical exercise in the laboratory setting, in the case of a real-life ending, it seems that both emotions related to each other in a slightly positive direction.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nGeneral Discussion\nWe maintain that the experience of poignancy can be considered a mixed emotional experience that occurs when one is reminded of the passing of time during a meaningful experience. To test the causal link between endings and the experience of mixed emotions, we measured participants\u2019 emotional responses while imagining a visit to a meaningful location for the last time. Results from Study 1 indicated that the limited-time manipulation gave rise to a significant decrease in the experience of happiness and a significant increase in the experience of sadness from baseline. Moreover, upon examining the mixed emotions scores, we found that a sense of limited time did indeed produce a mixed emotional experience. It should be noted that this mixed emotional experience was not unidirectionally negative in nature but rather remained positive as well. Hence, one critical component to the experience of poignancy appears to be a sense of limited time. Results from Study 2 showed that real-life endings outside of the laboratory also produce a sense of poignancy. As such, we provide evidence that the experience of poignancy involves mixed emotions in the face of a meaningful ending.\nOur conceptualization of poignancy arises out of the observation that chronological age is correlated with mortality. Subsequently, in daily life, we postulate that older people are more aware of endings than younger people are. We hypothesized that endings provoke a mixed emotional experience because a sense of limited time focuses individuals on emotionally meaningful goals. Such goals tend to be positive in nature, yet, because an ending highlights the passing of time, it also gives rise to an increase in negative emotion. Previous research has demonstrated that older adults experience such poignant states more often than younger adults (Carstensen et al., 2000; Ong & Bergeman, 2004), but the extent to which this change in emotional experience is due to a sense of limited time and not simply the result of changes in other processes associated with aging has not been explored. More important, in both studies we demonstrated that the experience of poignancy occurs equally in younger and older adults. Thus, here we provide the first evidence that some of the changes in emotional experience associated with aging (viz. poignancy) are a result of facing a meaningful ending rather than a result of chronological age per se.\nAlthough these results provide experimental support for the assertion that certain age-related changes in emotional experience are due to a shift in time perspective, alternative possibilities have been offered to address mixed emotions in old age. Williams and Aaker (2002), for instance, have proposed that older adults experience co-occurring positive and negative emotions because they are more likely than younger adults to accept the duality of emotional experience. In other words, compared with younger adults, older adults are better able to recognize that emotions do not have to be experienced in a unidirectional way. Such an explanation for poignancy is not necessarily at odds with SST\u2019s account that poignancy arises as a result of limited time. It is possible, for example, that limited time can also cause an individual to be more accustomed to accepting duality. Just the same, future research should attempt to disentangle these two explanations of poignancy.\nOur findings lend support to Cacioppo and colleagues\u2019 contention that mixed emotional experiences can and do occur (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). As demonstrated in both studies, when individuals face endings, emotional experience includes a mixture of happiness and sadness. But although emotional experience is mixed, these results do not speak to the nature of the behavioral output, or action tendency (Lazarus, 1991) that would arise from the experience of poignancy. Previous research makes us doubtful that the action tendency of poignancy\u2014 or the action tendency of any emotion for that matter\u2014would be mixed (Feldman Barrett & Russell, 1998). Lazarus (1991), for example, has noted that the action tendency of happiness is to approach others and share with them one\u2019s positive outcomes. On the contrary, sadness leads to a state of withdrawal and avoidance of others (Frijda, 1988). In theory, then, the action tendency of poignancy would most likely be singularly valenced. Future studies are necessary, however, to discern the nature of behavioral responses to mixed emotional experiences.\nWe found that poignant experiences entailed a mix of happiness and sadness. Was this experience truly mixed? Or, were our results a reflection of an inverse relationship between the two emotions? Although it is true that there was a significant negative correlation between happiness and sadness for participants experiencing poignancy in the experimental condition of Study 1, r(58) .39, p .005, it should be noted that this correlation is moderate in magnitude (Cohen, 1988) and not large, as might be expected if positive emotions simply replaced negative emotions. Furthermore, we found a trend toward a positive relationship between happiness and sadness in our real-world examination of poignancy. As noted above, the discrepancy between the correlations from Study 1 and Study 2 might be a function of a bias in affective forecasting that occurred during Study 1 but not Study 2. Unlike Study 1, in Study 2, participants were asked to report how they felt during a real-life ending. Understandably, we did not obtain a similar negative correlation. Nevertheless, future research should be conducted to further examine the relationship between happiness and sadness during mixed emotional experiences. Furthermore, in both Study 1 and Study 2, we found that the mix of happiness and sadness that participants felt was characterized by the addition of sadness to an already happy experience. Put another way, the endings did not in themselves produce the experience of happiness. However, it could be the case that some special cases of endings will actually give rise to both happiness and sadness. Future research should attempt to document various types of endings and the effects that they have on poignancy.\nLastly, researchers such as Larsen, Hemenover, Norris, and Cacioppo (2003) and Spiegel (1998) have noted that the coactivation of positive and negative emotion can often be an important step in the coping process, for the ability to face and accept negative life events is a crucial aspect of the healing course. Spiegel, Bloom, Kraemer, and Gottheil (1989) found, for example, that breast cancer patients who underwent group therapy and expressed the full range of their emotions lived twice as long as control patients who were in no such therapy group. Similarly, Bower, Kemeny, Taylor, and Fahey (1998) demonstrated that bereaved HIV-seropositive men showed positive health outcomes\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nwhen they both confronted stressors in their lives and found a sense of meaning in the trauma that they had undergone. Finally, Carstensen et al. (2000) found that emotional complexity in everyday life is associated with less neuroticism and better emotional control. Thus, to the degree that mixed emotional experiences can aid in the coping process, poignancy may be a special case of a mixed emotional experience that may help individuals in dealing with anticipated loss.\nIn summary, findings from the present studies lend further support to the notion that certain age-related changes in emotional experience are due to the experience of limited time and are not necessarily a result of organic processes associated with aging, such as the degradation of physical or cognitive abilities. As SST predicts, a sense of limited time, when coupled with the loss of something emotionally meaningful, produces the experience of poignancy.\nReferences\nBower, J. E., Kemeny, M. E., Taylor, S.

Fourier analysis decomposes this complex wave into a set of sinusoidal component waves. In some phenomena, the amplitude of these waves varies in inverse relation to frequency. This pattern has been called 1/f noise and, unlike white noise, it reflects nonrandom variation. Latencies in simple computer tasks typically reveal 1/f noise, but the magnitude of the noise decreases as tasks become more challenging. The current work hypothesizes a correspondence between 1/f noise and effort, leading to the prediction that increasing effort will reduce 1/f noise. In 2 studies, the author examined the relationship between an individual\u2019s attempts to avoid bias (measured in Study 1, manipulated in Study 2) and 1/f noise in implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice. In each study, participants who made an effort to modulate the use of racial information showed less 1/f noise than did participants who made less effort. The potential value of this analytic approach to social psychology is discussed.\nKeywords: 1/f noise, effort, stereotyping, prejudice\nRecent decades have witnessed dramatic changes in the study of stereotyping and prejudice. As egalitarianism gained prominence in the United States (Devine & Elliot, 1995), psychologists responded by developing ever more delicate measures to assess bias. Initially, researchers simply replaced direct questions about intergroup attitudes with more subtly phrased, indirect questions about racially or ethnically sensitive issues (e.g., McConahay, Hardee, & Batts, 1981), but, more recently, computer-based measures have proliferated. These computer tasks are usually designed to be difficult or impossible to strategically control. For example, an evaluative priming task, developed by Fazio and his colleagues (Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, & Williams, 1995), primes participants with either a Black face or a White face before asking them to classify a target word as good or bad. Participants typically classify positively valenced words (e.g., flower, rainbow) more quickly after seeing a White face than after a Black face, but they classify negative words (e.g., cockroach, death) more quickly after seeing a Black face than after a White face. Other prominent measures include the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), the Lexical Decision Task (Wittenbrink, Judd, & Park, 1997), and the Go/No-Go Association Task (Nosek & Banaji, 2001).\nA common feature of many computer tasks is that they require numerous responses. A typical paradigm involves something on the order of 100 trials, each requiring a separate reaction. An\nimplementation of Fazio et al.\u2019s (1995) task might pair each of 5 Black and 5 White faces with 10 positive target words and 10 negative target words, yielding 200 trials over the entire study. The rationale for such high numbers is simple. A participant\u2019s responses on any single trial are subject to several influences. One influence should, at least in theory, be the participant\u2019s general evaluation of Whites and Blacks. To the extent that the participant reacts more negatively to Blacks than to Whites, a Black prime should facilitate responses to negative words and a White prime should facilitate reactions to positive words. But on any given trial, the effect of the psychological response in which the experimenter is interested is presumably quite small. It may be overwhelmed by other, less theoretically interesting sources of variance. The participant may blink at the moment the prime appears, or the particular face or target word presented may conjure up idiosyncratic associations (e.g., \u201cShe looks like my roommate\u201d). If the task includes a sufficient number of trials and a sufficient variety of stimuli, these extraneous influences should cancel each other out and produce only a negligible effect. Averaging across all instances of a given trial type (e.g., all trials on which a Black face precedes a positive word) minimizes the influence of unintended variables, revealing the one factor that systematically influences responses on every trial: the participant\u2019s attitudes toward Whites and Blacks.\nAggregation, however, sacrifices a great deal of information about trial-by-trial variation in response times. Researchers generally assume that residual variability in the latencies (after accounting for the particular condition on each trial) is random and meaningless. Given that assumption, the sacrifice seems acceptable because a variable that fluctuates randomly cannot convey information. But what if residuals vary in a nonrandom fashion? Just as systematic differences in the average response times to Black and White faces can inform researchers about implicit bias, systematic differences in patterns of variability in those responses may hold important clues about the psychological states of the participants (e.g., the diffusion model; Ratcliff, Van Zandt, & This material is based on work supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant F31-MH069017.

In line with this possibility, in the current article, I examine measures of implicit racial bias to test the possibilities that (a) trial-to-trial fluctuations often vary in a nonrandom fashion and (b) the pattern of variability depends on participants\u2019 taskrelated effort. Although this research focuses on racial bias, the essential point of this article applies to other areas of research. In many areas of social psychology, variance that is treated as meaningless may contain valuable information. If so, analytic strategies like those presented here may provide social psychologists with additional techniques to investigate the phenomena that interest them.\nIt is important to note that this article does not dispute the value of aggregation as a means of isolating the influence of attitudes or associations on implicit tasks. The thrust of the argument is simply that researchers can glean additional, potentially valuable information by analyzing \u201cerror\u201d variance rather than throwing it away. What makes this approach important for researchers in the field of social psychology is that it can be applied to the kinds of data that are already being collected in laboratories around the world. It can even be applied retroactively to existing data sets. With no additional equipment and no new measures, these data can be reharvested, allowing researchers to potentially gain new insight into human behavior. The strategy used here is based on work investigating 1/f noise.\n1/f Noise and Response Times\n1/f noise refers to nonrandom variation over space or time. 1/f noise is intriguing in part because it seems to characterize a wide range of phenomena, from variation in the magnitude of earthquakes and the intensity of pulsar emissions to fluctuations in the auditory frequency of music. Each of these phenomena can be represented as a complex waveform (e.g., the notes weaving up and down as one reads a sheet of music). In similar fashion, in the present work, I examine the fluctuations in response latency that occur from one trial to the next as a participant performs a computer task (see the top panel of Figure 1). This work draws on research by Gilden (2001) and others, which tests for 1/f noise in a trial series\u2014treating the trial-by-trial variations in residualized latency data as a wave.\n1/f noise is examined by applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the complicated wave of latency data, decomposing it into several pure sinusoidal waves (see the middle panel of Figure 1). Adding these component waves back together reproduces the original wave. Component waves can vary in terms of their frequency and power (a function of the wave\u2019s amplitude), and one can plot the power of each component wave against its frequency\u2014after log transforming both variables\u2014to examine the relationship between them. This scatter plot is called a power spectral density (PSD) chart (see the bottom panel of Figure 1).\nIf trial-by-trial variations are random (i.e., if the residual on trial Xn is independent of the residual on trial Xn k), the PSD should show white noise: The power and frequency of the component waves should not covary in any systematic fashion (after all, the wave is random). On average, a random trial series therefore yields a PSD in which the slope between power and frequency does not differ from zero. 1/f phenomena, by contrast, produce a PSD with a negative slope: Lower frequency waves have more power than do higher frequency waves. That is, the power of a component\nwave is proportional to the inverse of its frequency, or power (1/frequency). This relationship is the origin of the term 1/f noise. The pattern is also called 1/f noise, where designates the slope of the power\u2013frequency relationship, or pink noise because the PSD of the color pink similarly reveals that lower frequencies have greater power.\nResearch in cognitive psychology has demonstrated that individuals performing simple tasks (e.g., determining whether a target is present vs. absent, pressing a button at regular intervals) show 1/f noise in their responses. That is, after the effects of any independent variables under investigation are partialed out, a PSD of the residual latencies reveals the characteristic negative slope of 1/f noise. This pattern is strongest or most negative at lower frequencies and tends to flatten as frequency increases. Gilden (2001; Gilden, Thornton, & Mallon, 1995; Thornton & Gilden, 2005) has proposed a dual-component model of 1/f noise in cognition. According to this model, 1/f variation (which may reflect cognitive functioning) is masked at high frequencies because of truly random variation or white noise from other sources. Gilden attributed this high-frequency noise to muscle activity. Figure 2 (left panel) shows a fairly typical PSD for a participant performing a response-latency\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\ntask. The negative slope suggests 1/f noise. It is important to note that these patterns are inherently a function of the temporal order of the data series. Compromising that order eliminates the 1/f noise pattern. For example, if the residual data that produced Figure 2\u2019s left panel are shuffled randomly, a Fourier analysis yields a flat, white PSD (see Figure 2, center panel).\nThe source of 1/f noise in reaction times is something of a puzzle\u2014 one that is beyond the scope of the current article. The following discussion merely attempts to give a rough overview of some of the important issues. In an influential review, Gilden (2001) referred to 1/f noise as a \u201ccarrier signal\u201d (p. 55) for the working mind. This is an intriguing and provocative statement, but it leaves the genesis and meaning of the phenomenon unclear. Van Orden and his colleagues (Van Orden & Holden, 2002; Van Orden, Holden, & Turvey, 2003) have observed that 1/f noise emerges from dynamic systems operating on the verge of chaos (Bak, 1990). Partly on the basis of this correspondence, they argued that 1/f noise in response times stems from self-organized criticality in the brain itself. Usher has tested neural network models, which offer oblique support for this possibility (Usher, Stemmler, & Olami, 1995, cited in Ward, 2002). When these networks are calibrated to behave in a manner consistent with real neurons (i.e., exhibiting priming effects at the level of individual neurons), two critical elements emerge: The system\u2019s activation fluctuates chaotically and the individual artificial neurons emit 1/f noise. Van Orden ultimately suggested that if the brain functions in a self-organized, verge-of-chaos fashion, psychologists may need to reconsider the basic assumptions of their science. He argued that selforganization implies bidirectional causal influences. Goals and efforts, which are presumed to generate or cause behavior, must also be seen as consequences of the actions to which they give rise. It is important to note, however, that this position is contested (Wagenmakers, Farrell, & Ratcliff, 2004, 2005). Al-\nthough the existence of 1/f noise is superficially consistent with chaotic phenomena, it may also stem from purely nonchaotic processes. For example, autocorrelation can produce 1/f-like patterns if the correlations exist at several time lags and those lags span several orders of magnitude (Ward, 2002). Wagenmakers argued that 1/f noise need not imply chaos and that the pattern can be explained through mechanisms like fluctuations in attention or the aggregation of several sources of short-term serial dependence. For the purposes of the current research, it is not especially important whether 1/f-like patterns stem from nonlinear, chaotic processes (long-range dependencies) or simpler, short-range dependencies. The point of this research is simply to test whether such 1/f patterning characterizes data from implicit measures in social cognition and to test the degree to which those patterns vary as a function of task-relevant effort.\n1/f Noise and Task Difficulty\nThe various possible sources of 1/f noise (e.g., chaotic, self-organizing processes in the brain or the cumulative input of various short-term dependencies) raise the possibility that 1/f noise may be sensitive to more familiar processes like attention and cognitive effort. It is notable that 1/f noise seems to depend on the nature of the task that participants are asked to perform. In simple cognitive tasks (e.g., detecting a right-to-left gradient), a robust 1/f pattern is usually obtained. But in more difficult paradigms (e.g., with more response options, when a simple task is complicated by high memory load), the signature slope of 1/f noise weakens (Clayton & Frey, 1997; Ward & Richard, 2001, as cited in Ward, 2002). Clayton and Frey asked participants to perform one of three tasks. The easiest involved pressing one button if the stimulus on a given trial was an X and another button if the stimulus was an O. More difficult tasks\nFigure 2. Power spectral density (PSD) graphs for latency data for Participant A, who reported minimal effort to avoid bias (left panel); for Participant A, again, after reshuffling the data to destroy the temporal sequence (center panel); and for Participant B who reported high effort to avoid bias (right panel), Study 1. Black data points represent log frequencies below 0, which were used to calculate the 1/f slope; gray points represent high-frequency waves, which were excluded from the 1/f analysis.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\ninvolved indicating whether the stimulus on the current trial was identical to the stimulus on the previous trial (a one-back task) or\u2014in the most difficult condition\u2014indicating whether the current stimulus matched the stimulus two trials earlier (a two-back task). 1/f noise was clearly evident in the easiest condition, but on the more difficult tasks, the negative relationship between power and frequency flattened dramatically. A task\u2019s difficulty, in other words, moderated the emission of 1/f noise. PSDs for simple tasks reveal more negative, steeper, pinker slopes, whereas PSDs for complex tasks produce more positive, flatter, whiter slopes.\nWhereas extant work has examined variation in 1/f noise as a function of the nature of the task a participant performs, the current research explores a different question. In this article, I test the possibility that even when participants perform an identical task, differences in the way they approach that task will affect the expression of 1/f noise. In tasks related to prejudice and stereotyping, there is reason to expect that some individuals will exert more effort than others. Some participants express strong motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior for a variety of reasons, and this motivation significantly alters their performance on both explicit questionnaire measures and implicit measures of racial bias (Devine, Plant, Amodio, Harmon-Jones, & Vance, 2002; Dunton & Fazio, 1997; Plant & Devine, 1998). More recently, Glaser and Knowles (in press) have measured implicit motivation to control prejudice. Someone who is high in this motivation should strive to appear\u2014or even to be\u2014egalitarian. Someone who is low in this motivation typically worries less about the potentially racist implications of his or her behavior.\nIn the current studies, I hypothesized that a participant\u2019s effort on a given task will affect the way they approach implicit measures of racial bias, even if those measures were designed to be impervious to strategic control (Fazio et al., 1995). Highly motivated participants should attempt to control their behavior (Monteith, 1993; Richeson & Trawalter, 2005), and their desire to avoid bias should prompt increased cognitive effort. In line with the effects reported by Clayton and Frey (1997) and Ward and Richard (2001, as cited in Ward, 2002), it was predicted that effort would reduce the prevalence of 1/f noise. If this hypothesis is correct, high effort should be associated with more positive PSD slopes, and low effort should be associated with more negative slopes.\nThis hypothesis was tested in two studies. In Study 1, participants performed a video game task in which they made shoot/don\u2019t-shoot decisions for a series of armed and unarmed targets who were either White or Black (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002). This task has been used to measure racial bias. Participants subsequently reported (a) the extent to which they had tried to avoid showing bias and (b) the perceived difficulty of the task. In Study 2, a different task was used to measure racial bias, and participants\u2019 effort was experimentally manipulated. Participants performed the computer task after receiving explicit instructions either to use racial stereotypes or to avoid using stereotypes or in the absence of any specific instructions (the control condition). In both studies, participants who exerted greater effort, either on their own or because they were instructed to do so, were expected to demonstrate reductions in 1/f noise.\nStudy 1"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Twenty-four White undergraduates participated in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. During the experimental session, each participant performed a shoot/don\u2019t-shoot video game task, which presented Black and White targets who were either armed or unarmed. The goal of this task was to shoot all armed targets but to indicate don\u2019t shoot for all unarmed targets. Participants also completed a modified version of a Stroop (1935) task, described below, which was included to allow the examination of discriminant validity. This second task helps determine whether results on the video game are specific to that measure or, instead, emerge in any reaction-time task. The results reported by Clayton and Frey (1997) suggest that more challenging tasks reduce 1/f noise, but it is not clear what drives this effect. Task-relevant effort and perceived task difficulty might both be associated with reductions in 1/f noise in the video game. On completion of both tasks, participants therefore reported the degree to which they tried to avoid biased behavior in the video game task (rated effort) and the degree to which the task was perceived as difficult (rated difficulty). The study followed a 2 (target race: Black vs. White) 2 (object type: gun vs. nongun) within-participants design, with rated effort and rated difficulty measured continuously as betweenparticipants factors."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "Video game. This study used a simple video game task (for details, see Correll et al., 2002). As implemented in Study 1, the task consisted of 200 trials in which participants were asked to respond to an image of a young man (i.e., a target). One hundred trials presented a Black target; 100 trials presented a White target. Within each race, half of the targets held pistols and half held innocuous objects (e.g., cell phones or wallets). Fifty targets, then, appeared in each of the four cells defined by the 2 2 repeatedmeasures design: unarmed White, unarmed Black, armed White, armed Black. Participants were instructed to press a button labeled shoot if the target was armed but to press a separate button labeled don\u2019t shoot for any unarmed targets. This task typically imposes a response window of 850 ms, but to avoid missing data (which is problematic for Fourier analysis), this response deadline was eliminated in the present study. A 500-ms intertrial interval preceded each trial. A 16-trial practice round preceded the test phase.\nStroop task. The modified Stroop task involved a series of trials on which a fixation cross (500 ms) appeared on the computer screen, followed by a simple letter string (xxxx) in one of four colors: red, green, blue, or yellow. Participants were asked to categorize the color of the typeface by pressing one of four color-designated keys. The task began with a 40-trial block of practice trials after which participants were asked to contact the experimenter if they had any questions. After the experimenter addressed any questions, participants pressed the space bar to resume the task, which started with 10 buffer trials prior to a 200-trial test block.

They were then thanked and debriefed."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Mean-Level Effects", "text": "Reaction times for correct trials on the video game task were log transformed (data are reported in the original metric for ease of comprehension). Log-transformed latencies were then averaged separately for each of the four target types: unarmed White, unarmed Black, armed White, armed Black. Similarly, error rates were calculated for each trial type. These averages were submitted to separate Target Race Object Type repeated-measures analyses. In this paradigm, participants typically respond more slowly and with a greater number of errors to targets that violate cultural stereotypes (unarmed Blacks and armed Whites) and more quickly and with fewer errors to targets that conform to those stereotypes (armed Blacks and unarmed Whites). In line with prior work, latencies from Study 1 revealed a pattern of bias, manifested as a significant interaction between target race and object type, F(1, 23) 13.91, p .002. Participants shot armed Black targets (M 627 ms) more quickly than they shot armed Whites (M 648 ms), F(1, 23) 5.38, p .03, and they were faster to choose the don\u2019t shoot response when an unarmed target was White (M 684 ms) rather than Black (M 705 ms), F(1, 23) 14.06, p .002. For each participant, an index of bias was calculated, reflecting the magnitude of the within-subject interaction (i.e., bias [armed White\u2013armed Black] [unarmed Black\u2013unarmed White]).\nIn an analysis of error rates, the Target Race Object Type interaction was similar in direction but did not approach significance, F(1, 23) 0.99, p .34. This is likely a consequence of the extended time window, which tends to reduce error rates (see Correll et al., 2002).\nA regression was performed for each participant to analyze 1/f noise, modeling the log-transformed latency on a given trial as a function of the target type (armed Black, armed White, unarmed Black, unarmed White), accuracy (correct response vs. incorrect response), and trial number. These regressions were designed to remove known sources of variability from the reaction times. Trial number was included to account for increases in speed over the course of the task\u2014a nonstationarity that can disrupt the Fourier analysis. PSD was calculated for each participant using the Statistical Analysis Software SPECTRA procedure with a Tukey\u2013\nHanning window (see Appendix for example syntax). With 200 trials, the FFT decomposed each trial series into 100 component waves. The analysis thus provides estimates of the power and frequency of 100 waves for each participant. The lowest estimable frequency describes a wave with a single cycle over the course of the task (f 2 radians/200 trials .031 radians/trial). The highest estimable frequency (the Nyquist frequency) is half the sampling rate, referring to a wave that cycles once every 2 trials (f 2 radians/2 trials 3.142 radians/trial).\nA visual inspection of the video game PSDs revealed a generally flat slope at high frequencies. This pattern, suggestive of white noise, conforms to Gilden\u2019s dual-component model (2001; Gilden et al., 1995), which argues that 1/f patterns emerge only at lower frequencies. It is interesting that at lower frequencies, participants seemed to vary dramatically. Some showed a relatively steep slope; others showed a fairly flat slope (see Figure 2, left and right panels, respectively).\nA second within-subject regression was performed to quantify the power\u2013frequency relationship for each participant. The goal was to estimate the relationship at low frequencies, but this effort is complicated by the general prevalence of white noise at high frequencies (Gilden, 2001). In essence, the power\u2013frequency relationship is not a straight line; it has a kind of elbow. Clayton and Frey (1997) addressed this nonlinear relationship by excluding high-frequency data and estimating 1/f noise as the linear relationship for the component waves below the elbow. Accordingly, the linear relationship between power and frequency was estimated for log frequencies below zero. As discussed above, if the residual latencies contain nothing but random error, the average slope estimated by this regression should be flat (it should hover around zero). Such a slope would indicate white noise. By contrast, 1/f noise would produce a negative slope and a significant deviation from zero. Across participants, the average linear slope was, indeed, significantly negative, mean slope 0.18, t(23) 2.21, p .04, suggesting that these residuals are not entirely random. This test provides the first evidence of 1/f phenomena in social\u2013 cognitive latency measures."}, {"heading": "Correlational Analyses", "text": "My primary goal in Study 1 was to examine the relationship between a participant\u2019s PSD slope in the video game and (a) efforts to avoid bias and/or (b) the perceived difficulty of the task. Prior literature offers no real basis for an a priori prediction about the distinction between rated effort and rated difficulty in this study. Participants low in rated effort and participants low in rated difficulty might both be expected to exhibit a more steeply negative 1/f slope, whereas those reporting high effort and those reporting high difficulty should produce a more positive, flatter slope. Rated effort and rated difficulty were, somewhat surprisingly, unrelated, r(22) .24, p .24. They are therefore treated separately below. The relationship between rated effort and 1/f noise was tested by regressing participants\u2019 slopes (derived from the PSD analyses) on their explicit ratings of effort. The relationship was significant and positive, F(1, 22) 6.33, p .02 (see Figure 3 and Table 1). This relationship remains significant when controlling for task difficulty, F(1, 21) 5.24, p .04.

Their simple linear slopes were negative and significantly different from zero, mean slope 0.39, t(22) 3.51, p .002. Participants reporting greater effort (1 standard deviation above the mean) showed less negative (more positive) slopes, which did not differ significantly from zero, mean slope 0.02, t(22) 0.16, p .88. This nonsignificant slope (white noise is, in essence, a null effect) is not especially important in its own right. The critical point of this analysis is that there is a significant relationship between the questionnaire measure (self-reported effort to avoid bias) and the expression of 1/f noise in this task. Higher effort is associated with increasingly flat (relatively white) PSD slopes.\nA similar regression offered no evidence that rated difficulty was related to 1/f noise, F(1, 22) 0.91, p .35. Although these data show no relationship, this study obviously does not provide a conclusive test of the relationship between perceived difficulty and 1/f noise. It seems plausible that social desirability concerns affected participants\u2019 willingness to report that a task (one with clear implications for racial bias) was difficult for them. Because the questionnaire followed both the video game and the Stroop task, it is also certainly possible that participants understood the question as referring to the entire study (both tasks) rather than just the video game (see below).\nIt was predicted that the that residual latencies in Study 1\u2019s shoot/don\u2019t-shoot task would show evidence of nonrandom trialto-trial variation consistent with 1/f noise. Further, the magnitude\nof this noise was expected to covary with participants\u2019 orientation to the computer task. The PSD analyses showed clear evidence of 1/f noise, on average, and also revealed the anticipated relationship between 1/f noise and participants\u2019 self-reported attempts to avoid bias during the course of the game. Participants who made little effort showed a relatively steep PSD slope. Participants who put forth greater effort showed a flatter slope.\nThe significance of these results is manifold. First, at the simplest level, they show that residual variance in a participant\u2019s response times during a computer-based measure of bias (variance that is usually treated as meaningless error) is not completely random. These findings add to the growing body of work on 1/f noise by demonstrating the patterns in socially oriented responsetime tasks. In fact, to my knowledge, this is the first demonstration of 1/f noise in implicit measures of stereotyping and, indeed, the first demonstration in any kind of social psychological research. Second, whereas Clayton and Frey (1997) showed that 1/f noise varies as a function of participants\u2019 task, the current work shows that even when participants perform the identical task, the magnitude of 1/f noise depends on individual differences in effort. It is critical to note that in the current work, all participants performed exactly the same task. Variability in 1/f noise was due entirely to differences in participants\u2019 orientation to that task. This study therefore extends understanding of the variables that can moderate 1/f noise but also holds out promise that spectral analysis can shed light on phenomena important to social psychology.\nFigure 3.

First, one might imagine that the relationship between rated effort and 1/f noise emerges simply because high-effort participants respond more slowly (or more quickly) than do low-effort participants. To address this question, I regressed PSD slopes simultaneously on both rated effort and average latencies from the video game. In this analysis, mean latencies were marginally related to slope estimates, F(1, 21) 3.06, p .10, such that longer latencies were associated with flatter slopes. Critically, however, the relationship between effort and PSD slope remained significant when controlling for average reaction time, F(1, 21) 6.15, p .03. Slower responding cannot account for these effects.\nSecond, as shown in Figure 2, randomly sorting Participant A\u2019s residuals prior to the Fourier analysis eliminated the pattern of 1/f noise. All participants\u2019 residuals were randomly sorted to provide a slightly more rigorous test of the importance of serial order. Next, both the average PSD slope in the video game task (across all participants in the sample) as well as the correlation between those individual slopes and rated effort were computed. This process was repeated 25 times, yielding 25 estimates of the average slope and 25 estimates of the correlation between slope and effort. When the temporal order of the trials was disrupted, the average participants\u2019 PSD slope across these 25 replications hovered around zero, mean slope 0.009, SD 0.053, t(24) 0.88, p .39. Similarly, the average correlation between the slope (once order had been disrupted) and rated effort did not differ from zero, mean correlation 0.010, SD 0.262, t(24) 0.19, p .86. These analyses suggest that the phenomenon in question is highly dependent on the temporal order of trials. The primary results of this study cannot be explained as an artifact of the distributions of the latencies. They are not due to changes (as a function of effort) in the mean, standard deviation, skewness, or kurtosis of the latency data.\nThird, in addition to the video game task, participants in this study completed a modified version of the Stroop (1935) task. The log-transformed latency data from the Stroop task were submitted to a spectral analysis, similar to the video game analysis above, and a PSD slope was calculated. On average, this slope was steeply negative, mean slope 0.47, t(23) 6.92, p .0001, suggesting a strong pattern of 1/f noise. This task is useful in the context of this study because it provides a test of the specificity of the relationship between 1/f noise and rated effort, reported above. Does this correlation reflect a general orientation on the part of the participants or rather\u2014as hypothesized\u2014a task-specific orientation to a particular measure of racial bias? It is possible, for example, that individual differences in 1/f noise, demonstrated in the video game task, reflect stable differences between participants. Those who show less 1/f noise on one task may show less 1/f noise on any task. Conceivably, of course, such a reduction could still be driven by effort, such that some participants exert more effort on any task they perform. In either case, if the patterns reported above reflect a general orientation to response-latency tasks, one might expect (a) rated effort on the video game to predict 1/f noise in the Stroop task and (b) 1/f noise in the video game task to correlate with 1/f noise in the Stroop task. The general-orientation account was tested by examining correlations\nof PSD slopes from the Stroop task with rated effort and rated difficulty (measures by which participants were supposed to assess the video game task), PSD slopes from the video game task, and bias in the video game task (see Table 1). Of critical importance, rated effort to avoid racial bias did not predict the Stroop PSD, nor were the PSD slopes from the video game related to those from the Stroop task. Further, when PSD slopes from the video game were regressed on rated effort while controlling for slopes in the Stroop task, the critical relationship between rated effort and 1/f noise in the video game task remained significant, F(1, 21) 5.95, p .03.\nSurprisingly, however, Stroop PSD slopes were marginally correlated with rated difficulty, r(22) .38, p .07. This unexpected relationship raises an interesting, although admittedly post hoc, possibility. When completing the difficulty ratings, participants were asked to rate only the difficulty of the video game task. It may be that the instructions were not sufficiently clear and that participants inappropriately rated the overall difficulty of the session or, perhaps, the difficulty associated specifically with the Stroop task. This tendency may have been exacerbated because the initial question, on which participants rated their effort, focused on attempts to avoid racial bias, which necessarily referred exclusively to the racially relevant video game. The question would make no sense for the Stroop. Participants may then have expected that the other question (on which participants rated task difficulty) applied to the other task (the Stroop; e.g., Heibeck & Markman, 1987; Waxman & Klibanoff, 2000).\nIn any event, the primary findings of Study 1 provide support for a relationship between task-relevant effort and 1/f noise. Selfreported effort to avoid bias uniquely predicted reductions in 1/f noise in a task that was relevant to racial bias (the shoot/don\u2019tshoot video game). This measure had no impact on 1/f noise in a race-neutral Stroop task. Study 1, then, provides a correlational demonstration of the relationship between 1/f noise and effort on a single measure of racial bias. Study 2 was conducted to replicate and extend these findings by using an experimental manipulation to test the causal relationship between effort and 1/f noise.\nStudy 2\nIn Study 1, effort was measured using a questionnaire. The correlation between participants\u2019 self-reported effort and the PSD patterns derived from their response times suggests that effort can moderate 1/f noise. Study 2 sought to bolster this claim by experimentally manipulating participants\u2019 effort on a separate computerbased measure of racial bias.\nThis research essentially strives to recreate a study conducted by Payne and his colleagues (Payne et al., 2002), who asked participants to either accentuate or avoid the use of racial cues in a weapon-identification paradigm. Like the shoot/don\u2019t-shoot task in Study 1, this task assesses racial bias in reactions to guns and harmless objects. On a series of trials, participants were primed with either a Black face or a White face. They were then asked to identify a target image as either a gun or a tool. In their study, Payne and his colleagues varied the instructions they gave to participants. Participants in the control condition were simply asked to perform the task to the best of their ability. A second group was asked to perform the task but was specifically instructed to avoid the use of race. They were not to allow the race of the\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nprime to influence their judgments. A third group was explicitly asked to make use of race during the performance of the task. They were asked to behave like racial profilers. Payne found greater bias in both experimental conditions. This finding makes perfect sense for the participants who were instructed to act like profilers. They were simply doing what they were told. But, ironically, the participants who were asked to avoid using the racial cues showed increases in bias. Relative to controls, they showed stronger associations between Blacks and guns. The authors suggested that because the instructions called attention to the race of the prime, participants in the experimental conditions were more susceptible to race-based associations (whether that influence was consistent or inconsistent with their instructions).\nIn addition to demonstrating an interesting and counterintuitive effect, Payne et al.\u2019s (2002) study has clear implications for task-relevant effort. Participants in the control condition approached the task without any experimentally imposed demands. By contrast, participants in both the avoid-race and use-race conditions were asked to consciously control or modulate their performance. Whether or not their efforts were ultimately successful, these participants approached the task with additional experimentally imposed demands. If 1/f noise is sensitive to increased effort, spectral analysis should reveal differences between the relatively minimal effort required of the control condition and the greater effort required of the experimental conditions."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Seventy-one undergraduates participated in return for course credit. All participants performed a simple task in which they were asked to classify objects that appeared on a computer screen as either guns or tools. Prior to the presentation of the target object, however, participants were primed with either a Black or a White face (Payne, 2001). Although all participants performed the same task, individuals were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, each imposing a different task-relevant goal. Participants in the control condition were given no specific instructions; participants in the avoid-race condition were instructed not to use racial information when making their decisions; participants in the userace condition were instructed to let racial cues guide their behavior during the task. This study followed a 3 (instructions: control vs. avoid race vs. use race) 2 (prime race: Black vs. White) 2 (object type: gun vs. tool) mixed-model design, with repeated measures on the last two factors."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "The weapon-identification task was based on the paradigm developed by Payne (2001, Study 1). The task consisted of a 25-trial practice phase followed by a test phase of 200 trials. Each trial began with the presentation of a prime face (200 ms). Primes consisted of black-and-white photographs (faces only) of five Black men and five White men. Immediately after the prime, a target object appeared (200 ms). Target stimuli consisted of blackand-white photographs of 5 guns and 5 power tools (drills, screwdrivers, etc). After 200 ms, the target image was replaced with a mask (a random pattern of black and white rectangles), which\nremained on screen until the participant responded. A 1,000-ms intertrial interval preceded the onset of the next prime.\nIn the original study, Payne and his colleagues (2002) forced participants to respond within 700\u20131,200 ms after the onset of the object image. They also presented the target object for only 100 ms (rather than 200 ms, as in the present research). Payne et al.\u2019s parameters were presumably motivated by their interest in process dissociation procedure estimates of control and automatic bias, which are derived from patterns of errors (see also Payne, 2001, Study 2). More restrictive time limits tend to increase the likelihood of errors in these tasks. By contrast, the current research focuses on variance in reaction times, and forcing participants to respond within a given time window carries with it the possibility that participants will respond too slowly on some trials, resulting in missing data, which (as noted above) are problematic for the analysis. The test phase of Study 2 therefore imposed no response deadline. To encourage participants to respond quickly, the practice phase imposed a deadline of 1,000 ms. Participants who responded too slowly during the initial 25 trials received a message to that effect. Fewer than 1% of responses exceeded 1,000 ms during the test phase."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "A White male experimenter introduced the study as an investigation of vigilance.

These values were averaged for each of the four trial types (Black\u2013gun, White\u2013gun, Black\u2013 tool, White\u2013tool). Similarly, error rates were calculated for each trial type. These averages were submitted to separate Prime Race Object Type repeated-measures analyses, which revealed an interaction (i.e., bias) in participants\u2019 errors, F(1, 70) 10.05, p .003, and a nonsignificant interaction (similar in direction to the error effects) in their latencies, F(1, 70) 1.23, p .30. The error analysis suggests that participants were more likely to classify a tool as a weapon after a Black face (M 2.66) than after a White face (M 2.44) but more likely to identify a gun as a tool after a White face (M 2.66) than after a Black face (M 1.87).

The second (control 0, avoid race 1, use race 1) assessed differences between the avoid-race and use-race conditions.\nStudy 2\u2019s primary question involves the slopes derived from the PSD estimates. As task-relevant effort increases, participants were expected to exhibit flatter, more positive slopes. It was therefore predicted that participants in the use-race and avoid-race conditions (conditions that imposed additional task demands) would show more positive (less negative) PSD slopes. As predicted, analysis revealed a significant difference between the control condition and the average of the two experimental conditions in terms of the magnitude of the PSD slopes, F(1, 68) 5.52, p .02 (see Table 2 and Figure 4). Pairwise comparisons showed that participants in both the avoid-race condition and the use-race condition exhibited more positive slopes (suggesting greater effort) than did participants in the control condition, Fs(1, 68) 5.24, 3.17, ps .03, .08, respectively, although the latter comparison was only marginally significant. Participants in the avoid-race condition did not differ from those in the use-race condition, F(1, 68) 0.19, p .66. When participants\u2019 average latency was included as a covariate, F(1, 67) 3.13, p .09, these results did not change: Control participants showed steeper slopes than did experimental participants, F(1, 67) 5.90, p .02, and participants told to avoid race did not differ from those told to use race, F(1, 67) 0.51, p .70. This analysis suggests that the condition differences in 1/f noise are not a simple by-product of slower or faster responses in general.\nAnalysis of bias in the errors revealed no effects of condition, Fs(68) 1.44, ps .23. (Signal detection and process dissociation procedure analyses yield similar results.) Although these data replicate those of Payne et al. (2002) on a mean level, the relatively\nlong time window in the current study may have reduced the reliability of estimates based on error rates and attenuated the likelihood of detecting condition differences (see Table 2).\nAnalysis of bias in reaction times yielded a marginal effect, such that participants instructed to either avoid or use racial cues during the weapon-identification task showed greater bias than did participants in the control condition, F(1, 68) 2.96, p .09. This effect is consistent with that found by Payne et al. (2002), who showed that either type of instruction induced greater bias. Participants instructed to use race did not differ from those instructed to avoid using race, F(1, 68) 0.16, p .70.\nAs in Study 1, these results show that participants who attempt to modulate their behavior on a measure of implicit racial attitudes show reductions in 1/f noise relative to participants who approach the task in a more naive fashion. It is important to note that, unlike Study 1, the current study used an experimental manipulation of effort by providing participants with randomly assigned instructions. Accordingly, Study 2 provides evidence that effort causally affects the emission of 1/f noise.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn two studies, I examined residual latencies from computerbased measures of racial bias.

Consistent with work in cognitive psychology, error variance was characterized by 1/f noise\u2014a complex pattern of serial dependency that can be assessed through spectral analysis (Gilden, 2001). Research has shown that this phenomenon is more pronounced when tasks are easy (rather than difficult), and in the absence (rather than in the presence) of memory load (Clayton & Frey, 1997). Whereas in previous work, the nature of the materials has been manipulated through the use of fundamentally different computer tasks, in the current research, the task was held constant across all participants in each study. These studies investigated variability only in participants\u2019 effort or orientation to a given task. Specifically, in these studies, I examined the impact of dispositional and experimentally induced efforts to avoid biased behavior. The hypothesis, building on the work of Clayton and Frey, suggested that effort would decrease 1/f noise in tasks related to racial bias.\nIn Study 1, participants performed a shoot/don\u2019t-shoot task with Black and White targets. On average, the data showed clear evidence of 1/f noise (a negative PSD slope). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect was attenuated (yielding PSD slopes closer to zero) for participants who reported greater effort. By contrast, the 1/f pattern was more pronounced among participants who reported that they did not try to avoid bias during the task. Study 2 experimentally manipulated participants\u2019 effort to control their behavior in a weapon-identification task (a measure of racial bias; Payne, 2001). Those who were given additional task demands\u2014 explicit instructions to either use or avoid the use of racial cues\u2014 showed reduced 1/f noise compared with participants in the control condition who were given no additional demands. Together, these studies suggest that 1/f noise characterizes response times in social\u2013cognitive measures of stereotyping and prejudice and (importantly) that these patterns are sensitive to a participant\u2019s taskrelevant effort.\nThese data have implications for the continuing debate about the meaning and utility of implicit measures. Like other measures before them, measures of implicit or automatic attitudes have gained prominence in social psychology by virtue of their purported ability to assess participants\u2019 views in ways that are relatively insensitive to concerns over social desirability. Clearly, computer-based implicit measures can be differentiated from simple questionnaire measures, and they seem to offer unique predictive power (Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002; McConnell & Leibold, 2001). But there is still a lack of clarity regarding what, exactly, they measure and how susceptible they truly are to demand (e.g., Karpinski & Hilton, 2001). A number of studies (Fiedler & Bluemke, 2005; Glaser & Knowles, in press; Hausmann & Ryan, 2004) have recently shown that a participant\u2019s motivation to behave in an unbiased fashion (or at least to present him- or herself as unbiased) can impact measures like the IAT. The current studies are similarly predicated on the idea that individuals approach even implicit measures with an awareness of the purpose of the research and with an intention to bring their performance into line with their goals and standards (Monteith, 1993). Of course, intention does not, in and of itself, mean that participants will be successful in their efforts. Indeed, their efforts may even backfire (Study 2; Payne et al., 2002). But it does imply that individual and situational differences may affect participants\u2019 orientation to implicit measures in fundamental ways with consequences that can be hard to predict."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "The current studies constitute the first known application of 1/f analysis to social psychological research in general and to the domain of stereotyping and prejudice in particular. This work has accordingly focused on a single question: Does effort affect 1/f noise on measures of racial bias? In the current studies, I examined this question using two operationalizations of effort and two measures of bias. Although some researchers may find these effects intriguing, it is important to note a few key limitations.\nSensitivity Versus Specificity\nFirst, the current research deals exclusively with the issue of sensitivity. Each of the studies reported here shows that 1/f noise depends on or is sensitive to task-relevant effort. At present, there is no evidence concerning the specificity of the relationship between effort and 1/f noise. Treating 1/f noise as a proxy for effort is therefore logically problematic (Cacioppo & Tassinary, 1990). To the extent that other variables increase or decrease the magnitude of the PSD slope, variation in 1/f noise may emerge independent of effort. Future research on other causal factors will likely improve understanding of 1/f noise and ultimately increase the utility of this approach."}, {"heading": "Mechanism", "text": "A second issue, related to the first, is that research has not yet specified the psychological processes through which effort affects 1/f noise. Previous work has suggested that task difficulty affects 1/f noise (Clayton & Frey, 1997; Ward & Richard, 2001, as cited in Ward, 2002), and the fact that effort reduces 1/f noise in these studies certainly seems consistent with the putative role of effort and/or the possibility that effort imposes additional demands. But effort is likely to induce a number of more specific psychological states, which may also give rise to 1/f noise. For example, effort may produce anxiety if participants worry about revealing some undesirable bias. It may also increase attention to the task at hand or even create a dual-task situation such that participants attempt to simultaneously (a) perform the basic task (e.g., accurately differentiate guns from tools) and (b) modulate the influence of race on their responses. The mediating role (or roles) of anxiety, attention, and difficulty must be tested."}, {"heading": "Baby or Bathwater?", "text": "The measures of 1/f noise used in the current studies are derived from nothing more than latency data\u2014the kind of data that are routinely collected in thousands of studies in hundreds of laboratories every year. These data not only yield estimates of the principal construct under investigation (e.g., racial bias in the decision to shoot), they also seem to offer hints about the participants\u2019 orientation to the task. This information, embedded in the residuals of the latencies, is typically ignored. To the extent that a researcher\u2019s question does not concern the participants\u2019 effort, researchers may lose little by disregarding patterns of trial-to-trial variability. In some cases, however, research may profit tremendously by virtue of this inconspicuous and generally untapped measure. That is, researchers may be able to harvest additional information from nothing more than the data they have already collected.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nAs understanding of this phenomenon improves (e.g., as researchers learn about the specificity of 1/f noise), spectral analysis may provide a tool for the researcher who hopes to mine data sets (new and old) to examine questions of orientation and effort. Reciprocally, existing data sets may improve understanding of 1/f noise by allowing for the identification of variables that moderate and mediate the types of effects reported here. These possibilities are particularly interesting in light of recent attempts to measure implicit efforts to control prejudice (Glaser & Knowles, in press). There has been some speculation that measures of effort to control prejudice may, themselves, be subject to social desirability concerns. In an individualistic society like the United States, for example, there may be pressure to endorse statements such as \u201cI always express my thoughts and feelings, regardless of how controversial they might be\u201d (Dunton & Fazio, 1997). With additional testing, spectral analysis may allow researchers to assess efforts to avoid prejudice in an almost completely covert and demand-free fashion.\nIt may be useful to speculate, briefly, about the IAT, which has been adopted as the implicit measure of choice in many laboratories. There is some reason to think that 1/f noise will be difficult or impossible to evaluate in the context of this popular measure. The IAT consists of two separate judgment tasks (e.g., classifying a face as Black or White, classifying a word as good or bad), which are mapped onto a single pair of response options. On one block of trials, a participant might be asked to press Button 1 if a face is Black or if a word is bad but to press Button 2 if a face is White or a word is good. If the participant holds a negative view of Blacks (or a positive view of Whites), these pairings are congruent. On another block, the participant would be asked to reorient one of the judgments, now pressing Button 1 if a face is White or if a word is bad but pressing Button 2 if a face is Black or a word is good. If this orientation is inconsistent with his or her views, the participant should experience greater difficulty. From the perspective of a spectral analysis, the IAT may prove problematic because the two blocks of trials involve vastly different degrees of effort, which should yield different patterns of 1/f noise. In fact, a highly prejudiced participant is expected to respond quickly, accurately, and easily on the congruent block (which may yield steep PSD slopes) but slowly, inaccurately, and with great difficulty on the incongruent block (which may yield flatter slopes). Analyzing the differences in slope between the blocks may address this problem, but the FFT procedure requires many trials to estimate low-frequency waves. Unless the IATs include sufficient trials in each block, low-frequency data (which are diagnostic of 1/f noise) may not be available.\nFor social psychology, 1/f noise and other dynamic approaches (e.g., Markov analyses) seem to hold tremendous promise. 1/f noise itself is based on the idea that events at time t may have implications for time t 1 (or t 100). That is, 1/f noise can reflect a dynamic system, where events are not isolated or disconnected but intertwined. Social psychological phenomena that unfold over time (e.g., conversations between individuals, behavioral mimicry, attraction, intergroup competition) reflect similarly complex influences. Given concern with these processes, analytical techniques that can address dynamic relationships seem like a natural fit for the discipline (Vallacher, Read, & Nowak, 2002)."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "1/f noise is striking because it violates expectations. A visual inspection of residual latencies in a sequential priming task yields little in the way of an obvious pattern. The data look random. It is only through spectral analysis that the underlying pattern becomes clear. In the current studies, I explore the utility of 1/f noise in the study of racial bias, but the prevalence of computer-based measures in the discipline of psychology raises the possibility that social psychologists can readily use spectral analyses to explore data on a wide variety of topics (e.g., self-esteem, attitudes, negotiation), gaining a deeper understanding of the processes they study. By so doing, social psychologists may reciprocally provide a unique perspective on the meaning of 1/f noise.\nReferences\nBak, P. (1990). Self-organized criticality. Physica A, 163, 403\u2013409.

Baumeister and Anne L. Zell Florida State University\nAmy J. Kraft Arizona State University\nCharlotte V. O. Witvliet Hope College\nPeople are more forgiving toward transgressors if they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses, as demonstrated in 7 studies. Methods included hypothetical scenarios, actual recalled offenses, individual and group processes, and correlational and experimental designs. Three factors mediated the link between personal capability and forgiveness: seeing the other\u2019s offense as less severe, greater empathic understanding, and perceiving oneself as similar to the transgressor. In terms of predicting forgiveness, it was important that people\u2019s own offenses were similar to the target offense in terms of both severity and type. The personal capability effect was independent of other established predictors of forgiveness and was more pronounced among men than women.\nKeywords: forgiveness, vengefulness, humility, empathy, gender\nForgiveness can be a powerful means to heal emotions and relationships after a transgression (see Worthington, 2005a, for a review), and it may also promote physical health (e.g., Lawler et al., 2003; Witvliet, 2001, 2005; Witvliet & McCullough, 2007; Worthington & Scherer, 2004). In spite of its potential benefits, however, forgiving can be costly in terms of pride and immediate self-interest (Exline & Baumeister, 2000). Forgiveness requires that people forego bitter feelings and desires for vengeance (Enright & Fitzgibbons, 2000), perhaps even replacing them with positive emotions (Worthington, 2005b). The process of forgiving can be a strenuous one, especially in cases of deep hurt.\nPeople are most likely to forgive when certain conditions are met: when offenses are minor (Boon & Sulsky, 1997; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002); when offended parties cultivate empathic feelings toward their offenders (Fincham, Paleari, & Regalia, 2002; McCullough et al., 1998; McCullough, Worthington, & Rachal,\n1997); and when offenses occur within close, committed relationships (Finkel, Rusbult, Kumashiro, & Hannon, 2002; Karremans, Van Lange, Ouwerkerk, & Kluwer, 2003). One means of facilitating these positive perceptions and feelings might be to focus on one\u2019s own potential for a similar misdeed. Our central hypothesis was that people would show greater forgiveness to the extent that they could recall or envision themselves committing similar offenses. This article presents seven studies to test this hypothesis.\nSelf-Enhancement as a Response to Transgression\nWhen faced with violations of social rules, one common response is to make judgments, asking the following: How serious is this offense? Should the offender be punished? Is forgiveness conceivable? Unfortunately, objective and dispassionate appraisals of transgressions may be relatively rare and difficult. Cognitive judgments are often clouded by emotion (Haidt, 2001), and emotion can be intense in the wake of transgression. As described by Goffman (1955), people who offend others push them down in symbolic terms, treating them with disrespect. To combat their feelings of rage and shame, victims typically feel a need to reestablish a position of strength and safety, and they often want to punish wrongdoers as well (Darley & Pittman, 2003; Tripp, Bies, & Aquino, 2002).\nIn cognitive terms, one way to accomplish both goals might be to see oneself as righteous and innocent while viewing the offending party as morally inferior: \u201cI would never do anything so horrible!\u201d Downward comparison, which involves comparing oneself to others who are faring worse, is a recognized method of bolstering the self (Wills, 1981; Wood, Taylor, & Lichtman,\nJulie Juola Exline, Department of Psychology, Case Western Reserve University; Roy F.

Particularly when feeling threatened, people may derogate others to turn them into targets of downward comparison (Gibbons & Gerrard, 1991). By focusing on the contrast between one\u2019s own qualities (or actions) and those of the offending party, the evaluator can enjoy the comforts of self-enhancement while creating a safe sense of moral distance from the offender.\nHow might self-enhancing comparisons affect attitudes toward an offender? One likely consequence is that the offender\u2019s misdeeds will seem to grow in size. When people adopt a victim\u2019s perspective, they often exaggerate the severity of the offense (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Wotman, 1990). Such biases can be so strong that people may be unable to override them even if given strong incentives, such as monetary compensation (Stillwell & Baumeister, 1997). Adopting a victim stance might also promote the demonization of offenders (Ellard, Miller, Baumle, & Olson, 2002), whose acts are viewed as monstrous and inexplicable. People often understand transgressions on the basis of what Baumeister (1997) termed the myth of pure evil, a belief that those who commit serious offenses are rotten to the core\u2014and fundamentally different from good people such as oneself.\nSelf-enhancing strategies may benefit offended parties by helping them to feel safe, strong, and morally good. But if people create a sense of moral distance between themselves and their offenders, how might such a stance affect decisions about forgiveness? If people demonize their offenders and see their actions as being rooted in pure evil, it seems likely that their responses will center on self-protection or retribution rather than forgiveness.\nReflecting on One\u2019s Personal Capability for Similar Offenses\nTo understand how people move from grudge holding to forgiveness, we believe that it is crucial to identify alternatives to the processes of demonization and distancing that commonly occur in response to an offense. One possibility is that people might reflect on their own capability for committing similar offenses\u2014a perception that we term personal capability throughout this article. Our main hypothesis is that personal capability will prove to be a robust predictor of forgiveness. Why? We propose three possible mechanisms."}, {"heading": "Reduced Perceptions of Severity", "text": "If people can see themselves as capable of committing a particular offense, the offense may seem to shrink, becoming less severe. People tend to perceive and recall their own offenses in a mitigated manner, downplaying their severity and consequences (Baumeister, 1997; Baumeister et al., 1990; Stillwell & Baumeister, 1997). With a perspective that says, \u201cIf I\u2019m capable of doing it, it must not be that bad,\u201d victims may be more likely to forgive."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Empathic Understanding", "text": "Victims often see the actions of perpetrators as inexplicable or rooted in sheer malice (Baumeister et al., 1990), a stance that hardly seems conducive to forgiveness. But if people can relate the offense to their own behavior, doing so may facilitate understanding. As victims reflect on their own similar transgressions, they may notice sensible and perhaps justifiable reasons for their behavior. They may, in turn, extend that understanding to the present perpetrators\u2014thereby making the offense seem more forgivable."}, {"heading": "Enhanced Sense of Similarity", "text": "Identifying with an offender, even in a minimal way, should help to break down psychological barriers that people erect to distance themselves. Focusing on themes of common humanity can facilitate forgiveness (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005). Seeing the similarities between oneself and an offender is also likely to be humbling, and humility should work against a self-righteous, judgmental mindset that distances the perpetrator from the victim (Exline, Campbell, et al., 2004; Tangney, 2000, 2002).\nRelevant Findings From Prior Research: Forgiveness and Empathy\nAs described above, we proposed that personal capability would predict forgiveness through several distinct pathways. Two of these pathways\u2014deepened understanding of the other\u2019s offense and a sense of similarity to the offender\u2014involve processes related to empathy. Many studies have revealed positive associations between empathy and forgiveness (e.g., Brown, 2003; Fincham et al., 2002; Konstam, Chernoff, & Deveney, 2001; Macaskill, Maltby, & Day, 2002; McCullough et al., 1997, 1998; Toussaint & Webb, 2005; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002). Treatment models of forgiveness by Enright and Fitzgibbons (2000) and Worthington (1998) also include a focus on one\u2019s own offenses (see also Malcolm, Warwar, & Greenberg, 2005).\nMost of the studies in this area have framed empathy as a disposition (Brown, 2003; Konstam et al., 2001; Macaskill et al., 2002; Toussaint & Webb, 2005) or in emotional terms, tapping feelings of warmth or sympathy (Fincham et al., 2002; McCullough et al., 1997, 1998). Researchers have devoted less attention to the cognitive, perspective-taking aspect of empathy that would take place in relation to a specific offense, and it is this more cognitive aspect of empathy that seems most relevant to personal capability.\nSeveral forgiveness researchers note the lack of attention to cognitive facets of empathy (McCullough et al., 1997; Toussaint & Webb, 2005). Although McCullough et al. (1997) did include a cognitive measure, results from that measure were inconclusive, and subsequent studies focused on emotional empathy (McCullough et al., 1998). Brown (2003) found that dispositional forgiveness correlated positively with the cognitive, perspective-taking facet of empathy. However, the perspective-taking measure used was dispositional rather than situation specific.\nWitvliet, Ludwig, and Vander Laan (2001) compared the effects of an empathic perspective-taking manipulation with conditions involving forgiveness, rumination, and grudge holding. The empathy condition had a cognitive emphasis, asking participants to focus on the humanity of the offender, factors in the offender\u2019s life that may have contributed to the offense, and/or times when the participants themselves had needed to be forgiven. Compared with the rumination and grudge-holding conditions, empathic perspective taking significantly reduced anger, arousal, and negative emotion as well as heart rate, blood pressure, sweat, and brow electromyography. Empathy also increased perceived control, pleasant relaxation, and joy. Yet, in terms of facilitating positive emotion and reducing negative emotion and arousal, the forgiveness manipulation was even more effective than the empathy manipulation.\nThe closest empirical precedent for our work on personal capability comes from several scenario-based experiments. Takaku\n(2001) and Takaku, Weiner, and Ohbuchi (2001) found that perspective taking (asking participants to recall prior offenses of their own) made participants more likely than controls to accept imaginary apologies from hypothetical offenders. Although clearly relevant to our ideas about personal capability, these studies had a circumscribed focus: They emphasized hypothetical situations in which apologies were being offered.\nIn summary, prior research on empathy and forgiveness provided some empirical backing for the hypothesized connection between personal capability and forgiveness. Our aim here was to perform a much more systematic and intensive examination of the proposed connection, including tests of the three proposed mediators, consideration of potential confounds, and use of both interpersonal and intergroup offenses. The use of experimental designs also allowed us to examine several important boundary conditions, which we describe next.\nPossible Pitfalls of Focusing on One\u2019s Own Offenses\nEven if seeing one\u2019s own capability for wrongdoing is associated with forgiveness (in correlational terms), does it follow that prompting people to focus on their own offenses will promote forgiveness? It might, if such self-reflection facilitates the kinds of empathic, humbling, and offense-diminishing processes described earlier. But it also seems possible that being asked to reflect on one\u2019s own misdeeds could backfire. First, a person might recall an offense of a very different type (e.g., an academic cheating situation as opposed to an ethnic slur). Any subsequent comparisons may not facilitate understanding of the target offense because the two situations are so different. Second, because of the prevalence of self-enhancement motives (e.g., Sedikides & Strube, 1997), it seems likely that many people would recall offenses that are less severe than the target offense. Seeing one\u2019s own offense as less severe could lead to a contrast effect, magnifying the other\u2019s offense rather than diminishing it. To facilitate forgiveness, then, it may be important for people to recall offenses that are truly similar to the target in terms of both severity and type. We examined these issues in Studies 5 and 6.\nA second problem is that reflecting on one\u2019s own offenses could bring up self-focused negative emotions. Earlier studies have shown that asking people to recall humbling situations can prompt feelings of shame and weakness. These self-focused negative emotions, in turn, can make people less generous (Exline & Fisher, 2005) and more aggressive (Exline & Zell, 2006). Simply being in a bad mood could make people harsh in their judgments. If people also feel ashamed and defensive regarding their own offenses, the resulting desire to repair their self-images might increase the tendency to derogate others rather than fostering forgiveness. We examined this possibility in Study 5.\nThe Potential for Gender Differences\nWhen we launched this line of research, gender was of peripheral interest to us. We tend to err on the side of not focusing on gender differences unless there is some clear conceptual reason for doing so (see Baumeister, 1988). However, some recent findings persuaded us to take a closer look at gender. For example, several studies examined whether recalling humbling events would affect responses to betrayal in a laboratory game (Exline & Zell, 2006).\nMen were less aggressive in response to the betrayal if they had written about a time when they felt humble (vs. proud or important). Women did not show this pattern. Another recent study found that within married couples, emotional empathy was a stronger predictor of forgiveness by husbands than by wives (Fincham et al., 2002). Likewise, a questionnaire study found that dispositional empathy predicted forgiveness by men but not by women (Toussaint & Webb, 2005).\nGranted, the above findings had only indirect relevance to our work. Our interest was in personal capability, a situation-specific construct with a cognitive emphasis. We were not studying humility, emotional empathy, or dispositional empathy. Nonetheless, the prior findings suggested that gender might moderate the effects of humbling or empathic processing in ways relevant to personal capability. Specifically, they raised the possibility that reflecting on one\u2019s own misdeeds might facilitate forgiveness more among men than among women.\nThe Present Research\nIn the studies presented here, our goal was not only to see whether a link exists between personal capability and forgiveness but also to examine potential mediators (Study 2) and rule out other third-variable explanations (Studies 2 and 6). We wanted to determine whether the pattern was specific to college students (Study 1) and whether it might generalize to severe intergroup offenses (Study 3). We also used experimental designs (Studies 4\u20137) to examine the effects of having people focus on their offenses, and we paid particular attention to the possibility of gender differences in those studies.\nStudy 1: Comparing Forgiveness and Unforgiveness in Two Samples\nWe started with a simple design to test whether forgiven offenses, relative to unforgiven offenses, would be associated with a higher sense of personal capability. Because generalizability concerns were particularly important to us in this initial study, we used two samples to test our hypothesis: an undergraduate sample and a more diverse Internet-based sample.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Sample 1: Undergraduates.

Instead, participants drew on their own ideas about what forgiveness entailed.

This prediction was strongly supported in both the undergraduate sample (forgiveness case, M 3.0, SD 1.6; unforgiveness case, M 1.8, SD 1.8), t(140) 6.61, p .01, 2 .24, and the Internet sample (forgiveness case, M 2.4, SD 1.7; unforgiveness case, M 1.5, SD 1.2), t(100) 4.59, p .01, 2 .17. No significant interactions were found on the basis of age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, or student versus nonstudent status.\nWe also examined correlations between forgiveness and personal capability within each condition. In both samples, personal capability correlated positively with forgiveness in the unforgiveness case\u2014undergraduate, r(142) .23, p .01, and Internet, r(103) .22, p .05\u2014 but not in the forgiveness case\u2014 undergraduate, r(147) .10, ns, and Internet, r(110) .07, ns. The nonsignificant associations in the forgiveness case may have been partly due to ceiling effects. It is also possible that cultivating a sense of personal capability is particularly relevant early in the\nforgiveness process, when the natural tendency is often to demonize one\u2019s offender.\nStudy 1 offered preliminary evidence for our hypothesis: Relative to cases of unforgiveness, cases of forgiveness involve acts that people see themselves more capable of committing. This association applied to both students and nonstudents. Study 1 also raised the possibility that personal capability predicts forgiveness mainly in cases in which people still harbor considerable anger toward their offenders.\nStudy 2: A Closer Look at the Capability\u2013Forgiveness Link\nStudy 1 demonstrated a link between personal capability and forgiveness. Next, we wanted to follow the strategy of a previous article on narcissistic entitlement and forgiveness (Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004). Specifically, we hypothesized that personal capability would still have unique predictive power when other robust predictors of forgiveness were controlled. First, we examined situational predictors of forgiveness that were discussed in the introduction: relationship commitment and apology. We also examined several individual-difference factors that have been linked with forgiveness in prior research.\nEarlier studies have shown that forgiveness levels correlate with the Big Five factors of personality, particularly low Neuroticism and high Agreeableness (e.g., Brown, 2003; McCullough & Hoyt, 2002). Some other forgiveness predictors include high dispositional forgiveness (e.g., Berry, Worthington, O\u2019Connor, Parrott, & Wade, 2005), high self-esteem (e.g., Miller, 2003), low narcissism and entitlement (e.g., Brown, 2004; Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004), high religiosity (see Worthington, 2005a, for a review), and high social desirability (e.g., Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004).\nWe reasoned that several of these factors might correlate with personal capability as well. For example, a willingness to focus on one\u2019s flaws would seem unlikely in narcissistic people or those with a high sense of entitlement, because they tend to be defensive about focusing on their faults (e.g., Campbell, Bonacci, Shelton, Exline, & Bushman, 2004). Competing predictions could be made about selfesteem: Given their positive self-views, people with high self-esteem could tend to downplay their potential for wrongdoing, much as narcissists do. However, their basic sense of security and confidence could enable them to admit shortcomings as well. Neurotic individuals might be highly aware of their personal capability for transgression, given their predispositions to focus on negative information (John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991), whereas conscientious people may carefully monitor their behavior and be quick to notice deviations from social rules. Because many religions emphasize the need to be accountable for transgressions, personal capability might correlate positively with religiosity. Finally, we reasoned that admitting moral flaws would be negatively linked with social desirability. Because any of these personality variables might serve as a confound, we examined whether the link between capability and forgiveness would remain significant when these factors were controlled.\nWe also evaluated the three potential mediators of the capability\u2013forgiveness association outlined in the introduction: If personal capability is indeed linked with forgiveness, is this because offenses seem smaller when people can relate to them? Or is the link due to empathic understanding or seeing oneself as similar to the offender? We predicted that all three mediation explanations would be supported.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (106 men, 112 women) were undergraduates in psychology courses at a private research university in Ohio.

Because of space constraints, this is the only study for which we will describe offense types."}, {"heading": "Situational Mediators", "text": "As described in the introduction, we proposed three mediators of the link between personal capability and forgiveness: offense severity, perceived similarity to the offender, and empathic understanding. We started by testing each variable as an individual mediator using the method popularized by Baron and Kenny (1986). Baron and Kenny\u2019s procedure involves three regression analyses: (a) Does the supposed predictor (or independent variable) X actually predict the criterion (or dependent variable) Y? (b) Does X also predict the supposed mediator M? (c) When X and M are both included in a regression equation predicting Y, does M continue to predict Y while X\u2019s contribution drops substantially? If all three criteria are met, and assuming that the proposed model makes conceptual sense, then the results can be said to support the hypothesis of mediation.\nTable 2 summarizes the hierarchical regressions used to test for mediation. The data met the first criterion, as shown in Model 1: Personal capability predicted lower TRIM (unforgiveness) scores. Criterion two also found support, as shown in Table 1: Personal capability was linked with lower severity ratings, higher perceived similarity to the offender, and higher empathic understanding. To test the third criterion, we ran three separate hierarchical regressions, as shown in Models 2A\u20132C in Table 2. In each model, the hypothesized mediator explained unique variance. The magnitude of the personal capability coefficients decreased in each case, although not to 0, suggesting partial mediation. (The coefficient for personal capability did drop to nonsignificance in model 2A, but not to 0.)\nTo provide a significance test for the question of mediation, we added a final column in Table 2 providing a z score. The z score came from the product of coefficients strategy, sometimes called the Sobel test (e.g., Sobel, 1982; see Preacher & Hayes, 2007, for a recent review). The strategy compares the indirect effects of X on Y (through M) with the standard error of these indirect effects. The\nresulting z score allows significance tests that evaluate whether the supposed mediator can truly be called a mediator\u2014that is, whether it statistically accounts for a significant part of X\u2019s prediction of Y. As shown in the final column of Table 2, all three hypothesized mediators met criteria for mediation using the Sobel test.\nWe had proposed what Preacher and Hayes (2007) described as a multiple mediation model. Our prediction was that severity, empathic understanding, and perceived similarity to the offender would each serve as distinct mediators of the link between personal capability and unforgiveness. In order to test for unique effects, we needed to consider all three mediators simultaneously. The three mediators did correlate highly with each other: severity and similarity, r(214) .39; severity and empathic understanding, r(215) .39; and similarity and empathic understanding, r(215) .47, all ps .01. Thus, it was conceivable that one or more of the mediation links would disappear when all three mediators were considered simultaneously.\nPart of the mediation question could be addressed through hierarchical regression. In Model 3 of Table 2, we added the three mediators to the equation. As predicted, all three continued to predict unique variance in unforgiveness when considered simultaneously, and the role of personal capability was no longer significant. Although these results were consistent with multiple mediation, we needed to see significance tests of mediation to draw firm conclusions. To address the question of multiple mediation, we turned to an SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes (2004). First, the macro used the product of coefficients strategy to compute a total indirect effect: Did the three proposed mediators, considered as a group, mediate the personal capability\u2013 unforgiveness link? The answer was yes, as indicated by the highly significant z score in the last column of Table 2. The macro then evaluated each of the proposed mediators, and each one yielded a significant z score (see Table 2). Taken together, these data provided strong evidence for the proposed multiple mediation pattern\ninvolving three distinct mediators: empathic understanding, perceived similarity to the offender, and offense severity.3"}, {"heading": "A More Behavioral Measure: What Would Participants Like To Say to Their Offenders?", "text": "Because of the potential for bias in self-report scales, we also examined whether the link between personal capability and forgiveness would emerge using another forgiveness measure, one closer to actual behavior. As described in the Method section, we coded participants\u2019 open-ended reports of what they would like to say to the other person (assuming that they could speak openly with no fear of the other person\u2019s response). The more personal capability people expressed, the less hostility they expressed in these statements, and the more positive emotion they expressed. (See Table 1 for correlations.)\nAs with the TRIM, we wanted to see whether personal capability would predict unique variance in the behavioral forgiveness measures when other robust predictors of forgiveness were controlled. When we controlled for prerelationship closeness, personal capability continued to predict less expressed hostility, pr(189) .29, p .01, and more positive emotion, pr(189) .20, p .01. When we controlled for apology, personal capability still predicted less hostility, pr(188) .21, p .01, and marginally more positive emotion, pr(189) .13, p .10. When we controlled for all dispositional variables that predicted either positive emotion or hostility (Neuroticism, Extraversion, dispositional forgiveness, and religiosity; see Table 1), personal capability continued to predict more expressed positive emotion, pr(116) .22, p .05, and less expressed hostility, pr(116) .28, p .01. (When we controlled for each disposition individually, partial correlations ranged from .29 to .32, ps .01, for hostility and from .17 to .23, ps .07, for positive emotion.)\nFinally, we examined whether perceived similarity, empathic understanding, and severity would mediate the links between personal capability and expressed positive and negative emotion (as they did with TRIMs). For brevity, we report only the z scores relevant to mediation. When we assessed each proposed mediator individually, the hypothesis of mediation was supported for all three proposed mediators when predicting both positive emotion and hostility, with zs ranging from 2.41 ( p .05) to 4.58 ( p .01). When we considered all three mediators simultaneously in a model predicting positive emotion, perceived similarity met criteria for mediation (z 3.57, p .01). The mediational role of empathic understanding was marginal (z 1.82, p .10), whereas severity did not meet criteria for mediation (z 1.36, ns). In the case of negative emotion, all three proposed mediators met criteria for mediation when considered simultaneously (similarity, z 2.60, p .01; empathic understanding, z 2.38, p .05; severity, z 2.21, p .05.)\nIn summary, all three proposed mediators (similarity, empathic understanding, and severity) did meet criteria for mediation when considered individually. These associations held for both expressed hostility and positive emotion. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that when considered together, all three variables were distinct mediators of the link between personal capability and expressed hostility, just as they were in the case of TRIM scores. In the case of expressed positive emotion, perceived similarity to the offender emerged as a clear mediator, with empathic under-\nstanding playing a marginal role and offense severity not being significant."}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "As in Study 1, results from Study 2 suggested that people will be more forgiving toward others if they see themselves as capable of a similar wrongdoing. Note that this link was shown not only with a standard self-report measure (the TRIM) but also with written statements of what people would like to say to their offenders. Personal capability continued to predict forgiveness even when we controlled for other robust predictors such as apology, relationship closeness, offense harmfulness, and several major dispositional factors.\nMultiple mediation analyses suggest that the link between capability and forgiveness can be explained through at least three proximal factors: First, seeing oneself capable of committing a certain offense may imply that the offense is not seen as very serious in moral terms. Second, seeing oneself as capable of committing a similar misdeed is associated with feeling similar to the offender. Third, personal capability is also linked with seeing the offense as more understandable. All three of these factors, in turn, predict greater forgiveness.\nStudy 3: From Personal Offenses to Intergroup Atrocities\u2014Responses to the September 11 Attacks\nStudies 1 and 2 demonstrated that in terms of everyday offenses, seeing oneself as capable of committing a similar offense is associated with greater forgiveness. Yet, there may be an upper limit to this association. What about cases involving heinous offenses such as the murder of innocent people? Could most people see themselves as capable of committing such an act? The attacks of September 11, 2001, provided an opportunity to examine people\u2019s responses to an extremely severe offense.

Our next aim was to shift to an experimental approach: Is it possible to facilitate forgiving attitudes by prompting people to consider their own misdeeds?\nOur strategy was to ask people to focus on similar offenses of their own. We chose this technique for two reasons. First, there was an empirical precedent for this procedure in several apology\u2013 forgiveness studies (Takaku, 2001; Takaku et al., 2001). Second, pilot studies suggested that reflection on past offenses was more potent and engaging than techniques such as imagining hypothetical future offenses, listing reasons why one might commit a similar offense, or recalling situations involving temptation but no misdeed. Our primary aim was to evaluate whether recalling a similar offense would facilitate forgiving attitudes. We began with scenario methods (Studies 4 and 5) before turning to real-life offenses (Study 6).\nAs described in the introduction, we also considered two potential moderator variables in these experiments. In Studies 5 and 6, we considered whether it would be important to recall a truly similar offense of one\u2019s own. In all four experiments (4\u20137), we examined the role of gender. Our prediction was that in terms of facilitating forgiveness (or reducing vengefulness), the similar offense technique would be more effective for men than for women.\nStudy 4: Responses to a Standardized, Hypothetical Offense\nThe aim of Study 4 was to see whether asking people to recall a similar offense of their own would make them less harsh in their\njudgments of another\u2019s offense. We chose to start with a standardized, hypothetical offense in which participants were not personally victimized, and we did so for two reasons. First, a scenario design provided considerable experimental control through use of a standardized situation. Second, we wanted to see whether reflecting on personal offenses could affect the \u201ccold\u201d cognitive judgments that people make as outside observers\u2014that is, when they read or hear about other people\u2019s offenses but do not suffer harm themselves. In line with several recent studies (Cohen, Malka, Rozin, & Cherfas, 2006; Farrow & Woodruff, 2005; Wohl & Branscombe, 2005), we asked participants to rate the extent to which they saw the offense as forgivable.4\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (65 men, 52 women, and 1 participant who did not list gender)5 were enrolled in an introductory psychology course at a private research university in Ohio.

We chose an offense that was likely to be common in college life. Participants were asked to imagine both people in the scenario as being of their own gender. The scenario read as follows:\nLee & Chris are roommates at [the same university as participants]. One night they are talking, getting to know each other better, and Lee confides in Chris about some very painful and embarrassing childhood memories. Suddenly feeling ashamed and afraid of the word getting out, Lee swears Chris to secrecy. Chris agrees, reassuring Lee that the secret is safe. A few weeks later, Chris is talking with some other friends. The conversation eventually turns to gossip about fellow students. One friend makes a joking reference to something that Lee did, and the gossip starts to center on Lee. A few of the friends turn to Chris and say, \u201cWell, you\u2019re Lee\u2019s roommate. What dirt have you picked up?\u201d Chris then blurts out Lee\u2019s secret, and everyone laughs. Word eventually gets back to Lee that Chris revealed this sensitive information.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Participants in the morally similar condition read these instructions: \u201cPlease recall a social situation in which you revealed some negative, private information about someone else. Note: This should NOT be a situation in which you revealed the information in order to protect or help the other person.\u201d They were then asked to briefly describe the recalled situation before answering questions about the offense. In the control condition, participants\n4 Pilot studies have clarified that labeling an offense as forgivable does not imply that it is seen as trivial. Rather, the construct of forgivability seems to capture beliefs about whether it would be morally appropriate to forgive the offense, regardless of its severity.\n5 Studies 4\u20137 were not originally designed to focus on gender differences. As such, most of them have unbalanced cell sizes containing more men than women, reflecting the gender composition of the university.\nsimply read the scenario and answered questions about the offense. (Although the Study 4 control condition was straightforward, it did not involve the same level of cognitive processing or elapsed time as the similar offense condition.6 We remedied this potential problem in Study 6.) Participants rated how forgivable Chris\u2019s offense was on an 11-point scale (0 not at all, 10 extremely)."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Results appear in Table 3. Although the main effect of experimental condition was not significant, an interaction with gender emerged clearly. In the control condition, men and women did not differ in their forgivability ratings. In the similar offense condition, men\u2019s forgivability ratings were higher than those of women. Men rated the offense as more forgivable in the experimental condition than in the control condition, suggesting that the prompt to consider their own misdeeds made them less harsh toward the hypothetical offender. Women gave equivalent forgivability ratings in both conditions.\nThese results supported the hypothesis that reflecting on one\u2019s own offenses can indeed soften judgments of hypothetical offenses, but only for men. Men, but not women, gave higher forgivability ratings if they were primed to consider a similar offense of their own.\nStudy 5: Multiple Scenarios\nStudy 5 built on the scenario methods of Study 4, with a primary prediction being that the Study 4 gender interaction would replicate across a wider set of situations. Study 5 also included new items that enabled closer inspection of underlying processes. Participants in the similar offense condition were asked to directly compare their offense with the target offense in terms of severity and type. They also reflected on whether writing about their own offense seemed to affect the forgivability, understandability, and size of the target offense. By tracing participant reports of what they had experienced, we could evaluate whether the underlying psychological processes fit with the mediational findings from Study 2. Participants also answered questions about the emotions that they experienced while reflecting on their own offenses. On the basis of prior research suggesting that negative emotion inhibits generosity (e.g., Exline & Fisher, 2005), we predicted that negative feelings about one\u2019s own offense (e.g., shame, guilt, embarrassment) would be linked with lower forgivability judgments."}, {"heading": "Pilot Study", "text": "Before conducting Study 5, we did a pilot study.

The third scenario involved failing to drop off an urgent, job-related letter for a friend at the post office.

As in Study 4, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a similar offense condition or a control condition in which they gave forgivability ratings immediately after reading the scenario.

Setting aside the gender interaction for the moment, we focused on another question: Under what conditions would recalling a similar offense of one\u2019s own make a target offense seem more forgivable? We made the following predictions, which are summarized in the Figure 1 path diagram.8\nStudy 2 revealed that the link between personal capability and forgiveness was partly mediated by empathic understanding and offense severity. In Study 5, we asked participants directly about whether writing about their own offenses led to changes in understanding and offense size (a proxy for severity). If recalling one\u2019s own offense is indeed linked with increased understanding and a sense that the target offense seems smaller, we reasoned that both shifts in perception would predict reports that the target offense seemed more forgivable.\nIn order to set these empathic and offense-shrinking processes in motion, a person might need to recall an offense that is truly similar to the target. We predicted that two domains of similarity would be important: First, to the extent that people recall an offense that is similar in type (e.g., gossip; betrayal), they should report that reflecting on their offense made the target offense seem more understandable. Second, to the extent that people recall an offense that is similar in severity, they should report that focusing on their own offense made the target offense seem to shrink. As reported earlier (see the Method section), most people recalled offenses that were less severe than the target. Recalling a lesser\n7 Specifically, the scenario in which the babysitter\u2019s error allowed the child to drink cleaning fluid was seen as more harmful (M 7.9, SD 2.4) than the gossip scenario (M 6.1, SD 2.4) or the post office scenario (M 6.6, SD 2.3), omnibus F(2, 300) 10.24, p .01, 2 .09 (for contrasts, p .01, with Bonferroni correction). The gossip offense was seen as more intentional (M 5.0, SD 2.9) than the post office offense (M 2.9, SD 2.4), which in turn was seen as more intentional than the babysitter offense (M 0.7, SD 1.3), omnibus F(2, 201) 60.09, p .01, 2 .37 (both comparisons significant at p .01 with Bonferroni correction).\n8 In Studies 5 and 6, the chain of proposed connections was more complex than in Study 2. This is why we used path analysis rather than the multiple mediation procedures outlined in Study 2.\noffense of one\u2019s own could lead to contrast effects, making the target offense seem to grow rather than shrink. We expected certain people to be more likely to recall offenses that were truly similar in severity and type: people who reported high levels of personal capability for committing a similar offense.\nThe proposed pattern of associations met with strong support, as shown in the path diagram in Figure 1. We used AMOS (Version 4; Arbuckle, 1999). Although we tested several alternate models, we show only the best-fitting model for simplicity: 2(8, N 160) 7.83, p .45; 2/df 0.98, normed fit index (NFI) .99, comparative fit index (CFI) 1.0, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) .00. As predicted, personal capability predicted greater odds of recalling offenses that were similar to the target in terms of both severity and type. Similarity in type predicted marginally ( p .07) greater understanding (see note below), whereas similar severity predicted a perception that the target offense had shrunk. Both increased understanding and decreased offense size predicted a sense that the target offense seemed more forgivable. These associations were generally consistent with the hypotheses.\nTo optimize model fit, we included one path in the model that was not originally proposed: a direct link between personal capability and increased understanding. Without this path, several indices suggested a mediocre fit: 2(9, N 160) 17.76, p .04; 2/df 1.97, NFI .98, CFI .99, RMSEA .08. However, it is worth noting that when this nonhypothesized path was deleted, the link between similar type and increased understanding was highly significant ( .25, p .01) rather than marginal ( .15, p .07)."}, {"heading": "Gender and Perceived Shifts in Offense Size", "text": "Women were more likely than men to report a contrast effect in which the target offense seemed to grow in size (women, M 0.4, SD 0.9; men, M 0.1, SD 0.9), t(154) 2.17, p .05, 2 .03.

Recalling an offense that was similar in type was linked with reports of increased understanding, whereas recalling an offense that was similar in severity was linked with reports that the target offense seemed to shrink. People high in personal capability were more likely to recall offenses that were truly similar to the target in terms of severity and type. Complementing the results of Study 3, these findings suggest that there may be an upper limit on the use of the similar-offense technique for many people. If people do not recall similar offenses of their own (and many people in this study did not), the resulting contrast effects could make the target offense seem even larger.\nStudy 5 replicated the gender differences of Study 4. For men, drawing attention to their own offenses led to higher forgivability ratings of a target offense. Reflecting on an offense of one\u2019s own did not affect forgivability ratings for women. Women were more likely than men to report that focusing on their own offense made the target offense seem to grow in size. Also, when asked how it felt to focus on their own offenses, women reported marginally more self-focused negative emotion than men. Negative emotion, in turn, predicted harsher judgments.\nStudy 6: A Return to Real-Life Offenses\nStudy 6 was designed to see whether the main findings of Study 5 (gender interaction; path model in Figure 1) would replicate in cases involving actual offenses. In several important respects, Study 6 presented a much tougher test of our hypotheses than the scenario studies: First, use of real-life situations would provide a broad range of offense types, features, and consequences, all of which would increase extraneous variance. Second, because the offenses occurred in the past, people might have already decided whether they wanted to forgive. Third, whereas the scenario studies had focused on \u201ccold,\u201d cognitively based judgments about forgivability, the next set of studies emphasized \u201chot,\u201d emotionally charged motivations related to forgiveness and vengefulness. Furthermore, the offenses examined in Studies 6 and 7 were ones in which people were personally engaged. All of these factors would make it harder for a brief manipulation to influence forgiveness ratings, thus providing a challenging testing ground for our hypotheses.\nA secondary aim was to build on Study 2, in which we examined whether various dispositional factors might explain the association between forgiveness and personal capability. Although Study 2 addressed many dispositional variables, two potentially important ones were omitted: empathy and humility. Because humility focuses on acceptance of personal limitations (Exline, Campbell, et al., 2004), it could be linked with personal capability. The humble\nperson\u2019s ability to transcend self-interest might also predict greater forgiveness. Envisioning oneself performing wrongful actions might also involve empathic processing, and there is evidence that dispositional empathy predicts greater forgiveness (e.g., Brown, 2003; Konstam et al., 2001; Macaskill et al., 2002; Toussaint & Webb, 2005). In Study 6, then, we examined whether dispositional humility or empathy might subsume the capability\u2013forgiveness link.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (63 men, 38 women) were enrolled in an introductory psychology course at a private research university in Ohio.

In the similar offense condition, participants were asked to spend the next 10 min writing about a time in which they seriously hurt or offended someone else. They were asked to focus, if possible, on an offense that was similar to the one committed against them. If they could not think of anything similar, they were asked to describe another situation in which they seriously hurt or offended another person. In the control condition, participants were asked to spend the next 10 min writing about what a typical week was like for them 1 year before they participated in the study. They were asked to remember details such as their class schedule, where they lived, when they typically worked and socialized, and so on.

The two subscales were Empathic Concern (M 2.8, SD 0.6, .78) and Perspective Taking (M 2.5, SD 07, .80).

Study 6 replicated the key gender interaction from Studies 4 and 5, using both the full TRIM and its Vengefulness subscale.

However, men who recalled a similar offense showed substantially less vengefulness and grudge holding, dropping to levels similar to those of women. Women\u2019s TRIM and Vengefulness scores were not affected by the manipulation.\nAs shown in Figure 2, all three mediators of the capability\u2013 forgiveness link that were identified in Study 2 emerged once again as important mechanisms. To the extent that people saw\nthemselves capable of committing similar offenses, they recalled offenses that were truly similar in severity and type. Recalling truly similar offenses, in turn, was linked with the increased understanding and offense shrinking that predicted higher forgivability ratings. Personal capability was also linked with a greater sense of similarity to the offender. This sense of similarity, combined with increased understanding, predicted lower TRIM scores.\nFinally, Study 6 ruled out two potential dispositional confounds that Study 2 did not address: empathy and humility. The link between personal capability and forgiveness was not subsumed by the roles of dispositional humility or empathic concern, although personal capability was positively associated with a humble disposition.\nStudy 7: Could a Subtle Empathy\u2013Capability Manipulation Reduce Men\u2019s Vengefulness?\nStudy 7 built on the gender interaction findings from Studies 4\u20136. The personal capability manipulations from those studies represented overt, conscious primes. In Study 7, we examined whether a more subtle manipulation could be effective. Rather than going through the conscious step of writing about one\u2019s own offense or envisioning the other person\u2019s perspective, could it be useful to simply answer questions involving personal capability and empathic understanding? We predicted that it would.\nWe saw an opportunity to test this hypothesis in an existing data set. As in Study 6, this study used real-life offenses, but it also included counterbalancing of questionnaires. The study included questions about personal capability and empathic understanding. The survey was structured so that some participants answered the capability and empathy questions just before they completed the vengefulness measure, whereas others did not answer them until after the vengefulness measure. Our purpose in Study 7 was to see whether simply being asked to reflect on these questions would be enough to reduce vengefulness scores\u2014at least for men.\n9 In both regressions, all key associations remained significant when condition, gender, and their interaction term were added to the equation.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (83 men, 72 women) were taking an introductory psychology course at a private research university in Ohio.

For men, vengefulness was reduced simply by answering questions about their capability for similar wrongdoing and their ability to see the situation from the other person\u2019s perspective.\nGeneral Discussion\nSeven studies tested the hypothesis that reflecting on one\u2019s own capability for similar offenses would predict more forgiving attitudes toward others. Three correlational studies (1\u20133) showed consistent support for the hypothesis, ruled out several alternative explanations, and identified three mediating processes. Four experimental studies (4\u20137) offered additional confirmation of the proposed mediators and also identified some important boundary conditions related to offense similarity and gender."}, {"heading": "Forgiveness and Personal Capability: Correlational Studies", "text": "Our correlational studies revealed a clear, consistent association: Forgiveness was greater to the extent that people could see themselves as capable of a similar wrongdoing. Personal capability distinguished between forgiven and unforgiven offenses (Study 1), predicted unforgiveness of actual transgressions (Study 2), and predicted greater forgivability ratings of hypothetical offenses (pilot study before Study 4). The association between personal capability and forgiveness was robust across procedures and samples. First, the association extended beyond college students (Study 1). Second, the link remained strong when we controlled for other robust predictors of forgiveness: relationship closeness and apology (Study 2). Third, the association was found not only on self-report rating scales but also on a more behavioral measure: people\u2019s written statements of what they would like to say to the other person (Study 2). Last, the association could not be reduced to individual-difference factors such as the Big Five, narcissism, entitlement, religiosity, or social desirability. Humility and empathy were also ruled out as dispositional confounds (Study 6).\nAt least three pathways mediate the link between personal capability and forgiveness (Studies 2, 5, and 6). First, people can more easily see themselves committing minor offenses compared with major ones, and minor offenses are easier to forgive. In fact, another\u2019s offense may seem to shrink in size when evaluators recall truly similar offenses of their own (Studies 5 and 6). The logic seems to be, \u201cIf I could do it, then it can\u2019t be that serious.\u201d\n10 Because of multiple types of counterbalancing and various hypotheses in the original study, there were unequal cell sizes in the data set. The condition with capability\u2013empathy measures first had 110 participants, and the condition with the TRIM first had 45 participants.\nThe other two mediators focus on empathic connection: If people see themselves as capable of a similar wrongdoing, this belief is linked with greater empathic understanding and a sense of being similar to the offender. Both of these perceptions, in turn, predict greater forgiveness.\nThe association between personal capability and forgiveness also applies at an intergroup level, as shown in Study 3\u2019s assessment of responses to the September 11 attacks. When faced with a heinous offense against one\u2019s ingroup, seeing oneself as capable of a similar offense did not predict forgiveness. There may have been a floor effect here, because most people simply could not envision themselves doing something so horrible. However, seeing members of one\u2019s ingroup (in this case, the U.S. government) as capable of a similar wrongdoing predicted more forgiving attitudes. Notably, this sense of ingroup capability predicted not only forgiving attitudes but also less support for specific aggressive actions, including strikes against civilian targets, the death penalty for perpetrators, and perpetrators being shot on sight. It is important to note that these associations remained when we controlled for support for strikes against military targets, which could be seen as a proxy for general military attitudes, attitudes toward the current administration, or support of the decision to go to war."}, {"heading": "Reflecting on One\u2019s Own Capability for Offenses: Experimental Studies", "text": "Having established a correlational link between personal capability and forgiveness, we turned to experimental designs. Most of these studies (4\u20136) focused on having people recall a similar offense of their own. Results suggested that having people recall a similar offense may indeed facilitate forgiveness; however, offense similarity and gender are important moderators."}, {"heading": "Offense Similarity", "text": "In order to influence forgivability judgments, it was important that participants regarded their own offenses as similar in both severity and type to the target offense (Studies 5 and 6). In terms of making offenses easier to understand, it was especially important to recall an offense that was similar in type. But in terms of making offenses seem smaller, it was important to recall an offense of one\u2019s own that was just as severe as the target offense. It was common for people to recall offenses that were less severe than that of the target, consistent with the notion of self-enhancement (e.g., Sedikides & Strube, 1997).\nThese results, combined with those of the September 11 study (Study 3), suggest a practical upper limit on the use of the similar offense technique: If people cannot recall an offense that is similar in type, the comparison may fail to facilitate understanding because it will seem irrelevant. And if people cannot recall an offense that is similar in severity, the other person\u2019s offense may seem to grow in size. In cases of heinous or unusual offenses, it may be useful to focus on the personal capability of ingroup members (Study 3), perhaps extending one\u2019s ingroup to include all of humanity (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005)."}, {"heading": "Gender Effects", "text": "Across our experimental studies, one consistent finding was that men gave gentler judgments (Studies 4 and 5) and showed less\nvengefulness (Studies 6 and 7) after reflecting on their own actual or potential misdeeds. Study 7 revealed that even a very subtle manipulation was effective: Men reported less vengefulness if they were first asked to answer questions about personal capability and empathic understanding. The experimental manipulations used in our studies did not influence forgiveness-related responses among women, who tended to be less vengeful than men in the control conditions (Studies 6 and 7).\nIn terms of facilitating forgiveness, why might personal capability prompts be especially effective for men? One possibility might be a basic gender difference in motivational orientation. Baron-Cohen (2002) and others have argued that male brains are oriented toward systems\u2014that is, they strive to analyze rules that govern behavior (or other systems, such as mechanical ones), with an ultimate goal of prediction or control. Female brains, in contrast, are proposed to assign higher priority to empathic concern for individuals. If so, then the primary male concern in response to another\u2019s offense would involve justice, whereas females would be more concerned with relationship repair.\nIn support of this reasoning, a recent study by Singer et al. (2006) using brain imaging techniques suggested that women and men responded differently to the punishment of a transgressor. Participants witnessed the punishment of a person who had played selfishly in a group resource game. Men showed activity in the reward centers of their brains, suggesting that they found pleasure or satisfaction in the punishment of the transgressor, whereas female brains showed activation in emotional and empathic sections, indicating concern for the individual\u2019s suffering. To the extent that a personal capability prime would shift men out of a predominant \u201csystems mode,\u201d instead facilitating relational or empathic thinking, it could lead to sharp decreases in punitive behavior. Among women, personal capability primes might have little or no effect because they do not represent much of a shift from the predominant relational mode.\nA complementary explanation centers on the distinction between agency and communion, with agency usually seen as masculine and communion as feminine (Bakan, 1966; Spence & Helmreich, 1978). The assumption of gender differences along those lines may be especially relevant when the choice is between seeking revenge and forgiving. Forgiveness would support a communal concern with maintaining social bonds, whereas agency would be linked to revenge seeking, which is a highly active form of unforgiveness. Our findings complement prior work showing that males favor revenge more strongly than females do (e.g., Stuckless & Goranson, 1992), which may reflect their concerns with justice and agency, respectively. Among males, then, reflecting on one\u2019s own offenses (or capability) might weaken vengeful motives by fostering a more reflective, communal stance. Women\u2019s low levels of vengefulness may have led to a floor effect.\nAnother possible explanation received indirect support in Study 5: Focusing on one\u2019s own offenses opens the door for self-focused negative thoughts and emotions, which tend to inhibit prosocial responses (Exline & Fisher, 2005). Women did report marginally more negative emotion than men regarding their offenses. Self-focused rumination has been linked with shame and personal distress (Joireman, 2004), and women tend to ruminate on negative thoughts more than men (Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, & Grayson, 1999). Women were also more likely than men to report that focusing on their own offense made the target offense seem to grow in size (Studies 5 and\n6). If the goal is to facilitate forgiving attitudes, then, it may be counterproductive to break women\u2019s predominant relational stance by encouraging them to focus on their flaws.\nIt is noteworthy that gender differences emerged only in the experimental studies\u2014those in which some people were primed to focus on personal capability. The correlational link between personal capability and forgiveness was not moderated by gender (Study 2). Both men and women were more forgiving to the extent that they saw themselves as capable of similar offenses. These findings contrast with prior work on empathy, which suggested that the magnitude of empathy\u2013forgiveness correlations might differ for men and women (Fincham et al., 2002; Toussaint & Webb, 2005). However, those studies focused on emotional empathy (Fincham et al., 2002) and dispositional empathy (Toussaint & Webb, 2005), variables with only indirect relevance to the situation-specific, cognitive factor of personal capability."}, {"heading": "Predictors of Personal Capability", "text": "Given the role of personal capability in predicting forgiveness, it seems important to pinpoint variables that predict personal capability. As shown in Study 2, personal capability correlated positively with the extent of apologies received. In terms of dispositional predictors, personal capability was linked with introversion as well as marginally lower narcissism and social desirability. Perhaps surprisingly, personal capability did not correlate with any of the other Big Five factors, religiosity, or dispositional forgiveness. Study 6 demonstrated that humility predicted personal capability but that dispositional empathy did not.\nForgiveness Versus Minimization of Offenses: Ethical Implications\nOur studies have considered personal capability and empathy as potential facilitators of forgiveness. Before we conclude, it seems important to clarify that we are not suggesting any type of value judgment about whether forgiveness is morally appropriate. To use an extreme example, one murderer might reflect on the actions of another murderer and think, \u201cOh, murder isn\u2019t so serious. After all, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d Such minimization of the offense could indeed facilitate a forgiving attitude. But it could also serve as justification for one\u2019s own future crimes, and it could work against justice by leading people to condone serious offenses. In the case of everyday offenses, a softening of one\u2019s attitude toward an offender may bring a sense of peace and help to heal damaged relationships. But in an abusive or exploitative situation, a premature softening of attitudes might contribute to a decision to stay in a dangerous situation.\nWhen dealing with these sorts of examples, forgiveness theorists are quick to point out that true forgiveness is not the same thing as condoning, minimizing, or excusing offenses (e.g., Enright & Fitzgibbons, 2000). We definitely agree. But, as some have pointed out (Belicki, Rourke, & McCarthy, 2007), the empathic thinking that often accompanies forgiveness can also lead people in the direction of minimizing offenses. Our own data also support the potential for minimizing: Reflecting on a similar offense of one\u2019s own often did promote softer judgments of the other party\u2019s offense. Clearly, there are situations in which demands for justice and safety might not be served if people are too quick to shrink the offenses of others. Our aim here was to consider whether reflecting on one\u2019s own dark side can\nfacilitate more forgiving attitudes\u2014regardless of whether such attitudes are seen as an asset or a liability."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "Although we have tried to be thorough, the work presented here has some clear limitations. Most of our data were based on student samples (except Study 1) and self-report instruments. Study 2 revealed that the findings did extend to a quasi-behavioral measure\u2014a statement of what participants would like to say to the other person. Future studies will ideally include more behavioral measures.\nOur research revealed some evidence that the link between capability and forgiveness may apply at an intergroup level. Clearly, however, our work has only scratched the surface in terms of intergroup processes. In future work, it will be important to consider ways of facilitating empathy in cases of severe intergroup offenses\u2014cases in which people may find it difficult to empathize. Looking at one\u2019s own ingroup may be one useful technique, as Study 3 suggested. But there are likely to be many cases in which people cannot envision their ingroup members committing certain offenses. One good alternative may be to create a highly inclusive ingroup, such as humanity (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005). By focusing on their connections with others, people may experience not only more prosocial attitudes but also a greater sense of humility.\nWhen we started this research, our conceptualization of humility was based on the idea that people need to come to terms with their dark sides\u2014their personal limitations, offenses, and failings. Yet, our data suggest that asking people to focus on their transgressions may be risky if it fosters negative emotion or defensiveness. These risks may be especially salient for women, given their tendencies toward negative rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1999). In fact, recent theorizing suggests that the open, nondefensive stance associated with humility may require a secure, stable basis of self-worth along with a positive emotional tone (Exline, Campbell, et al., 2004). If people lack these foundations, directing them to focus on their limitations might merely stimulate shame, which tends to prompt defensive reactions (e.g., Tangney & Dearing, 2002). Future forgiveness work should examine techniques to help people face their limitations in constructive ways. In addition to humility, topics such as self-affirmation (Steele, 1999) and selfcompassion (Neff, 2003) seem highly relevant to this effort."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This research suggests that when people evaluate the offenses of others, their attitudes are more forgiving when they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses. A sense of personal capability can make another\u2019s offense seem less severe, and it is also linked with empathic understanding and a sense of similarity to the offender. As shown in Studies 4\u20136, asking people to recall similar offenses of their own may facilitate forgiveness\u2014but primarily for men. Across all four experimental studies, men became more forgiving when prompted to reflect on their personal capability for similar offenses. Women did not show this effect. In fact, there was some evidence that for women, focusing on their own offenses prompted negative emotion and actually made the other person\u2019s offense seem to grow in size. To deepen our understanding of humility and forgiveness, future studies might\nincorporate positive features such as security, connectedness, and positive emotion. People may need to have these resources available before they can face their limitations and offenses in constructive ways.\nReferences\nArbuckle, J. L. (1999). AMOS 4.0 [Computer software].

Risen University of Chicago\nThomas Gilovich Cornell University\nThe present research explored the belief that it is bad luck to \u201ctempt fate.\u201d Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that people do indeed have the intuition that actions that tempt fate increase the likelihood of negative outcomes. Studies 3\u20136 examined our claim that the intuition is due, in large part, to the combination of the automatic tendencies to attend to negative prospects and to use accessibility as a cue when judging likelihood. Study 3 demonstrated that negative outcomes are more accessible following actions that tempt fate than following actions that do not tempt fate. Studies 4 and 5 demonstrated that the heightened accessibility of negative outcomes mediates the elevated perceptions of likelihood. Finally, Study 6 examined the automatic nature of the underlying processes. The types of actions that are thought to tempt fate as well as the role of society and culture in shaping this magical belief are discussed.\nKeywords: tempt fate, magical thinking, accessibility, negativity\nIt is an irony of the post-Enlightenment world that so many people who don\u2019t believe in fate refuse to tempt it. Why are people afraid to comment on a streak of success if they reject the notion that the universe punishes such modest acts of hubris (Ferm, 1989; Will, 2002)? Why do people feel that if they exchange a lottery ticket it will become more likely to win, even when they cannot cite any conceivable mechanism by which the odds could change (Risen & Gilovich, 2007)? Why do so many people feel that it\u2019s more likely to rain if they don\u2019t bring their umbrella or that a maddeningly slow checkout line at the grocery store is likely to speed up the moment they leave it in search of a speedier line (Miller & Taylor, 1995)? It is to these questions that the present research was addressed.\nAlthough these beliefs are puzzling in many respects, considerable insight into their nature is provided by recent \u201ctwo systems\u201d accounts of everyday judgment (Epstein, Lipson, Hostein, & Huh, 1992; Evans, 2007; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Sloman, 1996; Stanovich, 1999). Such accounts explain how people can be \u201cof two minds\u201d about such beliefs and propositions. People\u2019s rational faculties, aided by formal education, tells them that there is no mechanism by which, say, a television announcer\u2019s comment about a basketball player\u2019s streak of consecutive free-throws can cause the player to miss his next shot. Nevertheless, a set of associations built up and stored by the intuitive system can give people a very strong \u201cgut feeling\u201d that such comments do in fact bring bad luck. Perhaps the most clear-cut manifestation of this\nconflict between intuition and reason comes from participants who knowingly choose a dominated option. In one notable study, participants explicitly stated that they knew they had a better chance of drawing a red jelly bean from an urn with one red jelly bean and nine white jelly beans than they did of drawing it from an urn with 8 red beans and 92 white beans\u2014but still couldn\u2019t help themselves from drawing from the urn with 8 potential winners (Denes-Raj & Epstein, 1994).\nThe belief that it is bad luck to tempt fate reflects, for most people, the same dualism. They believe that \u201cthere is no such thing\u201d as bad luck, and yet they have a strong intuition, or \u201cfeeling,\u201d that bad things happen to people who tempt fate. For example, students who were asked to respond rationally stated that an exchanged lottery ticket was no more likely to win than any other ticket. Students who were asked to respond intuitively, however, reported that exchanging a ticket made it more likely to win (Risen & Gilovich, 2007). How do such intuitions arise?\nWe contend that the belief that it is bad luck to tempt fate is largely the result of two automatic mental processes. The first is the tendency for people\u2019s thoughts and attention to be drawn disproportionately to negative stimuli and prospects over positive stimuli and prospects. This tendency is reflected in the phenomenon of loss aversion (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1991; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979); in the tendency for scowling faces to \u201cpop out\u201d of arrays of happy faces (Hansen & Hansen, 1988; see also Dijksterhuis & Aarts, 2003); in the longer latency to name the color of negative adjectives in a Stroop task (Pratto & John, 1991); and, more generally, in the tendency for negative stimuli to pack a bigger psychological punch than positive stimuli (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001; Rozin & Royzman, 2001).\nOur argument is that people correctly anticipate that they would feel bad if they were caught in an agonizingly slow line at the grocery store or if they were caught in a thunderstorm without an umbrella. And they anticipate, again correctly, that they would feel even worse if they had moved to a slow checkout line from another or if they had thought about bringing an umbrella but chose not to (Gilovich & Medvec, 1995; Roese & Olson, 1995; Zeelenberg, van\nJane L.

We contend that because potential outcomes such as these would be particularly aversive, they are particularly likely to capture one\u2019s attention and imagination.\nSecond, having captured the imagination, the subjective probability of such outcomes is enhanced. Past research has established that merely imagining an event makes it seem more likely to occur (Carroll, 1978; Gregory, Cialdini, & Carpenter, 1982; Sherman, Cialdini, Schwartzman, & Reynolds, 1985). Imagining an outcome increases its accessibility and lends it a feeling of fluency that enhances its subjective likelihood (Kelly & Jacoby, 1998; Schwarz et al., 1991; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). Putting these two phenomena together, we contend that negative outcomes that (would) result from actions that tempt fate are anticipated to be particularly aversive and therefore (a) capture the imagination and, (b) having done so, are seen as more likely than negative outcomes that result from actions that don\u2019t tempt fate.\nMiller and Taylor (1995) advanced a similar analysis to explain why people are reluctant to take certain actions that depart from the status quo. They argued that people refrain from such things as switching answers on a multiple-choice test or changing lines at the grocery-store checkout counter for two reasons. First, they anticipate how much they would regret doing so if the action turned out badly and so they avoid acting to avoid having to kick themselves for their mistake. Second, because they do indeed kick themselves whenever they take such actions and they turn out badly, experiences of acting and being punished for doing so tend to become overrepresented in memory. Thus, people end up believing that bad outcomes are more likely to happen if they take action than if they stick with the status quo.\nOur analysis builds on that of Miller and Taylor (1995) in two ways. First, we note that it is not just negative outcomes that follow from actions that depart from the status quo that are experienced as particularly aversive. One can tempt fate in other ways. And when any action that tempts fate goes awry, whether it involves a departure from the status quo or not, it is experienced as especially negative. In its broadest sense, to tempt fate is \u201cto do something that is risky or dangerous\u201d (McKean, 2005). Thus, one can tempt fate by leaving one\u2019s house unlocked, skateboarding without a helmet, or serving as a photojournalist in a war zone. In this sense, one can tempt fate simply by leaving oneself exposed (i.e., not being prepared for what the universe may throw at you). But the term also applies to actions whose risk comes from the possibility of offending the gods (reflected in the phrase \u201cto tempt God,\u201d recorded as far back as the 1300s), the universe, or fate (with the phrase \u201cto tempt fate\u201d appearing around 1700; Simpson & Weiner, 1989). As we elaborate further in the general discussion, one is most frequently seen as tempting fate when one is unusually arrogant (e.g., by being presumptuous about the future). Commenting on a streak of success, for example, can be seen as a reflection of hubris and presumptuousness rather than simply a departure from the status quo, and when it precedes a downturn in performance, that downturn is especially salient and especially painful. And, like actions that depart from the status quo, calling attention to ongoing success is thought to be something of a jinx (Ferm, 1989; Risen, Gilovich, Kruger, & Savitsky, 2007; Will, 2002).\nOur analysis also differs from Miller and Taylor\u2019s (1995), in that their account involves psychological processes that occur over\ntime and retrospectively. That is, past departures from the status quo that went awry are particularly salient and memorable, which distorts one\u2019s intuitive database and makes it seem as if future departures from the status quo are especially risky. Our account, in contrast, involves psychological processes that operate prospectively and apply to possible courses of action never before taken or even considered. A student who has never failed to do the reading for class merely has to imagine what it would be like to be called on by the instructor without being properly prepared to get a sense of how aversive it would be. Picturing such an aversive outcome, furthermore, elevates its subjective likelihood. This leads to the impression\u2014consciously denied by some but not others\u2014that one is more likely to be called on in class if one has not done the reading than if one has.\nIn the six studies reported here, we examined the belief that actions that tempt fate increase the likelihood of negative outcomes. We also examined the psychological processes that we argue are largely responsible for such a belief.\nOverview of Studies\nWe contend that people overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes following behaviors that tempt fate because people are drawn to think more about negative possibilities, which makes those possibilities easier to imagine and therefore more accessible. The greater accessibility of such outcomes is then used as a cue to their likelihood, which enhances their subjective probability of occurrence. Studies 1 and 2 examined whether participants believe that negative outcomes are more likely following behaviors that tempt fate. Study 3 used the scenarios from Studies 1 and 2, but instead of asking participants to rate the perceived likelihood of the pertinent negative outcomes, we examined the accessibility of those imagined outcomes. Study 4 investigated whether accessibility mediated participants\u2019 likelihood judgments and Study 5 examined, experimentally, the causal role of accessibility on likelihood judgments. Finally, in Study 6, we used a cognitive load manipulation to disrupt effortful processing and determine whether System 1 is responsible for the effects of negativity and accessibility on judgments of likelihood.\nStudy 1\nStudy 1 was designed to examine whether people believe that negative outcomes are more likely following a behavior that tempts fate. Participants read either that Jon tempted fate by acting presumptuously or that he acted cautiously and avoided tempting fate. We predicted that participants would judge the likelihood of the negative outcome to be higher when Jon tempted fate than when he did not."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. Sixty-two Cornell undergraduates were randomly approached on campus and asked to participate.\nMaterials and procedure. Participants read a scenario in which Jon recently finished applying to graduate school and that Stanford was his top choice. The scenario specified that, typical of Jon\u2019s mother\u2019s optimistic nature, she sent him a Stanford T-shirt in the mail. Participants read either that Jon decided to stuff the shirt\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nin the bottom of the drawer while awaiting Stanford\u2019s decision or that he decided to wear the shirt the next day. Participants were then asked to indicate how likely they believed it was that Stanford would offer Jon acceptance by circling a number between 0 and 10, with 0 labeled not at all likely and 10 labeled extremely likely."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "As predicted, participants believed that Jon was less likely to be accepted to Stanford if he tempted fate by wearing the Stanford T-shirt (M 5.19, SD 1.35) than if he stuffed it in the drawer (M 6.13, SD 1.02), t(60) 3.01, p .01, d 0.78. We contend that they believe Jon is less likely to be accepted when he acts presumptuously because participants anticipate that it would feel particularly aversive to be rejected after donning the Stanford shirt and, precisely because it is more aversive, it jumps to mind more readily and therefore seems especially likely. To ensure that people do indeed anticipate that a given outcome would be more painful when it follows an action that tempts fate, we had a separate group of participants evaluate how someone would feel after being rejected. We found that 90% of participants thought that a person would be more upset by being rejected from Stanford after having worn a Stanford shirt than after having stuffed the shirt in the drawer, 2(1, N 20) 12.80, p .001.\nWe contend that the difference in likelihood judgments reflects participants\u2019 true feelings about what is likely to happen to Jon. It is possible, however, that participants\u2019 judgments reflect what they want to happen rather than what they think is actually likely to happen. That is, participants may prefer that Jon be denied admission if he is cocky enough to wear the shirt, and they may have expressed this desire in their likelihood judgments.\nWe tested this possibility in Study 2 by having some participants imagine themselves tempting fate and other participants imagine someone else doing so. Because people do not want to see themselves punished, if participants believe that negative outcomes are more likely to happen when they themselves tempt fate, it suggests that their likelihood judgments reflect their beliefs about what will happen rather than their desires.\nStudy 2\nParticipants were randomly assigned to imagine their own behavior or the behavior of a random student in class (Jon). Half of the participants in each condition were randomly assigned to imagine that they (Jon) had tempted fate and the other half imagined that they (Jon) had not. We predicted that participants who imagined a student tempting fate would more easily call a pertinent negative outcome to mind and would therefore judge the negative outcome to be more likely compared with participants who did not imagine the student tempting fate. We predicted that this would be equally true for participants imagining their own actions or the actions of someone else."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

There was no effect for protagonist nor an interaction, Fs 1. Furthermore, looking just at judgments for the self, the results reveal that participants believed that they would be more likely to be called on by the professor when they had not done the reading (M 3.77, SD 2.43) than when they had done the reading (M 2.47, SD 2.19), t(58) 2.18, p .05, d 0.56. Because it is unlikely that participants want to be called on when they are unprepared, this suggests that the likelihood judgments reflect participants\u2019 beliefs about what is likely to occur, not their desires.\nTogether, the results of Studies 1 and 2 indicate that people believe that negative outcomes are more likely following behaviors that tempt fate. Participants thought that Jon was less likely to be accepted when he wore the T-shirt than when he stuffed it in his drawer and that it was more likely that students would be called on when they did not do the reading than when they did. Furthermore, because people believe that they themselves would suffer negative consequences if they tempted fate, this belief appears to reflect participants\u2019 intuitions about what would happen and not what they would like to see happen.\nStudy 3\nWe contend that the beliefs documented in Studies 1 and 2 are due to the fact that people know that a negative outcome that follows an action that tempts fate will be experienced as particularly negative. Because such an outcome would be so negative, it captures imagination and, having captured one\u2019s imagination, it becomes highly accessible. The negative outcome\u2019s enhanced accessibility, in turn, makes it seem especially likely (Kahneman, 2003; Kelly & Jacoby, 1998; Schwarz et al., 1991; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973).\nAs a first step in testing this account, we measured the accessibility of negative outcomes in Study 3. Participants read stories in which the protagonist did or did not tempt fate and then were asked to indicate as quickly as possible whether a one-sentence ending fit the story they just read or whether it constituted a non sequitur. To the extent that reading the story led participants to call to mind the subsequently presented ending, it should be highly accessible, and as a result, participants should be quick to indicate that it constituted a sensible ending to the story (Higgins, 1996;\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nNeely, 1977; Srull & Wyer, 1979).

As predicted, there was a significant negative correlation between participants\u2019 latency to indicate that the ending in question made sense and their rating of its likelihood (r .31, p .001), indicating that the faster a participant responded that the acceptance or rejection made sense, the more likely he or she believed the ending to be.\nWe contend that people believe that negative outcomes are more likely following actions that tempt fate because negative outcomes readily spring to mind under such circumstances, and their enhanced accessibility enhances their perceived likelihood. To test this claim, we used procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986) to assess mediation. For the sake of clarity, we will address the responses to the rejection and acceptance endings separately (see Figure 2).3\nRejection. As reported above, the tempting fate manipulation\u2014whether or not Jon wore the shirt\u2014significantly predicted participants\u2019 ratings of the likelihood that Jon would be rejected from Stanford (B 0.50, SE .22, p .05) and the latency to indicate that the rejection ending made sense (B 0.15, SE .05, p .01). In addition, the latency to indicate that the rejection made sense significantly predicted participants\u2019 ratings of his likelihood of being rejected (B 2.00, SE .66, p .01). Finally, when both Jon\u2019s choice to wear the shirt or stuff it in the drawer and participants\u2019 response times were included in the same equation predicting participants\u2019 likelihood judgments, the former dropped to nonsignificance and the latter remained significant (B 0.15, SE .25, p .54, and B 1.80, SE .74, p .05, respectively). The results of a Sobel (1982) test confirmed the significance of this mediated relation (z 1.96, p .05).\nAcceptance. The tempting fate manipulation\u2014whether or not Jon wore the shirt\u2014also significantly predicted participants\u2019 ratings of the likelihood that Jon would be accepted to Stanford (B 0.48, SE .20, p .05) and the latency to indicate that the acceptance ending made sense (B 0.10, SE .04, p .05). In addition, the latency to indicate that the acceptance ending made sense significantly predicted participants\u2019 ratings of his likelihood of being accepted (B 2.50, SE .64, p .001). Finally, when both Jon\u2019s choice to wear the shirt or stuff it in a drawer and participants\u2019 response times were included in the same equation predicting participants\u2019 likelihood judgments, the former dropped to nonsignificance and the latter remained significant (B 0.27, SE .20, p .17, and B 2.17, SE .67, p .01, respectively). The mediated relation was supported by a marginally significant Sobel (1982) test (z 1.91, p .057)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of Study 4 support our contention that actions that tempt fate are more likely to call to mind the prospect of a negative outcome than actions that do not tempt fate. This, in turn, increases the accessibility and perceived likelihood of such an outcome. First, participants thought that Jon was more likely to be rejected if he tempted fate than if he did not.\n3 We also tested for mediated moderation by pooling the rejection and acceptance data and using outcome (rejection or acceptance) as a moderator. We found that the moderator (outcome: rejection or acceptance) affected the magnitude of the treatment effect (behavior: wear or stuff shirt) on the mediator (response latency). In other words, participants who read that Jon tempted fate judged the rejection ending as more likely and the acceptance ending as less likely compared with those who read that he did not tempt fate because the idea of rejection was more accessible and the idea of acceptance was less accessible for those participants. This was supported by the procedures outlined by Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt (2005). First, we found that the outcome that participants evaluated moderated the effect of Jon\u2019s behavior on likelihood ratings (B 0.44, SE .16, p .01) and on response latency (B 0.38, SE .10, p .001). Second, participants\u2019 response latency significantly predicted likelihood ratings, regardless of ending (B 0.74, SE .15, p .001). Third, the moderating effect of outcome on behavior no longer predicted likelihood ratings when response latency was included in the regression equation (B 0.20, SE .16, p .20). Finally, the effect of response latency remained a significant predictor of likelihood ratings when the moderating effect of outcome on behavior was included in the regression equation (B 0.66, SE .161, p .001). For ease of exposition, we present the rejection and acceptance data separately in the main body of the text (i.e., we present the simple mediation at each level of the moderator).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nSecond, the reaction time data indicate that actions that tempt fate enhance the accessibility of negative outcomes only, not outcome-relevant knowledge in general. Third, and most important, participants\u2019 likelihood judgments were mediated by their speed to recognize that the ending in question made sense. Thus, it appears that the negative outcomes were judged to be more likely because they were more accessible.\nStudy 5\nWe contend that the effects observed in Studies 1\u20134 are the product of online computations of accessibility. That is, actions that tempt fate are considered likely to yield negative outcomes because such outcomes, being particularly aversive, leap to mind (i.e., become \u201cspontaneously accessible\u201d), and their resultant enhanced accessibility is used as a cue for judging likelihood. Thus, the belief that negative outcomes are likely to follow actions that tempt fate need not result from any \u201coff the shelf,\u201d preexisting, culturally shared belief about the hazards of tempting fate. Although such culturally shared beliefs can certainly contribute to the accessibility of negative outcomes when contemplating actions that tempt fate, they are not necessary to produce the effects we have documented here. (We discuss later how the very processes under investigation give rise to such culturally shared beliefs that, once formed, can enhance these processes, yielding a cyclical pattern of mutual influence.)\nStudy 5 was therefore designed to isolate the causal role of spontaneous (rather than retrieved) accessibility on likelihood judgments. We manipulated accessibility with a subliminal priming procedure, thereby moving beyond a demonstration of the relationship between accessibility and likelihood. We predicted that the subliminal prime would, under specifiable conditions, increase the accessibility of the pertinent negative outcome and thereby increase its perceived likelihood of occurrence. Note that this prediction entails that participants\u2019 likelihood judgments be constructed from the sense of accessibility constructed in the moment rather than retrieved from a stored belief.\nBecause negative outcomes spontaneously spring to mind when considering actions that tempt fate, we predicted that the negative outcome would be accessible (and be perceived as likely) for participants who read a tempting fate story, regardless of whether or not they were primed with a negative outcome. However, we predicted that the prime would increase the accessibility of a negative outcome (and therefore likelihood judgments) when participants read a story that did not involve an action that tempted fate. This predicted asymmetry would provide clear evidence that participants had processed the tempting fate story differently than the control story."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants.

However, once they advanced to the next screen, they were to determine as quickly and accurately as possible whether the onesentence ending was a logical conclusion to the story. After advancing (following the completion of each story), an asterisk was presented in the center of the screen for 150 ms to capture participants\u2019 attention and prepare them for the ending. Participants pressed the \u201cYes\u201d key if they believed that the ending made sense, however likely or unlikely it might seem to them, and pressed the \u201cNo\u201d key if they believed that the ending did not make sense (i.e., was a non sequitur).

Two fillers had endings that did not make sense and one had an ending that did make sense. The critical story involved a protagonist named Julie who heeded or ignored a forecast of rain by either bringing her umbrella when she packed her bag for the day or not (even though she had room in her bag). Thus, participants read either that Julie tempted fate by leaving herself vulnerable and ignoring the warning or that she did not tempt fate. After reading the umbrella story and being presented with the fixation point, half of participants who read each version were subliminally primed with the word \u201crain\u201d and half were subliminally primed with the letter string \u201ccois.\u201d The prime was presented for 24 ms and was masked by the story ending, which immediately followed. All participants then evaluated the negative ending, \u201cLater that day it starts to rain really hard, and Julie needs an umbrella.\u201d After determining whether the ending made sense, participants rated the likelihood that such an outcome would occur.\nNote that the negative outcome in this story (rain) was the forecasted outcome rather than an unforeseen or unusual outcome. (And, outside the context of the story, foul weather is not at all unusual for our participants, all of whom were residing in Ithaca, New York.) Thus, although negativity and rarity are often conflated, in this study we were able to isolate the tendency for a negative outcome to come to mind following an action that tempts fate.\nAfter participants finished reading the stories, they were probed to determine whether they had seen the subliminal prime. Participants were first asked to recall whether they had seen anything unusual presented during the study. They were then given a list of items (cois, ####, small, yes, no, kaeb, moon, rain, wrong) and asked to circle anything they recognized as being presented during the study that was not part of one of the stories or endings. In addition, participants were given a manipulation check to ensure that they had paid attention to the stories. The manipulation check consisted of one recall question for each of the stories.

In addition, to reduce within-group variance, we calculated each participant\u2019s average response time to the filler endings for which he or she responded correctly and included it as a covariate.\nA 2 (story: brought umbrella vs. didn\u2019t bring umbrella) 2 (prime: rain vs. cois) ANOVA of participants\u2019 response latencies revealed a main effect of story, F(1, 85) 9.43, p .01, and a significant interaction, F(1, 85) 5.89, p .05.5 As predicted, when participants were presented with a nonsense prime, those who read that Julie had tempted fate by not bringing her umbrella were faster to indicate that the negative ending made sense (M 2,694 ms, SD 876) compared with those who read that Julie had brought her umbrella (M 3,957 ms, SD 2,112), F(1, 43) 15.45, p .001, d 1.19. However, when the negative outcome was made accessible with the presentation of the subliminal \u201crain\u201d prime, the difference in response time disappeared (see Figure 3). In the rain prime condition, there was no difference between those who read the tempting fate story and those who read the story that did not tempt fate (M 2,749 ms, SD 971, and M 2,770 ms, SD 1,032, respectively), F 1.\nPut another way, we predicted that the rain prime would increase the accessibility (and hence decrease response latency) of the negative ending when fate had not been tempted in the story but would have little or no affect on accessibility when fate had been tempted because the negative ending would have already spontaneously come to mind. This hypothesis was tested with an ANOVA with the following contrast weights: No Tempting Fate\u2013 Control, 3; No Tempting Fate\u2013Rain, 1; Tempting Fate\u2013Control, 1; Tempting Fate\u2013Rain, 1. This analysis yielded a significant contrast, F(1, 86) 12.96, p .001. The residual was not significant, F(1, 86) 1.\nLikelihood. A 2 (story: brought umbrella vs. didn\u2019t bring umbrella) 2 (prime: rain vs. cois) ANOVA of participants\u2019 likelihood ratings yielded a marginally significant effect of prime, F(1, 86) 3.62, p .06, and no significant interaction. However, our specific hypothesis that the likelihood judgments would mirror the response latencies, such that the No Tempting Fate\u2013Control condition would stand out from the other three conditions (i.e., the rain prime would only increase the likelihood judgments of those who had not read that the protagonist tempted fate) was supported (see Figure 3). An ANOVA with the following contrast weights: No Tempting Fate\u2013Control, 3; No Tempting Fate\u2013Rain, 1; Tempting Fate\u2013Control, 1; Tempting Fate\u2013Rain, 1; yielded the predicted significant effect, F(1, 86) 3.94, p .05. Again, the residual was not significant, F(1, 86) 1.\nIn the control, nonsense prime condition, those who read that Julie had tempted fate by not bringing her umbrella thought that it was more likely to rain (M 6.96, SD 1.31) than did those who read that Julie had brought her umbrella (M 6.15, SD 1.46), t(44) 2.00, p .05, d 0.58. However, in the rain prime condition, there was no difference between those who read that Julie had brought her umbrella (M 7.11, SD 1.56) and those who read that she had failed to bring it (M 7.16, SD 1.41), t\n1. In other words, if the negative ending did not spring to mind because of the story (that is, when Julie did not tempt fate), the rain prime increased the accessibility of the negative ending (as described above) and also made that ending seem more likely.\nResponse time and likelihood. As predicted, there was a significant negative correlation between participants\u2019 latencies to indicate that the ending made sense and their likelihood ratings (r .34, p .001), indicating that the faster a participant responded that the rain ending made sense, the more likely he or she believed the ending to be.\nTo determine whether participants believed that the ending was more likely because it more easily came to mind, we again used the\n4 No participant recalled the presentation of the word \u201crain\u201d or \u201ccois\u201d without prompting. Although 14 participants (13.5%) claimed to recognize the presentation of the word \u201crain\u201d with prompting, we did not omit these participants for several reasons. First, 8 of the 14 who claimed to have seen \u201crain\u201d presented were in the \u201ccois\u201d condition and were not actually exposed to the subliminal prime of \u201crain.\u201d Second, 7 participants claimed to recognize the presentation of \u201cstars,\u201d 5 recognized \u201cno,\u201d 4 recognized \u201cyes,\u201d and 1 recognized \u201csmall\u201d (none of which were presented). Finally, when the data are analyzed with these participants excluded, the findings remain the same.\n5 Thirteen participants (5 from the No Tempting Fate\u2013Control, 7 from the No Tempting Fate\u2013Rain, and 1 from the Tempting Fate\u2013Rain conditions) answered incorrectly and were excluded from all analyses that involved the latency to determine whether the ending made sense. These participants were also excluded from the likelihood analyses because their pattern of data differed from those who understood that the ending made sense (i.e., even after being prompted with the likelihood rating, these participants still presumably believed that the ending did not make sense, claiming that it was especially unlikely across conditions).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nmediation analysis procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). The analysis was focused on our a priori contrast, that is, we examined the specific hypothesis that the rain prime would only affect responses to the story in which fate had not been tempted (because the negative ending would already be accessible for those who had read that Julie did not bring her umbrella). Thus, the condition in which Julie brought her umbrella and participants were primed with the nonsense string should stand out from the other three. To create the contrast, we dummy coded the No Tempting Fate\u2013Control condition as 3 and the other three conditions as 1. In addition, all regression equations that used the a priori contrast as a predictor controlled for the other two orthogonal contrasts (i.e., the contrasts 0, 2, 1, and 1, and 0, 0, 1, and 1).\nThe a priori contrast significantly predicted participants\u2019 ratings of the likelihood that it would rain (B 0.23, SE .09, p .05) and the latency to indicate that the rain ending made sense (B 0.22, SE .06, p .001). In addition, the latency to indicate that the rain ending made sense significantly predicted participants\u2019 ratings of the likelihood of it raining (B 0.51, SE .15, p .001). Finally, when both the contrast and participants\u2019 response latencies were included in the same equation predicting participants\u2019 likelihood judgments, the former dropped to nonsignificance and the latter remained significant (B 0.13, SE .09, p .16, and B 0.44, SE .16, p .01, respectively). The mediated relation was supported by a marginally significant Sobel (1982) test (z 1.88, p .06)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results of Study 5 lend further support to the role of accessibility as a determinant of people\u2019s belief that negative outcomes are especially likely following behaviors that tempt fate. In this study we directly manipulated accessibility and observed a corresponding influence on participants\u2019 assessments of likelihood\u2014but only among those participants for whom the negative outcome was not already highly accessible. That is, when participants were primed with a negative outcome after reading a story in which the protagonist had not tempted fate, the accessibility of the negative outcome increased to the level of accessibility among those participants who had read a story in which the protagonist had tempted fate. And, more important, the likelihood judgments of the primed participants matched those of the participants (primed or unprimed) who were exposed to a protagonist who had tempted fate. These results support our contention that the heightened accessibility of negative outcomes that results from contemplating actions that tempt fate is constructed on the spot and need not be retrieved from a culturally shared belief. Although the feeling that something bad is likely to happen if one tempts fate may be aided and abetted by such culturally shared beliefs, the results of this study suggest that such feelings do not depend on them.\nNote that before providing likelihood ratings in Studies 4 and 5, participants judged whether an outcome made sense by pressing \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as quickly as possible. One might be concerned that participants\u2019 likelihood judgments may have been contaminated by this procedure. That is, the bodily feedback participants received as they pressed either quickly or slowly may have influenced their likelihood judgments. Participants may have thought the negative\noutcomes were especially likely because their fast physical response made them realize, either implicitly or explicitly, that the outcome had jumped to mind\u2014something they would not have realized otherwise.\nTo examine this possibility, we ran a follow-up study that manipulated accessibility but did not measure it. In other words, after reading that Julie either did or did not tempt fate, and after having been subliminally primed with either \u201crain\u201d or a nonsense string, participants immediately rated the likelihood of the ending, \u201cAs Julie is walking to class later that afternoon, it suddenly starts to rain.\u201d The contrast, which tested whether the No Tempting Fate\u2013Control condition differed from the other three conditions (i.e., the rain prime would only increase the likelihood judgments of those participants who had not read that the protagonist tempted fate) was significant, F(1, 121) 7.65, p .01. Participants primed with a neutral string thought the negative outcome was more likely if the protagonist had tempted fate (M 7.71) than if she had not (M 6.85), t(62) 2.74, p .01, but the effect was eliminated if the negative outcome had been made accessible by the rain prime (Ms 7.53 and 7.35, t 1). Because participants did not have any physical feedback, it appears that it is the mental rather than physical experience of accessibility that is used as a cue for judging likelihood. Thus, even when participants did not indicate whether the ending made sense, the manipulation of accessibility had a predictable effect on likelihood judgments.\nStudy 6\nThe psychological processes that give rise to the effects we have documented (i.e., the mind\u2019s tendency to seize on negative prospects and the link between imagination and subjective likelihood) combine to produce a gut feeling that to tempt fate is to invite remorse\u2014indeed, to make remorse more likely. But for many people, such a gut feeling conflicts with their more rational, deliberative thoughts on the matter. Thus, people\u2019s belief that the universe will punish those who tempt fate may be best understood from a dual-process or two-systems perspective (Chaiken & Trope, 1999). The intuitive system believes and the rational system does not.\nIn recent years, many psychologists have put forward various dual-process accounts of everyday cognition. Each of these dualprocess accounts involves the idea that there is one set of mental processes that operates quickly and effortlessly and another that operates in a deliberate and effortful manner. Although some dual-process models suggest that the two sets of mental processes work in parallel and others suggest that the deliberate processing is saved for consequential judgments, both types posit that one set of mental processes or the other can dominate at any given time, and that whichever set is dominant will have implications for an individual\u2019s response (Windschitl & Wells, 1996).\nAmong those who champion the idea that the two systems work in parallel, the quick and effortless set of mental processes is often referred to simply as System 1 (Stanovich & West, 2002). System 1 renders quick, holistic judgments that are typically based on associative connections. The products of System 1 are often evaluative in nature and are responsible for our quick affective reactions to stimuli. The quick, associative output of System 1 is often sufficient to guide effective action. Occasionally, however, the output of System 1 needs to be supplemented or corrected.

Participants used accessibility as a cue to frequency and therefore gave higher estimates of the likelihood of negative outcomes following the behaviors that tempted fate. Although it is true that common events tend to come to mind easily, this does not logically imply that events that come to mind easily are common. However, an associative system has trouble with this distinction, having simply learned\u2014and represented\u2014that common events \u201cgo with\u201d events that come to mind easily.\nAlthough participants relied on accessibility to a large extent when they made their likelihood judgments, they had the opportunity to override the accessibility-based output with deliberative, rule-based processing. It seems reasonable to assume that college students, who take pride in being intelligent and rational, tried to ignore the fact that Jon jinxed himself or that Julie didn\u2019t bring her umbrella when they judged the likelihood of Jon being rejected or Julie getting caught in the rain because they \u201cknew logically\u201d that the behavior would not influence the likelihood of the outcomes. Because they had as much time as necessary to rate the likelihood of the outcomes, it is probable that some participants were able to override System 1 processing to some extent.\nIn Study 6, the opportunity to override accessibility-based output was manipulated. Half of the participants were under cognitive load, making it more difficult for them to override System 1 output with rule-based processing. We predicted that the typical effect of a tempting fate behavior on participants\u2019 likelihood judgments would be even greater when participants were under load, resulting in an interaction between behavior and load. In other words, when participants\u2019 ability to deliberate was diminished, we hypothesized that System 1\u2019s accessibility cue would not be corrected and would therefore lead to an even greater difference in likelihood judgments compared with participants not under load."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants. One hundred twenty-two Cornell undergraduates completed a packet of unrelated questionnaires in exchange for course credit in psychology or human development courses.\nMaterials and procedure. In the one pertinent questionnaire, participants read one of the self-scenarios from Study 2, which asked them to imagine themselves in a large lecture and to imagine that the professor is planning to call on a student because no one has volunteered to answer the question. Participants either read that they have done the reading for class or that they have not done the reading for class. Half of the participants who read each scenario were under cognitive load. While reading the story and answering the likelihood question, participants under load were required to count backwards by 3s, starting with 564. Participants indicated how likely they believed it was that they would be called on by circling a number between 0 and 10, anchored at 0 with not at all likely and at 10 with extremely likely. After answering the question, participants under load were told to stop counting and to\nreport the number on which they ended on. They also indicated how much effort they put into the two tasks by circling a number between 0 and 6, anchored at 0 with I put all my effort into reading and at 6 with I put all my effort into counting."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Two participants who were under load (one imagined having done the reading and one imagined not having done the reading) were excluded from analysis because they ended on a number less than 3 away from their starting number (561 and 563), suggesting that they did not count backwards while they read the story. This was confirmed by the manipulation check, on which both participants reported putting all of their effort into reading the story. The remaining 120 participants were split evenly among the four conditions.\nA 2 (behavior: had read vs. had not read) 2 (load: yes vs. no) ANOVA revealed main effects for reading, F(1, 116) 22.88, p .001, and for load, F(1, 116) 17.34, p .001. The main effects were qualified by the predicted interaction, however, F(1, 116) 4.15, p .05. In other words, when participants were not under load, those who imagined that they had not done the reading believed that it was more likely that they would be called on (M 2.93, SD 2.16) than participants who imagined that they had done the reading (M 1.90, SD 1.42), t(58) 2.19, p .05, d 0.58. This pair-wise comparison replicated the results of Study 2. The effect of not doing the reading versus doing the reading was significantly greater when participants were under load, however (see Figure 4). When participants were under load, those who imagined that they had not done the reading believed that it was even more likely that they would be called on (M 5.27, SD 2.36) compared with participants who imagined that they had done the reading (M 2.70, SD 2.17), t(58) 4.38, p .001, d 1.15.

This finding lends further support to the claim that the elevated perception of likelihood is due to System 1, associationbased processing. After all, if cognitive load had interfered with the tendency to judge negative outcomes as more likely, then it would have suggested that the effect requires effortful processing. In contrast, these results suggest that the effect is at a maximum when effortful processing is at a minimum.\nWe suggest that System 1 processing is always at work. In other words, people spontaneously imagine negative outcomes and therefore feel those outcomes are more accessible and likely. The extent to which people\u2019s reported likelihood judgments match their feeling of accessibility will depend on the extent to which System 2 processing overrides the use of accessibility as a cue for likelihood. In Studies 3 and 4, participants had the capacity for effortful processing, and the relationship between accessibility and perceived likelihood was found to be moderately strong (Study 4: r .31, p .001, and Study 5: r .34, p .001). If accessibility had been measured while participants were under load in Study 6, it is likely that the relationship would have been even stronger because a deliberate, rule-based analysis was not available to override the cue of accessibility. If accessibility were measured when participants were made especially accountable for their likelihood judgments, however, it is likely that the relationship would be weaker because System 2 would probably be more engaged (Tetlock, 1992). We have found in our past work, furthermore, that we can diminish the intuitive belief in tempting fate by instructing participants to respond rationally (Risen & Gilovich, 2007). We argue that this was due to participants engaging the deliberate, correction processes of System 2. Thus, cues that prompt rational thinking (e.g., explicit instructions to respond rationally; the use of percentage scales) should weaken the relationship between accessibility and likelihood judgments.\nGeneral Discussion\nDespite explicit knowledge that tempting fate does not change the likelihood of a broad range of negative outcomes, participants gave responses that reflected the intuitive belief that it does. Thus, even if they rationally recognized that there is no mechanism to make rain more likely when they leave behind an umbrella or rejection more likely when they wear one shirt rather than another, participants reported that they thought these particular negative outcomes were indeed more likely following such actions. Elsewhere we have shown that these beliefs apply to real events in the here-and-now of experience and not just to hypothetical scenarios, and that they are sufficiently powerful to influence behavior with financial consequences (Risen & Gilovich, 2007; Risen et al., 2007).\nAlthough most traditional accounts of superstition maintain that such beliefs exist because people lack certain cognitive capacities (Frazer, 1922; Levy-Bruhl, 1926; Piaget, 1929; Tylor, 1873), the work presented here adds to accumulating evidence of magical thinking on the part of people who, according to traditional accounts, should not hold such beliefs (Gilovich & Savitsky, 2002; Nemeroff & Rozin, 1989; Pronin, Wegner, Rodriguez, & Mc-\nCarthy, 2006; Rozin, Millman, & Nemeroff, 1986; Rozin & Nemeroff, 1990; Rozin & Nemeroff, 2002). Whereas previous research has highlighted the role of the representativeness and affect heuristics in such beliefs, our work indicates that they may also arise from a reliance on the availability heuristic and the tendency for negative stimuli to grab attention."}, {"heading": "The Role of Negativity in the Belief in Tempting Fate", "text": "Why are negative outcomes that follow actions that tempt fate thought to be particularly aversive? In some cases, the outcomes are materially worse, as when one is called on, unprepared, for class or one does not have an umbrella during a storm. In many other cases, the outcomes are psychologically worse, as when one fails to win a lottery after trading in the winning ticket or falls short at an important task after presumptuously boasting. In these latter cases, the outcomes are more painful because, in addition to whatever pain is experienced from the loss or failure itself, there is an additional dose of humiliation and regret. People anticipate that they will be tormented by counterfactual thoughts (\u201cWhy did I have to say that?\u201d \u201cDo that? \u201cWear that?\u201d) and anticipate that they might have difficulty getting past the painful outcome and the action that led to it. Note that the prospect of negative outcomes such as these would tend to capture imagination even if one does not have personal experience with having tempted fate in a given domain. To anticipate how bad it would feel to be rejected from graduate school after wearing that school\u2019s shirt, one needn\u2019t have gone through a similar, previous experience. One can simply imagine doing so.\nBecause negative outcomes are especially accessible and seem especially likely when people consider tempting fate, it is not surprising that they live by the shared rule that fate shouldn\u2019t be tempted. The very existence of such a shared rule, in turn, makes the prospect of negative outcomes following actions that tempt fate even more aversive. To suffer a bad fate after flouting conventional wisdom and prevailing norms is especially painful because of the additional regret and embarrassment one feels for having unwisely gone out on a limb. Bee stings hurt, but an individual is likely to feel particularly badly about having been stung if he or she had taunted a hive because the pain of the sting would be accompanied by the regret of having taken such an action. Moreover, such an individual would feel even worse if taunting beehives is generally considered an action that tempts fate because everyone (including the rash individual with the stick) would know that by disobeying a shared rule, he or she somehow \u201cdeserved\u201d the punishment. This enhanced negativity makes the prospect of getting stung even more accessible and subjectively more likely, which reinforces the convention that one shouldn\u2019t tempt fate (or bees). This mutually reinforcing dynamic helps to account for one of the most noteworthy features of superstitions\u2014their often quite arbitrary nature. Once a given superstition gains some acceptance in a social group, no matter how arbitrary (don\u2019t walk under a ladder, don\u2019t comment on success), the thought of flaunting it makes the prospect of a negative outcome seem especially negative and, by the processes we have outlined here, especially likely.\nBecause the processes of negativity and accessibility serve to build on the shared, stored belief about the hazards of tempting fate, might the elevated likelihood judgments we have observed been simply taken \u201coff the shelf\u201d and not computed \u201con the fly\u201d as\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nwe have maintained? In other words, do negative outcomes seem especially likely following actions that tempt fate because of previously stored information (i.e., shared cultural rules)? Or does disaster seem especially likely because negative outcomes are generated the moment that one entertains the notion of tempting fate? We have suggested that cultural rules about tempting fate contribute to elevated likelihood beliefs primarily by enhancing the negativity of the imagined outcome. Previously stored information may also contribute to elevated likelihood beliefs by directly enhancing the accessibility of certain scripts. However, the current work indicates that such assessments are also generated on the fly as one contemplates the possibility of tempting fate because of the link between imagination, accessibility, and subjective likelihood."}, {"heading": "The Role of Accessibility in the Belief in Tempting Fate", "text": "The results of Studies 3 and 4 indicate that negative outcomes are indeed more accessible following behaviors that tempt fate and that accessibility mediates judgments of likelihood. Study 5 examined the impact of experimentally induced accessibility and found that likelihood judgments were influenced by the heightened online experience of accessibility. Thus, enhanced likelihood judgments are not only the product of preexisting associations that make a given outcome spring to mind, but also of online constructions that make such an outcome spring to mind in the moment.\nAlthough past research has shown that imagining an event elevates the subjective likelihood that it will occur (Carroll, 1978; Gregory et al., 1982; Sherman et al., 1985), and it has been suggested that this occurs because imagination heightens the feeling of accessibility, to our knowledge this line of work is the first to empirically demonstrate that accessibility is used as a basis for predicting the likelihood of specific outcomes (see also Risen & Gilovich, 2007). When a specific outcome jumped to mind, participants believed it was especially likely. These results add to a growing list of judgments that are influenced by feelings of accessibility\u2014e.g., trait inference (Schwarz et al., 1991), memory for past events (Kelly & Jacoby, 1998), category membership (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), and the probability of general outcomes (i.e., what is more probable, dying in a car accident or in a plane crash? Tversky & Kahneman, 1973)."}, {"heading": "An Automatic, Intuitive Belief in Tempting Fate", "text": "Two pieces of evidence support our contention that the belief that it is bad luck to tempt fate arises from automatic, associative processes characteristic of System 1. First, the results of Study 6 demonstrate that the processes underlying the belief do not require much in the way of cognitive resources. The belief that it is bad luck to tempt fate was exacerbated when participants were under cognitive load, suggesting that the processes responsible for the belief are automatic (Bargh, 1994; Gilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1988). Second, we have shown elsewhere that participants who were asked to rely on their \u201cgut feelings\u201d reported that exchanging a lottery ticket would make a negative outcome more likely. Those who were asked to rely on their \u201crational thoughts,\u201d however, were much less likely to report such a belief (Risen & Gilovich, 2007)."}, {"heading": "What Actions Tempt Fate?", "text": "The behaviors examined in the current set of studies (presumptuously wearing a shirt, failing to do assigned reading, and not bringing an umbrella when rain is expected) are manifestations of needless risk and hubris. Are these essential elements of behaviors that are believed to tempt fate? As a first step in addressing that question, we had participants sort 50 randomly selected newspaper articles that used the term \u201ctempting fate\u201d (Risen & Gilovich, 2008). Hierarchical cluster analysis mapped the underlying structure of how participants thought the term was used and yielded an initial split in the hierarchical organization between unnecessary risk taking and hubris. Actions tend to be seen as involving unnecessary risk when they depart from one\u2019s typical behavior, from a prevailing norm (such as a socially shared superstition), or from a state of physical safety (as when one attempts to \u201ccheat death\u201d). When such actions go awry, they tend to give rise to tormenting counterfactual thoughts and feelings of regret and embarrassment (Gilbert, Morewedge, Risen, & Wilson, 2004; Gilovich & Medvec, 1994, 1995; Hetts, Boninger, Armor, Gleicher, & Nathanson, 2000). Acts of hubris, which are departures from the norm in their own right, a norm of modesty and acceptance of limitations, give rise to the same tortured thoughts and the same counterfactual emotions when they go awry.\nBecause counterfactuals and feelings of regret are most likely to arise when the negative outcome \u201cfits the crime,\u201d people are much more likely to call to mind a negative outcome that matches the action that tempts fate than they are to imagine unrelated negative outcomes. For example, getting caught in a rainstorm is unlikely to spring to mind and be seen as likely to occur when Jon presumptuously wears a Stanford T-shirt. Conversely, because the sting of rejection is not intensified by failing to carry an umbrella, people are unlikely to predict Jon\u2019s rejection from Stanford if he decides not to bring an umbrella. To be sure, once one negative outcome springs to mind, others may become more accessible and thus seem more likely. However, we suggest that the greatest effect will be for negative outcomes that match the behavior in question, which is why the universe seems interested not only in punishing certain behaviors but in punishing them a certain, ironic way.\nDoes it matter who commits the action that is seen as tempting fate? Can one\u2019s fate be tempted by someone else? One might expect that an outcome is only experienced as more aversive if one comments on a streak of success oneself, exchanges one\u2019s own lottery ticket, or expresses overconfidence about one\u2019s own outcomes. After all, only then is one likely to kick oneself for what is experienced as an unwise action. But we have found that people believe that commenting on success is likely to jinx a run of good fortune even when someone else calls attention to the streak and that their chances to win a lottery are diminished even when it is their partner who exchanges their original tickets (Risen & Gilovich, 2007; Risen et al., 2007).\nNote that the outcomes in such cases are seen as especially aversive even when someone else does the tempting. A streak that comes to an end is likely to be experienced as particularly irksome even when someone else had commented on it because there are still plenty of counterfactual thoughts that are elicited when the streak has been made salient (\u201cWhy did she have to say that?\u201d). And, if overconfidence is expressed on someone else\u2019s behalf (\u201cOf course you\u2019re going to get into Stanford. You\u2019re going to get in\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\neverywhere!\u201d) rejection is likely to feel worse even if it was not one\u2019s own confidence that was misplaced. Thus, one person\u2019s actions can influence another person\u2019s counterfactual thoughts and make the latter\u2019s negative outcome more aversive. And such actions, it appears, are seen to increase the chance of a negative result.\nSocietal Influence\nThe needs and goals of society surely play a role in maintaining shared beliefs that associate hubris, greed, and other instances of tempting fate with negative outcomes. Groups stand to benefit from mutual constraints against selfishness and rash action on the part of their members. These constraints can come in the form of legal sanctions, but they may be more effectively and efficiently enforced through social norms and shared beliefs. If people believe that certain behaviors (that are not in the group\u2019s interest) will tempt fate and draw punishment from the cosmos, they are less likely to engage in them. Thus, if society\u2019s members believe\u2014 either explicitly or implicitly\u2014in an intentional, value-laden universe, it may encourage them to behave in a manner that promotes the shared values of society.\nAlthough some societies and cultures stress the role of supernatural agents more than others (Atran, 2002; Boyer, 2001), we want to emphasize that the beliefs we have investigated are by no means absent in populations in which notions of fate and the intervention of supernatural agents are not well articulated. The present data, involving the responses of Western-educated college students, make that clear. People in different cultures, regardless of their explicit beliefs, do not much differ in the tendency for negative outcomes to jump to mind and in the use of accessibility as a cue for judging likelihood. Instead, cultures are more likely to differ in their access to and reliance on abstract rules that override such automatic associations and assessments (Denes-Raj & Epstein, 1994; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich, 1999). Thus, members of some cultures fully believe that it is bad luck to tempt fate. Members of other cultures intuitively believe it (and often behave accordingly) but simultaneously know that the belief is not rational.\nBeyond differences in the explicit endorsement of supernatural influence, cultures also vary in how fate, God, and supernatural agents are assumed to operate. Dennett\u2019s (1987) distinction between the intentional stance and design stance has been used to classify cultural views toward the supernatural. When taking an intentional stance, one treats the supernatural like a person\u2014as though it has intentions, emotions, and goals. In the JudeoChristian tradition, for example, the central supernatural agent is a person-like God who can be merciful or vengeful at will. When taking a design stance, in contrast, one reacts as if the supernatural is a device or system. In the Hindu tradition, for example, there are many deities, but they must follow the laws of karma and operate within a higher system (Young & Morris, 2004).\nSome researchers advocate a strong cultural position whereby an intentional stance is necessary for the belief that misfortune will follow actions that tempt fate (Young & Morris, 2004). They argue that the conviction arises from people believing that their actions can offend a person-like supernatural agent who punishes reprehensible behavior. This strong position rests on the assumption that cultures can be unambiguously divided into those that view the\nuniverse as an intentional agent and those that view it as a system. But it is not clear that they can. The pervasive human tendency to anthropomorphize suggests that even those in a culture with a design stance are likely to perceive some intentionality in the actions of the prevailing system. And there certainly are systemlike regularities present in the Judeo-Christian worldview. In fact, we suggest that notions of tempting fate may exemplify the existence of design-stance thinking in cultures that primarily take an intentional stance. If participants in our subject pool were asked why they are more likely to be called on when they fail to do the reading, we predict that they would be more likely to invoke design stance language to explain their judgment (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s just how things work\u201d) than intentional stance language (\u201cGod/the universe wants to punish me\u201d).\nA weaker cultural position posits that the belief in tempting fate is culturally embedded and that an intentional stance is one aspect of cultural influence that may impact the belief. This position, while hardly controversial, nonetheless raises some interesting questions. For example, because karma works across lifetimes in the Hindu, design-stance worldview, and within lifetimes in the Judeo-Christian, intentional worldview, do behaviors that tempt fate prompt different negative outcomes to spring to mind in the two cultures? That is, do Hindus tend to think of long-term negative consequences (e.g., losing status in the next life) of tempting fate rather than the immediate negative consequences that sprang to mind for our participants? And are the behaviors that are believed to invite bad luck (e.g., hubris and needless risk) universal or do they vary by culture?"}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The studies presented here document a widespread belief that it is bad luck to tempt fate, even among those who would deny the existence of fate. So what happens when people believe things they know are false? They do their class reading, bring their umbrellas, hold onto their lottery tickets, and (try to) avoid boasting or presuming anything too soon. And when they don\u2019t follow their intuition, they think about how they might be punished. All the while, they shake their heads and roll their eyes, knowing that their behavior and worries are unwarranted.\nReferences\nAtran, S. (2002).

Stanovich University of Toronto\nRichard F. West James Madison University\nIn 7 different studies, the authors observed that a large number of thinking biases are uncorrelated with cognitive ability. These thinking biases include some of the most classic and well-studied biases in the heuristics and biases literature, including the conjunction effect, framing effects, anchoring effects, outcome bias, base-rate neglect, \u201cless is more\u201d effects, affect biases, omission bias, myside bias, sunk-cost effect, and certainty effects that violate the axioms of expected utility theory. In a further experiment, the authors nonetheless showed that cognitive ability does correlate with the tendency to avoid some rational thinking biases, specifically the tendency to display denominator neglect, probability matching rather than maximizing, belief bias, and matching bias on the 4-card selection task. The authors present a framework for predicting when cognitive ability will and will not correlate with a rational thinking tendency.\nKeywords: thinking biases, heuristics and biases, intelligence, cognitive ability\nIn psychology and among the lay public alike, assessments of intelligence and tests of cognitive ability are taken to be the sine qua non of good thinking. Critics of these instruments often point out that IQ tests fail to assess many domains of psychological functioning that are essential. For example, many largely noncognitive domains such as socioemotional abilities, creativity, empathy, and interpersonal skills are almost entirely unassessed by tests of cognitive ability. However, even these standard critiques of intelligence tests often contain the unstated assumption that although intelligence tests miss certain key noncognitive areas, they encompass most of what is important cognitively. In this article, we attempt to explore this assumption by examining whether measures of cognitive ability ignore important aspects of thinking itself.\nA prime candidate for a cognitive domain not assessed by tests of intelligence would seem to be the domain of thinking biases. The study of heuristics and biases has been an active topic in cognitive psychology for over 3 decades now (Gilovich, Griffin, & Kahneman, 2002; Kahneman & Tversky, 1973, 1996, 2000; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974, 1983, 1986). Many of these thinking biases relate to issues of rationality rather than to cognitive capacity (see Over, 2004; Samuels & Stich, 2004; Shafir & LeBoeuf,\n2002; Stanovich, 1999, 2004), and individual differences in their operation remain unassessed on IQ tests.\nHowever, there may be reasons for expecting a relationship between cognitive ability and individual differences in the operation of thinking biases even if the latter are not directly assessed on intelligence tests. This follows from the fact that theorizing in the heuristics and biases literature has emphasized dual-process models of cognition (Evans, 2003, 2006, 2007; Kahneman, 2000, 2003; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002, 2005; Sloman, 1996; Stanovich, 1999, 2004). Such models embody the assumption that thinking biases are universal properties of a heuristic system that operates autonomously (called System 1 in dual-process theory; see Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich, 1999). Nonetheless, although the presence of thinking biases might be universal, their ability to result in nonnormative choices varies from individual to individual because heuristic responses are sometimes overridden by a nonautonomous analytic system of thought (called System 2 in dual-process theory). The computational power needed to override a heuristically primed response and/or the ability to recognize the need to override might be related to intelligence, thus creating a (negative) relationship between biased responding and cognitive ability even though thinking biases are not directly assessed on IQ tests.\nSome research has indicated that cognitive ability is modestly related to performance on several tasks from the heuristics and biases literature. Stanovich and West (1997, 1998c, 1998d, 1999, 2000; see also Kokis, Macpherson, Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2002; Sa\u0301, West, & Stanovich, 1999; Toplak & Stanovich, 2002) found correlations with cognitive ability to be roughly (in absolute magnitude) .35\u2013.45 for belief bias in syllogistic reasoning, in the range of .25\u2013.35 for various probabilistic reasoning tasks, in the range of .20\u2013.25 for various covariation detection and hypothesis Keith E.

All correlations were in the expected direction, and all were from studies with 100 participants. Other investigators have found relationships of a similar effect size between cognitive ability and a variety of tasks in the heuristics and biases literature (Bruine de Bruin, Parker, & Fischhoff, 2007; DeShon, Smith, Chan, & Schmitt, 1998; Handley, Capon, Beveridge, Dennis, & Evans, 2004; Klaczynski & Lavallee, 2005; Newstead, Handley, Harley, Wright, & Farrelly, 2004; Parker & Fischhoff, 2005; Perkins & Ritchhart, 2004; Valentine, 1975).\nIn a commentary on this research on individual differences, Kahneman (2000) pointed out that the correlations observed may well have been inflated because most of the relevant studies used within-subjects designs, which contain cues signalling the necessity of heuristic system override (Bartels, 2006; Fischhoff, Slovic, & Lichtenstein, 1979; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Kahneman & Tversky, 1982a; Shafir, 1998). He argued that between-subjects tests of the coherence of responses represent a much stricter criterion and perhaps a more appropriate one because \u201cmuch of life resembles a between-subjects experiment\u201d (Kahneman, 2000, p. 682).\nThat the mental factors operative in within-subjects designs might be different from those operative in between-subjects designs suggests that the individual difference factors associated with biased processing in the two different paradigms might also vary. LeBoeuf and Shafir (2003) have produced some data indicating that biases that are assessed within-subjects display different relationships with individual difference variables than biases assessed between-subjects. They found that various framing effects were associated with the need for cognition thinking disposition (see Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, & Jarvis, 1996) when evaluated on a within-subjects basis but were independent of need for cognition when framing was assessed between subjects.\nWe know little about the relation between cognitive ability and the tendency to make coherent judgments in between-subjects situations. Thus, Kahneman\u2019s (2000; see also Kahneman & Frederick, 2002) conjecture that these less transparent designs would reduce the observed relationships between cognitive ability and the judgmental biases mentioned above remains virtually untested. In the present experiments, we examined a variety of effects from the heuristics and biases literature to see if cognitive ability was associated with these biases as they are displayed in betweensubjects paradigms. In the first experiment, we examined some biases and effects that are among the oldest in the literature (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972, 1973; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973, 1974, 1983): base-rate neglect, framing effects, conjunction effects, anchoring biases, and outcome bias.\nExperiment 1: Classic Heuristics and Biases Effects\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The participants were 434 undergraduate students (102 men and 332 women) recruited through an introductory psychology subject\npool at a medium-sized state university in the United States.

The participants were randomly assigned to Form A (216 participants) and Form B (218 participants)."}, {"heading": "Experimental Tasks", "text": "Base-rate problem. Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s (1973) muchstudied lawyer/engineer problem was employed as a probe of the degree of base-rate usage. The two versions were identical except that the base rates given for the engineers and lawyers were switched as a between-subjects variable (30 engineers and 70 lawyers in Form A and 70 engineers and 30 lawyers in Form B). Both groups responded by estimating the probability that the focal individual was one of the engineers.\nFraming problem (Asian disease). This item was based on Tversky and Kahneman\u2019s (1981) famous disease problem. The positive (gain) and negative (loss) framing of the problem was a between-subjects manipulation (Form A was the gain frame and Form B was the loss frame). Both groups of participants chose a response on the following scale: \u201cI strongly favor program A\u201d (1); \u201cI favor program A\u201d (2); \u201cI slightly favor program A\u201d (3); \u201cI slightly favor program B\u201d (4); \u201cI favor program B\u201d (5); \u201cI strongly favor program B\u201d (6). Higher scored responses represented more risk seeking.\nConjunction problem. This problem was based on Tversky and Kahneman\u2019s (1983) much-studied Linda problem. Participants read the following: \u201cLinda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.\u201d\nParticipants then used a 6-point scale (1 extremely improbable, 2 very improbable, 3 somewhat probable, 4 moderately probable, 5 very probable, 6 extremely probable) to indicate the relative probability of three statements that described Linda. The first two statements were identical for the two groups of participants as follows: 1) It is ______ that Linda is a teacher in an elementary school; 2) It is ______ that Linda works in a bookstore and takes Yoga classes. Each group then read one of two statements that differed in whether they did or did not contain a conjunction of two descriptions. Participants getting Form A read the following: 3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller. Participants getting Form B read the following: 3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.\nOutcome bias. Our measure of outcome bias derived from a problem investigated by Baron and Hershey (1988). Participants receiving Form A read the positive outcome version involving a 55-year-old man who had a heart condition and whose operation succeeded. Participants evaluated the physician\u2019s decision to go ahead with the operation (1 incorrect, a very bad decision; 2 incorrect, all things considered; 3 incorrect, but not unreasonable; 4 the decision and its opposite are equally good; 5 correct, but the opposite would be reasonable too; 6 correct, all things considered; 7 clearly correct, an excellent decision).\nParticipants receiving Form B (negative outcome) evaluated a medical decision that was designed to be objectively better than the first: 2% chance of death rather than 8%; 10-year increase in life expectancy versus 5-year increase, etc. However, it had an unfortunate negative outcome\u2014death of the patient.\nAnchoring and adjustment problems. The two problems used here were adapted from an anchoring and adjustment problem in Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and one used by Epley and Gilovich (2004). Prior to making an estimation of a particular value, participants answered a question containing a small or large anchor value. The Form A version is given below, with the Form B value in brackets:\n1. Do you think there are more or less than 65 [12] African countries in the United Nations?

The mean reported verbal SAT score of the students was 577 (SD 68), the mean reported mathematical SAT score was 572 (SD 69), and the mean total SAT score was 1149 (SD 110). The institution-wide averages for this university in 2006 were 565, 575, and 1140, respectively. Several studies have indicated that the correlation between self-reported SATs and verified SAT scores is in the range of .80 to .92 (Cassady, 2001; Kuncel, Crede, & Thomas, 2005; Noftle & Robins, 2007) as is the correlation between selfreported and verified grade-point average (Higgins, Peterson, Pihl, & Lee, 2007). An indication of the validity of the self-reported scores is that they correlated with a third variable to the same extent as verified scores. Stanovich and West (1998c) found that the correlation between a vocabulary test and self-reported SAT total scores (.49) was quite similar to the .51 correlation between the vocabulary test and verified total SAT scores in a previous investigation that used the same vocabulary measure (West & Stanovich, 1991). These indications of validity are perhaps consistent with the fact that participation in these experiments represents a low-stakes, anonymous situation in which participants have little reason to misrepresent their SAT scores (in contrast to a more high-stakes situation where a job or some other benefit may be on the line).\nThe total SAT score was used as an index of cognitive ability in the analyses reported here because it loads highly on psychometric g (Frey & Detterman, 2004; Unsworth & Engle, 2007). For the purposes of some of the analyses described below, the 206 students with SAT scores below the median (1150) were assigned to the low-SAT group, and the 228 remaining students were assigned to the high-SAT group. Parallel analyses that are fully continuous and that did not involve partitioning the sample are also reported.1\nOne caveat concerning the associations in these studies relates to the restriction of range in our sample. Certainly, it is true that individuals with average and above average cognitive ability are overrepresented in samples composed entirely of university students. Nevertheless, the actual range in cognitive ability found among college students in the United States is quite large. In the past 30 years, the percentage of 25- to 29-years-olds in the United States who have attended college has increased by 50%. By 2002, 58% of these young adults had completed at least 1 or more years of college, and 29% had received at least a bachelor\u2019s degree (U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 2003). However, the restriction of range in cognitive ability is somewhat greater in our sample because our participants attended a moderately selective state university. The SAT total means of our samples are roughly .60 of a standard deviation above the national mean of 1021 (College Board, 2006). The standard deviation of the distribution of scores in our sample is roughly .55\u2013.70 of the standard deviation in the nationally representative sample."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Table 1 displays, for each of the experimental tasks, the mean response as a function of Form (A vs. B) and cognitive ability group (low vs. high SAT). The table also contains, for each of the experimental tasks, an analysis that examines whether the magnitude of the effect or bias demonstrated by the task was moderated by cognitive ability. This was done by examining, in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) context, whether the effect of form interacted with SAT group.\nThe first analysis indicated that there was a significant base-rate effect on the engineer/lawyer problem, F(1, 430) 35.93, MSE 472.2, p .001. The mean probability that Jack was one of the engineers was lower in the 30% base-rate condition (60.8% for the entire sample) than the mean probability that Jack was one of the engineers in the 70% base-rate condition (73.4% for the entire sample). However, the effect of base rate failed to interact with cognitive ability, as the Form SAT Group interaction was not significant, F(1, 430) 1.30, MSE 472.2. To the extent that there is any hint of an interaction in the means, it is in the opposite direction from the expected finding. The low-SAT group was slightly more sensitive to base rates than was the high-SAT group.\nThe next task displayed in Table 1 is the disease framing task, and it is clear that both groups displayed the expected framing effect on this problem\u2014the loss frame (Form B) resulted in a greater preference for the risky option. The main effect of frame type (form) was highly significant, F(1, 430) 50.98, MSE 1.37, p .001. However, the effect of frame type failed to interact with cognitive ability, as the Form SAT Group interaction was not significant, F(1, 430) 1.48, MSE 1.37. To the extent there\n1 Separate analyses involving the verbal SAT (SAT\u2013V) and the mathematical SAT (SAT\u2013M) score were conducted in parallel to all of the analyses in this article that employ the SAT total score. Across the studies, there were few differences between the analyses of the total score and those employing either of the components, but those that did occur are listed in this footnote. In Experiment 1, the interaction involving the conjunction problem occurred for SAT\u2013V but not for SAT\u2013M, and the interaction involving outcome bias occurred for SAT\u2013M but not for SAT\u2013V. In Experiment 5, omission bias was more frequent (28.1% vs. 18.5%) in the group lower in SAT\u2013V, 2(1, N 458) 5.88, p .05, but there was no difference associated with SAT\u2013M. In probabilistic reasoning Problem 1 of Experiment 8, both SAT\u2013M and SAT\u2013V were correlated with the maximizing response, but the correlation involving SAT-M was higher. In probabilistic reasoning Problem 1, the point biserial correlation between responding normatively (MAX) versus nonnormatively (MATCH or OTHER) and SAT\u2013M was .269, whereas the corresponding correlation with SAT\u2013V was .151. In probabilistic reasoning Problem 2, the point biserial correlations between responding normatively (MAX) versus nonnormatively (MATCH or OTHER) and SAT\u2013M and SAT\u2013V were similar (.183 and .222, respectively).\nis any hint of an interaction in the means, it is again in the opposite direction from the expected finding. The high-SAT group displayed a slightly larger framing effect.\nThe next task displayed in Table 1 is the conjunction problem (Linda problem). The means of both groups displayed the expected conjunction fallacy\u2014Linda was judged more probably a feminist bank teller than a bank teller. The main effect of form was highly significant, F(1, 430) 120.5, MSE 1.18, p .001. There was a significant Form Cognitive Ability interaction, F(1, 430)\n4.66, MSE 1.18, p .05, although the size of the effect was small ( p\n2 .011). Additionally, the interaction was in the opposite direction from the expected finding\u2014the high-SAT group was more susceptible to the conjunction fallacy.\nThe next task displayed in Table 1 is the outcome bias problem. The means of both groups displayed the expected outcome bias\u2014the decision with the positive outcome was rated as a better decision than the decision with the negative outcome, despite the fact that the latter was objectively better. The main effect of outcome (form) was highly\nsignificant, F(1, 430) 20.50, MSE 1.13, p .001. There was a significant Form Cognitive Ability interaction, F(1, 430) 3.88, MSE 1.13, p .05, although the size of the effect was small ( p\n2 .009). This interaction was in the expected direction\u2014the low-SAT group displayed more outcome bias.\nThe remaining two analyses in Table 1 concern the two anchoring and adjustment problems. In the African countries item, it is clear that both groups displayed the expected anchoring effect\u2014 the large anchor resulted in higher estimates of the number of African countries in the United Nations (M 42.6 for the entire sample) than did the small anchor (M 14.9 for the entire sample). The number of African countries in the United Nations is actually 53. The main effect of anchor magnitude (form) was highly significant, F(1, 430) 219.1, MSE 381.4, p .001. However, the effect of anchor magnitude failed to interact with cognitive ability, as the Form SAT Group interaction was not significant, F(1, 430) 2.53, MSE 381.4.\nResults were similar for the redwoods problem. Both groups displayed the expected anchoring effect\u2014the large anchor resulted in higher estimates of the height of the tallest redwood (mean of 989.0 ft for the entire sample) than did the small anchor (mean of 127.4 ft for the entire sample). The tallest redwood tree is actually 370 ft in height. The main effect of anchor magnitude (form) was highly significant, F(1, 426) 461.0, MSE 171,862, p .001. However, the effect of anchor magnitude failed to interact with cognitive ability, as the Form SAT Group interaction was not significant, F(1, 426) 0.05, MSE 171,862.\nThus, across all of the ANOVAs, only two of the six interactions between form and cognitive ability were statistically significant, and only one of these (that for outcome bias) was in the direction of reduced judgmental bias on the part of the group higher in cognitive ability. Of course, some information is lost\u2014and power reduced\u2014 by dichotomizing on the cognitive ability variable (SAT). Thus, Table 1 also presents the results of a continuous analysis for each task in which the significance of the Form Cognitive Ability interaction was tested in a regression analysis in which SAT was used as a continuous variable rather than as a dichotomous variable. Immediately below the ANOVA in Table 1 is presented the F ratio for the test of the interaction: the Form SAT cross product when entered third in the equation predicting item response after form and SAT. Along with the F ratio is presented the R2 change for the interaction. These and all subsequent regression analyses were conducted with centered predictors.\nThe regression analyses converged completely with the results from the ANOVAs. Only two of the six interaction terms reached statistical significance, and only one of those (that for outcome bias) was in the expected direction\u2014the degree of outcome bias was larger for the group lower on the SAT. The significant interaction term for the Linda problem indicated a data pattern in the opposite direction\u2014the conjunction fallacy was displayed to a greater extent by the group with higher SAT scores.\nIn summary, Experiment 1 produced very little evidence indicating that cognitive ability was related to judgmental biases when the latter were assessed in between-subjects designs. In six comparisons involving five different classic effects from the heuristics and biases literature, only one comparison provided any indication that cognitive ability attenuated a judgmental bias. Even in that case (outcome bias), the effect was extremely modest. The vari-\nance associated with the interaction effect was less than 1% in both the ANOVA and in the regression analysis.\nExperiment 2: \u201cLess is More\u201d Effects\nIt has been proven through several formal analyses that if people\u2019s preferences follow certain logical patterns (the so-called axioms of choice), then they are behaving as if they are maximizing utility (Dawes, 1998; Edwards, 1954; Jeffrey, 1983; Luce & Raiffa, 1957; Savage, 1954; von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944). Much empirical work has gone into determining whether humans adhere to the axioms of choice (transitivity, independence, reduction of compound lotteries, etc.). However, a between-subjects comparison makes it possible to test an even simpler requirement of rational choice\u2014that people can be framed into preferring more to less (e.g., preferring $6 to $5). For example, Slovic, Finucane, Peters, and MacGregor (2002) found that people rated a gamble with 7/36 chance to win $9 and 29/36 to lose 5\u00a2 more favorably than a gamble with 7/36 chance to win $9 and 29/36 chance to win nothing. Indeed, they reported that the latter gamble was even rated less desirable than a gamble having a 7/36 chance to win $9 and 29/36 to lose 25\u00a2. Presumably, in a between-subjects design, the representation of the numerically small loss highlights the magnitude and desirability of the $9 to be won.\nLikewise, the phenomenon of proportion dominance can result in people preferring less to more in a between-subjects design. Slovic et al. (2002) reported a study in which people rated a safety measure that would save 150 lives less favorably than a safety measure that would save 98% of 150 lives at risk (see also Bartels, 2006; Slovic & Peters, 2006). Their explanation of this \u201cless is more\u201d effect exhibited in a between-subjects design is that saving 150 lives is more diffusely good than saving 98% of some target figure because the 98% is more evaluable (see Bartels, 2006; Hsee, Loewenstein, Blount, & Bazerman, 1999; Hsee & Zhang, 2004)\u2014it is close to the upper bound on a percentage scale. In the present experiment, we examined whether any of these \u201cless is more\u201d effects attenuate as the cognitive ability of the participant sample increases.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The participants were 361 undergraduate students (149 men and 212 women) recruited through an introductory psychology subject pool at a medium-sized state university.

Soon after you purchased the Video Connection discount card, Low Priced Videos, a competitor, opened a new store that rents videos for just $2.00 each. Although the Video Connection store is ten minutes away by car, the new Low Priced Videos is only about 1/2 block from your apartment. Assuming that you only rent from these two stores, how many of your next 20 videos rentals would be from the closer but more expensive Low Priced Videos?\nParticipants responded on the same 10-point scale. Absolute versus relative savings. This task was based on comparison problems introduced by Thaler (1980; see also Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Participants received either a large percentage of savings (Form 1) or a small percentage of savings (Form 2) framing form of the problem. The Form 1 version is given below:\nImagine that you go to purchase a calculator for $30. The calculator salesperson informs you that the calculator you wish to buy is on sale\nfor $20 at the other branch of the store which is ten minutes away by car. Would you drive to the other store? Option A: Yes, Option B: No\nThe Form 2 version is given below:\nImagine that you go to purchase a jacket for $250. The jacket salesperson informs you that the jacket you wish to buy is on sale for $240 at the other branch of the store which is ten minutes away by car. Would you drive to the other store? Option A: Yes, Option B: No\nPrevious research has found more participants willing to make the trip to save $10 for the calculator than for the jacket, thus violating the standard analysis of consumer behavior, which views the two versions as equivalent choices between traveling and gaining $10 versus the status quo (Thaler, 1980; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The sunk-cost paradigm used in this experiment was successful in creating a sunk-cost effect. The mean score of 6.71 (SD 2.9) in the no-sunk-cost condition (corresponding to roughly 11 videos) was significantly higher than the mean score of 4.61 (SD 3.2) in the sunk-cost condition (corresponding to roughly 7.5 videos), t(727) 9.33, p .001, Cohen\u2019s d 0.692. Both cognitive ability groups displayed sunk-cost effects of roughly equal magnitude. For the high-SAT group, the mean in the no-sunk-cost condition was 6.90 and the mean in the sunk-cost condition was 5.08, whereas for the low-SAT group, the mean in the no-sunk-cost condition was 6.50 and the mean in the sunk-cost condition was 4.19. A 2 (cognitive ability) 2 (condition) ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of cognitive ability, F(1, 725) 8.40, MSE 9.13, p .01, and a significant main effect of condition, F(1, 725) 84.9, MSE 9.13, p .001. There was a slight tendency for the low-SAT participants to show a larger sunk-cost effect, but the Cognitive Ability Condition interaction did not attain statistical significance, F(1, 725) 1.21, MSE 9.13. The interaction was also tested in a regression analyses in which SAT was treated as a continuous variable rather than as a dichotomous variable. The Form SAT cross product, when entered third in the equation, was not significant, F(1, 725) 0.32.\nThe sunk-cost effect thus represents another cognitive bias that is not strongly attenuated by cognitive ability. However, this is true only when it is assessed in a between-subjects context. Using a similar sunk-cost problem, Stanovich and West (1999) did find an association with cognitive ability when participants responded in a within-subjects design.\nResults on the percentage versus absolute savings problem were consistent with previous research. More participants were willing to drive 10 min when the resulting $10 savings constituted a substantially larger percentage of the cost of the purchase. For the high-SAT group, 88.3% were willing to drive to save $10 on the $30 calculator, but only 55.9% would drive to save $10 on the $250 jacket, 2(1, N 365) 47.14, p .001. These values for the low-SAT group were, respectively, 86.9% and 62.0%, 2(1, N 364) 30.11, p .001. Of particular interest in the present study, a logistic regression analysis indicated that the interaction between SAT group and problem form failed to reach significance, .38, 2(1, N 729) 1.01. The nonnormative preference for\nrelative over absolute savings was not moderated by cognitive ability.\nExperiment 4: Nonseparability of Risk and Benefit Judgments\nSlovic et al. (2002; Slovic & Peters, 2006) have suggested that judgments about the risks and benefits of various activities and technologies derive not from separable knowledge sources relevant to risk and benefit but instead derive from a common source\u2014affect. Evidence for this conjecture derives from the finding that ratings of risk and reward are negatively correlated (Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic & Peters, 2006), both across activities within participants and across participants within activities. When something is rated as having high benefits, it tends to be seen as having low risk, and when something is rated as having high risk, it is seen as having low benefits. Finucane et al. (2000) argued that such a finding is nonnormative because the risk/benefit relationship is most likely positive in a natural ecology. Their argument is that of the four cells in a high/low partitioning of risk and benefit, one of the cells\u2014that for activities of high risk and low benefit\u2014must be vastly underpopulated. This is because activities of this type are usually not adopted, and they are often proscribed by authorities even when they are. If the highrisk, low-benefit quadrant is underpopulated, then the overall risk/benefit of activities in the actual world must be positively correlated. In the present study, we investigated whether the nonnormative tendency to view risk and reward as negatively correlated is attenuated in individuals high in cognitive ability."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The 458 participants in this experiment (112 men and 346 women) were recruited as in the previous experiments, and their mean age was 18.8 years (SD 1.8).

The 231 students with SAT scores at or below the median (1140) were assigned to the lowSAT group, and the 227 remaining students were assigned to the high-SAT group. Participants were asked to rate the benefits and risks of the following technologies/products: bicycles, alcoholic beverages, chemical plants, pesticides. Participants were first asked to rate the technology/product on a 7-point scale ranging from not at all beneficial (1) to very beneficial (7). They then rated the relative risk of the technology/product on a 7-point scale ranging from not at all risky (1) to very risky (7)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Finucane et al. (2000) used three methods to assess the relationship between judgments of benefit and risk. First, they examined the mean risk/benefit ratings given to 23 different activities/ technologies and then calculated the correlation across the 23 items. Second, they calculated the correlation, across the 23 items, of the ratings of each individual participant. Finally, Finucane et al. (2000) examined, within each activity, whether those who rated the activity as having large benefits perceived it as having low risk\nand vice versa. All three of these methods yielded a preponderance of negative correlations. Because we examined only four different activities/technologies, we were restricted to the third method of calculating the correlation between risk and benefit.\nTable 3 presents the mean benefit and risk rating for each of the four activities/technologies. Not surprisingly, bicycles were rated of highest benefit and lowest risk. Alcoholic beverages, in contrast were rated relatively low in benefit and high in risk. Most relevant, however, are the correlations between benefit and risk within each of the four items. These correlations are presented for both the high-SAT and low-SAT group. Replicating the work of Finucane et al. (2000), all eight of the correlations were negative and seven of the eight were statistically significant. For each of the four activities/technologies, people who saw the activity as very beneficial saw it as lower in risk, and those who saw it as lower in benefit tended to see it as somewhat higher in risk.\nThe nonnormative tendency to view risk and reward as negatively correlated was not attenuated by high cognitive ability within the range that we studied. In fact, each of the four negative correlations were higher in the high-SAT group than in the lowSAT group. However, none of the differences between the correlations were significant when a Fisher z test (values of 1.51, 0.12, 0.45, and 1.12, respectively) was used.\nExperiment 5: Omission Bias\nOmission bias is the tendency to avoid actions that carry some risk but that would prevent a larger risk (Baron, 1998; Baron & Ritov, 2004; Bazerman, Baron, & Shonk, 2001). People often do not realize that by failing to act they often subject themselves and others to greater risk.

In this experiment, we examined individual differences in WTA/WTP discrepancies and also another effect predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)\u2014the certainty effect.

Although many theorists have discussed why individuals finding Option D attractive might nonetheless be drawn to Option A in the first problem (Bell, 1982; Loomes & Sugden, 1982; Maher, 1993; Schick, 1987; Slovic & Tversky, 1974), relatively little is known about the influence that cognitive ability might have on preferences on this problem."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "There was a significant WTA/WTP difference displayed in Experiment 6.

The task read as follows:\nAssume that you are presented with two trays of black and white marbles, a large tray that contains 100 marbles and a small tray that contains 10 marbles. The marbles are spread in a single layer in each tray. You must draw out one marble (without peeking, of course) from either tray. If you draw a black marble you win $2.

It is most often assessed with syllogistic reasoning tasks in which the believability of the conclusion conflicts with logical validity.\nTwenty-four syllogistic reasoning problems, largely drawn from Markovits and Nantel (1989), were completed by the participants. The 436 participants for this task (127 men and 309 women) were recruited in the same manner as in all the previous studies, but none had participated in previous experiments. Their mean reported total SAT score was 1174 (SD 109). Eight of the\nproblems\u2014the inconsistent syllogisms\u2014were worded such that the validity judgment was in conflict with the believability of the conclusion (e.g., All flowers have petals; roses have petals; therefore, roses are flowers\u2013which is invalid). Eight of the problems\u2014 the consistent syllogisms\u2014were worded such that the validity judgment was congruent with the believability of the conclusion (e.g., All fish can swim; tuna are fish; therefore, tuna can swim\u2014 which is valid). Eight of the problems\u2014representing the neutral condition\u2014involved imaginary content (e.g., All opprobines run on electricity; Jamtops run on electricity; therefore, Jamtops are opprobines\u2013which is invalid) and were thus neither consistent nor inconsistent. Participants were instructed to judge the validity of the conclusion assuming that all of the premises were true.\nA belief bias effect was demonstrated on the syllogistic reasoning task. The mean number of items answered correctly (out of 8) was 6.80 (SD 1.27) in the consistent condition, 6.73 (SD 1.38) in the neutral condition, and 5.11 (SD 1.91) in the inconsistent condition.

Their mean reported total SAT score was 1174 (SD 109). This task was adapted from a study by George (1995). It is a deductive reasoning task that assesses whether participants recognize the deductive certainty of modus ponens. Participants read four arguments. Following is one example:\nPremises: 1. If there is a postal strike, then unemployment will double. 2. There is a postal strike. Conclusion: 3. Unemployment will double.\nParticipants responded on the following scale: true (7), probably true (6), somewhat true (5), uncertain (4), somewhat false (3),\nprobably false (2), and false (1). Premise 1 in the other three arguments was as follows: \u201cIf the winter is harsh, then there will be a flu epidemic,\u201d \u201cIf a car is a Honda, then it is expensive,\u201d \u201cIf a person eats hamburgers, then he/she will get cancer.\u201d The score on the task was the sum of the responses to all four items. Because the normatively correct answer on each item is \u201ctrue,\u201d normatively correct responding on the task should result in a score of 28.\nBelief bias was shown on at least one of the modus ponens problems by 222 participants (they were less than certain that the syllogism was true on at least one problem). In contrast, 159 participants displayed no-belief bias on this task\u2014they answered true to each of the four items.

The test consists of two parts. First, participants indicated their degree of agreement with a series of 23 target propositions (on topics such as gun control, taxes, university governance, crime, etc.) on a 4-point scale. Participants then evaluated arguments (which varied on an operationally defined measure of strength; see Stanovich & West, 1997) relevant to these propositions. Individual differences in participants\u2019 reliance on objective argument quality were examined by running separate regression analyses on each participant\u2019s responses.

The former beta weight was used as the primary indicator of the ability to evaluate arguments independently of their prior opinion on the issue in question.\nPerformance on the AET was evaluated by examining the beta weight for argument quality for each participant. This score ranged from .506 to .768 and displayed a mean of .296 (SD .215). This beta weight was greater than zero for 90.9% of the sample.

Originally used by Wason (1966), the abstract version of the selection task has been studied extensively in the deductive reasoning literature (for detailed discussions of the enormous literature on the task, see Evans, Newstead, & Byrne, 1993; Evans & Over, 1996, 2004; Sperber, Cara, & Girotto, 1995; Stanovich & West, 1998a). The problem involves reasoning about the falsifiability of an \u201cif P then Q\u201d type of rule. We used a version with features that facilitated performance: \u201cviolation\u201d instructions, requiring justifications for each of the choices, and using a form of the rule that discourages a biconditional interpretation (see Platt & Griggs, 1993, 1995).\nThe correct response is to choose the P and not-Q cards. We specifically examined the common response patterns that have been discussed in the literature: P-only, PQ, all of the cards, and PQ not-Q. All remaining response patterns were classified as Other. We also constructed the \u201clogic index\u201d employed by Pollard and Evans (1987). It is formed by subtracting the number of incorrect responses (not-P and Q) from the number of correct responses (P and not-Q).\nThe major response patterns on the four-card selection task and the mean SAT score associated with that pattern are displayed in Table 7. Because this version of the task contained several features that have been found to facilitate performance in past studies (Platt & Griggs, 1993, 1995), the solution rate (30.9%) was substantially higher than that usually obtained with the abstract selection task (often 10% or less). Cognitive ability was associated with the response given to this version of selection task. In a one-way ANOVA, there was a significant overall effect of group, F(5, 369) 8.22, MSE 10,213, p .001, p\n2 .100. Partitioning the sample somewhat differently, we found that the mean SAT score (1214, SD 96) of the group answering correctly was significantly higher than the mean SAT score (1163, SD 106) of those giving an incorrect answer, t(373) 4.40, p .001, Cohen\u2019s d 0.493.

Thus, all of the analyses of this task consistently pointed to an association between cognitive ability and selection task performance."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The studies reported here demonstrated that many biases discussed in the heuristics and biases literature are surprisingly independent of cognitive ability in the range examined in our experiments. We say surprisingly because ever since Spearman (1904) first discovered positive manifold, intelligence indicators have correlated with a plethora of cognitive abilities and thinking skills that are almost too large to enumerate (e.g., Ackerman, Kyllonen, & Richards, 1999; Carroll, 1993; Deary, 2000, 2001; Lubinski, 2000, 2004; Lubinski & Humphreys, 1997; Sternberg, 1977, 2000). Of course, the generalization of our results must be restricted to the range of cognitive ability contained in our sample. All of our studies employed university students as participants. The higher and lower SAT groupings are partitionings of the upper half and lower half of the sample\u2014the low-SAT group is not low in an absolute sense; they simply are of lower cognitive ability relative to their counterparts in that particular study. The magnitude of the correlations involving SAT obtained in these studies is undoubtedly attenuated because of restriction of range. However, the fact that the range of the samples studied is somewhat restricted makes many of the findings (of near zero correlations between cognitive ability and many aspects of rational thought) no less startling. It is quite unexpected that, across even the range of ability in a university population, there would be so little relation between rational thought and cognitive ability."}, {"heading": "Mindware Gaps and Override Detection", "text": "Of course, it is not true that all thinking biases are independent of cognitive ability. The right column of Table 8 lists some effects and biases from Experiment 8 and from other studies where an association was found. Kahneman (2000) offers the beginning of an explanation of why certain rational thinking tasks might show associations with cognitive ability and others may not. His argument begins with the distinction between coherence rationality and reasoning rationality. Reasoning rationality \u201crequires an ability to reason correctly about the information currently at hand without\ndemanding perfect consistency among beliefs that are not simultaneously evoked\u201d (Kahneman & Frederick, 2005, p. 277). In contrast, \u201ccoherence is much stricter . . . coherence requires choices and beliefs to be immune to variations of framing and context. This is a lot to ask for, but an inability to pass betweensubjects tests of coherence is indeed a significant flaw\u201d (Kahneman, 2000, p. 682). Kahneman and Frederick (2002; see Kahneman, 2000), utilizing a dual-process framework, argued that correlations with cognitive ability will occur only in the intermediate range of difficulty. There, they argued, \u201cintelligent people are more likely to possess the relevant logical rules and also to recognize the applicability of these rules in particular situations. In the terms of the present analysis, high-IQ respondents benefit from relatively efficient System 2 operations that enable them to overcome erroneous intuitions when adequate information is available. When a problem is too difficult for everyone, however, the correlation is likely to reverse\u201d (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002, p. 68).\nThe phrase \u201cpossess the relevant logical rules and also to recognize the applicability of these rules in particular situations\u201d suggests two conditions that have to be fulfilled for a heuristically based response to be overridden by analytic processing (Evans, 2003, 2006, 2007; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich, 1999). These two conditions are actually the two sources of judgmental error that Kahneman and Tversky (1982a), two-decades ago, labeled as errors of application and errors of comprehension. The latter refers to errors that occur because people do not recognize the validity of a norm that they have violated. The former occurs when a person fails to apply a rule that he or she has learned.\nIn the remainder of this article, we use two slightly different terms for the loci of these problems. An error of comprehension we call a mindware gap (Stanovich, 2008a, 2008b; Toplak, Liu, Macpherson, Toneatto, & Stanovich, 2007). This is because in dual-process models, an important function of the analytic system is to take early representations triggered by the heuristic system offline and to substitute better responses. Mindware, a term coined by Perkins (1995; Clark, 2001, uses it in a slightly different way\nfrom Perkins\u2019 original coinage), refers to the rules, procedures, and strategies that can be retrieved by the analytic system and used to substitute for the heuristic response. However, if the mindware available to the analytic system for heuristic override has not been learned, then we have a case of a mindware gap.\nIn contrast, errors of application can only occur when the relevant mindware has been learned and is available for use in the override process. Errors of application occur when people fail to detect the situational cues indicating that the heuristically primed response needs to be overridden and an analytically derived response substituted. We give this requirement the label override detection (detecting the necessity for heuristic override). The above quote from Kahneman and Frederick (2002) suggests that cognitive ability differences only arise when the experimental task allows for variation in the presence of the relevant mindware and in the override detection process. It will be argued here that this analysis ignores a third potent source of nonnormative responding that might be an even more important source of individual differences."}, {"heading": "A Framework for Individual Differences in Heuristics and Biases Tasks", "text": "Most of the tasks in the heuristics and biases literature were deliberately designed to pit a heuristically triggered response against a normative response generated by the analytic system. As Kahneman (2000) noted, \u201cTversky and I always thought of the heuristics and biases approach as a two-process theory\u201d (p. 682). However, what this means is that even after the necessity for override has been detected and the relevant mindware is available, the conflict has to be resolved. Resolving the conflict in favor of the analytic response may require cognitive capacity, especially if cognitive decoupling must take place for a considerable period of time while the analytic response is computed. Cognitive decoupling is involved in inhibiting the heuristic response and also in simulating alternative responses (Stanovich, 2008a, 2008b). Recent work on inhibition and executive functioning has indicated that such cognitive decoupling is very capacity demanding and that it is strongly related to individual differences in fluid intelligence (Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer, 1996; Engle, 2002; Geary, 2005; Gray, Chabris, & Braver, 2003; Kane & Engle, 2002, 2003; Salthouse, Atkinson, & Berish, 2003; Unsworth & Engle, 2005, 2007).\nIt is argued here that it is this third factor present in some heuristics and biases tasks\u2014the necessity for sustained cognitive decoupling\u2014that is the major source of the variability in the association between cognitive ability and task performance that is displayed in Table 8. Building on the conjectures of Kahneman (2000) and Kahneman and Frederick (2002), our framework for conceptualizing individual differences on heuristics and biases tasks is displayed in Figure 1. The question addressed in the first stage of the framework is whether, for a given task, the mindware is available to carry out override (whether the procedures and declarative knowledge are available to substitute an analytic response for a heuristic one). If the relevant mindware is not available, then the person must, of necessity, respond heuristically. It is immaterial whether the person detects the necessity for override or has the capacity to sustain override if the normatively appropriate response is simply not available. If the relevant mindware (prob-\nabilistic thinking skills, falsifiability tendencies, disposition to search for alternative explanations, sensitivity to contradiction, etc.) is not present, then participants will end up at what has been termed in the figure Path 1 to a heuristic response.\nIf the relevant mindware is in fact available, then the next question that becomes operative is whether or not the person detects the need to override the heuristic response. Even if the relevant mindware is present, if the participant does not detect any reason to override the heuristic response, then it will be emitted (this is Path 2 to a heuristic response as labeled in the figure). Many heuristics and biases tasks lead people down this path. People do not detect the need to override the response that comes naturally (Kahneman, 2003) even though, in retrospect, they would endorse the norm that the heuristic response violated (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982a; Shafir, 1998; Shafir & Tversky, 1995; Thaler, 1987).\nThe next choice point in the figure concerns the task rather than the participant. If the relevant mindware is present and if the need for override has been noted, the question then becomes whether or not the task requires sustained inhibition (cognitive decoupling) in order to carry out the override of the heuristic response. If not (or if the capacity required is low\u2014this of course may not be an all-or-nothing issue), then the analytic (System 2) response will be substituted for the heuristic response. In contrast, if the task requires sustained decoupling in order to carry out override, then we must ask whether the participant has the cognitive capacity that will be necessary. If so, then the analytic response will be given. If not, then the heuristic response will be given (Path 3 to the heuristic response in the figure)\u2014despite the availability of the relevant mindware and the recognition of the need to use it.\nIn order for cognitive ability to associate with a bias, there must be differences correlated with cognitive ability at some of the choice points in the framework\u2014that is, in some of the person\nparameters that branch toward or away from heuristic paths. As Kahneman (2000) noted, \u201cA task will be too difficult if (1) System 1 favors an incorrect answer, and (2) System 2 is incapable of applying the correct rule, either because the rule is unknown [mindware gap] or because the cues that would evoke it are absent [no override detection]\u201d (p. 682). Performance on such a task will be floored and will show no association with cognitive ability. Some of the tasks in Table 8 are no doubt of this type (betweensubjects conjunction effects, for example). However, several of the tasks in Table 8 without associations with cognitive ability cannot be viewed as displaying floor effects.2 For a cognitive ability difference to be observed, there must be differential cleaving by intelligence at some of the critical nodes in Figure 1\u2014that is, there must be a correlation between intelligence and at least one of the person parameters. Of course, the partitioning of cognitive ability groups at each of the nodes will vary from task to task. We advance here a generic conjecture about the source of associations with cognitive ability. The conjecture is that the primary source of associations with cognitive ability in heuristics and biases tasks is the way that people are partitioned by person Parameter 3 (\u201cdoes the person have the decoupling capacity to sustain override\u201d)."}, {"heading": "Cognitive Decoupling, Mindware Gaps, and Override Detection in Heuristics and Biases Tasks", "text": "There is evidence in the literature indicating that intelligence tests (especially tests of fluid intelligence, see Carroll, 1993; Horn & Cattell, 1967; Horn & Noll, 1997) directly tap the ability to sustaining the decoupling of representations from the world so that cognitive simulations can be run which test the outcomes of imaginary actions (Currie & Ravenscroft, 2002; Dienes & Perner, 1999; Evans & Over, 2004; Kahneman & Tversky, 1982b; Nichols & Stich, 2003). There is probably a substantial differential in the cleaving at Node 3 based on cognitive ability (Duncan et al., 1996; Kane & Engle, 2002; Salthouse et al., 2003). In contrast, we conjecture that, for many tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, the other two parameters show only modest differential partitioning based on cognitive ability.\nRegarding Parameter 1, it is true that the rules, knowledge, and strategies available to the analytic system to use in heuristic system overrides are in part the product of past learning experiences. One might expect that people with more cognitive ability would profit more from learning experiences. However, the relevant mindware for our present discussion is not just generic procedural knowledge, nor is it the hodge-podge of declarative knowledge that is often used to assess crystallized intelligence on ability tests. Instead, it is a very special subset of knowledge related to how one views probability and chance; whether one has the tools to think scientifically and the propensity to do so; the tendency to think logically; and knowledge of some special rules of formal reasoning and good argumentation. At least among the university students typically tested in these studies, acquiring these sets of skills and knowledge bases might be, experientially, very haphazard.\nAlthough it is true that more intelligent individuals learn more things than the less intelligent, many thinking dispositions relevant to rationality are acquired rather late in life and the explicit teaching of this mindware is very spotty and inconsistent. For example, the tendency to think of alternative explanations for a phenomenon leads to the ability to more accurately infer causal\nmodels of events. Such principles are taught very inconsistently (by either explicit or implicit means). Or take, for example, the conjunction rule of probability, the violation of which is illustrated in the Linda problem. Kahneman and Tversky (1982a) reported that tests of rule endorsement and argument endorsement conducted after participants had made the conjunction error revealed that statistically sophisticated psychology graduate students did endorse the rule they had violated (they possessed the relevant mindware but did not detect the necessity for override). However, a majority of statistically na\u0131\u0308ve undergraduate students failed to endorse the conjunction rule\u2014they lacked the relevant mindware (\u201cmuch to our surprise, naive subjects did not have a solid grasp of the conjunction rule,\u201d p. 127, Kahneman & Tversky, 1982a). The lack of uniform teaching and learning conditions for the acquisition of this mindware might attenuate any natural correlation with intelligence that there would be if it were taught under uniform conditions.\nOverride detection (Parameter 2), we would argue, is perhaps even more likely to display a low correlation with cognitive ability. First, it would seem to be more of a thinking disposition (related to constructs like need for cognition; e.g., see Cacioppo et al., 1996) than a cognitive capacity. Psychometricians have long distinguished typical performance situations from optimal (sometimes termed maximal) performance situations (Ackerman, 1994, 1996; Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Cronbach, 1949; Matthews, Zeidner, & Roberts, 2002). Typical performance situations are unconstrained in that no overt instructions to maximize performance are given, and the task interpretation is determined to some extent by the participant. In contrast, optimal performance situations are those in which the task interpretation is determined externally (not left to the participant); the participant is instructed to maximize performance and is told how to do so. All tests of intelligence or cognitive aptitude are optimal performance assessments, whereas measures of rational thinking dispositions (need for cognition, actively openminded thinking, reflectivity/ impulsivity) are often assessed under typical performance conditions.\nOverride detection, particularly in between-subjects designs, is exercised under typical rather than optimal conditions. It thus parses, in terms of the structure of cognitive abilities (Baron, 1985, 2000; Dole & Sinatra, 1998; Matthews et al., 2002; Sinatra & Pintrich, 2003; Sternberg, 1997, 2003) with thinking dispositions rather than cognitive capacity measures such as intelligence. For these theoretical reasons, we think that person Parameter 2 in the framework is less the source of associations with cognitive ability than is Parameter 3.\n2 Although the presence of floor and ceiling effects can be difficult to determine in between-subjects experiments, it is clear that at least some of our between-subjects tasks avoided them. For example, in the engineer/ lawyer base-rate problem from Experiment 1, roughly half of the sample made estimates below 60% in the 30% engineer condition, even though the description tilts toward engineer. This seems to show some sensitivity to the base rate and to thus indicate that at least half the sample was not floored. It is likewise with the African countries anchoring problem of Experiment 1. Regardless of the anchor, more than half the sample gave estimates less than 55 and greater than 15. Given that the actual number is 53, such performance is indicative of at least some degree of resistance to anchoring in the task.\nThere are two other ways that the influence of Parameter 2, as a generator of individual differences, becomes attenuated\u2014 essentially by floor effects (as Kahneman, 2000, argued), but also by ceiling effects. Certain tasks in between-subjects designs (perhaps anchoring problems or the Linda problem) give so few cues to the possibility of heuristic/analytic conflict that this parameter is probably floored for most subjects. Conversely, the instructions in other tasks (belief bias assessed with syllogisms, for example), and some situations in real life (\u201cthe salesperson is trying to sell you\u2014don\u2019t forget\u201d) are so explicit in calling attention to heuristic/ analytic conflict that this parameter is probably near ceiling.\nThe case of belief bias in syllogistic reasoning is probably a good illustration of our argument that it is Parameter 3\u2014the decoupling capacity parameter\u2014that is the primary generator of associations with cognitive ability in rational thinking tasks3 (see De Neys, 2006a, 2006b). The mindware available to reason logically on these simple categorical syllogisms (Parameter 1) is probably pretty uniformly present in the sample of university students studied here (and in most studies in the reasoning literature). The procedures needed to reason through the syllogisms used in these studies (for example, the invalid syllogism: all A are B, all C are B, therefore all C are A) are within the mindware of the vast majority of the students in research studies (the percentage correct in the neutral condition in Experiment 8 [84.1%] was almost as high as the percentage correct in the consistent condition [85.0%]). Additionally, as just mentioned, the instructions on this task probably ceiling out Parameter 2\u2014override detection. Recall that the instructions to the task sensitize the participants to potential conflict (between argument validity and the truth of argument components). Thus, Parameters 1 and 2 probably leave little room for any individual difference variable to associate with performance.\nIn contrast, the task does require sustained cognitive decoupling (De Neys, 2006b). In the \u201crose\u201d syllogism for example (All flowers have petals; roses have petals; therefore, roses are flowers\u2014 which is invalid), participants must suppress the tendency to endorse a valid response because of the \u201cnaturalness\u201d (see Kahneman, 2003) of the conclusion\u2014roses are flowers. This response must be held in abeyance while reasoning procedures work through the partially overlapping set logic indicating that the conclusion does not necessarily follow and that the syllogism is thus invalid. The reasoning process may take several seconds of perhaps somewhat aversive concentration (see Botvinick, Cohen, & Carter, 2004; Glenberg, 1997; Kahneman, 1973; Navon, 1989)\u2014seconds during which the urge to foreclose the conflict by acceding to the natural tendency to affirm \u201croses are flowers\u201d (by responding \u201cvalid\u201d) must be suppressed. Such response suppression while reasoning is closely related to the inhibitory and conflict resolution processes being studied by investigators examining the construct of executive functioning (Baddeley, Chincotta, & Adlam, 2001; Botvinick et al., 2004; Kane, 2003; Salthouse et al., 2003). Individual differences in such inhibitory processes have been found to be strongly associated with individual differences in fluid intelligence.\nWe conjectured that many of the other tasks that do show associations with cognitive ability (second column of Table 8) are tasks that involve some type of inhibition and/or sustained cognitive decoupling. For example, in within-subjects tests of outcome bias (Stanovich & West, 1998c) the appearance of the second item\ngives a pretty clear signal to the participant that there is an issue of consistency in their responses to the two different forms\u2014that is, the within-subjects design probably puts Parameter 2 at ceiling, thus insuring that it is not the source of any associations with cognitive ability that are obtained. Detecting the need for consistency is not the issue. Instead, the difficulty comes from the necessity of inhibiting the tendency to downgrade the decision in the negative outcome condition, despite its having a better rationale than the positive outcome decision. Even in the betweensubjects version of this task, one group of participants\u2014those getting the negative outcome version\u2014is alerted to the potential conflict between the seemingly good reasons to have the operation and the shockingly bad outcome. Participants must suppress the desire to sanction the decision, decouple their knowledge of the outcome, and simulate (see Evans & Over, 1996; Nichols & Stich, 2003) what they would have thought had they not known the outcome. Indeed, this condition creates a situation similar to those of various \u201ccurse of knowledge\u201d paradigms (see Birch, 2005; Camerer, Loewenstein, & Weber, 1989; Gilovich, Medvec, & Sativsky, 1998; Hinds, 1999; Keysar & Barr, 2002; Royzman, Cassidy, & Baron, 2003). Note that the two cognitive ability groups show no difference in the positive outcome condition (see Table 1), which does not necessitate heuristic system override. The difference is entirely in the negative outcome condition in which sustained suppression is required.\nThe \u201ccurse of knowledge\u201d logic of the negative item in the outcome bias task is similar to that in hindsight bias paradigms (e.g., Christiansen-Szalanski & Williams, 1991; Fischhoff, 1975; Pohl, 2004), which have also shown associations with cognitive ability (Stanovich & West, 1998c). In hindsight paradigms, the marking of the correct response sensitizes every respondent to the potential conflict involved\u2014between what you know now versus what you would have known without the correct response being indicated. Thus again, Parameter 2 must be at ceiling. However, there is a need for sustained decoupling in the task, so whatever association between bias and cognitive ability exists on the task (a modest one; see Stanovich & West, 1998c) is likely generated by individual differences in Parameter 3.\nWithin-subjects framing paradigms probably have a similar logic. The appearance of the second problem surely signals that an issue of consistency is at stake (putting Parameter 2 at ceiling), and virtually all of the university students in these studies have acquired the value of consistency (Parameter 1 is also at ceiling). The modest cognitive ability associations that are generated by this task probably derive from lower cognitive ability participants who cannot suppress the attractiveness of an alternative response despite the threat to consistent responding that it represents\u2014in short, from variation in Parameter 3. In contrast, between-subjects framing situations probably drive Parameter 2 to a very low value (few people recognize that there is a conflict to be resolved between a potentially different response to an alternative framing),\n3 Our conjecture here amounts to an endorsement of what Evans (in press) calls the quality hypothesis regarding cognitive ability\u2014that individuals higher in cognitive ability are more likely to compute the correct response given that they have engaged System 2. The corresponding quantity hypothesis is that individuals higher in cognitive ability are more likely to engage System 2.\nthus eliminating associations with individual differences (in the manner suggested by Kahneman, 2000).\nThe logic of the Linda problem is similar. Transparent, withinsubjects versions are easier because they signal the conflict involved and the necessity for override. Such versions create at least modest associations with cognitive ability. In the between-subjects version, however, individual differences are eliminated entirely because this design obscures the heuristic/analytic conflict and puts Parameter 2 at floor.\nAs a final example, consider the difference between causal and noncausal base rates4 illustrated in Table 8. Noncausal base-rate problems trigger conflict detection in so few participants that Parameter 2 is floored and hence cognitive ability differences are eliminated. In contrast, in a classic causal base-rate problem such as the Volvo versus Saab problem (see Footnote 4), where aggregate information is pitted against indicant information, the aggregate information has a causal relationship to the criterion behavior. Thus, the aggregate information in causal base-rate scenarios clearly signals that there are two pieces of information in conflict, Parameter 2 is near ceiling, and individual differences are determined largely by Parameter 3 (the sustained decoupling parameter), which is, we conjecture, linked to individual differences in cognitive ability. Thus, causal, but not noncausal, base-rate problems show cognitive ability differences.\nOf course, with this discussion of what creates associations between biases and cognitive ability, we do not mean to draw attention away from the most salient outcome of this investigation\u2014that a startlingly wide range of rational thinking tendencies appear to be independent of intelligence within the range existing in a university sample. These include many tasks that test some very basic strictures of rational thought. For example, the absence of framing and context effects are performance patterns that ensure that people\u2019s choices are utility maximizing. The failure to adhere to these strictures leads to descriptive models of human rationality that have profound public policy implications (Camerer, Issacharoff, Loewenstein, O\u2019Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003; Mitchell, 2005; Prentice, 2005; Sunstein & Thaler, 2003). But adherence to these strictures of utility maximization were unrelated to cognitive ability in our sample. Within the range of intelligence that we studied, individuals of the highest cognitive capacity were no less likely to display base-rate neglect, the conjunction fallacy, myside bias, anchoring effects, the sunk-cost effect, proportion dominance, and a host of other cognitive biases.\nGeneral Conclusions\nThe framework in Figure 1 illustrates why rationality will not be uniformly related to intelligence. Instead, that relationship will depend upon the degree that rational responding requires sustained cognitive decoupling. When the heart of the task is recognizing the need for heuristic override but the override operation itself is easily accomplished, no sustained decoupling is necessary and rational thinking will depend more on the operations of the reflective mind than on those of the algorithmic mind (Stanovich, 2008a, 2008b). Thus, relationships with intelligence will be attenuated. Additionally, as Kahneman (2000) has argued, when detecting the necessity for override is very difficult (Parameter 2 is low), performance overall will be quite low and no relationships with cognitive ability will be evident.\nConversely, however, highly intelligent people will display fewer reasoning biases when you tell them what the bias is and what they need to do to avoid it. That is, when Parameters 1 and 2 are ceilinged and considerable cognitive capacity is needed to sustain decoupling while the correct response is computed, then highly intelligent people will do better in a rational thinking task. However, if there is no advance warning that biased processing must be avoided (as is the case in many between-subjects designs), then more intelligent individuals are not much more likely to perform any better on the task. Another way to phrase this is to say that, often, people of higher cognitive ability are no more likely to recognize the need for a normative principle than are individuals of lower cognitive ability. When the former believe that nothing normative is at stake, they behave remarkably like other people (equally likely for example to be \u201canchored\u201d into responding that redwoods are almost 1,000 ft tall!\u2014see Table 1). If told, however, that they are in a situation of normative conflict and if resolving the conflict requires holding a prepotent response in abeyance, then the individual of high cognitive ability will show less of many different cognitive biases.\nAn important caveat to the model presented in Figure 1 is that which rational thinking tasks yield a conflict between heuristic and analytic responses is not fixed, but instead is a function of the individual\u2019s history of mindware acquisition. Early in developmental history, the relevant mindware will not be present and the heuristic response will be inevitable\u2014no conflict will even be detected. Someone with no training in thinking probabilistically\u2014 or, for that matter, logically in terms of subset and superset\u2014may experience no conflict in the Linda problem. As experience with statistical and probabilistic thinking grows, a person will begin to experience more of a conflict because relevant mindware is available for use in the simulation of an alternative response by the analytic system. The final developmental stage in this sequence might well be that the mindware used in analytic simulation becomes so tightly compiled that it is triggered in the manner of a natural heuristic response. Some statistics instructors, for example, become unable to empathize with their students for whom the basic probability axioms are not transparent. The instructor can no longer remember when these axioms were not primary intuitions. This final stage of processing is perhaps captured by developmental models of heuristic versus analytic processing that trace a trajectory where fluent adult performance looks very heuristic (Brainerd & Reyna, 2001; Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Klein, 1998; Reyna, 2004; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995; Reyna, Lloyd, & Brainerd, 2003).\n4 Base rates that have a causal relationship to the criterion behavior (Ajzen, 1977; Bar-Hillel, 1980, 1990; Tversky & Kahneman, 1979) are often distinguished from noncausal base-rate problems\u2014those involving base rates with no obvious causal relationship to the criterion behavior. A famous noncausal problem is the well-known cab problem (see Bar-Hillel, 1980; Lyon & Slovic, 1976; Tversky & Kahneman, 1982). In contrast, the classic Volvo versus Saab item (see p. 285 of Fong, Krantz, & Nisbett, 1986) would be an example of a causal base-rate problem.\nReferences\nAckerman, P. L. (1994).

Blankenship California State University, Fresno\nDuane T. Wegener Purdue University\nPast research showed that considering a persuasive message in light of important rather than unimportant values creates attitudes that resist later attack. The traditional explanation is that the attitudes come to express the value or that a cognitive link between the value and attitude enhances resistance. However, the current research showed that another explanation is plausible. Similar to other sources of involvement, considering important rather than unimportant values increases processing of the message considered in light of those values. This occurs when the values are identified as normatively high or low in importance and when the perceived importance differs across participants for the same values. The increase in processing creates resistance to later attacks, and unlike past research, individual-level measures of initial amount of processing mediate value importance effects on later resistance to change. Important values motivate processing because they increase personal involvement with the issue, rather than creating attitudes that represent or express core values.\nKeywords: values, information processing, resistance to persuasion\nAttitude theorists have long been interested in attitude strength, a property of attitudes that has important implications for how attitudes influence people\u2019s reactions to the world around them (Petty & Krosnick, 1995). Strong attitudes are those that have lasting impact. That is, strong attitudes last over time, resist change when attacked, and influence future thinking and behavior (Krosnick & Petty, 1995). Thus, practitioners in many domains have as their goal to create strong attitudes that support their products, policies, candidates, or other advocated actions.\nOne well-worn path to a strong attitude is to associate the attitude with important values. Values are generally described as a relative ordering of beliefs that serve as trans-situational guides for evaluative and behavioral concerns (Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987, 1990; see Rohan, 2000, for a review). Rokeach (1968, 1973) suggested that an attitude\u2019s association with one\u2019s values is an important consideration in attitude strength and structure. After all,\nvalues have been characterized as a \u201cdominating force in one\u2019s life\u201d (Allport, 1961, p. 543), and values themselves have been shown to influence one\u2019s perceptions of reality and to guide both attitudes and behaviors (Kraus, 1995; Thomsen, Lavine, & Kounios, 1996; Woodruff & Divesta, 1948). As such, connecting an attitude to an important value has been one common way to create strong attitudes.\nConsistent with the proposed attitude strength, both attitudes and beliefs linked to values tend to be relatively resistant to various attempts at change. Behavioral resistance to social pressure has also been bolstered by the behavior\u2019s relation to values. For example, social perceivers resist conforming to the behavior of others when the behavior conflicts with the social perceivers\u2019 values (Schwartz, 1992; Vaughn & Mangan, 1963). As one would expect, effects of values are enhanced when the values are considered personally important rather than unimportant. For example, Lydon and Zanna (1990) found that research participants were more committed to a task involving their relationship partner when the task was described as being linked to their important rather than unimportant values. In addition, beliefs that have been anchored to a value by writing about the belief\u2013value link more effectively resist a later message that attacks the belief, compared with situations in which the belief has not been anchored to the value (Nelson, 1968). In the attitudes domain, Ostrom and Brock (1969) manipulated whether the content of a persuasive message was linked to relatively important or unimportant values. They had research participants look for and draw links between either important or unimportant values and specific words or phrases in a persuasive message. When the values were important rather than unimportant, the resulting attitudes were more resistant to later attacks on those attitudes (see also Johnson & Eagly, 1989; Rokeach, 1968). Kevin L.

For example, Ostrom and Brock (1968, 1969) put forth a cognitive model of attitudinal involvement in which key elements concern the centrality or importance of the value at stake and the relatedness of the value to the attitude. These two elements were believed to combine multiplicatively, such that high importance and high relatedness would result in the greatest attitudinal involvement. Highly involved attitudes were described as being \u201cwell imbedded in the cognitive structure, linked firmly and often with highly central elements\u201d (Ostrom & Brock, 1968, p. 375). Like Sherif and Cantril (1947) before them, Ostrom and Brock (1968) expected high levels of attitudinal involvement to primarily result in high levels of resistance to persuasion. Because of the links connecting the attitude and value, change in the attitude would push toward further cognitive restructuring, and in the tradition of other cognitive consistency theories, the preference for stability and consistency would push the individual to resist change (see also Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, 1998; Sherif & Hovland, 1961). This egoinvolvement/cognitive structure/cognitive consistency approach also formed the basis for Johnson and Eagly\u2019s (1989) concept of value-relevant involvement.\nOther related traditions in the attitude change domain are also consistent with these views. For example, functional theories of attitudes emphasize the psychological needs met by attitudes. One common attitude function is expression of one\u2019s values (Katz, 1960; Kristiansen & Zanna, 1988; Maio & Olson, 2000). If an attitude is perceived as expressing a value that is central to one\u2019s self-concept, it makes sense that the person would be reluctant to change that attitude (Nelson, 1968; Ostrom & Brock, 1969). In fact, Murray, Haddock, and Zanna (1996) characterized the Ostrom and Brock (1969) value-linking procedure as a creation of value-expressive attitudes and incorporated a linking procedure into their own manipulation of value-expressive attitudes. Also, Maio and Olson (1995) directly connected value expression with value-relevant involvement (Johnson & Eagly, 1989), which was based in the discussions of involvement by Sherif and Cantril (1947) and Ostrom and Brock (1968).1\nIt seems to us, however, that connecting an attitude to a value (even one with extensive cognitive structure) is not the only reasonable explanation for resistance stemming from consideration of values. For example, the concept of involvement can be treated in a somewhat broader fashion. Petty and Cacioppo (1979, 1986, 1990) defined issue involvement in terms of how important the attitudinal issue is to the person (see also Apsler & Sears, 1968; Kiesler, Collins, & Miller, 1969). An issue can be perceived as important for many reasons. The issue could relate to virtually anything for which the person cares (the person\u2019s outcomes, values, goals, friends, relatives, possessions, etc.). Thus, the same factors previously discussed as making the attitude itself involving (e.g., the attitude being self-defining, Sherif & Cantril, 1947, or being related to important values, Ostrom & Brock, 1969) would also make the message topic involving. In this broader conception of involvement, however, higher levels of issue involvement are thought to increase information processing, not simply to result in resistance to change (Petty & Cacioppo, 1979, 1990). This increase in processing should occur regardless of the source of issue involvement (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986, 1990; see also Boninger, Krosnick, & Berent, 1995). Therefore, intense information pro-\ncessing may provide an indirect route through which values could influence attitude strength in general and resistance to change in particular. That is, attitudes based on high rather than low levels of information processing (elaboration) are more likely to last over time, to resist change, and to guide future thinking and behavior (Petty, Haugtvedt, & Smith, 1995; Petty & Krosnick, 1995; Wegener, Petty, Smoak, & Fabrigar, 2004). Thus, if consideration of important values increases processing, it should be possible to produce strong, resistant attitudes even if the processing does not produce the kinds of direct connections between the value and the attitude that have guided most previous discussions of value effects on resistance or attitude strength. That is, resistance might occur even if attitudes do not become value expressive or are not viewed as representing one\u2019s core values. It is this new, indirect route from values to resistance that we examined in the current research.\nThe idea that extensive cognitive structure underlying central or important values can impute strength to other cognitive structures (including attitudes) that are connected to the value may certainly still have merit. However, it also seems quite plausible that consideration of important values might get people to think extensively, and existing evidence suggests that high levels of thinking alone can create strong attitudes (without explicitly connecting the attitude to a previously existing value or making that attitude express the value). In fact, some of the original manipulations used to directly connect values and attitudes might also have prompted research participants to elaborate on (to think carefully about) the issue. For example, anchoring beliefs to a value created the most resistance when people actively participated in the anchoring (writing about the belief\u2013value link) rather than anchoring in a more passive manner (Nelson, 1968). Thus, elaboration may have been an important part of the effectiveness of value anchoring in creating strong beliefs.\nAn elaboration component also seems plausible in accounting for the Ostrom and Brock (1969) attitude resistance effects. Although they discussed involvement as resulting from direct cognitive links between values and attitudes per se, they randomly assigned various values to be linked to passages from the persuasive message. Thus, the messages were not at all framed as the attitude supporting, expressing, or even relying on the specific value under consideration, and attitudes may not have been viewed as representing or expressing the values at all. Unfortunately, neither the Nelson (1968) nor the Ostrom and Brock research measured whether attitudes were perceived as representing or expressing the values. However, it seems quite possible that consideration of more important values would increase personal involvement with (and therefore effortful processing of) the associated message. If this occurs, it would provide an important alternative way of thinking about value effects on attitude strength (cf. Kiesler et al., 1969; Petty & Cacioppo, 1990).\n1 Of course, much research on functional views has also emphasized that linking the counterattitudinal message itself to support for an important value can enhance the effectiveness of that persuasive message (e.g., DeBono, 1987; Murray et al., 1996).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nResearch Overview\nFour sets of studies examined the potential role of message elaboration in creating later resistance to change when the original message was considered in light of important rather than unimportant values. In general, we propose that consideration of important values 3 issue involvement 3 message processing 3 attitude resistance. Considerable research suggests that involvement can influence message processing and that message processing can influence resistance (e.g., see Wegener et al., 2004). However, surprisingly little research has addressed whether consideration of important versus unimportant values can influence issue involvement or message processing, and neither issue involvement nor message processing has been the preferred explanation for how values create resistant attitudes. Thus, key pieces of the reported research address the links between value consideration and these hypothesized mediating mechanisms.\nThe first study set (i.e., Studies 1A and 1B) examined whether consideration of normatively important rather than unimportant values produces differences in the amount of elaboration of initial persuasive messages. In Study 1B, amount of elaboration was examined while also asking participants the extent to which their attitudes are based on their core values (i.e., questions used in past research to examine the value relevance of attitudes; e.g., Boninger et al., 1995; Holbrook, Berent, Krosnick, Visser, & Boninger, 2005). In both studies, we expected that consideration of important rather than unimportant values should increase elaboration of the message considered in light of the values. Especially if this occurs in the absence of attitudes coming to represent or express one\u2019s core values (in Study 1B), this would suggest that initial message elaboration per se might be responsible for later resistance to change. A second study set (i.e., Studies 2A and 2B) controlled for the fact that considering normatively important versus unimportant values asks participants to consider different semantic content within the persuasive message. A third study set tied the elaboration effects back to the resistance outcome that was the focus of early work on value\u2013attitude connections. Study 3 conceptually replicated past effects of value consideration on attitude resistance, and Study 4 examined the mediation of value effects on resistance by individuals\u2019 level of elaboration. Finally, the fourth set of studies (i.e., Studies 5A and 5B) examined why consideration of important values increases amount of processing. These studies directly measured participants\u2019 level of personal involvement with the issue to account for why consideration of important values increases message processing.\nStudies 1A and 1B\nThe crucial mediator in our hypothesized path from values to resistance is amount of message processing. Message recipients might think more carefully about the content of a message if they expect that information to relate to values they hold as relatively important rather than unimportant (cf. Petty & Cacioppo, 1990). Our first two experiments addressed whether consideration of a message in relation to important rather than unimportant values influences the level of message processing. We expected that consideration of important values would lead to greater processing (elaboration) than consideration of unimportant values. To address this question, we adapted the paradigm used by Ostrom and Brock\n(1969; see also Murray et al., 1996) in which participants are randomly assigned to consider normatively important or unimportant values in relation to a persuasive message about a topic of low personal relevance to the message recipients. To index the level of processing of the persuasive message, we created two versions of the persuasive message, one that contained relatively strong (compelling) arguments and one that contained relatively weak (specious) arguments. When processing is high rather than low, there should be larger effects of argument quality on attitudes and on the favorability of thoughts toward the attitude object (see Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "One hundred forty-four introductory psychology students participated in Study 1A, and 79 participated in Study 1B.

First, participants received a booklet presenting a written message containing either strong or weak arguments arguing that a fictitious country, Tashkentistan, should be allowed to join the European Union (EU). After viewing the message for the first time, participants were asked to engage in a \u201cspeech interpretation task.\u201d Participants read three 3- to 4-sentence excerpts (paragraphs) from the message, each listed separately on a page along with an \u201cidea\u201d (i.e., a value). The value had been identified in pretests as normatively important or unimportant. Each message paragraph was created such that some elements were related to both the important and the unimportant values that were associated (in different conditions) with the excerpt. For each excerpt, participants were asked to circle the value and to circle a keyword in the excerpt that was most related to the value, connecting the two circled words by drawing a line between them.2 After the speech interpretation task, participants were asked to report their attitudes toward Tashkentistan entering the EU and to list the thoughts that came to mind when reading the message.\nTwo differences existed between Studies 1A and 1B. Participants in Study 1A (but not Study 1B) were asked to rate how appropriate the idea (value) was to the excerpt after drawing a link\n2 In addition to adding the argument quality manipulation to the Ostrom and Brock (1969) paradigm, each message excerpt contained words that were semantically related to both an unimportant and an important value. Therefore, when participants looked for a word to circle in the speech interpretation task, they could find one in both conditions. Because Ostrom and Brock randomly assigned values to excerpts, there was no guarantee that there was any semantic content in the passage directly related to the value. Because of this, in elaboration terms, one could imagine that people might search harder (in vain) for material related to important rather than unimportant values. We wanted to avoid this possibility in the current research.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nbetween each idea and a word in the excerpt (following Ostrom & Brock, 1969). This rating ensured that both important and unimportant values were perceived as having equal fit to their associated paragraphs. Also, after reporting their attitudes but before the thought listing, Study 1B participants were asked to report how closely their attitudes were related to their core, self-defining values (using items from a past measure of value-relevance of attitudes; Boninger et al., 1995; Holbrook et al., 2005).\nIndependent Variables\nValue importance. In a pretest, three values (adopted from Schwartz, 1992) were identified as normatively important (i.e., self-respect, M 8.11; loyalty, M 8.15; and freedom, M 8.44, on a 9-point scale with 1 not at all important and 9 very important). Three other values were identified as normatively less important (i.e., wealth, M 5.41; social power, M 5.70; and unity, M 5.19).\nArgument quality. The message contained three arguments pretested to be either relatively cogent and compelling or relatively weak and specious in their support of Tashkentistan\u2019s admittance into the EU (see Petty & Cacioppo, 1986, regarding pretesting procedures). One example strong argument described a strong Tashkentistani economy:\nThe economy has shown improvement in the past few years, and will continue to show even more if it becomes an EU participant. Unemployment has decreased and independence from government-assisted living has increased over the past few years, in part due to the construction of high-quality fishing ports that are capable of bringing in tons of fish per day.\nThe argument went on to say that this strong Tashkentistani economy would benefit the EU. In contrast, in the weak argument conditions, the Tashkentistani economy could only be viewed as benefiting from the EU, not the other way around:\nInclusion of a country into the EU leads to a chance at independence from outside influence, by providing security for the new country and changing its monetary system into the EU\u2019s. EU members will aid in the building of new seaside ports, resulting in an extra hundred pounds of fish caught per week.\nHowever, this EU support for Tashkentistan was also described as coming at a price to EU countries.\nWithin each argument, there were words that related to values pretested as important (i.e., self-respect) and unimportant (i.e., wealth). Yet the messages did not explicitly tie support for the advocacy to any of the values. That is, the messages did not say that supporting Tashkentistan would support self-respect or would support wealth. Therefore, the task of linking the value with a word from the message need not create attitudes viewed as expressing or representing the values.\nDependent Variables\nAppropriateness of values. Study 1A participants were asked to rate how appropriate each value was for its message excerpt using a 9-point scale (1 not at all appropriate, 9 very appropriate).\nAttitudes. Participants reported their attitude toward Tashkentistan becoming a member of the EU on five semantic 9-point differential scales (1 harmful, foolish, bad, unfavorable, and undesirable; 9 beneficial, wise, good, favorable, and desirable, respectively), as well as rating how strongly they agreed with the message (1 strongly disagree, 9 strongly agree; see Wegener & Fabrigar, 2004). The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for these six items was .92 for Study 1A and .94 for Study 1B.\nThought favorability. After completing the attitude measures, participants completed a thought listing task. Participants were given 3 min to write down any thoughts they had while reading the message (see Wegener, Downing, Krosnick, & Petty, 1995, for specific instructions). Two judges, unaware of condition, categorized participants\u2019 thoughts as positive, negative, or neutral toward admitting Tashkentistan to the EU. Thought favorability was computed by subtracting the number of negative thoughts from the number of positive thoughts and dividing by the total number of thoughts related to the topic. Thought favorability indices for the two judges were highly correlated (Study 1A, r .93; Study 1B, r .89), so they were averaged to form a single measure of thought favorability.\nValue relevance. In Study 1B, after the attitude measure but before the thought listing, participants were asked to report the extent to which their attitude was related to their core, personal values. Similar to Holbrook et al. (2005; see also Boninger et al., 1995), participants were asked the extent to which Tashkentistan entering the EU (a) is related to their personal values (1 not at all, 9 very much; 1 does not at all reflect, 9 very much reflects), (b) is based on the values they care about the most (1 not at all, 9 very much; 1 does not at all reflect, 9 very much reflects), (c) has an impact on the values they care about the most (1 not at all, 9 very much; 1 does not at all reflect, 9 very much reflects), and (d) reflects their core values (1 not at all, 9 very much; 1 does not at all reflect, 9 very much reflects).

In recent research, we have replicated the message processing effects of value consideration while also failing to find any differences in rated value relevance of the resulting attitudes (Blankenship & Wegener, 2007). Thus, we can be confident that the current paradigm need not create attitudes perceived as reflecting or expressing the values."}, {"heading": "Mediational Analyses", "text": "As noted by Petty and Cacioppo (1986), an argument quality manipulation is intended as an experimental manipulation of participants\u2019 cognitive responses to the persuasive message. Therefore, for Studies 1A and 1B, we expected measures of thought favorability to mediate argument quality effects. In other words, Value Argument Quality effects would really be due to differences in thought favorability produced when people encounter the strong or weak arguments while considering important rather than unimportant values. This produces a form of mediated moderation (Muller, Judd, & Yzerbyt, 2005; Wegener & Fabrigar, 2000) in which the Value Thought Favorability effect is responsible for the Value Argument Quality effects on attitudes.\nThe Value Argument Quality effect on thought favorability represents moderation of the front-end effects of argument quality on thoughts. This effect is consistent with value importance influencing the amount of elaboration of the message arguments. Differences in thought favorability would then carry the impact of argument quality through to attitudes. Traditionally, these types of effects have been indexed, in part, by showing that correlations between thoughts and attitudes are stronger when elaboration is high rather than low (see Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Wegener et al., 1995). In the current analyses, this type of differential relation between thoughts and attitudes would result in back-end moderation of thought favorability effects on attitudes. Therefore, the combination of front-end moderation (of argument quality effects on thoughts) and back-end moderation (of thought effects on attitudes) provides a strong case for value importance affecting the level of elaboration. In statistical terms, this pattern of effects is present if the Value Thought term continues to predict attitudes above and beyond the Value Argument Quality term when predicting attitudes (along with the Value Argument Quality effect on thoughts that has already been reported).\n3 Study 1A also included control conditions (n 71) in which participants were asked to simply reread the strong or weak message excerpts instead of considering the paragraph in light of any of the values. Like the unimportant value conditions, there was no effect of argument quality on participants\u2019 attitudes (F 1.00) or thoughts (F 1.50), suggesting that the topic was of low personal relevance, that the baseline amount of elaboration was low, and that the value consideration task per se was not increasing amount of processing (because there were no differences in effects of argument quality across the control and unimportant value conditions). The low level of baseline processing creates favorable conditions for testing variables thought to increase amount of processing (see Petty & Wegener, 1998).\nTable 1 Means, Standard Deviations, and Simple Effects for Attitudes and Thoughts as a Function of Value Importance and Argument Quality in Studies 1A and 1B\nStudy Values\nArgument quality\ntStrong Weak\n1A Attitudes Important 6.97 (1.24) 6.07 (1.64) 2.64*\nUnimportant 5.96 (1.38) 6.29 (1.69) 0.89 Thoughts Important 0.41 (0.56) 0.10 (0.74) 3.29*\nUnimportant 0.03 (0.65) 0.03 (0.65) 0.39 1B\nAttitudes Important 7.54 (1.30) 5.79 (1.49) 3.75* Unimportant 6.74 (1.57) 6.75 (1.65) 0.20 Thoughts Important 0.21 (0.56) 0.29 (0.74) 2.90*\nUnimportant 0.02 (0.56) 0.01 (0.55) 0.07\nNote.

(2005; see also Wegener & Fabrigar, 2000). The first regression analysis replicated the ANOVA results presented earlier. We centered all predictor variables prior to analysis (Aiken & West, 1991). As reported earlier, the Value Argument Quality interaction significantly predicted participants\u2019 attitudes, Study 1A, b 0.31, t(140) 2.46, p .015; Study 1B, b 0.41, t(75) 2.40, p .019. The next analysis examined effects of the predictor variables on the mediator. As presented earlier, we obtained a significant Value Argument Quality interaction on thought favorability, Study 1A, b 0.43, t(140) 4.02, p .001; Study 1B, b 0.13, t(75) 2.88, p .001. Similar to past analyses of differential thought\u2013attitude correlations (see Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), when values, thoughts, and the Value Thought interaction were used to predict attitudes, the Value Thought Favorability effect on attitudes was significant, Study 1A, b 0.52, t(139) 2.79 p .006; Study 1B, b 0.92, t(74) 3.14, p .002. The final analysis included effects of all of the distal predictors on the dependent measure (as reported in the previous regression effects on the attitude measure) plus the main effect and interactions involving the mediator (thoughts). In this analysis, the Value Thought Favorability interaction remained strong and significant, Study 1A, b 0.47, t(139) 2.44 p .016; Study 1B, b 0.65, t(74) 2.19, p .03, whereas the distal Value Argument Quality interaction on attitudes was reduced to nonsignificance, Study 1A, b 0.14, t(139) 1.40, p .18; Study 1B, b 0.25, t(74) 1.46 p .15. As described by Muller et al. (2005) and Wegener and Fabrigar (2000), the combination of the two significant paths (moderation on the front-end influences on the mediator and moderation on the back-end influences of the mediator on the dependent measure) support the mediated moderation pattern.4"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Taken together, the results suggest that consideration of important rather than unimportant values increased message processing. This occurred even though the resulting attitudes were not viewed as expressions of the values or as reflections of the participants\u2019 core beliefs. These types of perceptions of value\u2013attitude relations (or direct cognitive connections between the values and attitudes) formed the heart of previous discussions of value effects on later resistance to change (e.g., Holbrook et al., 2005; Maio & Olson, 1995; Ostrom & Brock, 1969; Sherif & Cantril, 1947). Yet past research did not provide direct evidence of value expression, perceptions of value relevance, or direct cognitive connections per se mediating value effects on resistance. Thus, if elaboration of the initial message mediates value effects on resistance, this would be the first direct evidence for a mechanism by which consideration of important values creates later resistance to change. Evidence that consideration of important rather than unimportant values increases message processing constitutes an important first step in arguing for the plausibility of our proposed indirect route from value importance to resistance (through changes in issue involvement and, therefore, message processing).\nBefore examining these mediational roles, however, we thought it prudent to address a primary concern about the first two studies. Different values were used across the value importance conditions. Because participants were looking for different semantic content in\nthe message paragraphs, one might wonder whether those semantic differences per se created the differences in amount of processing. That is, if some semantic content is easier to find and other content is harder to find, it could be that these semantic differences happen to be associated with value importance, rather than importance per se producing differences in processing. This seems unlikely, given the use of multiple values and passages across conditions, but the possibility cannot be ruled out on the basis of the first two studies.\nStudies 2A and 2B\nThe key to addressing semantic differences across values is to design a study that uses the same values across levels of value importance. In Studies 2A and 2B, we used the same values for everyone but measured differences across participants in their self-rated value importance. If differences in elaboration are created by differences in value importance per se, then the perceptions of importance should predict processing differences. If, however, the ease of finding certain semantic content within the messages is responsible for the previous effects, then the current studies would produce no differences in processing across levels of perceived value importance (because the semantics are the same for everyone). This design would also control for other possible differences across the specific values used, such as priming of concepts related to motivation, processing, or resistance.

In the unimportant value conditions, argument quality did not predict participants\u2019 attitudes or thoughts. Also, thoughts failed to reliably predict attitudes. Thus, no mediational pattern is plausible for unimportant value conditions. In the important value conditions, however, Sobel tests for the expected mediational pattern were significant (Study 1A, z 2.45, p .023; Study 1B, z 2.21, p .014; see Baron & Kenny, 1986).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nvalues was used as the index of value importance.

In the studies to follow, therefore, we wished to examine the impact of value importance on later resistance to change and the possible mediational role of elaboration (message processing). Random assignment of participants to consider important versus unimportant values should equate the value importance conditions on background factors that might influence the extent to which people elaborate or resist change.

Then, we could seek evidence that these effects are mediated by the differences in elaboration demonstrated in the previous studies. Thus, Study 3 was intended to conceptually replicate the resistance results from Ostrom and Brock (1969) using the current procedures.\nAn ideal test of elaboration effects on resistance requires that initial attitudes differ in the level of elaboration that went into establishing the attitudes without differing in other ways that would confound the comparison (Petty et al., 1995). Chief among these possible confounds would be differences in extremity of the initial attitudes. For example, if high-elaboration attitudes were more resistant to change but also started out being less extreme than initial low-elaboration attitudes, critics might reasonably note that the resistance result might have occurred because the highelaboration attitudes were less discrepant from the attacking message (i.e., they had less possible room for change). Alternatively, if initial high-elaboration attitudes were more extreme than initial low-elaboration attitudes, increased resistance of high-elaboration attitudes might be attributed to the greater extremity per se (another common antecedent of attitude strength; Abelson, 1995).\nTo create initial attitudes of equal extremity, we adjusted the persuasive communications used in the previous studies. We added positive information about the source of the initial message. In our earlier studies, no information had been given about the writer of the message. However, in the current study, the initial message was attributed to a highly expert source. This information on source expertise should especially increase the favorability of initial attitudes in the low-processing (i.e., unimportant value) conditions (see Chaiken & Maheswaran, 1994; Petty, Cacioppo, & Goldman, 1981). By increasing the favorability of attitudes when the message is considered in light of unimportant values, the extremity of attitudes may be equal across important and unimportant values when the arguments in the initial message are strong.\nThus, for Study 3, all participants received the same strong arguments as in the previous studies. After creating equally extreme initial attitudes across levels of value importance, we exposed participants to a counterattitudinal message arguing against admittance of Tashkentistan to the EU. We expected that conditions leading to higher levels of processing in the preceding studies (i.e., high value importance) would create greater resistance to the second, attacking message. This would result in an interaction between the importance of the value considered during the initial message and the time of attitude measurement. There should be no difference in initial attitudes, but after the second message (arguing against admission of Tashkentistan), there should be less favorable attitudes toward admitting Tashkentistan to the EU when values had been unimportant rather than important."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "One hundred five introductory psychology students were randomly assigned to consider either important or unimportant values\nin a 2 (value: important vs. unimportant) 2 (time: initial vs. postattack) mixed design with value as a between-participants factor and time as a within-participants factor."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "As in the previous studies, participants read a message supporting the admittance of Tashkentistan to the EU. As noted earlier, participants were given information about the writer of the message that had not been provided in the earlier studies. When encountering the first message, participants learned that Dr. Endelshone, a professor in the Finance Department at the University of Zurich and cochair of the committee examining Tashkentistan\u2019s application for admittance to the EU, approved of Tashkentistan\u2019s admittance. This information provided a positive cue that could increase favorability of attitudes in the unimportant value conditions, thereby equating the favorability of initial attitudes across value conditions. After reading the brief description of the message source, participants completed the same speech interpretation task linking each value to specific words in the strong argument message from the previous studies. Participants were then asked to report their attitudes using the same set of items listed earlier (Cronbach\u2019s .82). Consistent with previous resistance studies, thoughts about the initial message were not collected, so the level of elaboration was not artificially increased in conditions where low levels of thinking would have been the natural result (i.e., unimportant value conditions; see Petty et al., 1995, for discussion).\nAfter reporting their initial attitudes toward the proposal, participants read an attacking message written by the other cochair of the committee (Dr. Dijksterhuis), who was said to believe that Tashkentistan should not be admitted into the EU. This attacking message consisted of relatively weak arguments that countered the strong arguments used in the initial message. For example, regarding the economy of Tashkentistan, Dr. Dijksterhuis claimed,\nInitial estimates used to show improvement in the unemployment rate were based on incomplete information. For example, only 189 of the 192 major businesses in Tashkentistan had reported their employment statistics, leaving three businesses unaccounted for. These three major businesses might be laying off workers, which could change the unemployment rate by as much as a half percentage point overall.\nAfter the attacking message, participants reported their attitudes using the same six items as for initial attitudes (Cronbach\u2019s .92) and were asked to list thoughts that came to mind while reading the attacking message.

A one-way ANOVA revealed an effect of value, F(1, 103) 6.88, p .011, with participants who initially considered important values reporting more positive thoughts toward Tashkentistan joining the EU (M 0.65, SD 0.61) than in the unimportant value conditions (M 0.30, SD 0.73). The thought measure partially mediated the effects of value on resistance (Sobel z 2.09, p .037), suggesting that the resistance in Study 3 was an active type of resistance in which participants defended their initial point of view in relatively thoughtful ways (for discussion of thoughtful and nonthoughtful forms of resistance, see Wegener et al., 2004)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Study 3 presented an attacking message and replicated the resistance effects of Ostrom and Brock (1969) using the current materials and procedure. Thus, the same manipulation of value importance that created differences in message processing in Studies 1A and 1B also created differences in resistance of the attitudes to attack in Study 3. Thus, consistent with our issue-involvementbased approach, the results thus far suggest that the observed differences in message processing might be responsible for the observed differences in attitude resistance. These cross-study comparisons provide evidence that is typical of past studies of elaboration and attitude strength. That is, a manipulation or measure hypothesized to enhance elaboration (e.g., manipulations of personal relevance of the message topic, Petty et al., 1981, or of distraction, Petty, Wells, & Brock, 1976, or a measure of need for cognition, Cacioppo, Petty, & Morris, 1983) is shown to do so. Then, the same manipulation or measure is used to create initial attitudes of equal extremity that are influenced differently by an attacking message (e.g., Haugtvedt & Petty, 1992; Petty et al., 1995; see also Haugtvedt & Wegener, 1994; Wegener et al., 2004). Although the evidence is suggestive of elaboration effects on resistance, individuals\u2019 level of elaboration has not been assessed or used as a mediator of distal variable effects on resistance. Study\n4 was designed to produce direct mediational evidence of elaboration as a mediator of value importance effects on attitude resistance.\nStudy 4\nElaboration has been hypothesized to mediate effects of many motivation and ability variables on attitude strength outcomes (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Petty et al., 1995; Wegener et al., 2004). Yet, in these past studies, the role of elaboration has been implied through comparisons across participants and across studies, rather than being analyzed as a within-participants measure or mediator. This may be true, in part, because the most popular indicators of amount of processing (e.g., thought\u2013attitude correlations, argument quality effects on attitudes) are generally created as betweenparticipants indices (see Wegener et al., 1995). To provide more direct evidence of elaboration mediating value importance effects on resistance, we used a within-participant measure of elaboration based on a within-participant manipulation of argument quality (cf. Erb, Bohner, Rank, & Einwiller, 2002; Erb, Bohner, Schalzle, & Rank, 1998).\nIn making a case for the mediational role of elaboration per se, one might also want to control for beliefs about one\u2019s level of elaboration. For example, one could imagine some cases in which the mere belief that one has thought a lot rather than a little could get people to hang onto the attitude that was based on much rather than little thought. Although these effects of elaboration would be of scientific interest, similar effects could occur without any differences in actual elaboration, as long as people could be convinced that they thought much rather than little (e.g., Barden, 2006). A similar situation has recently been studied regarding the confidence people have in their attitudes. That is, higher levels of elaboration can increase confidence (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989), and higher levels of confidence can increase resistance to later attacking messages (Bassili, 1996; Tormala & Petty, 2002). Yet different levels of confidence can also be created without differences in elaboration by telling people that they successfully resisted strong versus weak arguments against their current position (e.g., Tormala & Petty, 2002). Therefore, in providing evidence of elaboration per se increasing resistance, it seemed prudent to measure and control for beliefs about the amount of processing in which one engaged, as well as the amount of confidence message recipients had in their attitudes prior to the attack."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "One hundred forty-four introductory psychology students participated in a 2 (value: important vs. unimportant) 2 (argument quality: strong vs. weak) 2 (time: initial vs. postattack) 2 (order of arguments: strong/weak/strong/weak vs. weak/strong/ weak/strong) mixed design.

Participants first received the same source from Study 3 presenting an initial message supporting Tashkentistan\u2019s admittance to the EU. Participants engaged in the same speech interpretation task as in the previous studies. To create individual-level indices of elaboration, participants received a message containing two strong and two weak arguments. By later assessing judgments related to each of the arguments, we were able to index the level of elaboration for each individual.\nDuring the speech interpretation task, two important or unimportant values were related to the message, each value being linked to one of the strong argument passages and to one of the weak argument passages. After considering the message in light of either important or unimportant values, participants evaluated the support for Tashkentistan joining the EU in each of the four arguments. After evaluating the arguments, participants were asked to report how confident they were in their evaluations and how much cognitive effort they exerted in reading the message.\nThe central data from these initial dependent measures should parallel the data from the previous amount-of-processing studies (Studies 1A\u20132B). That is, the dimensions associated with strong arguments should be evaluated more favorably than the dimensions associated with weak arguments, especially when participants considered important rather than unimportant values.\nSimilar to Study 3, after the initial dependent measures, participants read a second (attacking) message that opposed Tashkentistan\u2019s admittance to the EU. The attacking message was attributed to the same source used with the attacking message in Study 3. As in Study 3, the attack was tailored to contain relatively weak arguments that countered the claims associated with strong support in the initial message. Because initial evaluations should be equated only for dimensions initially supported by strong arguments (as in Study 3), the attacking message and postattack dependent measures addressed only those dimensions that were initially supported by strong arguments.\nAfter reading the attacking message, participants evaluated the support for Tashkentistan entering the EU along the dimensions in the attacking message (i.e., the same dimensions supported by strong arguments in the initial message and then attacked by relatively weak arguments in the attacking message). Participants used the same evaluation measures as when they evaluated the same dimensions after the initial message. Finally, participants were debriefed and dismissed.\nIndependent Variables\nArgument quality. Each participant received two strong, compelling arguments and two weak, specious arguments in favor of Tashkentistan becoming a member of the EU. Each argument addressed a different dimension along which Tashkentistan\u2019s admittance could be supported, and dimensions were always addressed in the same order (though order of the strength of arguments varied across participants). One strong argument and one weak argument were paired with each (important or unimportant) value. Each argument included two related facets that formed the basis for later evaluations. One argument addressed the family connections and worldwide alliances existing in Tashkentistan. A second argument addressed national pride and perceived similarity with EU countries. The third argument addressed strength of the\nTashkentistani economy and financial independence of the country. The final argument addressed food safety and livestock quality.\nFor example, participants who received a strong argument about Tashkentistani standards for food safety/livestock quality learned the following:\nTashkentistan is at the forefront of food safety, by setting down strict guidelines about livestock quality (most of which meet or exceed international standards). . . . As a result, 97% of dairy and beef cattle farmers have passed international food safety regulations and reports of unhealthy and sick livestock have decreased to a low 2%.\nParticipants who received a weak food safety/livestock quality argument read that\nTashkentistan is near the top of food safety in some parts of the world, by setting down strict guidelines about livestock quality (most of which meet third world country standards). . . . As a result, 9% of dairy and beef cattle farmers have passed international food safety regulations and reports of unhealthy and sick livestock have decreased to 38%.\nAs noted earlier, participants considered one strong and one weak argument in light of each (important or unimportant) value during the speech interpretation task. The order of the strong and weak arguments was counterbalanced such that half of the participants received arguments in a strong/weak/strong/weak order, whereas the other half received arguments in a weak/strong/weak/ strong order.\nValue importance. Each participant used two of the important values or two of the unimportant values used in the previous studies, with each value considered with one of the strong initial arguments and with one of the weak initial arguments. Participants in the important (unimportant) value conditions were asked to consider loyalty (unity) when receiving arguments about Tashkentistan\u2019s family connections/worldwide alliances and national pride/ similarity to EU countries and were asked to consider freedom (wealth) when receiving arguments about Tashkentistan\u2019s economy/financial independence and food safety/livestock quality.\nDependent Variables\nInitial evaluations. After reading the initial message and engaging in the speech interpretation task, participants were asked to evaluate the support provided by each of the arguments. Participants rated each of the eight facets (two per argument) in terms of the extent to which it would be (a) useful and (b) advantageous for the EU to have a country with Tashkentistan\u2019s qualities (i.e., worldwide alliances, tradition of family connections, feeling of a common bond with other EU countries, amount of national pride, economy, level of financial independence, food safety standards, and livestock quality, respectively). All ratings were made on a 9-point scale (1 not at all useful/not at all advantageous, 9 very useful/very advantageous). Correlations between the two items for each facet ranged between .70 and .82, and the four measures for each argument were averaged to form a composite measure for that argument. Cronbach\u2019s alphas for each of the four arguments (combining the four items across the two facets for each argument) ranged from .81 to .91.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nThe initial argument evaluations were also used to create an index of amount of elaboration of the initial message. Recall that between-participant assessments of elaboration often use argument quality effects on attitudes as the indicator of the amount of elaboration. We computed a within-participant index of elaboration based on differences in evaluations across the dimensions that were supported by strong versus weak arguments. This differential-evaluation index was created by averaging the evaluations of strong argument dimensions and subtracting the average evaluation of weak argument dimensions.\nConfidence. After rating all of the arguments, participants were asked to rate on two 9-point scales how confident and how certain they were about their beliefs regarding Tashkentistan becoming part of the EU (1 not at all certain/not at all confident, 9 very certain/very confident; Tormala & Petty, 2002). The correlation between the two items was .84, and the ratings were averaged to form a composite measure of confidence.\nSelf-reported amount of elaboration. Participants responded to three items designed to assess their own perceptions of their amount of elaboration (Petty, Brin\u0303ol, & Tormala, 2002). Participants were asked to report how much attention they paid to the message (1 no attention at all, 9 a lot of attention), how much effort they put into reading the message (1 no effort at all, 9 a lot of effort), and how deeply they thought about the issue (1 not deeply at all, 9 very deeply). Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the scale was .85, and the ratings were averaged to form a composite measure of self-reported amount of elaboration.\nPostattack evaluations. After the attacking message, participants were asked to evaluate the support for Tashkentistan entering the EU on the same four facets (two per argument) that were addressed by the attacking message using the same measures as in the initial evaluations. Correlations between the two items for each facet ranged between .71 and .92, and the four measures for each argument (two per facet) were averaged to form a composite measure for that argument (Cronbach\u2019s alphas for each argument, collapsing across the two facets in each argument, ranged from .88 to .92)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Initial Evaluations", "text": "Consideration of important rather than unimportant values should create higher levels of elaboration.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide experimental evidence of elaboration per se mediating effects of any distal variable (in this case, value importance) on resistance to change.\nAs described previously, we assume that consideration of important values increases processing because participants become more involved with the issue when considering the issue in relation\nto important rather than unimportant values. This seems quite plausible given previous discussions of issue involvement that connect issue involvement to settings in which people perceive the topic as related to anything they care about (objects, people, values, etc.; see Kiesler et al., 1969; Petty & Cacioppo, 1979, 1986, 1990). However, to this point, we had no measures directly linking amount of processing to involvement per se. Also, in past involvement and processing research, the data directly linking involvement with processing have manipulated the personal relevance of the message topic, which is hypothesized to be one primary source of involvement (e.g., Petty & Cacioppo, 1979, 1990; Petty et al., 1981). However, in the current case, there was little reason to believe that the Tashkentistan message was perceived as any more personally relevant to participants when considering important values. Thus, it seemed important to directly address the potential for consideration of values to influence involvement and, through involvement, amount of message processing.\nStudies 5A and 5B\nAs noted earlier, people are hypothesized to be more personally involved in an issue whenever the issue is thought to address something important to the person (values, outcomes, possessions, people; Petty & Cacioppo, 1990). Although values have been previously noted as one possible source of issue involvement, few data directly address this possibility. To date, the data that come closest to addressing this question show that attitude importance is higher when the attitude is viewed as reflecting or as based on one\u2019s core values (e.g., Boninger et al., 1995; Holbrook et al., 2005). Yet, as noted earlier, in the current setting, there was no evidence that participant attitudes were viewed as reflecting or expressing participants\u2019 values. Thus, there were no existing data that directly supported our proposed explanation of value effects on message processing as stemming from value effects on issue involvement per se. Therefore, in Studies 5A and 5B, we included a measure of issue involvement to test whether consideration of important values increases issue involvement, which in turn influences amount of thinking about the message (i.e., elaboration)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Two hundred sixty-one introductory psychology students participated in Study 5A, and 124 participated in Study 5B.

However, because thoughts often mediate effects of argument quality on attitudes, it may be that these two measures actually represent sequential points in the causal progression (from value importance 3 differential thoughts 3 differential evaluations 3 resistance to change). Regressions showed that the differential-thought measure significantly mediated effects of value importance on differential evaluations (Sobel z 2.44, p .015; see Baron & Kenny, 1986).

After the speech interpretation task, participants were asked to report their attitudes toward the topic and to rate how important the issue was to them. Finally, participants were debriefed and dismissed. The only difference between Studies 5A and 5B was the message topic. The topic for Study 5A was the same as that used in previous studies (i.e., Tashkentistan entering the EU). However, Study 5B used a message advocating the building of nuclear power plants in Canada.\nIndependent Variables\nValue importance. Participants were randomly assigned to consider the message in light of either the important or unimportant values used in Studies 1A, 1B, and 3.\nArgument quality. Half of the participants received strong arguments, and half received weak arguments. Participants in Study 5A received the same strong or weak messages as in Studies 1A\u20132B. Participants in Study 5B received either three strong or three weak arguments supporting the building of nuclear power plants in Canada. For example, one strong argument stated that nuclear power was safe because highway transport waste containers can withstand a 30-ft drop and 30-min 1,475 \u00b0F fire. In the weak argument conditions, participants read that the highway transport containers can withstand a 3-ft drop from a truck bed, as well as a 3-min 375 \u00b0F fire (see Blankenship, 2006).\nDependent Variables\nAttitudes. After the speech interpretation task, participants in Study 5A were asked to rate their overall attitude toward Tashkentistan becoming a member of the EU using the same scales as in Studies 1\u20133. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the six items was .88. Participants in Study 5B were asked to rate their attitude toward the building of nuclear power plants in Canada using the same stems as for the previous studies, but replacing \u201cTashkentistan becoming a member of the EU\u201d with \u201cbuilding nuclear power plants in Canada.\u201d The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the six items was .91.\nIssue involvement. Following the attitude measures, participants were asked to rate how involved they were with the message topic using four items. For Study 5A, participants were asked \u201cHow personally involved do you feel with the issue of Tashkentistan entering the EU?\u201d (1 not at all involved, 9 very involved). Consistent with issue importance being a key feature of issue involvement (Petty & Cacioppo, 1990), participants were also asked \u201cHow important is the issue of whether Tashkentistan becomes a member of the EU?\u201d (1 not at all important, 9 very important) and \u201cTo what extent should other people feel the issue of Tashkentistan becoming a member of the EU is important?\u201d (1 not at all important, 9 very important). Finally, participants were asked \u201cTo what extent do you think the issue of\nwhether Tashkentistan becomes a member of the EU warrants consideration?\u201d (1 not at all, 9 very much).

The predicted Value Argument Quality interaction was significant for Study 5A, F(1, 257) 11.58, p .002, and Study 5B, F(1, 120) 6.01, p .017 (see Table 3). That is, the difference between the strong and weak argument conditions was greater when values were important rather than unimportant. Thus, these studies provide replications of value importance effects on amount of processing of the message. In Study 5A, there was also an overall main effect of argument quality, F(1, 257) 16.65, p .001, with strong arguments (M 6.83, SD 1.16) leading to more favorable attitudes than weak arguments (M 6.21, SD 1.30).9\nIssue Involvement\nA 2 (value: important vs. unimportant) 2 (argument quality: strong vs. weak) ANOVA revealed the expected main effect of value in Study 5A, F(1, 257) 9.39, p .002, and Study 5B, F(1, 120) 5.12, p .025. Participants reported that they were more involved with the issue of whether Tashkentistan should be admitted to the EU when they had previously considered values that were important (M 4.54, SD 1.27) rather than unimportant (M 4.07, SD 1.19). Similarly, participants reported greater involvement with the issue of whether more nuclear power plants should be built in Canada when they had previously considered values that were important (M 7.22, SD 1.48) rather than unimportant (M 6.49, SD 2.06). No other effects were significant in either study (Fs 1.00). This pattern of effects makes issue involvement a potential mediator of value importance effects on amount of processing. As noted earlier, past manipulations of issue involvement have relied on manipulations of personal relevance. Participants were asked to report how personally relevant each topic was to them, but the value manipulation had no influence on these perceptions (Fs 1.20).10\n9 Participants also completed thought listings. Similar to the attitude results, there was a greater difference in thought favorability between strong and weak arguments when values were important rather than unimportant, Value Argument Quality interaction, F(1, 257) 18.37, p .001, for Study 5A, and F(1, 120) 11.93, p .001, for Study 5B. Also, as in previous studies, Value Argument Quality effects on attitudes were mediated by Value Thoughts effects (i.e., mediated moderation).\n10 Ratings of issue importance (a core part of issue involvement) might seem to reflect participant attitudes (i.e., the issue is important if I support it, but unimportant if I oppose it). However, the correlation between involvement and attitudes is very small (in Study 5A, r .11; in Study 5B, r .16). This is true for the involvement measure as a whole and for the issue importance items in particular.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly ."}, {"heading": "Mediational Analyses", "text": "If issue involvement is responsible for value effects on elaboration, then controlling for Issue Involvement Argument Quality effects should diminish the impact of Value Argument Quality effects on attitudes. In other words, issue involvement should mediate the moderation of argument quality effects by value importance (cf. Muller et al., 2005; Wegener & Fabrigar, 2000). If issue involvement mediates the moderational effects of value importance, this would be the first evidence that value importance influences amount of processing through perceptions of issue involvement.\nAs reported earlier, the Value Argument Quality interaction significantly predicted participants\u2019 attitudes, Study 5A, b 0.26, t(257) 3.40, p .001; Study 5B, b 0.31, t(120) 2.45, p .017.

When involvement, argument quality, and their interaction were used to predict attitudes, the Involvement Argument Quality interaction was significant, Study 5A, b 0.29, t(255) 4.98, p .001; Study 5B, b 0.26, t(118) 2.76, p .01. Finally, when effects of the proposed mediator were added to the distal predictors of attitudes, the Issue Involvement Argument Quality interaction remained significant, Study 5A, b 0.25, t(255) 4.16, p .001; Study 5B, b 0.22, t(118) 2.01, p .048, whereas the distal Value Argument Quality interaction was reduced, though still significant or marginal, Study 5A, b 0.19, t(255) 2.60, p .01; Study 5B, b 0.13, t(118) 1.78, p .08.11 As noted earlier, the combination of the two significant paths (a direct effect of the distal variable on the mediator and moderation involving that mediator on the back end, when controlling for the distal moderation) supports the mediated moderation pattern (Muller et al., 2005; Wegener & Fabrigar, 2000).12"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Studies 5A and 5B replicated previous effects of value importance increasing processing of a related persuasive message using two different message topics. More importantly, the studies also provided evidence for the proposed mechanism behind value importance effects on elaboration of the message. That is, consider-\nation of important values increased the extent to which participants became personally involved in the topic, and this involvement motivated them to elaborate on message content. These results are important for the current setting because they connect the results to the extensive literature on issue involvement and message processing. They are also important for the issue involvement literature because they provide the first evidence for increased involvement when people consider a topic in general as related to cherished values. Although past discussions of issue involvement have noted that people can become involved with a topic for many reasons (e.g., because the topic addresses cherished people, outcomes, values, or possessions), most past research manipulating issue involvement has focused on personal relevance (e.g., Petty & Cacioppo, 1979; Petty et al., 1981). The current research shows that involvement can be increased by consideration of important values, even in a setting where the values have no effect on perceptions of personal relevance and the resulting attitudes are not viewed as based on the values.\nGeneral Discussion\nValues have long been considered important in creating strong attitudes that are resistant to change and that influence behavior (see Allport, 1961; Rokeach, 1968, 1973). Past discussions of value effects on attitude strength have focused on the benefits of\n11 Using thoughts as a dependent variable produced similar mediated moderation results. The Value Argument Quality interaction significantly predicted thought favorability, Study 5A, b 0.13, t(257) 4.29, p .001; Study 5B, b 0.15, t(120) 3.45, p .002. When involvement, argument quality, and their interaction were used to predict thoughts, there was a significant Involvement Argument Quality interaction, Study 5A, b 0.09, t(257) 3.49, p .001; Study 5B, b 0.16, t(120) 4.74, p .001. When including the effects of all distal predictors plus the involvement main effect and Involvement Argument Quality interaction, the Issue Involvement Argument Quality interaction remained strong and significant, Study 5A, b 0.07, t(255) 2.81, p .005; Study 5B, b 0.13, t(118) 3.07, p .003, whereas the distal Value Argument Quality interaction was reduced, Study 5A, b 0.05, t(255) 0.81, p .28; Study 5B, b 0.05, t(118) 1.77, p .08. The more complete chain of effects may be that value importance influences issue involvement, issue involvement interacts with argument quality to influence thoughts, and issue involvement also interacts with thought favorability to influence attitudes. The mediated moderation with issue involvement mediating effects of value importance on thoughts is presented in this note, and Issue Involvement Thought Favorability effects also mediated Issue Involvement Argument Quality effects on attitudes in Studies 5A and 5B.\n12 Our analyses treated thoughts as mediators of argument quality effects on attitudes. Of course, thoughts could also have been generated to justify recently reported attitudes, despite instructions to report thoughts that came to mind when receiving the message. If so, perhaps one would treat attitudes as a mediator of argument quality effects on thoughts. This would not necessarily conflict with treating attitudes as more thoughtful when argument quality effects occur than when they do not, but the causal chain would look a bit different. In two of the six studies where thought mediation of argument quality effects was presented, either mediational path is empirically plausible (i.e., Studies 1B and 4). However, in the other four studies (i.e., Studies 1A, 2B, 5A, and 5B), attitudes do not serve as statistical mediators of argument quality effects on thoughts, but thoughts do mediate argument quality effects on attitudes. Thus, the general pattern is consistent with the presented analyses.\nTable 3 Means, Standard Deviations, and Simple Effects for Attitudes as a Function of Value Importance and Argument Quality in Studies 5A and 5B\nStudy Values\nArgument quality\ntStrong Weak\n5A Attitudes Important 7.06 (1.17) 5.94 (1.36) 5.07* Unimportant 6.61 (1.11) 6.51 (1.16) 0.51 5B\nAttitudes Important 6.69 (1.20) 6.05 (1.33) 2.93*\nUnimportant 6.16 (1.59) 6.46 (1.46) 0.76\nNote.

Nelson, 1968; Ostrom & Brock, 1969). Because values come with extensive cognitive structures, attaching an attitude to that structure should impart strength to the attitude (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, 1998; Scott, 1969). This approach makes sense, and we do not disagree with it. However, the current research, as well as research by Maio, Olson, and colleagues, suggests that this idea may require some caveats. For example, Maio and Olson (1998) suggested that at least some values may not be associated with extensive cognitive structures. Instead, the values act as truisms, in that the values are easily changed when challenged, presumably because the values are rarely questioned or defended (McGuire, 1964; see also Bernard, Maio, & Olson, 2003). Truistic values may not have the kinds of structure-based effects previously described in the literature.\nThe current research suggests that there may also be less direct effects of values on attitude strength. Consideration of a topic in relation to important values might increase perceptions that the topic itself is important (and, therefore, increase the level of the person\u2019s involvement with the issue). Involvement with the issue can then increase processing of material presented along with those values. If so, then even if the resulting attitudes do not come to represent or express the values themselves (i.e., even if the cognitive structures are not strongly connected), the processing prompted by the values can increase attitude strength (in the current case, resulting in greater resistance to change). The current article reports evidence consistent with each of these mediational steps.\nWhen important values prompt processing, the ultimate result might sometimes be to create direct connections between the values and the attitudes, but it need not be. In the current setting, because the arguments themselves were not phrased such that the values formed the basis for the argument, it may have been less likely for the attitudes to be viewed as representing or expressing the values. Nonetheless, because information processing was extensive when important values were considered, the consideration of important values still created attitudes that were strong. It remains to be seen whether a truistic value is sufficient for creating the current motivating effects of value consideration or whether these effects are most likely with values associated with extensive knowledge structures. If a mere perception of value importance is the key, then even truistic values may produce the current influences of value importance on elaboration of associated messages. This would be an interesting question for future research.\nThe current work also shows that attitudes more successfully resist change in the face of attack when important rather than unimportant values have been considered with the initial message. For the first time, direct mediational analyses showed that the value effects on resistance were mediated by differing amounts of message processing. Thus, at least in the current paradigm, value effects on resistance can be produced indirectly through value effects on amount of processing. Some past research intended to anchor beliefs to values has also suggested that elaboration might be important (e.g., Nelson, 1968). Therefore, it seems reasonable to ask whether value effects on elaboration of the associated message constitute a large part of value effects on resistance, even when persuasive materials\ncreate attitudes that are identified as representing or expressing core values (cf. Holbrook et al., 2005). Because no structurebased value effects on resistance to change have been demonstrated separate from value effects on message processing, it is possible that the current indirect effects are, in fact, the primary reasons for value effects on attitude resistance. It is also quite possible, however, that both types of effects occur under certain circumstances. We can imagine a variety of possible moderators, including whether support or opposition of the values themselves form core parts of the message arguments. We would note, however, that such moderational questions primarily become important when each process has been unambiguously demonstrated in the literature.\nMessage processing effects may also take on different forms when attitudes are viewed as expressing cherished values. In such settings, a persuasive message might be viewed as supporting the value (if the message is proattitudinal) or opposing the value (if the message is counterattitudinal). If the message is viewed as opposing the value, it could be that people are motivated to reject the message or that they attempt to avoid the message altogether (e.g., Maio & Olson, 1995). We look forward to future research addressing potential moderators of the current processing effects of value importance and of the role of processing in resistance when attitudes are explicitly value relevant."}, {"heading": "Potential Limitations", "text": "The current research used what might seem on the face of it to be a rather artificial setting for value consideration. We chose to use an adaptation of the Ostrom and Brock (1968, 1969) procedure because the procedure represents (a) the primary experimental method previously used to demonstrate effects of values on attitude resistance and (b) a situation in which our alternative route from values 3 processing 3 attitude resistance seemed likely to occur, without necessarily going through value-expressive (valuerelevant) attitude properties. It is important to note, however, that the current processing effects are not limited to the current paradigm. We have replicated these processing patterns using alternative methods, such as asking people to write about the relation between the value and the information in the message (cf. Nelson, 1968).\nBlankenship (2006) also presented data showing the same processing effects and involvement-based mediation (using the nuclear power topic from the current Study 5B) when the values were simply presented for 1.5 s prior to the message, with no explicit instructions to consider the values in relation to the message. Participants were told that the research addressed aids to reading comprehension, but there was no speech interpretation task, and participants did not have to do anything with the values to complete the experimental tasks. Clearly, then, the effects of value importance on processing are not limited to situations where participants have to draw links between values and words in a persuasive message.\nFuture research could also address more microlevels, such as how the importance of the value influences perceptions of issue involvement. Previous discussions of issue involvement have simply noted that people become more involved if they perceive the topic as related to important values. But there may be a number of ways that values could influence message recipients\u2019 level of\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\ninvolvement, and these different mechanisms could open up new effects of value consideration. For example, the important value might simply be activated (primed) by the value consideration task. If so, then message recipients might become more involved with any topic ambiguously related to the value (because of its potential relation to the value). Yet these effects might still require a potential relation between the topic and the value in the mind of perceivers.\nOther even broader possibilities also exist. It could be, for example, that important values activate the concept of importance. If so, it could also be that important objects, people, or attitudes might have similar effects. This would suggest that perceived relations between the value and message topic might not be necessary. However, it could be necessary for the activated concept to be broad and applicable to the topic at hand (as a value would often be). When more narrow (specific) or inapplicable concepts are activated, their importance might set up a standard against which the perceived importance of the current message topic is compared (cf. Tormala & Petty, 2007). Of course, if this were to occur, the result could be assimilation toward or contrast away from the importance of the activated construct, depending on how similar the importance levels of the standard and the message topic might be (e.g., Herr, 1986; Sherif & Hovland, 1961; see Mussweiler, 2003). If these priming-based mechanisms are operating, then one could imagine many settings to which the current results would generalize (because values could be activated in a variety of ways, including intentional activation of values by advertisers or other message sources) and some to which the current results would not generalize (because contrast effects of importance would be opposite in direction to the current effects). We look forward to future research that examines the value importance\u2013issue involvement (issue importance) relation in greater detail (see also Blankenship, 2006).\nApplied Implications\nThe current approach could be useful in many applied domains, when communicators seek to influence those who believe that a topic is utterly irrelevant to them. For example, many youths regard health risks, such as smoking-related illness, as unlikely to affect them (Milam, Sussman, Ritt-Olson, & Clyde, 2000). As a result, they pay little attention to messages on the topic, and their health-related behaviors are difficult to change. Yet the present research suggests that there may be routes other than personal relevance to motivate message recipients to pay close attention to information. Many of the same youths who regard ill effects of smoking (or sun exposure, or unsafe sex, or other risky health behaviors) as unlikely to affect them personally still hold a variety of values as important in their lives. Thus, if the current results hold true, communicators may be able to increase processing of these health messages by getting the message recipients to consider the messages in relation to important values (whether or not those values form the crux of the message content). We look forward to testing these implications of the current research.\nReferences\nAbelson, R. P. (1995). Attitude extremity. In R. E. Petty & J. A.

Nadler, 2002; A. Nadler & I. Liviatan, 2004; A. Nadler & N. Shnabel, in press). On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one\u2019s status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one\u2019s image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties\u2019 willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.\nKeywords: reconciliation, conflict resolution, emotional needs, victims, perpetrators\nThe study of conflict and its resolution has generated much theoretical and empirical interest in the last few decades (Jones, 1998; Pruitt, 1998). Most of the research in this field is based on the realist approach to conflict and its resolution, according to which disputes between persons and groups are grounded in conflicts over material interests (Scheff, 1994). Consequently, most of the literature in this field assumes that conflicts are resolved once the relevant parties are able to agree on a formula for redistributing contested resources. In the present article, we focus on reconciliation between opponents as distinguished from conflict resolution. Reconciliation, in contrast to conflict resolution, \u201cmust include a changed psychological orientation towards the other\u201d (Staub, Pearlman, Gubin, & Hagengimana, 2005, p. 301) and may occur only once the parties have resolved the emotional issues that may have left them estranged (Nadler, 2002; Nadler & Liviatan, 2006).\nTheories of reconciliation stress that an end to a conflict cannot be achieved merely by satisfying the instrumental motivations of opponents (such as the motivation to maximize one\u2019s outcomes; Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996). Instead, satisfying the emotional needs of the parties (such as the need to take revenge; Frijda, 1994) is necessary as well. Similarly, theoreticians of negotiation stress that although focusing on tangible issues such as money or property and ignoring intangible issues that relate to the psychological needs of the adversaries is a common practice, it often deadlocks the negotiation (Zubek, Pruitt, Peirce, McGillicuddy, & Syna, 1992). In other words, as long as these emotional needs remain unsatisfied, they block the path to reconciliation. The process of satisfying these emotional needs that impede reconciliation was\ntermed by Nadler (2002) the socio-emotional route to reconciliation. One major way these emotional barriers can be removed is through the apology\u2013forgiveness cycle (Tavuchis, 1991), that is, when a perpetrator apologizes to the victim and when the victim reciprocates by granting forgiveness.\nThe processes of socio-emotional reconciliation has received little attention in social psychology research, and the few studies devoted to this subject have mostly explored factors at the intrapersonal level. Some of these have included attention to affective states (e.g., feeling empathy toward the offender; McCullough, Worthington, & Rachal, 1997) and personality traits (e.g., psychological femininity; McCullough et al., 1998). Others have focused on how parties to a conflict perceive the relationship between them (e.g., perceived quality of alternatives) or the profitability of maintaining the relationship (Rusbult, 1983; Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996; Rusbult, Verette, Whitney, Slovik, & Lipkus, 1991). Consequently, these studies focused on only one side of the conflict (i.e., either on the perpetrator or the victim) and thus have overlooked the interaction between the victim and the perpetrator and the role of this interaction in promoting interpersonal reconciliation. The present research seeks to amend this shortcoming by proposing a model of reconciliation as the outcome of the simultaneous and reciprocal satisfaction of the emotional needs of the perpetrator and the victim.\nReconciliation as an Act of Social Exchange\nThe needs-based model of reconciliation is predicated on the idea that following an episode in which one side has been victimized by another, both the victim and the perpetrator are deprived of certain unique psychological resources. This deprivation brings about different emotional needs in victims and in perpetrators, and until these needs are satisfied they serve as barriers to reconciliation.

In this manner, socio-emotional reconciliation can be framed as an act of social exchange: Reconciliation is facilitated when victims and perpetrators receive needed emotional \u201ccommodities\u201d through postconflict interactions.\nIn a victimization episode, the impairment to the psychological resources of victims and perpetrators is asymmetrical. Victims feel inferior regarding their power (Foster & Rusbult, 1999), honor (Scheff, 1994), self-esteem (Scobie & Scobie, 1998), and perceived control (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Heatherton, 1994) and may experience feelings of victimization or anger (McCullough et al., 1998). In contrast, perpetrators suffer from moral inferiority (Exline & Baumeister, 2000; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002) and may feel guilt (Baumeister et al., 1994), shame (Exline & Baumeister, 2000), or repentance (North, 1998). This myriad of emotional states has been said to reflect the perpetrators\u2019 \u201canxiety over social exclusion\u201d (Baumeister et. al., 1994, p. 246) because they face the threat of being rejected from the moral community to which they belong (Tavuchis, 1991).\nFrom a broader perspective, these impaired emotional resources can be subsumed under the human need for power and the human need for love and belonging, two needs that constitute the core of interpersonal experience (Bennis & Shepard, 1956). Using the terminology of resources theory, which classifies the resources that are exchanged in social interactions into six categories (love, status, services, goods, information, and money; Foa & Foa, 1980), we suggest that the resource that is threatened in victims falls into the category of status (i.e., the need for relative power), whereas the resource that is threatened for perpetrators is associated with the category of love (i.e., the need for relatedness).\nDeprivation of the above resources leads to a corresponding motivational state in which the individual experiences his or her deprivation as a need that must be fulfilled. For victims, this emerges as an enhanced need to restore their sense of power and an increase in power-seeking behavior (Foster & Rusbult, 1999). To achieve this goal, victims are likely to want perpetrators to acknowledge their responsibility for the injustice that they have caused. This acknowledgement creates a kind of \u201cdebt\u201d that only the victim can cancel, and thus returns control to the hands of the victim, who may then determine whether the perpetrator will be forgiven and reaccepted into the moral community (Akhtar, 2002; Minow, 1998; Scho\u0308nbach, 1990). For this reason, victims often try to induce guilt among perpetrators: Perpetrators\u2019 guilt serves as an admission of the debt they owe victims (Baumeister et al., 1994).\nThe perpetrator, unlike the victim, exercises more power and control during the victimization episode. Nevertheless, when perpetrators are accused of violating conventional moral standards or deviating from group norms, they may fear exclusion from the designated moral community to which they belong (Tavuchis, 1991). The anxiety over social exclusion increases perpetrators\u2019 motivation to perceive themselves as acceptable people (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Wotman, 1990) as well as their need to have others express understanding and empathy regarding the circumstances that compelled them to act in a socially unacceptable way (Nadler & Liviatan, 2004, 2006) and empathy for their emotional distress (McCullough et al., 1997). This understanding, in turn, restores perpetrators\u2019 public moral image (i.e., their sense of being perceived as moral individuals) and helps them feel \u201crehumanized\u201d\n(Staub et al., 2005). Empathy and understanding for the perpetrator\u2019s perspective are therefore a kind of \u201cgift\u201d that victims give to those who have offended them, which culminates in their explicitly granting forgiveness (Enright, Freedman, & Rique, 1998). Forgiveness mitigates the moral inferiority engendered by the role of perpetrators (Exline & Baumeister, 2000) and is a reassurance that they belong to the moral community to which their membership was questioned.\nIn line with this reasoning, Carlsmith and Gross (1969) reported that participants who delivered an electric shock to a confederate tended to offer more help to the confederate following the experiment than those who did not deliver the shock. This behavior may be interpreted as a reaction by perpetrators aimed at balancing the impairment to their resource of love (Foa & Foa, 1980).\nThe impairment to the perpetrators\u2019 resource of love consists of a threat to their moral image in the eyes of relevant others (i.e., threat to public moral image) rather than to their feelings of guilt. Research that indicates that victims and perpetrators have different perspectives on the same victimization episode is consistent with the idea that concerns about one\u2019s moral image may be disassociated from perpetrators\u2019 guilt. In fact, while perpetrators are concerned as to whether others view them as moral actors, they often avoid feelings of guilt by minimizing the moral implications of their actions or by denying responsibility for them (Mikula, 2002); in fact, even actions that seem senselessly cruel may be perceived by perpetrators as having at least some redeeming purpose or merit (Baumeister, 1996). This contrasts with victims\u2019 tendency to emphasize the injustice that they suffered and the perpetrator\u2019s responsibility for it. This phenomenon, labeled by Exline and Baumeister (2000) as the magnitude gap underscores the idea that the impairment to perpetrator\u2019s resource of love, which is posited in our model, reflects a threat to perpetrators\u2019 moral image that is relatively independent of their feelings of guilt.\nWhen a successful social exchange takes place between victim and perpetrator, both sides satisfy their emotional needs and cease to feel weaker than or morally inferior to their counterpart. This generates a process of symbolic erasure of the roles of victim and perpetrator, which places the involved parties on a more equal footing (North, 1998) and thus leads to a greater willingness to reconcile with one\u2019s opponent (cf. Nadler & Shnabel, in press). The progress of the socio-emotional route to reconciliation is summarized in Figure 1.\nThe present research was designed to test this model. The first two hypotheses center on the psychological resources that are impaired in the victim and the perpetrator and the needs that result from this impairment. The third and fourth hypotheses focus on the way in which messages of empowerment and acceptance affect victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 views of themselves and their subsequent willingness to reconcile. Accordingly, the major hypotheses are as follows:\nHypothesis 1: For victims, the primary psychological resource that is impaired following a victimization episode is their sense of power, whereas for perpetrators, the primary impairment is to their public moral image (i.e., their perception that others view them as being relatively immoral).\nHypothesis 2: This differential impairment elicits different emotional needs: Perpetrators will express a stronger need for\nsocial acceptance (i.e., that victims should try to understand and accept their perspective), whereas victims will express a stronger need for power.\nHypothesis 3: After receiving a message of empowerment from perpetrators, victims will perceive themselves as more powerful. After receiving a message of acceptance, perpetrators will perceive that others view them as relatively more moral (i.e., will have a higher public moral image).\nHypothesis 4: Restoring victims\u2019 sense of power will enhance their willingness to reconcile with perpetrators. Similarly, restoring perpetrators\u2019 public moral image will enhance their willingness to reconcile with victims.\nWe conducted four studies to test these hypotheses. The first two studies used laboratory experiments: Study 1 tested Hypotheses 1 and 2 (these hypotheses were also tested in naturally occurring situations, in a study briefly described in the Discussion section of Study 1), and Study 2 tested Hypotheses 3 and 4. Study 3 again tested Hypotheses 3 and 4 by using vignettes describing real-life situations. Finally, Study 4 used vignettes in a role-playing methodology to test the whole model (Hypotheses 1\u20134).\nStudy 1\nThe first study was designed to test the first part of our theoretical model: In the course of an offense, victims primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of power and consequently have a stronger need to restore power. By contrast, perpetrators primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of moral worth and hence have a higher need for social acceptance. Unlike past research on victim\u2013perpetrator relations that has investigated this topic through the use of roleplaying techniques (e.g., Foster & Rusbult, 1999) or recall of relevant life situations (e.g., McCullough et al., 1997), we chose a laboratory setting to test our hypotheses. The use of the experi-\nmental method allowed us to randomly assign participants to the victim or perpetrator role in the same controlled social situation. This created two major methodological challenges: The first was to provide a cover story that was ethically sound, given that classical paradigms that produce victims and perpetrators such as the teacher\u2013student paradigm (Milgram, 1974) or the jail paradigm (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973) are unacceptable. The second was to have all participants in the perpetrator condition hurt their victim and believe that they had done so of their own volition.

All instructions and procedures were computerized.\nParticipants were told that they would take part in a \u201ccreativity test\u201d meant to identify participants who had a high potential to work in the advertising industry. To enhance the value of success on the creativity test, participants were told that if they succeeded on the test they could advance to a second and rewarding phase of the study.\nParticipants were then randomly assigned to be either \u201cwriters\u201d or \u201cjudges.\u201d The writers\u2019 task was to write slogans for a list of products that were presented to them, and the judges\u2019 task was to evaluate these slogans. To advance to the second phase of the study, writers had to achieve an average score of at least 85. Judges were told that their advancement to the second phase depended on an assessment by an IAA representative of the quality of their judgment and their ability to evaluate creativity potential. To maintain a high level of psychological relevance of the interaction with the partner, all participants were led to believe that after the test they would have to work together with their partner on a common task.\nJudges in the experimental condition were advised to be strict in their evaluations and to judge the slogans by real-world standards, whereas judges in the control condition were advised to be lenient and regard the slogans as preliminary drafts. It was stressed that following this advice for lenient or strict assessments of the slogans would increase the judges\u2019 chances of passing to the next phase of the experiment, which was presented as highly rewarding. Thus, judges in both conditions were free to choose which grades to give their partners, but in the experimental condition they knew that being too nice to their partner might harm their chances of moving to the next and rewarding phase of the experiment. As a result of these instructions, judges in the experimental condition gave their partners lower grades, and the experimenter later informed them that the writers had failed the test due their harsh\nevaluations. Judges in the control condition gave their partners higher grades, and the experimenter later informed these judges that despite their positive evaluations, the IAA committee declined to advance the writer to the second phase due to external considerations. Writers in the experimental condition received low scores from their partners throughout the exam and consequently failed the test, whereas writers in the control condition received relatively higher scores from their partners but were informed that they failed the test due to the decision of the IAA representatives.\nAfterward, the experimenter asked participants to complete questionnaires, which included the dependent measures.

Ratings for the first two items were highly correlated (r .85) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of victimhood. Ratings for the third and fourth items were also highly correlated (r .86) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of perpetration.\nSense of power. Three 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 self-perception of power: (a) During the interaction with my partner, I felt relatively weak to I felt relatively strong; (b) I did not have a lot of influence on the interaction with my partner to I had a lot of influence; and (c) I had the lower hand to I had the upper hand. Another three items measured the public image of power (i.e., the extent to which participants thought their partners viewed them as powerful): My partner perceives me as. . . (a) relatively weak to relatively strong, (b) not having a lot of control over the interaction between us to having a lot of control, and (c) having relatively low influence on the interaction to relatively high influence. Ratings for the 6 items were averaged to obtain a single measure of sense of power (Cronbach\u2019s .92).\nPublic moral image. Three 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 public moral image (i.e., the extent to which participants believed that their partners viewed them as moral): My partner perceives. . . (a) me as not being completely moral to me as being completely moral, (b) my behavior as not 100% appropriate to my behavior as 100% appropriate, and (c) my behavior as not ethically flawless to my behavior as ethically flawless. Ratings for the three items were averaged to obtain a single measure of public moral image (Cronbach\u2019s .92).\nEmotional needs. Four 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 need for power: I would like to. . . (a) have more influence on the test and its procedure, (b) have more power in the role to which I was assigned, (c) increase my level of control over the interaction between myself and my partner, and (d) have more say during joint work. Participants rated these items from 1 (not particularly) to 7 (very much). Ratings for the four items were\naveraged to obtain a single measure of need for power (Cronbach\u2019s .95).\nFive 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 need for social acceptance: I would like. . . (a) to explain my considerations during the task to my partner, (b) my partner to understand the reasons for my behavior, (c) my partner to know that I tried to act fairly during the test, (d) my partner to know that I did not act out of thoughtlessness, and (e) my partner to understand that I am not a harsh person.

First, the manipulation was successful in producing perpetrators and victims: Judges in the experimental condition perceived themselves as perpetrators to a greater extent than did the participants in the other three conditions, and writers in the experimental condition perceived themselves as victims to a greater extent than did the participants in the other three conditions. Furthermore, our predictions regarding most of the dependent variables were supported: For victims, the primary psychological resource that was impaired was their sense of power, and for perpetrators, the primary impairment was to their public moral image. The results also supported our predictions that the differential impairment of psychological resources would elicit different emotional needs: Victims expressed a stronger need for power, whereas perpetrators expressed a stronger need for social acceptance (i.e., wanting victims to understand and accept their perspective).\nHowever, there was one empirical inconsistency with our predictions that needs to be considered. The unpredicted finding was that writers in the experimental condition expressed a higher need for social acceptance compared with writers in the control condition. This finding does not contradict our theoretical model (because perpetrators nevertheless exhibited the greatest need for social acceptance). Because the victims\u2019 need for social acceptance was related to their need for power (these two measures were strongly correlated, r .37, p .01), it is possible that victims felt that if they could spell out their perspectives to perpetrators, the perpetrators would realize the extent of their wrongdoing and would try to compensate them for this mistreatment.\n1 Here, as well as in all other t tests reported in this article, we conducted Levene\u2019s test for homogeneity of variances and decided whether to assume equal variances accordingly. For the sake of brevity, we do not report the results of the Levene\u2019s tests, but these can be deduced by the reported degrees of freedom of the t tests.\nIn order to extend the generalizability and external validity of our findings, we tested the same hypotheses in a real-world context. Participants in this study were 107 university undergraduates who were instructed to recall a situation in which they had hurt a significant other (perpetrator condition) or were hurt by a significant other (victim condition). Following this, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed (a) self-ratings of power, (b) public moral image, and (c) emotional needs (i.e., the needs for power and social acceptance). The results replicated the findings of Study 1: Victims perceived themselves as weaker than perpetrators and exhibited a higher need for power, whereas perpetrators perceived themselves as having an inferior public moral image compared with victims and exhibited a higher need for social acceptance.2 Taken together, the findings of both studies support the first part of our theoretical model, which asserts that in a victim\u2013perpetrator interaction different psychological resources are impaired for victims and perpetrators and that this leads to the arousal of different emotional needs.\nStudy 2\nStudy 2 tested the second part of our model, which asserts that satisfying the differential emotional needs of victims and perpetrators will facilitate reconciliation between them in the setting of a laboratory experiment. The experiment used the experimental condition of the creativity test paradigm used in Study 1, which was proven effective in producing victims and perpetrators. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the victim condition (i.e., writer) and the other half were assigned to the perpetrator condition (i.e., judge). At the end of the session (i.e., after they were informed of their success or failure in passing to the next phase), participants received messages allegedly sent by their partners. The content of the message emphasized either social acceptance or empowerment or neither social acceptance nor empowerment (i.e., the control condition). Thus, the experimental design was a 2 3 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) Message (empowerment vs. acceptance vs. control). We hypothesized that messages emphasizing empowerment would render victims readier to reconcile, whereas messages emphasizing acceptance would render perpetrators readier to reconcile.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (N 184) were 140 female and 44 male university undergraduates (age: M 23.5 years), who took part in the experiment in fulfillment of a course credit.

Participants completed the feedback form electronically and ostensibly exchanged feedback with their partner by pressing a Send or Receive button.3\nThis feedback consisted of ratings on two subscales, each containing four items. The first subscale rated the participants\u2019 competence on four measures (talent, creativity, originality, and quality of ideas), and the second subscale rated the partners\u2019 agreeableness and interpersonal skills (the extent to which the participant was perceived as kind, agreeable, pleasant to work with, and having good social skills). The manipulation of empowerment through competence feedback and acceptance through feedback on agreeableness and interpersonal skills is consistent with Foa and Foa\u2019s (1980) resource theory as well as with research in the field of empowerment, which treats competence as one of its components (Brookings & Bolton, 2000; Menson & Hartmann, 2002; Vardi, 2000; Yiannakis & Melnick, 2001), and research in the field of agreeableness, which associates this trait with the feeling of being accepted by others (Buckley, Winkel, & Leary, 2004). On the empirical level, the competence feedback was designed to increase participants\u2019 sense of power, and the feedback was aimed at increasing their public moral image; these manipulations were successful in inducing the intended psychological effects.\nIn the empowerment condition, participants received feedback implying that they were perceived by their partners as very competent and creative (receiving an average competence score of 6.5) but mediocre on agreeableness (receiving an average agreeableness score of 3.5); in the acceptance condition, the partners\u2019 feedback implied that they perceived the participant as very agreeable (receiving an average agreeableness score of 6.5) but mediocre in terms of competence (receiving an average competence score of 3.5). In the control condition, the partners\u2019 feedback implied that participants were perceived as mediocre on competence and agreeableness (both average scores were 3.5). After participants finished reading the feedback, they were asked to fill in the dependent measure questionnaire in a manner similar to Study 1 (assessing the manipulation checks as well as the dependent variables: sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile with the partner).4 Upon completion, participants were thanked and debriefed."}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "Manipulation checks.

Receiving a message of empowerment from an opponent positively affected participants\u2019 sense of power, but this change was associated with increased willingness to reconcile only among victims; perpetrators\u2019 willingness to reconcile was not affected by the change in their sense of power. By contrast, receiving a message of acceptance from an opponent positively affected perpetrators\u2019 public moral image, and this change was associated with an increase in their willingness to reconcile. Receiving a message of acceptance did not enhance victims\u2019 public moral image. This result might reflect a ceiling effect; that is, because victims\u2019 public moral image had not been impaired in the first place (as suggested by our model and as indicated by the finding that victims\u2019 average score on public moral image was 5.94 on a 7-point scale), it could not be raised much further. Furthermore, as our claim is that the resources that are damaged for victims and perpetrators are their sense of power and public moral image, respectively, it makes sense that the extent of change in these resources following messages of empowerment or acceptance would be different due to the differences in their perspectives. To replicate the findings of Study 2 and to extend their generalizability, we assessed the next two experiments and the same hypotheses by using vignettes that described real-life situations.\nStudy 3\nStudy 3 tested the same hypotheses tested in Study 2 in the context of a real-life situation. To accomplish this task, we used two versions of the same vignette. Both depicted exactly the same situation but from opposite perspectives: In the perpetrator condition, the protagonist was the offender and the antagonist was the offended party, whereas in the victim condition, the roles were reversed. In the story, the antagonist approached the protagonist after the offense occurred and conveyed a message of empowerment, acceptance, empowerment and acceptance, or none of these.\nIt should be noted that it was highly important for the different messages to be meaningful and relevant for both victims and perpetrators. It is likely that a uniform message such as I understand your perspective or I acknowledge violating your rights without any further reference to the specific context of the incident would be perceived as too general and therefore artificial and even condescending. We therefore decided to phrase different messages for victims and perpetrators that would refer to the specific context and details of the victimization episode and thus be perceived as natural and meaningful for both victims and perpetrators. Despite the different phrasing of the messages, they nevertheless manipulated the same variables (i.e., acceptance and empowerment); furthermore, the measurement of the dependent variables was identical for victims and perpetrators. We therefore conducted the\nanalyses for victims and perpetrators together; the advantage of conducting such an analysis (in contrast to conducting separate analysis for each role) is that it makes it possible to detect a Role Message interaction.\nThe experimental design was thus a 2 2 2 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) Empowerment (included vs. not included) Acceptance (included vs. not included). Because the same theoretical constructs were manipulated differently, this study could have been presented as two 2 (acceptance vs. empowerment) 2 (included vs. not included) experiments (i.e., for perpetrators and victims separately). The cost of such a strategy would have been an inability to assess the statistical significance of the Role Message interaction, which is the central theoretical prediction of this study. We therefore opted for the above 2 2 2 factorial design. The dependent variables (sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile) were identical to those measured in Study 2.\nOn the basis of our theoretical model, we hypothesized that although a message of empowerment would increase sense of power for all participants, it would be associated with greater willingness to reconcile only among victims.

Receiving a message of acceptance increased participants\u2019 public moral image, but the increase in public moral image was related to an increase in willingness to reconcile only among perpetrators; victims\u2019 public moral image was not related to willingness to reconcile. By contrast, receiving a message of empowerment increased participants\u2019 sense of power, but the increase in sense of power was related to willingness to reconcile only among victims; perpetrators\u2019 sense of power did not affect their willingness to reconcile. These findings support the main assertion of our model that willingness to reconcile is mediated by satisfaction of victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 different needs.\nIn addition to these findings, which lend direct support to our model, we also found that the Role Empowerment interaction had a significant effect on both the empowerment manipulation check and the sense of power measurement. These findings indicate that victims were more affected by a message of empowerment than were perpetrators. This might reflect victims\u2019 stronger motivation to restore their sense of power: Because victims\u2019 sense of power is impaired in the victimization episode, they might be more sensitive to messages that remedy this impairment and therefore might be more affected by empowerment messages than might perpetrators, whose sense of power has not been similarly affected.\nSimilarly, the Role Acceptance interaction had a significant effect on both the acceptance manipulation check and the public moral image measurement. These results indicate that perpetrators were more affected by a message of acceptance than were victims. This might reflect perpetrators\u2019 stronger motivation to restore their public moral image; that is, because perpetrators\u2019 public moral image is harmed in the victimization episode, they might be more sensitive to messages that remedy this harm and therefore might be more affected by such messages than might victims, whose public moral image has not been similarly affected. These results are consistent with our theoretical model.\nAnother intriguing finding is that although the manipulations of acceptance and empowerment were perceived as intended, their effects were not orthogonal. Participants perceived messages of acceptance as expressing some amount of empowerment and messages of empowerment as expressing some amount of acceptance. This nonorthogonality was also found in a study that assessed the effects of receiving messages of empathy and responsibility (i.e., acceptance and empowerment in terms of the present study) on participants\u2019 willingness to reconcile in the context of intergroup conflict (Nadler & Liviatan, 2006). Consistent with Nadler and Liviatan\u2019s (2006) suggestion, such nonorthogonality may be unavoidable in the context of a conflict when the opponent makes an unexpected positive gesture. However, this nonorthogonality represents an unavoidable partial overlap rather than equivalence in\nthe effects of these two independent variables. The fact that the magnitude of the effect of each independent variable on its corresponding manipulation check (i.e., acceptance on perceived acceptance and empowerment on perceived empowerment) was higher than its effect on the noncorresponding measure (i.e., empowerment on perceived acceptance and acceptance on perceived empowerment) supports this view. Also, the effects of these two variables on the main dependent measures were consistent with our predictions. This suggests that our manipulations are better seen as emphasizing empowerment or acceptance rather than as excluding one or the other.\nStudy 4\nStudy 4 tested the complete needs-based model of reconciliation, from the differential impairment of the psychological resources of victims and perpetrators through the fulfillment of victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 emotional needs, resulting in the increased willingness of the two sides to reconcile. Unlike the previous experiments, which assessed participants\u2019 perceptions following a victimization episode (Study 1) or their perceptions following the receipt of a message from their adversary (Studies 2 and 3), Study 4 assessed participants\u2019 perceptions and willingness to reconcile before and after receiving a message from their rival. Thus, it examined the full range of the model\u2019s hypotheses.

We predicted that, as in Study 1, before receiving the message, victims would perceive themselves as weaker than perpetrators and would therefore express a higher need for power, whereas perpetrators would perceive themselves as having a worse public moral image compared with that of victims and would therefore express a higher need for social acceptance.\nOn the basis of our theoretical model, we also hypothesized that participants who received a message of acceptance from their partner would exhibit higher ratings for public moral image than would those who received a message of empowerment. In contrast, a message of empowerment should enhance participants\u2019 sense of power more than should a message of acceptance. Further, we predicted that the increase in participants\u2019 public moral image would be related to an increased willingness to reconcile only for perpetrators, whereas an increase in participants\u2019 sense of power would be related to an increased willingness to reconcile only for victims.

First, this study replicated the findings of Study 1 that being a perpetrator threatens one\u2019s public moral image, resulting in a greater need for social acceptance, and that being a victim threatens one\u2019s sense of power, resulting in a greater need for power. Second, the repeated measures analyses revealed that the messages of acceptance and empowerment had the expected effect on the restoration of participants\u2019 psychological resources: The increase in participants\u2019 sense of power was higher following a message of empowerment than following a message of acceptance; in contrast, the increase in participants\u2019 public moral image was higher following a message of acceptance than following a message of empowerment. Third, as expected, the increase in victims\u2019 willingness to reconcile was higher in the empowerment condition than in the acceptance condition, whereas the reverse pattern was true for perpetrators, whose willingness to reconcile increased in the acceptance condition more than it did in the empowerment condition. Thus, the restoration of the differentially impaired psychological resources of victims and perpetrators promoted their willingness to reconcile.\nThe finding that across conditions (i.e., after receiving any positive message from their partner, either acceptance or empowerment) victims\u2019 sense of power increased, whereas that of perpetrators\u2019 decreased, which may imply a regression to the mean effect on the second measurement. Alternatively, for victims, this increase in sense of power may indicate that their greater need for power led them to interpret any positive message from their partner as affirming their power. The parallel finding that the increase in public moral image across conditions was significantly higher for perpetrators than for victims may be similarly explained as reflecting perpetrators\u2019 greater need for signs of acceptance, which may have led them to interpret any positive gesture from their partner as implying acceptance. Finally, the perpetrators\u2019, but not the victims\u2019, greater increase in willingness to reconcile across conditions, which cannot by explained as a regression to mean effect (as perpetrators\u2019 initial level of willingness to reconcile was higher than that of victims), may be interpreted as reflecting their relatively greater need to restore social harmony with the victim, which finds expression in willingness to reconciliation in response to any positive indication from the other side.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe above four experiments support the hypotheses of the needs-based model of reconciliation. Taken together, these studies indicate that a victimizing episode makes victims feel less powerful and perpetrators feel more morally inadequate. Thus, the main psychological resource that is damaged for victims is their sense of power, whereas the main psychological resource that is damaged\nfor perpetrators is their sense of belongingness and social acceptance. Consequently, a social exchange interaction that restores the respective psychological resources of the adversaries facilitates their willingness to reconcile. These findings support the main tenet of our model, which states that reconciliation between adversaries depends on satisfying relevant emotional needs and restoring their damaged psychological resources.\nThe empirical support for our hypotheses is underscored by the methodological differences that existed between the five studies: Studies 1 and 2 tested the hypotheses in the context of a laboratory experiment in which the social role (victim or perpetrator) was determined ad hoc, whereas Studies 3 and 4 were role-playing experiments in which participants imagined how they would feel and act in a vignette they had read; yet another study (mentioned in the Discussion section of Study 1) used the context of real-life situations. The studies also differed on the following dimensions: (a) the characteristics of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, such as whether these were relationships between strangers who had not met before (Studies 1 and 2) or imagined relationships in the workplace that were either hierarchical (Study 3) or equal (Study 4); and (b) the type of harm caused, such as limiting the victim\u2019s capacity to influence the situation (Study 3), harming the victims\u2019 self-esteem (Studies 1 and 2), or a combination of the two (Study 4).\nThe primary contribution of the model is that it presents a motivational perspective on socio-emotional reconciliation processes. Although existing models of conflict resolution address the motivations of adversaries in conflict, these motivations are usually conceptualized in general and unspecific terms, such as the motivation for maximization of outcomes (Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996). In contrast, the present model outlines specific motivations and pinpoints how they are related to the impairment of psychological resources among parties in conflict. Furthermore, the model differentiates between the emotional motivations of victims and perpetrators, as opposed to prior studies that have focused on only one side of the conflict\u2014usually the victim. In place of this one-sided focus, the current perspective focuses on the interaction between victims and perpetrators and how this may facilitate (or inhibit) reconciliation between them. Naturally, such a perspective is theoretically and empirically more complex. The main assertion of the model\u2014that reconciliation requires a successful emotional \u201cbarter\u201d between victims and perpetrators integrates intrapersonal processes with interpersonal processes in a manner that is characteristically absent from social psychology (Semin, 1997).\nThe needs-based model of reconciliation offers a general theoretical framework for understanding the findings of other studies in the field. Findings that the effectiveness of an apology increases when accompanied by an admission of guilt by the perpetrator (Darby & Schlenker, 1982) might be interpreted as reflecting the fact that an admission of guilt satisfies victims\u2019 need for empowerment. Fatal quarrels instigated \u201cover nothing,\u201d which are the focus of Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, and Schwarz\u2019s (1996) study on the Southern culture of honor, are not conflicts over the division of contested resources. In terms of our model, these are conflicts over the emotional resources of acceptance and empowerment. Similarly, the social needs for vengeance (discussed by Frijda, 1994) and for forgiveness (Enright et al., 1998) may be conceptualized as reflecting victims\u2019 need to restore their sense of power and perpetrators\u2019 need to restore their public moral image and sense of belonging to the community."}, {"heading": "The Type of Victimization Episodes Used in the Present Research and the Question of Culpability", "text": "Because our model addresses the interaction between parties in conflict, it was important to be able to randomly assign participants to the role of perpetrator and victim in both laboratory experiments and the role-playing vignettes. Random assignment to the role of victim is relatively easy because of the passive nature of this social role. The induction of the perception that one is a perpetrator is more difficult. It requires that participants view themselves as having volitionally hurt another person who had done them no harm. Situations in which the victimization is done unintentionally (e.g., the perpetrator looked after the victim\u2019s child and did not pay attention to the child\u2019s drinking of a poisonous substance\u2014a vignette used by Scho\u0308nbach, 1990) are inadequate for this purpose as they do not follow the conditions required for the attribution of blame, that is, that the perpetrator will be able to foresee the consequences of his conduct, have control over his behavior, and behave intentionally in a given way (Shaver, 1985). Situations in which a person hurts another person with no immediately available justification (e.g., a sadistic act) are also problematic as it would have been impossible to randomly place participants in an experimental setting in which they hurt another person for no apparent reason or justification; similarly, in the case of role-playing studies, it does not make sense that such situations would produce an appropriate level of identification. Thus, the induction of perpetration that holds moral responsibility is possible only if viewed by the average person as related to contextual demands such as job requirements or conflicting interests (such as when favoring selfinterest involves hurting the partner and vice versa).\nAlthough at first glance this characteristic of the present research may seem to limit the generalizability of the findings and the model, closer scrutiny reveals that this is not the case. First, most daily real-life interactions between victims and perpetrators have characteristics that are similar to the ones in our research. In fact, when we asked people to report on real-life episodes in which they had caused harm to another person (i.e., see description of the study in the Discussion section of Study 1) they reported episodes in which there had been some justification to hurt the other person, such as preferring one\u2019s own interests over the other\u2019s interests, retaliation for previous harm done to them, doing an honest job of criticizing the other, unwillingness to have the extent of proximity desired by the victims (such as in breaking up with a romantic partner), et cetera. Although one could argue that such accounts represent selective reporting, research indicates that perpetrators tend to deny their culpability, even when their behavior is judged as blameworthy by others (Baumeister, 1996; Mikula, 2002). The gap between victims and perpetrators in their perceptions of the latter\u2019s culpability is consistent with current literature on justice, which suggests that people\u2019s affective reactions (e.g., anger or satisfaction) to the outcome of a certain situation influences their judgments of its fairness rather than the other way around (in other words, justice judgments are emotionally, rather than cognitively, based; Mullen & Skitka, 2006). It makes sense that because victims and perpetrators experience different emotions following a victimization episode, their perceptions of it as unjust, and consequently, their perceptions of the perpetrator\u2019s blameworthiness/culpability, will be different in a predictable/consistent\nmanner. For this reason, it is claimed that \u201cevil is in the eyes of the beholder\u201d (Baumeister, 1996, p. 1).\nSecond, this characteristic of our research does not affect the major claim of our model. It should be recalled that the model suggests that regardless of feelings of objective or subjective justifications and the associated feelings of guilt that one has for having harmed another person, perpetrators have a need to ameliorate the perception that others view their behavior as wrong and relatively immoral. This perception represents a threat to inclusion in one\u2019s moral community that a message of acceptance is argued to ameliorate. Such perceptions of threat to inclusion in the moral community were successfully induced in our experiments as is evidenced by the decrease in public moral image suffered by participants who had been randomly assigned to the role of perpetrators."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Research Directions", "text": "The present model suggests a number of issues that may be researched in the future. The first of these is that the dependent variable measured in Studies 2, 3, and 4 was a self-rated willingness to reconcile. Because the success of the reconciliation process is highly dependent upon the adversaries\u2019 attitudes (e.g., their willingness to be involved in such a process, their perceptions of future relations) we believe this measure to be adequate for testing our model\u2019s hypotheses. However, because we aim to apply our model to real-life conflicts, it remains for future research to determine the extent to which self-rated willingness to reconcile predicts actual reconciliatory behavior.\nSecond, our model and research focuses on situations in which there is a relative consensus regarding who the victim is. Yet, in many real-life situations in which such consensus does not exist, both parties may perceive themselves as victims, and there may even exist a degree of competition over who is the \u201creal\u201d victim (Nadler, 2002). Although we assume that our model also applies to such complex situations, it remains for future research to address this issue empirically.\nThird, applying the needs-based model of reconciliation to intergroup contexts might provide a broad framework to test variables, such as strength of ingroup identification, collective guilt (Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, & Manstead, 1998), and level of social categorization (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005), which have been found to influence the willingness of group members to reconcile. Nadler and Liviatan (2006) provided partial support for the model\u2019s applicability to the intergroup level in a study that tested the willingness of Jewish Israelis to reconcile with Palestinians. The researchers found that in predicting willingness to reconcile, Jewish Israeli subjects (who belong to the more powerful party in the conflict and are therefore likely to be viewed as the guilty oppressors) were more responsive to Palestinians\u2019 expressions of empathy with Israelis (which can be viewed as a manifestation of social acceptance) than to Palestinians\u2019 acceptance of responsibility for hurting them (which can be viewed as a manifestation of empowerment). However, further research is required in order to provide more comprehensive support for the model\u2019s applicability at the intergroup level.\nFinally, on the practical level, the needs-based model of reconciliation can contribute to the advancement of emotionally intelligent justice (a term suggested by Sherman, 2003) through the\ndevelopment of restorative practices, that is, practices that restore relationships, connections among people, trust, and mutual understanding and thus make cooperative problem solving possible (Wachtel & McCold, 2001). These practices involve nurturing the expression of vulnerable emotions (Braithwaite, 2006), and our model can cast light upon the nature of these emotions as well as on the psychological needs that lie beneath them.\nIn conclusion, our focus on the emotional motivations underlying the reconciliation process comes on the heels of a relatively long period during which these motivations were neglected in favor of more instrumental concerns. However, understanding the factors that help to repair relationships between victims and perpetrators has practical meaning for the fields of conflict resolution and reconciliation.\nReferences\nAkhtar, S.

Much of this work, however, has employed outcome variables that are subjective. For example, in the study of teacher effectiveness, both the predictor (naive observers\u2019 ratings) and the outcome (teaching evaluations) were based on subjective opinions. Similarly, electoral success is based on voters\u2019 impressions of candidates, which are also responsible for which candidates are elected. In the current study, we examined the relation between a subjective predictor and an objective performance outcome: Are impressions of chief executive officers (CEOs) related to the performance of their companies?\nDespite the ubiquitous perception of the CEO as the embodiment of a company, there is no clear evidence of any relation between CEOs\u2019 personalities and their companies\u2019success (Ranft, Zinko, Ferris, & Buckley, 2006). Although some studies show that mediating factors, such as environmental context, can link factors like CEOs\u2019 charisma to companies\u2019 performance, no direct relation between CEOs\u2019 personalities and companies\u2019 success has been found (Agle, Nagarajan, Sonnenfeld, & Srinivasan, 2006; Tosi, Misangyi, Fanelli, Waldman, & Yammarino, 2004).\nPrevious research, however, has shown that personality traits associated with the evaluation of leadership overlap with traits that can be judged reliably from the face. These traits include competence, likeability, and trustworthiness (Todorov et al., 2005) and dominance (Hess, Adams, & Kleck, 2005). Another facial feature related to judgments of leadership is facial maturity (Zebrowitz & Montepare, 2005). Are these variables that can be gauged from facial information also associated with leaders\u2019 success and performance? To answer this question, we asked participants to make naive personality judgments from the photographs of the CEOs from the 25 highest and 25 lowest ranked\ncompanies of the Fortune 1,000 and examined whether these judgments related to measures of the companies\u2019 financial success.\nMETHOD"}, {"heading": "Stimuli", "text": "We selected the 25 highest and 25 lowest ranked companies from the 2006 listing on the Fortune 500 Web site (http://money. cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500).

Data for one CEO were removed from analysis because his score was more than 3 standard deviations below the mean for all CEOs. For the five personality traits, we conducted a principal components analysis with varimax rotation and obtained two factors: Power (competence, dominance, and facial maturity; 47% variance explained) and Warmth (likeability and trustworthiness; 39% variance explained). Hence, for each CEO, we computed composite power and warmth scores by averaging the scores for the traits loading on each factor.\nWe then calculated partial correlations between the independent measures (power scores, warmth scores, and leadership scores) and dependent measures (mean company revenues for FY 2004\u20132006 and mean company profits for FY 2004\u20132006), controlling for attractiveness, affective expression, and age. Table 1 summarizes the results.\nRatings of power-related traits from CEOs\u2019 faces, after controlling for age, affect, and attractiveness, were significantly related to company profits, r(41) 5 .36, p < .025. Thus, some element of financial success seems to be communicated through\nfacial appearance. Further, ratings of CEO leadership were also strongly related to company profits, r(41) 5 .30, p < .05; however, power and leadership were not significantly related to one another, r(41) 5 .08, p 5 .60. Similarly, the relation between profits and leadership remained significant after controlling for power, r(40) 5 .36, p < .025, and the relation between profits and power remained significant after controlling for leadership, r(40) 5 .40, p < .01.2 Thus, participants\u2019 naive perceptions of leadership ability from CEOs\u2019 faces are significantly related to how much profit those CEOs\u2019 companies make. Moreover, these judgments of leadership are not related to judgments of perceived power.\nThese findings suggest that naive judgments may provide more accurate assessments of individuals than well-informed judgments can. Our results are particularly striking given the uniformity in the CEOs\u2019 appearances. All the CEOs were male, of approximately the same age, and ostensibly Caucasian. Even when we controlled for age, affect, and attractiveness, CEOs from more versus less successful companies could be distinguished via naive judgments based solely on perceptions of the CEOs\u2019 facial appearance. Of course, we cannot draw any causal inferences as to whether more successful companies choose individuals with a particular appearance to be their CEOs or whether individuals with a particular appearance emerge as more successful in their work as CEOs. We can conclude, however, that naive inferences from facial appearance may provide information not only about subjective preference, but also about objective performance.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank Preeti Mehta, Sanjiv Mirchan-\ndani, Susan Pinto, and Mathew Sullivan.

The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).\nKeywords: information seeking, selective exposure, information quantity, selection criterion, information direction\nIndividuals often systematically prefer information that is consistent with their beliefs, attitudes, or decisions and, in contrast, neglect inconsistent information. This phenomenon is called selective exposure to (consistent) information and previous research has revealed that such biased information-search processes occur in different contexts, including attitudes (Lundgren & Prislin, 1998), stereotypes (Johnston, 1996; Trope & Thompson, 1997), expectations (Pinkley, Griffith, & Northcraft, 1995), and selfserving conclusions (Frey, 1981a; Holton & Pyszczynski, 1989). Most important to the focus of the present article, biased information search has also been consistently observed following individ-\nual and group decisions (for individual decision making see Frey, 1986; Jonas, Greenberg, & Frey, 2003; Jonas, Schulz-Hardt, Frey, & Thelen, 2001; for group decision making see Kray & Galinsky, 2003; Schulz-Hardt, Frey, Lu\u0308thgens, & Moscovici, 2000; SchulzHardt, Jochims, & Frey, 2002). Although there is a great deal of research supporting the existence of the selective-exposure phenomenon, other influential research in this area has unexpectedly found that decision makers can also exhibit a strong preference for inconsistent information (e.g., Freedman, 1965; Freedman & Sears, 1965; Sears, 1965). Because these results led to the question of whether the selective-exposure phenomenon exists at all, the present article tries to resolve these contradictory findings on information search after decision making. In short, we propose that differences due to available information quantity as well as associated different selection criteria as underlying psychological processes moderate whether decision makers prefer decisionconsistent or decision-inconsistent information.\nSelective-Exposure Research\nA great deal of empirical research on selective exposure to information has been conducted in the context of dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957, 1964; Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001; see also D\u2019Alessio & Allen, 2002). Dissonance theory suggests that subsequent to having made a decision, decision makers experience cognitive dissonance because of the salient negative aspects of the selected alternative and the salient positive aspects of the rejected alternative. Dissonance is experienced as an aversive affective\nPeter Fischer, School of Psychology, Social, Economic, and Organizational Psychology Unit, University of Exeter, Exeter, England; Stefan Schulz-Hardt, Institute of Psychology, Economic and Social Psychology Unit, University of Go\u0308ttingen, Go\u0308ttingen, Germany; Dieter Frey, Department of Psychology, Social Psychology Unit, Ludwig-MaximiliansUniversity, Munich, Germany.\nParts of the data from this article were presented in a talk at the International Congress of Psychology conference in Beijing, August 2004, as well as in a talk at a conference in Heidelberg, September 2003.

One prominent means of reducing dissonance is selective exposure to consistent information (Festinger, 1957; Frey, 1986).\nIn the standard research paradigm (see e.g., Frey, 1981a, 1981b, 1981c; Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001), participants are confronted with a decision problem that requires them to decide between two different alternatives (e.g., whether the contract of a manager should be extended or not or whether a company should invest in Developing Country A or B). They are asked to make a preliminary or final decision and afterward have the opportunity to freely search for additional decision-consistent and decision-inconsistent information among a set of equally distributed consistent and inconsistent pieces of information (e.g., 6 consistent and 6 inconsistent pieces of information; cf. Fischer, Jonas, Frey, & SchulzHardt, 2005; Frey, 1986). Selective exposure to supporting information occurs when participants systematically select more consistent than inconsistent pieces of decision-relevant information (Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001). So far, various variables have been identified that increase the tendency to prefer consistent information after decision making, for example, strong commitment to a position (Frey, 1986; Schwarz, Frey, & Kumpf, 1980), situations with high freedom of choice (Cotton & Hieser, 1980; Frey, 1981b; Frey & Wicklund, 1978), when decisions are irreversible (Frey, 1981c), or when individuals are in negative affective states (Jonas, Graupmann, & Frey, 2006).1\nIn striking contrast to the overall preference for consistent information found in the above-mentioned studies, as well as in many others, an influential research program conducted by Freedman (1965) and Sears (1965) consistently found that people systematically prefer information that is inconsistent with their decisions and standpoints. For example, in the Freedman study, participants listened to an interview with a college student who had applied for an international conference abroad. The student was described as either rather competent or incompetent. Participants then had to decide whether the student\u2019s request should be granted or not. Subsequently, 2 additional pieces of information were available: 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent with their prior decision. Participants were instructed to choose only 1 piece of information. Contrary to the selective-exposure hypothesis of dissonance theory, a strong preference for inconsistent information was observed: 94% of all participants selected the inconsistent piece of information. Corresponding results were obtained by Sears, who used a similar information-seeking paradigm in the context of a legal decision case. Participants had to decide whether a defendant was guilty or not and subsequently had the chance to select either decision-consistent or decision-inconsistent information. As in the Freedman study, a similar strong preference for inconsistent information was observed. As a consequence, the contradictory results of this research program subsequently led to a significant decrease in interest in selective-exposure effects. These differences call for an examination of why this research program by Freedman and Sears yielded results at odds with those found in corresponding dissonance research.\nThe Impact of Information Quantity on Selective Exposure: The Present Research\nWe propose that the crucial difference between studies finding a preference for decision-consistent information and studies find-\ning a preference for decision-inconsistent information is the available quantity of decision-relevant information. In the Freedman and Sears studies, participants chose between only 2 pieces of information: 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent with the prior decision (Freedman, 1965; Freedman & Sears, 1965; Sears, 1965). In contrast, studies finding a preference for decision-consistent information normally confronted participants with approximately 8 to 16 (half consistent and half inconsistent) pieces of additional information (e.g., Fischer et al., 2005; Frey, 1981a, 1981b, 1981c; Jonas et al., 2001; Schulz-Hardt et al., 2000; Schwarz et al., 1980; for an overview see also Frey, 1986). Thus, it seems that if decision makers have to choose between 2 pieces of information, they prefer the inconsistent one. If, however, they are confronted with larger amounts of information, they exhibit a preference for consistent information."}, {"heading": "Underlying Psychological Processes", "text": "We propose that there are three possible psychological processes that could underlie the expected moderating effect of information quantity on selective exposure: (a) differences due to the amount of aroused dissonance and threat, (b) differences in processing complexity, and (c) different activated selection criteria. In the following, we outline these different potential psychological processes.\nDissonance and threat explanation. From the perspective of dissonance theory, the differential effect of information quantity on the preference for decision-consistent versus decisioninconsistent information could be explained by (a) different refutation strategies as well as (b) differences in dissonance (threat) arousal. With regard to (a), refuting inconsistent information is the most effective way to achieve an enduring and stable reduction in post-decisional dissonance (cf. Frey, 1986). Hence, when decision makers are confronted with only 2 (1 consistent and 1 inconsistent)\n1 Selective exposure to information should not be mixed up with a positive test strategy in hypothesis testing (e.g., Devine, Hirt, & Gehrke, 1990; Klayman & Ha, 1987; Slowiaczek, Klayman, Sherman, & Skov, 1992). In research on information search in the context of social hypothesis testing, participants are asked to test hypotheses about other people, for example, whether a person is an extrovert or an introvert (Snyder & Swann, 1978). If participants test the hypothesis that a specific person is an extrovert, they are systematically inclined to ask questions about typical extrovert rather than introvert behaviors. In contrast, when participants test the introvert hypothesis, they systematically ask more questions about introvert rather than extrovert behaviors. To put it differently, individuals ask questions that, in case of a positive answer, would confirm the hypothesis under consideration. In significant contrast to the present selective exposure to information paradigm (Festinger, 1957; Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001), a person asking hypothesis-consistent questions does not know in advance whether the answer will be consistent or inconsistent to the hypothesis under consideration. In addition, previous research has revealed that the employment of a positive test strategy does not depend on a person\u2019s own opinion: Semin and Strack (1980) have shown that even if the hypothesis tester is made to believe that the target is an extrovert, the tester still asks more questions about introvert behaviors because the experimental task was to test whether the target person is an introvert (Semin & Strack, 1980). In sum, positive hypothesis testing is a tendency that is phenomenologically as well as conceptually significantly different from selective exposure to information (see also Schulz-Hardt et al., 2007).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npieces of information, the most effective way to bring about a long-lasting reduction in dissonance is to refute the inconsistent information. However, if the number of pieces of available inconsistent information increases, selecting and refuting all of the inconsistent information becomes more and more difficult due to limited cognitive resources and time constraints. In addition, if only 1 piece of information can be chosen, selecting and subsequently refuting this 1 piece of inconsistent information would still leave several remaining inconsistent pieces of information nonrefuted. Consequently, increasing the number of pieces of inconsistent information should result in a stronger preference for consistent information, which (next to refuting all inconsistent pieces of information) offers the second-best opportunity to reduce dissonance (cf. Frey, 1986). With regard to the differences in dissonance arousal, in the 2-information condition, the potential for dissonance or threat arousal is comparatively low because only 1 piece of inconsistent or threatening information exists for the decision maker. In contrast, conditions with more than 1 inconsistent piece of information should lead to a comparatively higher degree of postdecision dissonance because several inconsistent pieces of information exist for the decision maker. Hence, because of higher dissonance and threat arousal in the 10-information condition, decision makers should be more inclined to select the consistent piece of information than they would be in the less dissonance and threat arousing 2-information condition.\nComplexity explanation. This explanation assumes that the preference for consistent information gets stronger with an increasing degree of complexity in the decision task and in the associated information-seeking process. Increasing quantities of available decision-relevant information (as is the case in selective-exposure studies with more than 2 pieces of available information) increase the complexity of decision tasks. High complexity, in turn, increases the need for closure (cf. Kruglanski & Webster, 1996), which represents a motivation to reduce decision complexity by \u201cfreezing\u201d a decision alternative as fast as possible. Thereby, an effective way to reduce cognitive complexity in decision making is to predominantly search for decision-consistent information, which helps to bolster one\u2019s own decision. In summary, according to the complexity explanation, studies with a larger number of available decision-relevant pieces of information increase decision complexity, which in turn might trigger decision makers\u2019 need for closure and thus lead to an increased preference for consistent information.\nSelection-criteria explanation. This explanation is based on the assumption that different information quantities trigger different selection criteria for information search, which in turn result in different information preferences. Furthermore, it is assumed that the use of selection criteria for information search follows the principle of minimum effort. Correspondingly, people choose among possible selection criteria the one that best differentiates between the available pieces of information. If there is more than one selection criterion that fits this description, decision makers choose the one that entails the least processing effort. We propose that two selection criteria are particularly relevant for our experimental situations: (a) information quality and (b) information direction. With regard to information quality, previous research has consistently revealed that information search can be strongly determined by the assessment of expected information quality (Fischer et al., 2005; Schulz-Hardt, Fischer, & Frey, 2007). That is,\non the basis of main arguments (which are the typical basis for information search), decision makers often try to find the qualitatively best decision-relevant information in their information search. However, because of a basically more critical testing of inconsistent information (cf. Ditto & Lopez, 1992; Ditto, Scepansky, Munro, Apanovitch, & Lockhart, 1998) and a systematic skewing of a priori knowledge toward one\u2019s own standpoints (cf. Chaiken, Giner-Sorolla, & Chen, 1996; Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989), consistent information normally has a general advantage in the assessment of information quality and thus is systematically preferred in information search (given information quality is the salient selection criterion; cf. Fischer et al., 2005; Schulz-Hardt et al., 2007). With regard to information direction, other research has revealed that decision makers show balanced information search (or even a preference for inconsistent information) when they try to be or to appear as unbiased decision makers and information processors (cf. Kunda, 1990; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987). Thus, a high salience of information direction (in contrast to a high salience of information quality) might increase decision makers\u2019 attempts to be and/or appear balanced and unbiased, which in turn should increase their striving for inconsistent information.\nTransferred to our experimental situation with only 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 10) pieces of information, these considerations imply the following: Given 2 available pieces of information (1 decision consistent, 1 decision inconsistent), decision makers do not need to consider expected information quality (which is effortful to detect) as a selection criterion. Instead they can use the more easily detectable information direction, which fully distinguishes between the available pieces of information. If information direction is the salient selection criterion, a preference for inconsistent information should prevail because the decision maker tries to be (or at least to seem to be) unbiased, objective, and fair in their information processing (cf. Kunda, 1990; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987). In contrast, given the situation where more than 2 pieces of information (e.g., 10) are available (half of them supporting and half conflicting with the prior decision), the information direction does not fully distinguish among the available pieces of information anymore. That is, on the basis of information direction alone, it is not possible for the decision maker to identify and select the most relevant piece of information. As a consequence, the decision maker uses the more effortful evaluation of the expected information quality in order to decide which piece of information to choose. Hence, because consistent information mostly appears to be of higher quality than inconsistent information (cf. Fischer et al., 2005; Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979), an increased preference for consistent information should emerge in conditions with more than 2 pieces of available consistent and inconsistent information (e.g., in classic conditions with 10 pieces of information\u2013\u20135 consistent and 5 inconsistent with the participant\u2019s decision or standpoint).\nThe following studies were designed to test whether different quantities of decision-relevant information moderate differences between studies that find a preference for decision-consistent information and studies that find a preference for decisioninconsistent information (Studies 1\u20134). Furthermore, we investigated the psychological processes that underlie this expected effect; we tested whether the expected effect of information quantity on information preferences is due to complexity processes\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\n(Study 2), dissonance and threat processes (Study 3), or different salient selection criteria (Studies 2\u20134).\nStudy 1\nThe goal of the first experiment was to test whether the quantity of available information moderates decision makers\u2019 preference for consistent versus inconsistent decision-relevant information. Participants made a decision on a legal case study. Afterward, they selected 1 piece of information among either 2 or 10 pieces of information (half consistent and half inconsistent). Participants in the condition with 2 pieces of information were expected to systematically prefer inconsistent information and thus replicate the classic findings of the Freedman (1965) and Sears (1965) studies (cf. Freedman & Sears, 1965). In contrast, participants in the condition with 10 pieces of information were expected to significantly prefer consistent information and thus replicate the typical findings of recent research on selective exposure (cf. Fischer et al., 2005; Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants and design. Sixty-four students (38 women and 26 men, 16 to 32 years of age) from a high school in Kiel and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (both cities located in Germany) participated in this experiment. It was a one-factorial design with two experimental conditions (2 pieces of information vs. 10 pieces of information) for the factor Information Quantity, with the direction of the selected information (consistent vs. inconsistent) as the dependent variable.\nMaterials. In order to keep our experimental material as close as possible to the material used by Sears (1965) and Freedman (1965), participants were confronted with a legal decision case that was slightly adapted to the German legal system. The decision case contained a hearing of evidence concerning the death of Mr. Schulz, a 19-year-old insurance broker, who lived with his father. Mr. Schulz\u2019s father was unemployed, which contributed to the violent climate within the family: Fights between father and son were common. In a recent fight, Mr. Schulz succumbed to a fatal knife wound. The father then faced court charged with murder. However, it was unclear whether the son\u2019s death was murder or manslaughter. Unfortunately, the only possible eyewitness\u2014Mr. Schulz\u2019s mother\u2014had been struck on the head during the fight and was thus unconscious for most of it. Evidence procured from the scene of the incident was ambiguous.2\nAfter participants had read the legal case study, they finally decided whether Mr. Schulz was murdered by his father or not. Afterward, participants were informed that either 2 or 10 pieces of additional information concerning the court proceeding were available. Each piece of information was characterized by a main thesis containing information direction (i.e., whether they were consistent or inconsistent with the prior decision) and a short explanation. Participants learned that these main theses represented one full page of more detailed statements and were appraisals by legal experts who were familiar with the court proceedings. An example of a piece of information implying that the father killed Mr. Schulz is as follows: \u201cMr. Schulz fought with his father on numerous occasions. This should be evidence enough of the guilt of the father.\u201d An example assuming the innocence of the father is as\nfollows: \u201cWe have no fingerprints on the knife and no witnesses. Without such evidence, Mr. Schulz\u2019s father should be released.\u201d In both conditions, half of the statements spoke for and half spoke against a conviction of Mr. Schulz. Hence, irrespective of the participants\u2019 previous decision, half of the pieces of information were consistent and half were inconsistent with this decision. The participants could select only 1 piece of information\u2014either a consistent or an inconsistent one. Please note that this instruction to select only 1 piece of information is very important and necessary to keep information-search conditions comparable, otherwise (under conditions of free choice) information search (i.e., number of pieces of information that could be selected) and information quantity (number of pieces of information to which participants are exposed) would be confounded. After information selection, the experiment ended and participants were debriefed, thanked for their participation, and dismissed."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Check for interfering effects. Of the 64 participants, 39 decided for a conviction of Mr. Schulz\u2019s father. The information selection of these participants did not differ from those who decided against a conviction ( 2 1). Furthermore, neither participants\u2019 age nor participants\u2019 gender significantly influenced the selectivity of information search or interacted with the experimental factor (all Fs and 2s 1).\nInformation search. For an overview of information selection dependent on the experimental factor, see Figure 1. A chi-square analysis of the factor Information Number (2 vs. 10 pieces of information) and the type of information selection (consistent vs. inconsistent) reached significance, 2(1, N 64) 9.04, p .003. Separate analyses revealed that participants in the 2-information condition more often selected an inconsistent (67.6%) than a consistent (32.4%) piece of information, 2(1, N 34) 4.24, p .04, replicating the findings of the Freedman (1965) and Sears (1965) studies. In contrast, participants in the 10-information condition selected significantly more consistent (70%) than inconsistent (30%) pieces of information, 2(1, N 31) 4.80, p .03, replicating the typical findings of classic dissonance studies and recent research on selective exposure.\nIn showing that the preference for consistent versus inconsistent information systematically depends on the amount of available information, Study 1 suggests that information quantity is the crucial moderator between studies that find a preference for decision-consistent information and those that find a preference for decision-inconsistent information. The following studies were designed to replicate this finding with different decision cases and, most importantly, to identify the differential psychological processes underlying this moderator effect.\nStudy 2\nThe aim of the second study was to test whether the findings of Study 1 were due to different degrees of cognitive complexity in\n2 This procedure partially deviates from the classic Sears and Freedman procedure, which mostly employed one-sided decision cases. However, our own prestudies revealed that whether the decision case is formulated one-sided or two-sided (in a balanced manner) does not differently affect the direction of information search.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nthe 2- versus 10-information condition and to employ a decision scenario that was more involving for student participants (students had to decide whether or not to introduce tuition fees at German universities). Processing and testing 10 pieces of information should be more complex and laborious than processing only 2 pieces of information. From previous research, we know that conditions that render information processing difficult and laborious\u2014such as time restrictions or noise\u2014increase the preference for consistent information (cf. Kruglanski & Webster, 1996). This tendency is explained by the psychological construct \u201cneed for cognitive closure,\u201d which reflects an individual\u2019s need for a strong and definite answer to a specific question as well as ambiguity aversion (Kruglanski, 1989; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996). According to this line of argumentation, conditions that enhance cognitive complexity increase the need for cognitive closure and thus increase the preference for consistent information. Transferred to the present research, and compared to the 2-information condition, participants confronted with 10 pieces of decisionrelevant information might have experienced higher cognitive complexity and therefore an increased need for cognitive closure. In order to reduce cognitive complexity and reach cognitive closure, they might systematically prefer decision-consistent information. In contrast, participants in the 2-information condition should have experienced less cognitive complexity, less need for closure, and therefore a decreased preference for consistent information.\nOne way to specifically test this complexity explanation is to design an experimental condition that is almost as low in complexity as the 2-information condition, but (a) does not provide information direction as a selection criterion that fully distinguishes between the available decision-relevant pieces of information (see Selection-criteria explanation above), and (b) does not give the information seeker the possibility to refute all inconsistent information (see Dissonance and threat explanation above). A condition that possesses these attributes is when participants are confronted with 4 pieces of information (2 consistent and 2 inconsistent with the preliminary decision). The cognitive complexity of this condition is quite similar to the low cognitive complexity of the 2-information condition but simultaneously does not allow information direction to completely distinguish between the available pieces of information nor does it allow complete dissonance\nreduction by refuting all available pieces of inconsistent information (because decision makers can only select 1 piece of information).\nIn order to test the validity of the complexity explanation, participants in Study 2 made a preliminary decision and then selected 1 piece of information among either 2, 4, or 10 decisionrelevant (half consistent and half inconsistent) pieces of information. If the cognitive-complexity explanation is valid, then participants should reveal a more or less similar information-search pattern both in the 2- and the 4-information condition\u2014namely a systematic preference for inconsistent information (in other words: information search patterns in the 4-information condition should differ from the 10-information condition). If the dissonance or the selection-criteria explanation is valid, then a preference for consistent information should occur not only in the 10-information condition but also in the 4-information condition (i.e., no difference should occur between information-search patterns in the 4- and 10-information condition). Moreover, in order to get additional information about the participants\u2019 subjective reasons for their information selection, we asked them in an open-ended question, after decision making and information selection, about why they had selected that particular piece of information."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants and design.

After this short introduction, participants indicated on a checkbox whether they were in favor of or against the introduction of tuition fees. Please note that participants were informed that this decision was preliminary and that after information search (which would help them to optimize their decision), they would have the chance to revise their decision (at the end of the experiment). This instruction should have ensured that participants were convinced that the goal of information search was to increase the probability of making a correct final decision. Subsequently, they were informed that after the study, they would be interviewed on the topic of tuition fees by one of the experimenters. However, in order to prepare for this short interview, participants could gather 1 (out of 2, 4, or 10) additional piece of information concerning this decision problem.3\nThe additional pieces of information were said to consist of one-page statements written by students from the LudwigMaximilians-University, Munich, Germany. Each statement was summarized by a main thesis of two sentences. The main thesis contained the main argument of the corresponding statement and made it clear whether the author of the statement was in favor of or against the introduction of tuition fees. Participants were explicitly instructed that they could select only 1 piece of information. An example of a main thesis in favor of the introduction of fees is as follows: \u201cTuition fees are a good thing because they would increase the quality of research and teaching. Thus, German universities would be more competitive on an international level.\u201d An example of a main thesis against the introduction of fees is as follows: \u201cOne shouldn\u2019t introduce tuition fees because this would transform universities into commercial organizations. As a consequence, matters of profitability rather than teaching and research would be the focus of German universities.\u201d Thus, irrespective of whether the participants were in favor of or against an introduction of tuition fees, half of the statements supported their decision and half conflicted with it. Participants indicated in a checkbox which pieces of information they wanted to read in full; after information selection, a final decision was made. Finally, participants were asked in an open-ended question to write down why they had selected their specific piece of information.

For an overview of information selection dependent on the experimental conditions, see Figure 2. A chisquare analysis of the experimental conditions (2 vs. 4 vs. 10 pieces of information) and information selection (consistent vs. inconsistent) revealed a significant interaction between both factors, 2(2, N 69) 12.60, p .002. Separate analyses revealed that in the condition with 2 pieces of information, participants chose the inconsistent information somewhat more often (63%) than the consistent information (37%), although this preference for inconsistent information failed to reach significance, 2(1, N 24) 1.50, p .22. In contrast, both in the 4-information condition (consistent: 77%; inconsistent: 23%), 2(1, N 22) 6.55, p .01, and in the 10-information condition (consistent: 83%; inconsistent: 17%), 2(1, N 23) 9.78, p .002, consistent information was chosen significantly more often than inconsistent information.\nIn order to test differences in information-search patterns across the separate experimental conditions, we conducted further analyses.

Moreover, a similar interaction was observed when comparing the 2-information condition with the 10-information condition, 2(1, N 47) 9.92, p .002. However, no significant interaction between information quantity\n3 In order to minimize possible material effects, in the 2-information condition we used five different information pairs. In the 4-information condition we used two different 4-information samples.

In sum, follow-up analyses suggest that information-search patterns differ between the 2- versus 4- and 10-information conditions but not between the 4- and 10- information conditions.\nReported selection criteria. Participants\u2019 answers on the openended question concerning the subjective reason for their information selection were coded by two independent raters. The raters decided whether the answer was quality related (e.g., participants wrote that they wanted to get the best piece of information or mentioned the interesting information content as the selection criterion) or direction related (e.g., participants indicated that they wanted to read a piece of information that supported or contradicted their own decision). Answers that were neither quality nor direction related were also coded but, because of their very low frequency, not included in subsequent analyses. Overall, the raters agreed in 66 of 69 cases, representing an overlap of more than 95%. Finally, inconsistent rater assessments were resolved by discussion.\nOverall, a significant correlation was found between the type of information selected (consistent vs. inconsistent) and type of reported selection criterion (direction related vs. quality related; Spearman\u2019s r .36, p .004). That is, when participants selected a consistent piece of information, they were more inclined to report a quality-related selection criterion. In contrast, when participants selected an inconsistent piece of information, they were more inclined to report a direction-related selection criterion. Moreover, a chi-square analysis of the experimental conditions (2 vs. 4 vs. 10 pieces of information) and type of reported selection criterion revealed a significant two-way interaction, 2(2, N 61) 6.87, p .03. Further analyses, conducted separately for the three experimental conditions, revealed that participants in the 10-information condition reported more quality-related (71%) than direction-related (29%) selection criteria for information search, 2(1, N 21) 3.86, p .05. The same pattern was found in the 4-information condition (quality-related: 78%; direction-related: 22%), 2(1, N 18) 5.56, p .02. In contrast, participants in the 2-information condition reported somewhat more directionrelated selection criteria (59%) than quality-related selection criteria (41%), although this difference failed to reach significance, 2(1, N 22) 0.73, p .39.\nIn sum, Study 2 revealed a slight, though nonsignificant, preference for inconsistent information in the 2-information condition (i.e., balanced information search) and a significant preference for consistent information in the 4-information condition as well as in the 10- information condition. It was demonstrated that a significant preference for consistent information emerged as soon as participants were confronted with more than 2 pieces of information. Because no different information-search pattern could be observed between the conditions with 4 and 10 pieces of information, the effect of information quantity on information preference is unlikely to be mediated by differences due to differences in cognitive complexity. An openended question provided initial support for the validity of the proposed selection-criteria explanation.\nStudy 3\nIn the next study, we succeeded in collecting more direct evidence for our main assumption that the differential information\nsearch in the 2- versus 10-information condition is based on different salient selection criteria, and, in addition, we tested whether the 2- versus 10-information effect could also alternatively be due to dissonance processes. From the perspective of dissonance theory, the effect of information quantity on the preference for consistent versus inconsistent information could emerge as follows: When people are confronted with only 1 inconsistent and 1 consistent piece of information, then (a) the potential for dissonance arousal and threat is comparatively low because only 1 piece of inconsistent information exists for the decision maker (Frey, 1986), and (b) refuting that 1 piece of inconsistent information is the most efficient way to reach long-lasting dissonance reduction (cf. Festinger, 1964; Frey, 1986). If the only existing piece of inconsistent information can be refuted, no further sources of potential dissonance arousal remain. In contrast, conditions with more than 1 inconsistent piece of information should lead to (a) a comparatively higher degree of postdecisional dissonance because several inconsistent pieces of information exist and (b) a refutation strategy that is an ineffective way of achieving dissonance reduction because even if 1 inconsistent piece of information were refuted, several pieces of nonrefuted inconsistent information would still remain (because in our classic paradigm, decision makers can only choose 1 piece of additional information). As a consequence, selecting a consistent piece of information should be the most efficient way to achieve dissonance reduction in conditions with more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of information.\nInstead of the dissonance explanation, we propose an alternative explanation that is based on different selection criteria. This alternative explanation is derived from the hypothesis that information search follows the minimum-effort principle and, therefore, decision makers try to select the piece of information that best differentiates among all available pieces of information. If there is more than one selection criterion that fits this description, decision makers choose the one that requires the least processing effort. In the 2-information condition, information direction completely distinguishes between both available pieces of information and requires less cognitive effort than assessing the information quality of the pieces of information individually. Therefore, decision makers\u2019 information search should be guided by information direction, which, however, triggers individuals\u2019 desire to be and/or appear self-critical and unbiased (Kunda, 1990; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987) and thus leads to a systematic preference for inconsistent information. However, given that more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of decision-relevant information exist, information direction no longer completely differentiates the available pieces of information. Hence, decision makers should switch to the cognitively more demanding assessment of information quality as the crucial selection criterion. However, because previous research has shown that consistent information is generally assessed to be of higher quality than inconsistent information (Ditto & Lopez, 1992; Ditto et al., 1998; Fischer et al., 2005; Schulz-Hardt et al., 2007), in conditions with more than 2 available pieces of information, individuals are expected to systematically prefer a consistent piece of information.\nThe following research design, which varies as to whether in the 2- versus 10-information condition information content is given or not, helps to empirically distinguish between both the dissonance explanation and the selection-criteria explanation: If the 2- versus\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\n10-information effect is due to different selection criteria, and therefore partially based on biased assessment of information quality in the condition with 10 pieces of information, then removing information content as a possible selection criterion\u2013\u2013 which means that evaluation of information quality is no longer possible\u2013\u2013should reduce the preference for consistent information in that condition. However, if the 2- versus 10-information effect is due to dissonance processes, it should make no difference whether participants are provided with both information direction and detailed information content or with information direction only (without information content), because dissonance arousal is mostly a function of information direction (i.e., whether the information is consistent or inconsistent with one\u2019s own standpoint). In short, the manipulation of information content should have no impact on the 2- versus 10-information effect if it is due to dissonance processes. In contrast, it should eliminate the preference for consistent information in the 10-information condition, as that effect is partially based on the biased assessment of information quality (i.e., different selection criteria)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Participants and design. One hundred and nine (81 women and 28 men, ages ranged from 18 to 55 years; M 26.07, SD 6.74) undergraduate and graduate students from LudwigMaximilians-University, Munich, Germany, participated in this experiment. All participants were recruited in the university cafeteria by asking whether they would be willing to participate in a study on decision making at the nearby Department of Psychology. The experiment was based on a 2 (information quantity: 2 vs. 10) 2 (information content: given vs. not given) factorial between-subject design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions.\nProcedure. In Study 3, we employed a personnel decision case that has also been used in previous experiments on selective exposure (cf. Fischer et al., 2005). The participants were asked to imagine themselves in the role of a fashion store owner and to decide whether the contract of a manager (Mr. Miller) should be extended or not. They received a questionnaire containing an introduction to the topic and the most important facts about Mr. Miller\u2019s work: Mr. Miller had been hired to manage a fashion store 1 year ago. Mr. Miller\u2019s contract had been limited to a 1-year term; after that year, negotiations were to be conducted to discuss a possible extension of the contract. The participants were told that the success of Mr. Miller\u2019s work was mixed. For example, he had succeeded in gaining new customers for the store by introducing a new product line (\u201cYoung Fashion\u201d). However, at the same time, some of the store\u2019s regular customers had been lost because they did not accept Mr. Miller\u2019s \u201cMen\u2019s Fashion\u201d collection. Positive and negative aspects of Mr. Miller\u2019s work were balanced overall. After participants had read these facts, they were asked to make a preliminary decision as to whether Mr. Miller\u2019s contract should be extended or not (participants were also informed that following their information search, they would have the opportunity to revise their decision at the end of the experiment).\nAfterward, participants were informed that additional information concerning the decision problem was available (which would help them to make their final decision). The additional pieces of information consisted of either 2 or 10 one-page statements written\nby Mr. Miller\u2019s colleagues. Each statement was summarized by a main thesis of two sentences. The main thesis contained the main argument of the corresponding statement and made it obvious whether the expert was in favor of or against an extension of the contract. Irrespective of whether the participants were in favor of or against an extension of the contract, half of the statements (either 1 or 5) supported their decision and the other half conflicted with it. Accordingly, the experimental manipulation of information quantity took place according to the number of statements presented (2 vs. 10).\nMoreover, the factor Information Content was manipulated as follows: The short description of the available pieces of information contained either both the information direction and the corresponding main argument (information content given) or only the information direction without any explanation (information content not given). An example of a piece of information with information content provided is as follows: \u201cMr. Miller has made the best out of the current difficult economic situation. Therefore, his contract should be extended.\u201d An example of a piece of information with no information content provided is as follows: \u201cMr. Miller\u2019s contract should not be extended.\u201d In the first case, participants could use two different selection criteria, namely information quality (inferred from the argument \u201cMr. Miller has made the best of the currently difficult economic situation\u201d) and information direction (apparent in the statement \u201cMr. Miller\u2019s contract should be extended\u201d). In the latter case, information direction (\u201cMr. Miller\u2019s contract should not be extended\u201d) was the only possible selection criterion. After information selection, participants made a final decision on whether the contract of the manager should be extended or not. After the experiment was over, all participants were debriefed, informed why it was not necessary to read the selected pieces of information, and given a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar as a token of our thanks for their participation."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Of the 109 participants, 4 had to be excluded from further analyses.

In both the 2-information condition (consistent: 36%; inconsistent: 64%), 2(1, N 25) 1.96, p .16, and the 10-information condition (consistent: 48%; inconsistent: 52%), 2(1, N 25) 0.04, p .84, inconsistent pieces of information were selected slightly, but nonsignificantly, more frequently.\nTwo additional chi-square analyses, conducted separately for conditions with 2 and 10 pieces of information, revealed a significant interaction between the factors Information Content and Information Selection for only the 10-information condition, 2(1, N 49) 8.69, p .01, indicating that participants in the 10-information condition with information content provided selected significantly more consistent (88%) than inconsistent pieces of information (12%), 2(1, N 24) 13.50, p .001. In contrast, participants in the 10-information condition with no information content provided did not select significantly more consistent (48%) than inconsistent pieces of information (52%), 2(1, N 25) 0.04, p .84. Moreover, for the 2-information condition, no significant interaction occurred between the factors Information Content and Information Selection, 2(1, N 56) 0.09, p .76. In both the 2-information condition with information content given (consistent: 32%; inconsistent: 68%), 2(1, N 31) 3.90, p .048, and with no information content given (consistent: 36%; inconsistent: 64%), 2(1, N 25) 1.96, p .16, participants selected more inconsistent than consistent pieces of information (please note that this tendency was significant for the information content given condition but not significant for the information content not given condition).\nIn summary, Study 3 revealed that the 2- versus 10-information effect is not likely to be due to dissonance or threat-related processes because it was differentially affected by the informationcontent manipulation. That is, given that information content and information direction were both presented, the basic 2- versus 10-information effect of the previous two experiments was replicated. However, if the main argument was missing (no information\ncontent), differences in information selection disappeared and a slightly (though not significantly) increased selection rate of inconsistent pieces of information was observed for both the 2-information and 10-information conditions. Hence, Study 3 provides further evidence that quality aspects are a crucial selection criterion in the 10-information condition, which thus supports the idea of our selection-criteria explanation.\nStudy 4\nFinally, we conducted a fourth study that directly tested the validity of the selection-criteria explanation by manipulating both the salience of information direction and information quality as a selection criterion in the 2- and 10-information conditions. If conditions with 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 4 or 10) pieces of information trigger different selection criteria and thus account for different information preferences in the 2- versus 10-information conditions, then the direct experimental manipulation of these two selection criteria (information direction vs. information quality) should directly affect information search, whereas the effect of information quantity on information preference should be simultaneously eliminated. This experimental logic is analogous to the logic of mediational analysis (Baron & Kenny, 1986). The mediator variable (i.e., different salient selection criteria) should be connected to the dependent variable (i.e., information preference). That is, a direct manipulation of the mediator variable should lead to the same effect in the dependent variable as a manipulation of the independent variable (i.e., information quantity). In addition, if the effect of the mediator variable is statistically controlled for, the effect of the independent variable (information quantity) on the dependent variable (information preference) should be eliminated.\nIn order to provide such a test, we conducted the following experiment. As in Study 3, participants made a personnel decision about the future career of Mr. Miller and subsequently selected 1 out of either 2 or 10 pieces of information, half supporting and half conflicting with their prior decision. In addition, participants were instructed to base their information selection on either information direction (direction focus) or information quality (quality focus). A control group received no additional instructions.

Given the quality focus, participants in both the 2-information (71% consistentinformation selections) and the 10-information condition (78% consistent-information selections) selected significantly more consistent than inconsistent pieces of information, 2(1, N 24) 4.17, p .04, and 2(1, N 27) 8.33, p .01, for the 2- and 10-information conditions, respectively. No significant interaction emerged, 2(1, N 51) 0.32, p .57. Given the direction focus, participants in both the 2-information condition (92% inconsistent-information selections) and the 10-information condition (59% inconsistent-information selections) selected more inconsistent than consistent pieces of information, as predicted. However, since this tendency was stronger and significant in the 2-information condition, 2(1, N 25) 17.64, p .001, and weaker and nonsignificant in the 10-information condition, 2(1, N 27) 0.93, p .33, an unpredicted significant interaction emerged in the direction-focus conditions, 2(1, N 52) 7.42, p .01.\nThe results of Study 4 support the idea that the contrasting information preferences in conditions with 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 10) pieces of decision-relevant information are due to different selection criteria. Basically, the 2- versus 10-information effect was replicated again. However, if participants were reminded about information quality in both the 2- and 10- information conditions, they selected significantly more decisionconsistent than decision-inconsistent pieces of information. In contrast, when participants were reminded about information direction, in the 2-information condition, they systematically selected more inconsistent than consistent information, and in the 10-information condition, they selected slightly (but not significantly) more inconsistent than consistent pieces of information. Please note that the normally strong preference for consistent information in the 10-information condition vanished when an information direction cue was given. In sum, if the salient selection criterion was manipulated and thereby held constant, the 2-information versus 10-information effect disappeared. Therefore, the results clearly support our selection-criteria explanation.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe proposition that people systematically prefer information that supports their decisions, attitudes, and opinions is broadly accepted in social psychological research (Brannon, Tagler, & Eagly, 2007; Festinger, 1957; Fischer et al., 2005; Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001; Lundgren & Prislin, 1998). However, some influential studies have revealed a systematic preference for in-\nconsistent information (Freedman, 1965; Freedman & Sears, 1965; Sears, 1965). To date, it has not been clear why these different studies yielded contradictory results. A series of four experiments ascertained that the crucial difference between studies that found a systematic preference for consistent information and those that found a systematic preference for inconsistent information was the available quantity of selectable information. When people were confronted with 2 pieces of information (1 consistent, 1 inconsistent) they predominantly selected the inconsistent information. Yet when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, they systematically selected the consistent information more often than the inconsistent information (Studies 1 and 2). We excluded complexity differences (Study 2) and dissonance and threat processes (Study 3) as possible psychological mediators. Furthermore, we found clear empirical support for a selection-criteria explanation of the information-quantity effect (Studies 2\u20134): Information search basically follows the minimum-effort principle and, therefore, decision makers try to choose the selection criterion that best differentiates between all the available pieces of information.\nIf there are several selection criteria that fit this description, then decision makers choose the criterion that requires the least cognitive processing effort. In the 2-information condition, information direction completely distinguishes between both available pieces of information and requires less cognitive effort than assessing expected information quality. Therefore, decision makers\u2019 information search is guided by information direction, and, thus, they select the inconsistent piece, which helps them to be or to appear self-critical (cf. Kunda, 1990; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987). However, given more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of information, information direction no longer completely differentiates between all available pieces of information. Therefore, decision makers switch to the cognitively more demanding assessment of information quality as the crucial selection criterion, which, however, because of a general subjective quality advantage of consistent over inconsistent information, causes a systematic preference for consistent information (Fischer et al., 2005; SchulzHardt et al., 2007). Our studies clearly support this selectioncriteria-based account for the effect of information quantity on selective exposure."}, {"heading": "Implications", "text": "The present results have several theoretical and practical implications. First of all, they resolve a long-lasting debate about the question of whether people predominantly prefer consistent to inconsistent information. Research from Freedman and Sears (Freedman, 1965; Freedman & Sears, 1965; Sears, 1965) suggested that, above all, people prefer inconsistent information, which subsequently led to a substantial reduction in the number of studies on selective exposure. Although more recent research has shown that this termination was not justified and that selective exposure to consistent information is indeed an existing psychological phenomenon (Frey, 1986; Jonas et al., 2001; Schulz-Hardt\n5 The second order three-way interaction in the logit analysis (which occurred because information focus is a factor with three steps) did not reach significance, Z 1.55, confidence interval ( 3.47, 0.41), SE 0.99, p .12.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\net al., 2000), to date it has been unclear why Freedman (1965) and Sears (1965) found a strong preference for inconsistent information. The present studies resolve these contradictory results by demonstrating that the opposing-information preference is due to the different quantities of information available in the Sears and Freedman studies (2 pieces of information) compared to recent studies on selective exposure (more than 2 pieces of information).\nMoreover, the present research broadened the scope of the evaluation-based explanation of selective exposure (Schulz-Hardt et al., 2007): We found that subjective information quality drives information search only under conditions in which information quality indeed is the salient selection criterion in peoples\u2019 minds. In contrast, when information direction is highly salient, decision makers increasingly prefer inconsistent information in their information search. Together these results show how important the consideration of specific context factors (such as different information quantities) and their triggering of different selection criteria can be for the prediction of the direction of information search (see also Fischer et al., 2005).\nAnother important theoretical implication of the present results is that they induce doubt about the classic dissonance theoretical explanation of selective exposure. In situations in which information direction was the crucial selection criterion (these are situations in which dissonance and dissonance-reduction processes could work in their pure forms), participants did not prefer the consistent information, and even revealed a strong preference for the inconsistent information. In short, under conditions of high salience of information direction, participants wanted to be or at least to appear to be self-critical information searchers, which is a pattern that does not easily fit the classical dissonance explanation.\nOn a practical level, the present results have important implications for decreasing selective exposure to consistent information, which has often been shown to decrease decision quality and thus increase the probability of bad decision outcomes (Janis, 1982; Kray & Galinsky, 2003). The present research revealed that a preference for inconsistent information could be induced by not only reducing the number of pieces of information to 1 piece that conflicts with and 1 piece that supports a prior decision (which is seldom the case in real-life decision making) but also by increasing the salience of information direction with an explicit instruction to base information selection on information direction. This could be a promising new debiasing technique as long as it can be demonstrated that this debiasing effect also exists when decision makers are allowed to freely select among the available pieces of information and are not restricted to selecting only 1 piece of information.\nTasks with different quantities of decision-relevant information available after preliminary decisions reflect real-life situations and are thus of considerable practical relevance for decision makers. For example, information quantity and associated information selection can be restricted (a) when decision makers are under considerable time pressure (so that they can gather only a very small amount of the existing information), (b) when they have limited cognitive resources (e.g., when multitasking or in high stress situations), (c) when additional information is very expensive (e.g., when the amount of money or effort one has to invest for gathering additional information is extremely high), or (d) when a specific event occurs very seldom. The following example could illustrate this: If a physician preliminarily diagnoses a very rare\ndisease (e.g., Menkes disease\u2013\u2013a hereditary copper-based metabolic disorder), she or he has little additional decision-relevant information available (e.g., personal experience with this disease, experiences of colleagues, scientific publications) to make the final diagnosis compared to when a very frequently occurring disease (e.g., asthma) is at stake. Moreover, in the context of this example, not only information quantity but also the amount of selectable information can be restricted. That is, if a general practitioner has a preliminary suspicion that a patient suffers from a specific disease, she or he will transfer the patient to a specialist to clarify the diagnosis. Normally, because of time and money restrictions, general practitioners do not transfer patients to several specialists but to only one. For some diseases, many specialists are available (e.g., orthopedic problems), whereas for other diseases there are very few specialists available (e.g., rare hereditary disorders). The general practitioner has to decide to which one of the many available orthopedists (akin to our 10-information condition) versus to which one of the few hereditary disorder specialists (akin to our 2-information condition) she or he will send the patient. In addition, the general practitioner has an idea whether the specialist normally supports her or his preliminary diagnoses or not and why (which reflects our experimental information-search paradigm when participants know whether the selected information will be consistent or inconsistent to their preliminary decision). Due to our findings, the general practitioner is expected to send the patient with orthopedic problems to the orthopedist who normally supports her preliminary diagnoses (comparable to the 10-information condition), whereas, in contrast, the general practitioner is expected to send the patient with the supposed rare hereditary disorder to a specialist who is expected to be more critical with the general practitioner\u2019s preliminary diagnosis (comparable to the 2-information condition). In sum, these examples illustrate that the experimental paradigm employed in the present research has important implications for real-life decision making and information search."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Directions for Future Research", "text": "Some limitations of the current findings have to be taken into account. First, in contrast to Studies 1, 3, and 4, we did not find a significant preference for inconsistent over consistent information in the 2-information condition of Study 2. Although participants selected somewhat more inconsistent than consistent information in that condition, this tendency failed to reach significance. One possible reason for this somewhat unexpected finding could be that the decision case employed was more involving than the other decision cases. Student participants had to decide whether they were in favor of tuition fees or not. Since this topic is highly relevant for students, additional motivational (defense related) factors could have been at work. As a consequence, increased defensive tendencies might have led to a more frequent selection of consistent information in the 2-information condition of Study 2 compared to the 2-information conditions of the remaining three studies (which employed less involving decision scenarios). However, at the same time, it is also possible that some random variation reduced the effect to a level below statistical significance. As the preference for inconsistent information given 2 available pieces of information was significant in three out of four studies, and because in the second study the means were also in that\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\ndirection, we generally consider the differential effect of information quantity on information preference to be a rather robust one.\nSecond, inducing a direction focus in the 10-information condition\u2014either by removing information content or instructing participants to attend to the information direction (Studies 3 and 4)\u2014did not cause a clear, significant preference for inconsistent information (although the typical preference for consistent information in that condition was no longer significant). Therefore, either the manipulation of the direction focus was not strong enough or an additional, unknown variable affected information preference, especially in the 10-information condition. Future research should address this point and attempt to determine whether the manipulation was too weak on the one hand or to identify the missing determinants of information preference on the other hand.\nThird, in order to prevent demand effects, we did not measure participants\u2019 motivation to be or to appear to be an unbiased decision maker (illusion of objectivity; Kunda, 1990; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987), which was postulated to be associated with the increased selection rate of inconsistent information in the 2-information condition. Future research should try to measure peoples\u2019 intention to appear unbiased without possible demand and test whether that motive mediates the effect of information direction on information preference.\nFourth, besides quality and information direction, there might be other possible selection criteria for information search, such as uncertainty reduction. In the context of stereotype-related information search, Trope and colleagues (e.g., Cameron & Trope, 2004; Trope & Liberman, 1996; Trope & Thompson, 1997) documented that information search can be systematically affected by the desire to reduce uncertainty about attributes held by another person, which in turn can lead to the employment of asymmetric information search and biased strategies of questioning. Uncertainty reduction might have played a significant role in our studies as well. For example, when participants were exposed to 10 pieces of information, uncertainty about the validity of one\u2019s own standpoint might have been stronger than when they were confronted with only 2 pieces of information. Although the results of Studies 3 and 4 revealed that the two selection criteria (information quality and information direction) directly change the way individuals search for new information, future research should address whether uncertainty-reduction processes might have additionally interacted with the selection criteria we suggest in the present research.\nFifth and finally, a limitation of the present research is that it does not directly address the extent to which the exposure to pieces of information with more or less decision-inconsistent content represents a threat to a decision maker\u2019s prior decision. For example, in the 10-information condition, participants were informed that there exist at least five facts that speak against their initial decision. Such knowledge might imply a threat to this decision and thus might lead decision makers to spontaneously bolster their standpoint (i.e., selection of decision-consistent information). In contrast, in the 2-information condition, the threat implied by a single piece of decision-inconsistent information seems to be minimal, which allows decision makers to satisfy their need for knowledge and examine the argument that contradicts their prior decision.6 Although this threat-based explanation is very similar to the dissonance explanation of the effect (which was ruled out in Study 3), future research should nevertheless more directly address this\nalternative explanation by measuring to what extent decision makers differentially feel threatened by inconsistent information in the 2- versus 10-information condition.\n6 We want to thank an anonymous reviewer for this important point.\nReferences\nBaron, R., & Kenny, D.

Davies University of British Columbia, Okanagan\nFour studies investigate the role that stereotype threat plays in producing racial distancing behavior in an anticipated conversation paradigm. It was hypothesized that the threat of appearing racist may have the ironic effect of causing Whites to distance themselves from Black conversation partners. In Study 1, participants distanced themselves more from Black partners under conditions of threat, and this distance correlated with the activation of a \u201cWhite racist\u201d stereotype. In Study 2, it was demonstrated that Whites\u2019 interracial distancing behavior was not predicted by explicit or implicit prejudice. Study 3 provides evidence that conceiving of interracial interactions as opportunities to learn may attenuate the negative consequences of threat for Whites. Study 4 found that Whites have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat and that this awareness may mediate the relationship between threat and distance. These results are discussed within a broader discourse of racial distancing and the possibility that certain identity threats may be as important as prejudice in determining the outcomes of interracial interactions.\nKeywords: stereotype threat, racial bias, racial discrimination, social distance, prejudice\nMuch of contemporary research on racial prejudice and discrimination must contend with a paradox. Namely, in the last half century, researchers have found a consistent decline in the expression of anti-Black racial attitudes and a similarly robust maintenance of Black\u2013White racial inequality (Bobo, 1983). Many researchers have explained this paradox by assuming that contaminated \u201chearts\u201d or \u201cminds\u201d are the necessary precondition for racial disparities. Each of these contemporary theories about racial discrimination locates the problem of racial inequality within individual agents and assumes that if there is racism, there must be racists. The present research adopts a more contextual approach to racial inequality and discrimination in order to explain the paradox of diverging racial attitudes and outcomes.\nRather than assuming that contaminated \u201chearts and minds\u201d are solely responsible for racial discrimination, in the present research we hypothesized that one\u2019s concern with appearing prejudiced might have the ironic and unintended consequence of causing racial harms. Of note, research on intergroup contact has frequently assumed that making racially egalitarian values important to an individual is a significant step toward prejudice reduction\n(Allport, 1954). Yet we predict that this same prosocial concern may contribute to racial distancing under conditions where an egalitarian individual becomes concerned with being seen as prejudiced. There is some research to support this hypothesis.\nA growing literature suggests that individuals are aware that they may be negatively stereotyped as racially prejudiced (i.e., Dunton & Fazio, 1997; Plant & Devine, 1998; Vorauer, Main, & O\u2019Connell, 1998). For example, Vorauer and her colleagues have demonstrated that White Canadians spontaneously frame interracial interactions in terms of how they may be stereotyped (Vorauer et al., 1998; Vorauer, Hunter, Main, & Roy, 2000). In a series of experiments examining the relationship between White Canadians and indigenous Canadians, Vorauer and her colleagues demonstrated that White Canadians\u2019 impressions of an interracial interaction and of their out-group partner were influenced by the degree to which they felt they had been stereotyped as prejudiced (Vorauer et al., 1998). Similarly, White Canadians expected to be stereotyped as prejudiced when anticipating interactions with indigenous Canadians (Vorauer et al., 2000).\nIn line with these findings, the present research investigates the possibility that for Whites, the fear of being stereotyped as racially prejudiced by a Black conversation partner may lead individuals to distance themselves from their partner. That is, the fear of being labeled prejudiced could lead to racial distancing.\nA Brief History of Racial Distancing\nPsychologists began studying race relations by examining racially avoidant behaviors and attitudes (Samelson, 1978). This so-called \u201crace psychology\u201d (Duckitt, 1992) focused research on \u201cracial preferences,\u201d the ostensibly natural desire of individuals to\nPhillip Atiba Goff, Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University; Claude M.

Edward Bogardus, who helped pioneer this research, measured racial preference through an index of avoidance attitudes and behaviors. Subsequent researchers, however, disputed Bogardus\u2019s claim that these racial preferences were natural or rational. Psychologists began to study the same outcomes, now labeling them as prejudices, stereotyping, and discrimination (Duckitt, 1992; Samelson, 1978). As psychologists made the shift from race psychology to a psychology of prejudice and discrimination, avoidant behavior became a measure of racial antipathy.\nPerhaps because the study of avoidance and the study of prejudice share a common birthplace, contemporary researchers do not generally distinguish between the two concepts. Research on nonverbal discrimination (Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002; Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1974), reactions to nonconscious stereotyping (Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, & Jetten, 1994), and aversive racism (Gaertner & Dovidio, 1986) have used physical avoidance alternately as evidence of prejudice and a measure of discrimination. Consequently, distancing is often treated as if it were interchangeable with group stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.\nHowever, intergroup distancing may also stem from factors other than prejudiced attitudes. In such contexts, group harms could still be observed even when prejudiced attitudes are weak or nonexistent. That is, to borrow a phrase from the sociologist Bonilla-Silva (2003), there may be \u201cracism without racists.\u201d Therefore, it may be important to analyze intergroup avoidance for its own sake, apart from its use as a measure of prejudice. In the present research, we hypothesize that the stereotype that Whites are racist may contribute interracial distancing even absent interracial animosity. We use stereotype threat theory as a model for this prediction (Steele, 1992).\nA Stereotype Threat Approach\nStereotype threat is the sense of threat that can arise when one knows that he or she can possibly be judged or treated negatively on the basis of a negative stereotype about one\u2019s group (Steele, 1992, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1995). Though primarily applied to the domains of academic achievement, stereotype threat has also been applied to such domains as athletic performance (Stone, Lynch, Sjomeling, & Darley, 1999) and women\u2019s professional aspirations (Davies, Spencer, Quinn, & Gerhardstein, 2002). Stereotype threat requires that an individual be highly identified with a domain, that the individual believe he or she is being evaluated, and that the self-concept be implicated in that evaluation (Steele & Aronson, 1995). In the present research, it is hypothesized that Whites may experience stereotype threat in interracial contexts on the basis of a perception that they could be stereotyped as racist in those contexts.\nResearch by Frantz and colleagues has provided evidence that stereotype threat can have an ironic effect of increasing Whites\u2019 implicit pro-White bias on an implicit association test (Frantz, Cuddy, Burnett, Ray, & Hart, 2004). That is, under conditions where White participants feared being stereotyped as racist, their scores on an implicit association test showed an increased bias in favor of Whites and against Blacks. And, although Richeson and Shelton (2003) do not frame their research in terms of stereotype threat, they have demonstrated a number of behavioral conse-\nquences of Whites\u2019 concern with being seen as prejudiced in interracial interactions. Notably, these effects can be both negative\u2014in particular, decrements in working memory (Richeson & Shelton, 2003; see also Schmader & Johns, 2003)\u2014or positive, such as when highly prejudiced Whites are rewarded by Blacks for making great efforts to correct for their racism (Shelton, Richeson, Salvatore, & Trawalter, 2005). Still, little research has examined the behavioral consequences of stereotype threat for Whites in interracial interactions.\nWe hypothesized that Whites under stereotype threat in interracial contexts would distance themselves from anticipated interaction partners. It is important to note that this stereotype threat approach to interracial distancing is distinct from the \u201chearts and minds\u201d approach. That is, because a stereotype threat account of interracial interactions is definitionally a situationist account, we do not expect that traitlike measures of prejudice\u2014either external or internal\u2014will predict distancing effects. This prediction is a departure from previous research suggesting that implicit prejudice is responsible for nonverbal behaviors in interpersonal settings (e.g., Dovidio, 2001; Dovidio et al., 2002). However, previous research in this area has not simultaneously manipulated threat and measured implicit prejudice. We propose that in cases where Whites experience stereotype threat, this experience may overwhelm preexisting racial attitudes, rendering those attitudes devoid of predictive power. That is, the importance of the situation may trump the importance of individuals\u2019 characteristics when predicting discrimination. This is not, of course, intended to deny the importance of individual differences in prejudice. Rather, it is meant to foreground the relatively underexplored role of situational factors in producing disparate racial outcomes.\nOverview of Studies\nStudy 1 was designed to test the primary hypothesis: that racially tense conversations with Black partners would produce stereotype threat among White participants and in turn would produce physical distancing. Study 2 used the same paradigm to test an alternative hypothesis of the findings in Study 1: that the patterns of avoidance and stereotype activation were due not to stereotype threat but rather to a general anxiety about potentially tense conversations. Study 2 was also designed to replicate another boundary condition of stereotype threat, namely that stereotype threat occurs in conditions where the self is implicated by the stereotype but not in conditions where the self is not implicated (Steele, 1992, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1995).\nStudy 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that shifting participants\u2019 evaluative frameworks could reduce the experience of stereotype threat. It was hypothesized that giving participants learning goals would attenuate the negative consequences of stereotype threat by reducing the evaluative implications of stereotype-confirming behavior. Finally, Study 4 was designed to gauge participants\u2019 conscious access to the experience of stereotype threat. It was hypothesized that Whites\u2019 experience of stereotype threat in interracial interactions was a \u201chot\u201d process and not reducible to \u201ccold\u201d cognitive processes.\nStudy 1\nStudy 1 was designed to examine the effect of stereotype threat on the preferred social distance of White participants in an ex-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npected interracial contact. The principal hypothesis was that when the stereotype of racism was relevant to a potential interaction\u2014 that is, when participants expected to discuss a threatening topic\u2014 Whites would distance themselves from Black partners more than White partners. Under such conditions, it was further hypothesized that stereotype activation would positively correlate with the degree of avoidance."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Eighty-two White male undergraduates at Stanford University participated in this study in exchange for either $10 or partial course credit. Women were not included as participants in this study. Previous research has shown that threat and anxiety influence mixed-gender proximity preferences differently than samegender proximity preferences (Ugwuegbu & Anusiem, 1982). Because \u201cBlackness\u201d is most commonly mentally represented by \u201cBlack males\u201d (Goff, Thomas, & Jackson, in press), it was reasoned that Black males would produce the strongest effects. Therefore, only men were recruited for ostensibly same-gender dyads.\nThis experiment took the form of a 2 (race of partners: Black vs. White) 2 (conversation topic: love and relationships vs. racial profiling) between-subjects design. The chief dependent measures were the physical distance participants put between themselves and their conversation partners and the degree to which stereotypes related to their racial identity were cognitively activated by the experimental conditions."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "Word-stem completion. We hypothesized that participants who were talking about racial profiling would sit farther away from Black partners the more threatened they felt. To measure threat (and rule out the possibility that general White identity or anxiety was driving the effect), we measured the activation of three distinct concepts: White racial identity, negative stereotypes about Whites as racist, and general social anxiety. To measure the activation of these concepts, we used a word-stem completion task similar to that employed in previous stereotype threat research (e.g., Steele & Aronson, 1995). Ten words were chosen for each category\u2014White racial identity, negative stereotypes that Whites are racist, and social anxiety\u2014from pretests involving 157 Stanford undergraduates. In our pretest, 127 participants simply listed words associated with one of the categories. The 25 most common words for each category were then selected and given to 30 participants. These 30 participants rated each word for how strongly related it was to its category. The 10 highest rated words in each category were then selected as target words. All words are listed in the Appendix. These target words were randomly intermixed with 60 filler words that could not be completed as words that would fit any of the three category concepts, creating a sheet of 90 total word stems.\nFor the purpose of analysis, the number of target words a participant completed in each category was recorded. Of those words, the number of target words the participant filled out in a category-relevant manner (e.g., RACIST as opposed to RACKET) was counted. Last, the number of target words filled out in a\ncategory-relevant manner was divided by the total number of target words the participant had completed. This ratio, then, is the measure of concept activation.\nFaces. To convey the race of the participants\u2019 prospective partners, we showed participants Polaroid pictures of their ostensible partners. Pictures of Black and White men were selected from a data set of 20 Polaroids, each of which was rated on stereotypicality and attractiveness. Two Black faces and two White faces were selected such that the Black faces were neither reliably more attractive (M 3.50) than the White faces (M 3.46) nor reliably more stereotypically Black (M 4.57) than the White faces were stereotypically White (M 4.50).\nDistancing measurement. The principal hypothesis was that participants would sit farther away from Black partners than White partners when participants felt under threat of confirming the negative group stereotype. In order to measure this, we asked participants to arrange three chairs\u2014one for themselves and two for their two prospective partners\u2014so that the three of them could have a \u201ccomfortable conversation.\u201d Participants under the stereotype threat of possibly being seen as racist might put more distance between their own chair and the chairs of their two partners when they anticipate their partners are Black as a means of distancing themselves from the interaction. However, another factor could also affect the distance measure: a dispositional preference for some level of distance between all three individuals involved.\nIf participants positioned themselves far away from their partners, then the configuration of chairs would look like there was an odd person out (the isosceles triangle pictured in Configuration 1.1 in Figure 1). However, participants who were dispositionally more comfortable with larger interpersonal distances might also create distance between themselves and their partners. This configuration would look quite different from one created by anxiety specific to the partners and the situation and would look more like the equilateral triangle pictured in Configuration 1.2 in Figure 1. Therefore, to capture the first of these patterns\u2014without the second\u2014we developed a distance index in which the average distance between the participant and his prospective conversation partners (AB distance in Figure 1) was analyzed, covarying for the total distance the participant put between all three chairs (ABC distance in Figure 1). This calculation allows one to capture a participant\u2019s motivation to reduce possible tension, controlling for his individual proximity preferences. That is, by covarying for the total distance between the three chairs, we were able to measure the relative \u201codd-person-out\u201d effect. Individuals who sat close to one partner and far from the other would score similarly to someone who sat equidistant from both partners. Likewise, individuals who sat equally close to both partners but sat the partners far away from each other would score lower than individuals who sat themselves and their partners equidistant from each other. This odd-person-out index gives an estimate of the degree to which the participant\u2019s chair placement reflected specifically a desire to distance himself from the potential interaction partners.\nIt was hypothesized that participants expecting to talk with Black partners about racial profiling would place their own chairs farther away from the chairs of their partners than would participants in any of the other conditions. To further ensure that participants were sitting farther away from their partners rather than in some other configuration (see Figure 1), we computed another index in which Distance C was subtracted from the average of\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nDistances A and B. If participants were distancing themselves from their partners, then [(A B)/2] \u2013 C would be positive. If participants were sitting in some other configuration, then this index would be 0 or negative.\nIn fact, participants who expected to speak with two Black partners about racial profiling scored positively on this index (M 1.74), whereas those who anticipated speaking to Black partners about love and relationships (M \u20131.59) and those who anticipated speaking to White partners about either topic (racial profiling, M \u2013 0.55; love and relationships, M \u2013 0.43) scored negatively. This suggests that participants sat farther away from their partners in the Black/racial-profiling condition and not in any other condition. As the distance scores presented in Figure 2 show, this is precisely what was observed."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Participants were greeted by one of several White experimenters, who confirmed the participant\u2019s name and informed him that two other conversation partners had already arrived. The experimenter, who was kept blind to condition, then checked the participant\u2019s name off a list of three names. After administering the consent and demographic forms, the experimenter took the participant\u2019s picture with a Polaroid instant camera and placed it between two other pictures, ostensibly of the two partners with whom the participant would later have a conversation (no conversation would actually take place). In the Black partner condition, both pictures were of Black males. In the White partner condition, both pictures were of White males.\nFigure 1.

Pretesting revealed that expecting to talk to two Black males\u2014probably in light of their limited numbers in the student body\u2014tended to arouse suspicion in our participants, especially when they learned that the topic of conversation was racially charged. To combat this suspicion, we told participants that they were participating in an experiment on \u201cdiverse conversations\u201d in which the gender and racial makeup of the groups were manipulated to create diversity. Unfortunately, pretesting also revealed that White participants reported being threatened at the mere mention of diverse conversations. In light of this finding, it was expected that stereotype activation would not differ by condition.\nTopic selection. Participants then chose a topic slip, without looking, from a grab bag. In reality, all slips in the bag stated that the conversation topic would be either racial profiling in the racial profiling condition or love and relationships in the love and relationships condition. Participants were then told that they would be discussing the topic they had picked from the bag.\nDistance measurement. After the topic was selected, participants were given a \u201ccognitive engagement task\u201d\u2014in actuality, the word-stem completion task\u2014ostensibly to ensure that they were taking the conversation and experiment seriously. Participants were asked to complete the task as quickly as possible by finishing each word stem with the first word that came to mind. After 6 min, the word-stem completion sheet was collected, and participants were escorted to the room where the conversation would purportedly take place. Upon arriving, the experimenter feigned frustration at the fact that the three chairs were lined up in the corner of an otherwise featureless room. The experimenter apologized for the inconvenience and then asked participants to set up the chairs \u201cso that the three of [them could] have a comfortable conversation\u201d and instructed them to \u201ctake a seat\u201d in one of the chairs after they had arranged them. The experimenter then left the room, ostensibly to retrieve the other two partners for the conversation. After 1 min, the experimenter returned to the room, probed the\nparticipants for suspicions, thoroughly debriefed them, and thanked them for their participation."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Distance Findings", "text": "The data were submitted to a 2 2 analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with AB distance as the dependent variable, race of partner and conversation topic as the predictors, and ABC distance as the covariate.

The only significant partial correlation was between AB distance and the activation of words associated with White racism in the Black-partner/racial-profiling condition, r(19) .43, p .05. In this condition, the more that words associated with White racism were activated, the farther participants placed their chairs from Black participants.\nNext, a regression analysis was conducted to test whether the relationship between stereotype activation and distance was significantly different in the Black/racial-profiling condition than in all other conditions. In order to perform this test, we created contrast weights for the Black/racial-profiling cell and the other three cells (3, \u20131, \u20131, \u20131). The regression on AB distance, then, included these contrast weights, stereotype activation, and the interaction between the two as predictors, using ABC distance as a covariate. The regression revealed that the relationship between activating the White racist stereotype and participants\u2019 AB distance was significantly stronger in the Black/racial-profiling condition than in all other conditions, B .69, t(77) 2.03, p .05, 2 .05. This suggests that participants\u2019 AB distance was uniquely moderated by worry about being perceived as racist in the Black/racial-profiling condition."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In support of the primary hypothesis, participants who were assigned to discuss racial profiling with two Black partners distanced their partners more than did participants in any other condition. In addition, activation of the White racist stereotype remained constant across conditions and was related to distance only for participants who anticipated talking with two Black partners about racial profiling. In this condition, there was a significant correlation between activation of the stereotype and distance such that the more participants activated the stereotype of the White racist, the farther they sat from their anticipated partners. Of note, stereotype activation and distance were related only under conditions of threat. This provides initial support that stereotype threat is an appropriate lens through which to interpret these findings.\nThough these results are consistent with a stereotype threat approach, there is no direct evidence that this pattern is due to a threat to the self. One might argue that a White individual talking with two Black partners about racial profiling does not experience stereotype threat but rather may simply fear that the conversation may become tense or contentious. The resultant aversion to the situation, manifested through increased distance, might therefore reflect an attempt to reduce the contentiousness of the conversation rather than reflecting any threat to the self.\nAdditionally, because Study 1 did not include any measurements of prejudice, the role of implicit or explicit prejudice remained unexplored. Though the random assignment of participants to conditions means it is statistically improbable that the observed pattern of data was due entirely to participants\u2019 levels of internal prejudice, the degree to which internal prejudice could moderate these effect is an important issue to examine. Therefore, Study 2 was designed to test the hypothesis that the self must be threatened\nin order to produce the observed distancing behavior and that prejudice has little role in producing distance in this context.\nStudy 2\nThe first goal of Study 2 was to test directly the hypothesis that the pattern of distance observed in Study 1 resulted from threats to the self. It was again hypothesized that stereotype activation and distance would be related only when participants felt threatened. To test these hypotheses we dropped the love and relationships topic, and racial profiling became the only topic assigned in all conditions. One condition, therefore, was a replication of the racial profiling condition from Study 1. In addition, a condition was added where participants were given instructions immediately before being led to the conversation room (i.e., immediately after completing the word-stem task). The experimenter informed participants that they would be assigned an opinion, be asked to read it aloud, and argue from that perspective during the conversation. Participants were informed that their partners would be explicitly told that the opinions read and argued were assigned and not those of the participant.\nThe language of the opinion was taken from a focus group session where White undergraduates were asked to report the types of arguments they might adopt that would create the largest degree of racial tension with Black students on the topic of racial profiling. Stanford undergraduates rated this opinion as a pro-racialprofiling stance in pretesting.\nHaving students read this pro-racial-profiling position allowed for a strong test of our hypothesis. If participants were simply afraid of taking potentially racist perspectives and, thus, causing contention, being forced to read the opinion might make them all the more likely to sit far away from their prospective Black partners. Therefore, if participants sat equally close to Black and White prospective partners, it would not be because they had been supplied with a position that either was easy to defend or itself defused the racial tensions in the situation.\nTo test the hypothesis that internal prejudices, either explicit or implicit, were not predictive of distance, we had participants complete measures of prejudice before arriving for the anticipated conversation. This allowed for the possible moderating effects of prejudice to be examined.\nThe principal hypothesis of Study 2 was that participants would distance themselves from Black partners more than from White partners when voicing their own opinion but not when reading an assigned opinion. As in Study 1, it was further hypothesized that stereotype activation would positively correlate with distance only under conditions of stereotype threat. Last, it was hypothesized that stable prejudice (both explicit and implicit) would have little if any influence on distance and would not attenuate the relationship between stereotype activation and distance."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Forty-seven White male undergraduates at Stanford University participated in this study in exchange for either $20 or partial course credit.

When the findings were taken together, it was concluded that although interethnic anxiety is predictive of distance from Blacks, it does not attenuate the impact of stereotype threat on distancing behavior."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Study 2 demonstrated that the results of Study 1 were not due only to participants\u2019 reluctance to engage in potentially uncomfortable conversations, and that internal prejudice played little if any role in the observed findings. By directly testing the hypothesis that threats to the self are a necessary part of a stereotype threat phenomenon, in Study 2 we sought to replicate and extend the findings of Study 1. In Study 2, stereotype threat produced a pattern of data such that White participants sat farther away from Black partners than from White partners when discussing racial profiling. Additionally, stereotype activation was related to distance only when participants expected to discuss racial profiling with Black partners. However, when participants were assigned an opinion and their selves were \u201cremoved\u201d from the situation, there was no difference in the degree to which they distanced themselves from their Black or White participants, nor was there a relationship between stereotype activation and distance. Stereotype activation was related to distance only when participants experienced a threat to the self, which supports a stereotype threat interpretation of the data.\nIn addition, neither explicit prejudice, as measured by the MRS, nor implicit prejudice, as measured by the IAT, predicted distance in any condition. Nor did either measure of prejudice moderate the relationship between stereotype threat and distance. Beyond supporting the initial hypothesis that situational threats play a more important role than internal prejudices in predicting behavior it appears that internal prejudices played virtually no role in predicting behavior under conditions of stereotype threat.\nSurprisingly, participants\u2019 scores on the MCP did not predict distancing behavior. One would imagine that those who are most motivated to control the expression of racial prejudice would be the most identified with an antiracist identity and, therefore, be most threatened by the possibility of being seen as racist.

Plant (2004), for instance, found that Whites who were high in motivation to control prejudice also had more positive expectations of interracial interactions when no additional threat was introduced. If that were true of participants in Study 2, then they may have been motivated to expect a positive interaction at the same time that a negative one would be most threatening to their self-concept. Similarly, Vorauer and Ross have demonstrated that those who were most invested in positive intergroup interactions imagined that they were most transparent to an out-group partner (Vorauer & Ross, 1999). This feeling that their true, nonracist self was visible impaired their ability to accurately judge their own behavior.\nThough participants\u2019 motivation to control prejudice was not predictive, the measure of interethnic anxiety was predictive of distance under conditions of stereotype threat, suggesting that general anxiety did contribute to distancing behavior. This finding is consistent with previous literature that suggests that stereotype threat produces increased anxiety whether that anxiety is measured via nonverbal expression (Bosson, Haymovitz, & Pinel, 2004), blood pressure (Blascovich, Spencer, Quinn, & Steele, 2001), or social facilitation (O\u2019Brien & Crandall, 2003). No factors were found to attenuate the relationship between stereotype activation and distancing behavior.\nStudy 3\nWork by Dweck and her colleagues suggests that if ability is conceptualized as an entity (i.e., one simply has it or does not), then poor performance can be seen as an indication that one is inadequate within that domain (Dweck, 1996; Hong, Chiu, & Dweck, 1995). Such a framework is called an implicit entity theory of the domain. However, if ability is conceptualized as learnable and protean, then it stands to reason that doing poorly on a test would not serve as stereotype confirming evidence (Hong, Chiu, & Dweck, 1995). Such a framework is called an implicit incremental theory of the domain. Although the work of Dweck and her colleagues has been shown to have effects on academic perseverance (Dweck, 1996; Hong et al., 1995), a shift in evaluative framework has not yet been proven to reduce stereotype threat in an experimental setting.\nHowever, Vorauer and Turpie (2004) did find evidence that increased evaluative concerns can lead low-prejudiced dominant group members to react negatively toward stigmatized out-groups. Across three studies, Vorauer and Turpie found that when dominant group members were concerned with being evaluated in terms of their privileged social position, it created a \u201cchoking\u201d effect for those who were identified with being nonprejudiced. Vorauer and Turpie discussed these results in terms of intergroup contact and did not measure stereotype activation. Therefore, although their findings are consistent with stereotype threat, a direct application of the theory to these contexts has yet to be attempted.\nStudy 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that a shift in evaluative framework might eliminate the negative consequences of stereotype threat\u2014in this case, within interracial situations. Our rationale was that just as women taking a math test might assume that ability is entitative, so too might Whites in an interracial conversation believe that racial sensitivity is entitative. Being\nnegatively evaluated (either doing poorly on a math test or being seen as racist) with an entitative evaluative framework would result in a strong threat to one\u2019s self-concept. If, on the other hand, one has an incremental theory of the stereotyped domain, then it is less likely that a negative evaluation would be threatening to one\u2019s sense of self. Study 3, therefore, tested the hypothesis that when Whites frame interracial contact in terms of an incremental theory, stereotype threat is eliminated.\nThe primary hypotheses of Study 3 were, first, that in the absence of learning goals, participants would sit farther away from Black partners than from White partners. This was not expected to be the case in the presence of learning goals. Second, as in Studies 1 and 2, it was hypothesized that stereotype activation would be positively correlated with distance under conditions of stereotype threat and, as in Study 2, that no other measurements of prejudice or identity would moderate this relationship.\nHaving already examined the relationship between explicit and implicit prejudice on distance, we included a measure of Black stereotype activation. This was intended to rule out the possibility that whereas stable prejudices might not predict differences in participants\u2019 distance scores, context-specific activation of negative Black stereotypes would."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Seventy-four White male undergraduates at Stanford University participated in this study in exchange for either $20 or partial course credit.

They also indicated their political affiliation. In order to perform a stronger test of the hypothesis regarding explicit prejudice, we also included a second measure of explicit prejudice, the Attitudes Towards Blacks Scale (Brigham, 1993).\nDuring Session 2, participants were shown pictures of their conversation partners (Black vs. White) and filled out the wordstem completion task (with Black stereotypes instead of the general White words used in Studies 1 and 2). Half of the participants were then given the learning goals instructions, whereas the other half received no instructions. All participants were told they would discuss racial profiling with their partners.\nAfter receiving either the learning goals instructions or no instructions, participants were told to set up the chairs as per Studies 1 and 2. Feigning forgetfulness, the experimenter then returned to the room and handed them the learning-goals/performance-goals scale. Finally, participants were probed for suspicions, thoroughly debriefed, and thanked for their participation.\nThough Studies 1 and 2 were conducted by a different set of experimenters, it was important to rule out the possibility that experimenter expectancies contributed to our effects. Therefore, a new group of experimenters was trained for Study 3. Then, midway through the study, yet another group of experimenters was trained to complete data collection. Whereas the experimenters for Studies 1 and 2 were both male and female, the experimenters for the first half of Study 3 were all female, and the experimenters for the second half were all male.

Post hoc analyses did find that several factors contributed to participant distance scores. Interethnic anxiety was predictive of participant distance scores. However, none of these factors attenuated the relationship between stereotype activation and distance, suggesting that a stereotype threat framework is still an appropriate one.\nThe robust nature of the principal distance and stereotype activation findings having been demonstrated, there remained a number of outstanding questions. First, the degree to which participants have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat remained to be tested. Second, Studies 1\u20133 used a paradigm wherein participants either were in racially heterogeneous groups or had lone in-group status.

It measured the degree to which participants spontaneously generated stereotype-threatrelated thoughts during their initial encounter.

Coders read each participant\u2019s thought-listing task and coded each participant as either a 1 (if he had listed at least one stereotype-relevant thought) or 0 (if he had listed no stereotype-relevant thoughts).

If they had drawn different slips, they would place both slips back into the bag and draw again until they both drew the same slip at the same time. In one condition, only \u201cracial profiling\u201d was written on more than one slip, and in the other, only \u201clove and relationships\u201d was written on more than one slip, thus ensuring that the experimenter could decide what topic would be discussed.\nAfter the topic had been chosen, the confederate entered the conversation room, where there was one chair at the center of the room and one chair in the corner.

Participants sat farther away from their partner in the racial profiling condition (M 54.68 in.) than in the love and relationships condition (M 39.82 in.) when learning goals were not present, F(1, 51) 13.80, p .001, 2 .21. This was not the case when learning goals were present, F(1, 51) 0.50, ns. Similarly, when participants expected to discuss racial profiling, they sat farther away from their partner when learning goals were absent (M 54.68 in.) than when learning goals were present (M 42.63 in.), F(1, 51) 9.08, p .01, 2 .15. This was not the case when participants expected to discuss love and relationships, F(1, 51) 1.82, p .10. These results suggest that the results obtained in Studies 1\u20133 were not simply due to participants\u2019 being in the numerical minority (i.e., they were solo in-group members paired with two out-group members)."}, {"heading": "Thought-Listing Task", "text": "Participants showed a great willingness to report stereotypethreat-relevant thoughts, with 27% of participants listing such thoughts. Examples of stereotype-threat-relevant thought listings included statements such as the following: \u201cI feel awkward knowing that I, a White person, will be talking to a Black man about racial profiling\u201d; \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t affect my conversation on the subject that the other person is of a different race, though I don\u2019t imagine it would\u201d; \u201cMy first thought when I saw \u2018racial profiling\u2019 as a topic, and my partner was of a different ethnicity was that I might want to be cognizant of this and be somewhat careful in my remarks\u201d; and \u201cOh shit, this guy is Black!\u201d\nTo be considered stereotype threat relevant, a thought had to include specific reference to anxiety and race. A chi-square test revealed that significantly more participants generated stereotypethreat-relevant listings when they anticipated discussing racial profiling (50%) than when they anticipated discussing love and relationships (4%), 2(1) 12.2, p .001. As hypothesized, participants who anticipated discussing racial profiling were as likely to generate stereotype-threat-related thoughts when learning goals were present (50%) as when learning goals were absent (50%). Similarly, participants expecting to discuss love and relationships were equally unlikely to generate stereotype-threatrelated thoughts (in fact, only 1 participant listed a stereotyperelevant thought in the love and relationships condition).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nNext, it was hypothesized that participants who generated stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts would be more likely to create distance from their conversation partners, but only in the absence of learning goals. To test this hypothesis, we submitted participants\u2019 distance measures to a 2 2 ANOVA with learning goals (present vs. absent) and stereotype-threat-relevant thought listings (present vs. absent) as the predictor variables. Because only 1 participant who was assigned to talk about love and relationships listed a stereotype-threat-relevant thought, the analysis was restricted to participants assigned to talk about racial profiling. This analysis revealed a main effect of learning goals condition, F(1, 24) 7.59, p .01, 2 .24, that was qualified by the predicted two-way interaction, F(1, 24) 7.46, p .01, 2 .24. Simple effects tests further revealed that participants who anticipated talking about racial profiling and who were not given learning goals sat farther away from their partners when they generated stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts (M 65.14) than when they did not (M 40.14), F(1, 24) 9.36, p .005, 2 .28. When learning goals were present, however, participants who expected to discuss racial profiling sat equally close when they generated stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts (M 45.21) and when they did not generate such thoughts (M 45.12).\nThese findings suggest that participants spontaneously generate stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts and that the generation of these thoughts is related to distance in the absence of learning goals. However, given the fact that no participants who anticipated discussing love and relationships generated threat-relevant thought listings in the absence of learning goals, it was not possible to test the potential mediational role of these thought listings. Additionally, a continuous variable might be better able to capture the relationship between an individual\u2019s subjective experience of threat and distance than would the mere presence of a threat-\nrelevant thought listing. Therefore, the ESTS was included in order to supplement these limitations of the thought-listings methodology."}, {"heading": "Explicit Stereotype Threat Scale", "text": "The percentage of stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts participants listed was highly correlated with their score on the ESTS, indicating high construct validity of the scale, r(55) .52, p .001. A t test revealed that participants who listed stereotypethreat-relevant thoughts scored higher on the ESTS (M 5.00) than those who did not list stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts (M 3.17), t(53) 5.70, p .001, 2 .38. Next, stereotype threat scores were submitted to a 2 2 ANOVA where conversation topic and learning goals were the independent variables. Similar to the thought-listing results, this analysis revealed only a main effect of conversation topic, such that participants expecting to discuss racial profiling reported significantly higher levels of stereotype threat (M 4.30) than did those expecting to discuss love and relationships (M 3.00), F(1, 51) 17.98, p .001, 2 .26. That those who generated stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts experienced more stereotype threat and that patterns of thought listings and stereotype threat scores were similar demonstrates a strong relationship between an individual\u2019s stereotype threat score and the occurrence of stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts."}, {"heading": "Mediational Analysis", "text": "To test the relationship between explicit stereotype threat scores and distance, we followed the steps outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986) to test for mediation, first in the learning goals absent\nFigure 4.

All four steps outlined by Baron and Kenny are satisfied when learning goals are absent. That is, first, the independent variable (conversation topic) significantly predicts the dependent variable (distance), B 14.86, t(26) 3.28, p .005, 2 .29. Second, the independent variable predicts the mediator variable (explicit stereotype threat score), B 1.31, t(26) 3.41, p .005, 2 .31. Third, when the independent variable is held constant, the mediator variable predicts the dependent variable, B 4.96, t(25) 2.32, p .05, 2 .18. And fourth, when the mediator is held constant, the independent variable predicts significantly less of the variance of the dependent variable (Sobel test, Z 1.92, p .05).\nThese steps are not satisfied when learning goals are present. This finding supports the hypothesized moderated mediation model. Because the independent variable still predicts the dependent variable after the mediator variable is controlled for, this model may best be described as moderated partial mediation. This suggests that other factors may also contribute to the effect of threat on distancing."}, {"heading": "A Note on Design and Mediation", "text": "Because there was concern that asking questions about one\u2019s experience of stereotype threat might impact racial distancing behavior, and because there was no a priori reason to suspect that positioning one\u2019s chair would influence one\u2019s experience of stereotype threat, the ESTS was moved to the end of the experiment. Because this mediator variable was placed after the primary dependent variable, it can be argued that it is improper to test for mediation, as the study does not have a conventional mediational design. However, recent analytic strategies have defied this convention (Keller & Dauenheimer, 2003).\nWhen Keller and Dauenheimer (2003) found that there was no a priori reason that their dependent variable should influence their mediator variable, they compared the mediational pathways as they hypothesized, as well as \u201creverse\u201d\u2014that is, switching the mediator and dependent variables in the analyses. If this reverse mediation is a less compelling statistical model for the data than the mediational model proposed by the researchers, then the design irregularity is overlooked.\nIn the present research, there was no reason to believe, a priori, that positioning one\u2019s chair would influence the level of stereotype threat one reported. Therefore, the data were submitted to a reverse mediational analysis, with conversation topic as the independent variable, distance as the mediator variable, and explicit stereotype threat score as the dependent variable. As this analysis produced numbers identical to those of the hypothesized mediational model and the hypothesized model is more logically consistent, we concluded that although the study design is not a traditional mediational design, the hypothesized mediational analysis is an appropriate way to interpret the present data."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Study 4 demonstrated that the findings of Studies 1\u20133 could be extended to one-on-one interactions with actual partners. Additionally, participants demonstrated access to their subjective experiences of stereotype threat, and reports of this experience were, in turn, predictive of behavior.\nGeneral Discussion\nRacial prejudice and racial distancing are not the same thing. Though both may lead to racial harms, they can do so via different mechanisms and it is possible for one to exist in the absence of the other. The four studies presented here provide support for the hypothesis that stereotype threat may cause Whites to distance themselves from Blacks. This distancing was unrelated to racial prejudices, either implicit or explicit. When White participants expected to discuss a racially contentious topic with Black partners, the threat of appearing racist caused them to physically distance themselves from those partners in each of the four studies. Both stereotype activation (Studies 1\u20133) and stereotype-threatrelevant thoughts (Study 4) were positively related to distance, such that the more White participants thought about the stereotype, the farther away they moved. However, neither implicit nor explicit measures of prejudice predicted this pattern of distancing (Studies 2 and 3), and no measure of prejudice moderated the role of stereotype threat on distance. Identifying which contexts can overwhelm individual differences in racial attitudes and under what conditions would be a worthy project in light of these results.\nAlso deserving further investigation is the question of subjective experience. Study 4 lends support to the hypothesis that individuals may consciously experience stereotype threat (Marx & Goff, 2005). Although this does not resolve the debate about the relative role of \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d processes in producing performance decrements (Schmader & Johns, 2003; see Wheeler & Petty, 2001), it does suggest that there is an underexplored qualitative component to this phenomenon. The subjective experience of stereotyped targets, therefore, deserves consideration in future research on the topic.\nThe present research also explores new facets of stereotype threat theory. These studies are the first to apply stereotype threat to interracial interactions. These findings suggest a promising salve for the negative consequences of stereotype threat, namely, learning goals (Dweck, 1996; Hong et al., 1995). In Studies 3 and 4, participants who were given learning goals were made to feel that their situation was less evaluative. Participants were therefore protected from the negative consequences of stereotype threat. This suggests an exciting direction for future stereotype threat research. Although stereotype threat may operate differently for different groups and in different contexts, it is possible that adopting learning goals may help in other situations, perhaps because, despite the powerful threats participants experience, they are all the more willing to find ways to be at ease in these important settings.\nIt may be important to note that a shift away from an entitative framework with regard to stereotypes is also a shift away from an essentialist framework of that stereotype. That is, understanding a generalization about one\u2019s group as something other than innate and unchangeable is a departure from the dominant view of stereotypes\u2014that they are related to some essential essence of group members (Cosmides, Tooby, & Kurzban, 2003; Eberhardt & Goff, 2005). This is important because it means that any group-based stereotypes for gender, race, and other \u201cbiologistic\u201d groups are, by default, likely to produce higher levels of stereotype threat owing to the essentialist conception of the group and the consequent stereotypes. A focus on learning may cause evaluations to seem less dire, or it may cause stereotypes to be seen in less essentialist\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nterms, and either of these outcomes may protect one from the negative consequences of stereotype threat. Therefore, regardless of how learning goals protect individuals against the negative consequences of stereotype threat, their utility deserves further investigation.\nApart from advances regarding stereotype threat, the present research suggests that studying racial distancing behavior\u2014 separate from racial prejudice\u2014has utility. Though perceivers are capable of distinguishing between racially prejudiced intent and racial harms (Swim, Scott, Sechrist, Campbell, & Stangor, 2003), social psychologists sometimes do not make this distinction. That is, by conflating racial harms (such as distancing) with racial prejudice, researchers run the risk of ignoring important causes of racial harms. And, though moving a chair may not constitute dire racial injury, it is easy to imagine how similar subtle behaviors could lead to feelings of isolation, or worse, when experienced in the aggregate. In some contexts, such as in an interview or when solving problems as a team, nonverbal behaviors have even been demonstrated to produce racial harms in the moment (Dovidio et al., 2002; Sanchez-Burks, 2002; Word et al., 1974). The present research suggests, then, that racial harms occurring in the absence of racial animus may be no less damaging for their lack of intent."}, {"heading": "A Note on Stereotype Threat and Racism", "text": "If a racial harm occurs but racist actors and intents are not present, what does one call that harm? Is it racism? As BonillaSilva (2003) mused, is it possible to have \u201cracism without racists\u201d? Although racial prejudice remains a persistent feature of the U.S. social landscape, the present research suggests that there exist contexts that can overwhelm one\u2019s racial biases\u2014or lack thereof. That is not to say that these individuals lack racial prejudice or that racial prejudice is not an important predictor of racial discrimination. But in contexts such as those in the present research, is it objectionable to fear being seen as racist?\nThis question is particularly important if calling an action racist can lead to further racial disparities (e.g., by causing distancing behavior). However, using the term racism might also have certain advantages. For example, it seems difficult to imagine that terms such as stereotype threat, contextual factors, or racial disparities would inspire the kind of moral outrage or rush to respond that the term racism occasions. The fact that participants in these experiments seemed so vigilant to the possibility of appearing racist indicates that they may also be motivated to reduce racism where they observe it.\nFraming racial disparities as racism may influence an agent\u2019s desire to alleviate those racial disparities as well as that individual\u2019s level of stereotype threat. Consequently, framing racial disparities in terms of racism could influence how and even whether the disparity is confronted. It is possible, then, that the term racism itself is due for reexamination. Although racism has been defined in many different ways (for a review, see Collins, 1991; Jones, 1997), it is rare that scholars or laypeople distinguish between racism and racists. Perhaps it is possible to construct a conception of racism that foregrounds the harm being done to one group without simultaneously castigating the members of another. Regardless, although the question of what to call racial harms without racist actors is beyond the scope of this empirical project, it seems an important question for researchers of racial disparities to con-\nsider, as changing our conception of the problem may allow us to form better solutions to it."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The present research is a contextual approach to interracial difficulties and is therefore an optimistic one. A stereotype threat approach to interracial contact does not locate racial problems in the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of prejudiced agents. Rather, it suggests that certain features of an interracial context can create identity threats that lead to distancing. And, because the threat is contextual, so too may be the solution. Though social psychologists frequently examine racial discrimination by investigating problems in the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of racist actors, it may be that the metaphorical racial divide is amenable to subtle changes in context. Creating a context in which individuals are free to act out their desire to learn may be enough to bring people together\u2014or at least have the beginnings of a comfortable conversation.\nReferences\nAllport, G.

Eastwick and Eli J. Finkel Northwestern University\nIn paradigms in which participants state their ideal romantic-partner preferences or examine vignettes and photographs, men value physical attractiveness more than women do, and women value earning prospects more than men do. Yet it remains unclear if these preferences remain sex differentiated in predicting desire for real-life potential partners (i.e., individuals whom one has actually met). In the present study, the authors explored this possibility using speed dating and longitudinal follow-up procedures. Replicating previous research, participants exhibited traditional sex differences when stating the importance of physical attractiveness and earning prospects in an ideal partner and ideal speed date. However, data revealed no sex differences in the associations between participants\u2019 romantic interest in real-life potential partners (met during and outside of speed dating) and the attractiveness and earning prospects of those partners. Furthermore, participants\u2019 ideal preferences, assessed before the speed-dating event, failed to predict what inspired their actual desire at the event. Results are discussed within the context of R. E. Nisbett and T. D. Wilson\u2019s (1977) seminal article: Even regarding such a consequential aspect of mental life as romantic-partner preferences, people may lack introspective awareness of what influences their judgments and behavior.\nKeywords: sex differences, mate preferences, speed dating, empathy gap, a priori theories\nAfter decades of research, it is now well established that men and women differ in their reports of the importance of certain characteristics in a romantic partner. Such assessments of ideal partner preferences or mate preferences have consistently revealed two key sex differences: A greater male (compared with\nfemale) desire for romantic partners who are physically attractive and a greater female (compared with male) desire for romantic partners who have good earning potential. These findings are frequently (but not always, see Eagly & Wood, 1999) discussed as part of an evolutionary psychological perspective on mate selection, which suggests that men and women possess different evolved, domain-specific psychological adaptations that guide their mate preferences and their romantic-partner choices accordingly (Buss, 1989, 1994; Buss & Kenrick, 1998; Buss & Schmitt, 1993).1 In the present study, we replicated these ubiquitous sex differences in romantic-partner preferences and attempted to follow them to their anticipated conclusion: sex-differentiated romantic interest in real-life potential romantic partners depending on the partner\u2019s physical attractiveness and earning prospects. In fact, the data never pointed toward such a conclusion; instead, they led us on a detour that raised fascinating new questions about the meaning of romantic-partner preferences and shed new light on the processes underlying romantic-relationship initiation.\n1 Some evolutionary perspectives also predict that other sex differences will emerge within the domain of human mating, such as the desired age of a mate or interest in short-term sexual relationships (Buss, 1989; Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Kenrick & Keefe, 1992; Symons, 1979). The present report focuses exclusively on the sex differences in the stated importance of physical attractiveness and earning prospects in a romantic partner.\nPaul W. Eastwick and Eli J.

Sociologist Reuben Hill asked participants to rate the importance of certain qualities in a mate and found that men placed more importance on good looks than did women, whereas women placed more importance on good financial prospects than did men (Hill, 1945). The best-known study of mate preferences in this \u201cstated preference\u201d tradition was published by David Buss (1989), who surveyed 10,047 participants spread across 37 different cultures and documented consistent sex differences in the importance of physical attractiveness and good earning prospects. Buss interpreted these data in an evolutionary framework, appealing largely to Trivers\u2019s (1972) parental-investment theory. Buss suggested that (a) men (more than women) value physical attractiveness in a mate because a woman\u2019s physical attractiveness confers information about her reproductive value, and (b) women (more than men) value earning prospects in a mate because a woman\u2019s offspring are more likely to survive given a man\u2019s economic contributions. Many evolutionary psychologists argue that these preferences persist today because they increased the reproductive success of ancestral humans who possessed them, presumably because such preferences facilitated mate choice by directing ancestral men and women to select attractive and successful mates, respectively (see Buss & Schmitt, 1993).\nThese two sex differences in stated mate preferences have withstood a number of additional empirical tests. For example, the differences have proven robust in meta-analyses of the statedpreference paradigm (Feingold, 1990, 1992), in a nationally representative sample (Sprecher, Sullivan, & Hatfield, 1994), and among men and women who anticipated having high incomes (Townsend, 1989; Wiederman & Allgeier, 1992). Other researchers have asked participants to evaluate photographs or descriptions of opposite-sex individuals; the attractiveness of these stimuli affected men\u2019s liking more than women\u2019s, and the earning prospects of these stimuli affected women\u2019s liking more than men\u2019s (e.g., Stroebe, Insko, Thompson, & Layton, 1971; Townsend & Wasserman, 1998). In addition, a naturalistic program of research explored the content of personal advertisements (e.g., Harrison & Saeed, 1977), revealing these same sex differences in the mate characteristics sought by ad placers (see meta-analyses by Feingold, 1990, 1992). Finally, recent research investigating online dating has found that (a) men\u2019s (but not women\u2019s) incomes predicted the number of opposite-sex emails received (Hitsch, Hortac\u0327su, & Ariely, 2006), and (b) the physical attractiveness of users\u2019 online photographs predicted email receipt better for women than for men (Olivola et al., 2007).\nSeveral evolutionary psychologists have also posited that distinct psychological adaptations guide people\u2019s behavior in shortterm versus long-term romantic relationships; therefore, men and women are likely to value different characteristics in a romantic partner depending on whether they are currently in a short-term or a long-term mating mindset (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). For example, women should be more likely to prefer men who exhibit cues to their genetic fitness (e.g., physical attractiveness) for short-term compared with long-term relationships (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). Some research has in fact demonstrated that men and women converge in the strength of their preference for physically\nattractive individuals in short-term contexts (Kenrick, Groth, Trost, & Sadalla, 1993; Li & Kenrick, 2006; but see Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, & Kenrick, 2002; Regan, Levin, Sprecher, Christopher, & Cate, 2000). Similarly, women tend to prioritize earning prospects when seeking a long-term compared with a short-term partner (Li & Kenrick, 2006). In general, the extant data support those evolutionary perspectives that predict that sex differences in mate preferences will be especially robust when individuals consider a long-term compared with short-term relationship.\nAll of the above studies have helped build a strong case for the existence of sex differences in mate preferences with respect to physical attractiveness and earning prospects. Although much of the support derives from the stated preferences of men and women as reported on questionnaires or in response to experimental stimuli (e.g., photographs), the personal-ad and online-dating findings suggest that these sex differences continue to emerge in some actual dating contexts. In addition, participants\u2019 stated preferences are meaningfully moderated by the short-term versus long-term distinction, as predicted by several prominent evolutionary perspectives (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). Nevertheless, the functional importance of these preferences would be bolstered by demonstrations that they predict what happens when men and women actually meet one another, either in a live dating context or even when considering real-life potential marriage partners. Surprisingly, in prior studies in which the targets of participants\u2019 romantic interest were not hypothetical ideals or photographs but rather live, flesh-and-blood human beings, the sex differences in physical attractiveness and earning prospects have proven empirically evasive. We now turn our attention to these curious findings.\nEquivocal Evidence for Sex Differences\nIf men (more than women) prefer physical attractiveness and women (more than men) prefer earning prospects, this could conceivably result in a marriage \u201ctradeoff\u201d such that attractive women will tend to marry rich men. Two studies are often cited as providing evidence for this hypothesis. In the first, Elder (1969) presented data showing that women\u2019s physical attractiveness positively predicted marrying a high-status mate. In the second, Udry and Eckland (1984) found that attractiveness was positively related to household income (but not own income) for women; the reasonable inference is that the additional income is a result of marrying successful husbands. However, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these studies for two reasons. First, neither study examined sex differences in the correlation between attractiveness and spousal earning prospects. Second, attractive people tend to accrue many extra benefits in life, including better occupational success (see meta-analysis by Langlois et al., 2000); therefore, an association between women\u2019s attractiveness and men\u2019s earning prospects could emerge if attractive people simply marry other attractive people (see Buller, 2005). In other words, it could be the attractiveness of certain men (not their accompanying income and success) that successfully attracts good-looking women. In fact, Stevens, Owens, and Schaefer (1990) assessed the attractiveness and education levels (an indicator of earning prospects) of recently married women and men and indeed found that, after controlling for the fact that attractive women marry attractive\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nmen, the apparent association between men\u2019s education and women\u2019s attractiveness disappeared. In short, there is no strong evidence demonstrating that men and women engage in a marriage tradeoff between physical attractiveness and earning prospects.\nSeveral other creative research paradigms have failed to show that men and women differ in their romantic interest toward opposite-sex others who are physically attractive or have good earning prospects. Speed and Gangestad (1997) asked college students to nominate friends and acquaintances who were romantically popular, who were physically attractive, and who were likely to have future financial success. Results revealed no sex difference in either the (large) correlation between popularity and physical attractiveness or the (negligible) correlation between popularity and future financial success. Recently, researchers have started to investigate romantic preferences using speed-dating (Eastwick & Finkel, in press-b; Finkel & Eastwick, in press; Finkel, Eastwick, & Matthews, 2007), a paradigm in which opposite-sex individuals meet for short dates and then decide whether they would (\u201cyes\u201d) or would not (\u201cno\u201d) be interested in meeting one another again. Data on individuals (Mage 32 years, SD 5.3) who attended professional speed-dating events revealed that (a) income did not make either sex significantly more desirable, and (b) athough men indeed had a strong preference for women with attractive faces, bodies, and a lower body mass index (BMI), women had a similarly strong preference for men with attractive faces, bodies, and an average BMI (Kurzban & Weeden, 2005). Finally, a speed-dating study with graduate-student participants did find that men were more likely than women to \u201cyes\u201d the dates they found physically attractive (Fisman, Iyengar, Kamenica, & Simonson, 2006). Regarding earning prospects, however, women and men did not differ in their likelihood of \u201cyessing\u201d the dates they judged to be ambitious or the dates who came from wealthy hometowns. Especially fascinating are data presented by Iyengar, Simonson, Fisman, and Mogilner (2005) revealing that speed-daters\u2019 stated preferences correlated poorly (rs ranging from .00 to .17) with their actual yes/no decisions\u2014we return to this point shortly.\nWith regard to the importance of physical attractiveness, Feingold\u2019s (1990) meta-analysis summarized findings from several different research paradigms, two of which (stated preferences and personal ads) are mentioned above. Although men clearly exhibit a stronger preference for physical attractiveness in these two paradigms, the evidence for the physical-attractiveness sex difference is less robust when participants are actually interacting with a potential partner. Feingold (1990) reported that being physically attractive was (a) positively associated with dating activity more strongly for women than for men but (b) positively associated with the number of opposite-sex interactions per day more strongly for men than for women. Feingold speculated that these findings might actually reflect a sex difference in the strategies that men and women use to initiate a romantic relationship (i.e., attractive men have more interactions because many of their female friends are attempting to initiate a relationship through friendship). Thus, these data do not unambiguously demonstrate a sex difference in the importance of physical attractiveness. Feingold also examined data from seven studies in which men and women actually went on dates with one another (e.g., the well-known \u201ccomputer dance\u201d study conducted by Walster, Aronson, Abrahams, & Rottmann, 1966). The correlation between romantic liking for and physical attractiveness of one\u2019s date was positive for both men and women, but the meta-analyzed sex difference between these correlations was small and not significant. Although Feingold\u2019s\n(1990) review is often cited as providing clear evidence for the sex difference in the importance of physical attractiveness, a closer look reveals substantial ambiguity in paradigms in which participants actually interact.\nHave Participants Told More Than They Know?\nIt initially seems strange that the sex differences that emerge so consistently in the literature on stated preferences become so erratic when examining live dating contexts. Fortunately, the extant social psychological literature could shed light on this quandary. One possibility is suggested by the classic Nisbett and Wilson (1977) demonstrations that people are often unable to correctly report how features of a stimulus affect their evaluations of it (known as a \u201ccausal judgment\u201d). Their studies revealed that participants do not use true introspection to answer such \u201cwhy\u201d questions (e.g., \u201cWhy do you like this particular pair of stockings?\u201d)\u2014they instead defer to their a priori theories about whether a certain feature might plausibly lead to such an evaluation. Although these a priori theories may be correct at times, Nisbett and Wilson made their case by exposing the inaccuracy of participants\u2019 theories across a variety of contexts.\nNevertheless, the Nisbett and Wilson (1977) experiments tested preferences and judgments that did not hold tremendous meaning in participants\u2019 lives (e.g., stocking preferences). Might something as important as mate selection be subject to their critique? Could mate preferences reflect participants\u2019 potentially inaccurate a priori theories about the characteristics they would find appealing in a romantic partner or why they would choose a certain potential mate over another? This suggestion is plausible for three reasons. First, although it may seem odd to equate mate preferences with Nisbett and Wilson\u2019s problematic causal judgments, one of the original introspective inaccuracy studies (Nisbett & Bellows, 1977) conceived of physical attractiveness in precisely this way. Physical attractiveness was a reason participants might like or dislike a job candidate in that study, just as it is a reason that participants might like or dislike a potential romantic partner. Second, although several subsequent articles demonstrated that participants were aware of what influenced their judgments when the data were analyzed using alternative statistical procedures (e.g., Smith & Miller, 1978), this awareness typically emerged only when those judgments were made in rapid succession in a controlled laboratory setting (e.g., Wright & Rip, 1981; cf. Wilson, Laser, & Stone, 1982). People still tend to have difficulty reporting what influences their judgments in everyday life; for example, participants demonstrated virtually no insight about how their mood judgments were affected by the amount of sleep they got (Wilson et al., 1982). These difficulties are likely to be compounded in the romantic domain, given how rarely individuals select a romantic partner or must choose among several interested and available partners (compared with how often they sleep!). Third, because mate preferences are typically assessed when a participant is in a state of cool rationality, such preferences may not reflect what inspires actual desire during the emotional throes of romantic attraction. For example, it is easy to imagine an individual acknowledging (while calmly chatting with friends) the benefits of dating an individual who is loyal and reliable but soon thereafter experiencing strong romantic desire in the presence of someone who is unpredictable and exciting. This is an example of\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\na cold-to-hot prospective empathy gap (Ariely & Loewenstein, 2005; Loewenstein, 1996, 2005) and similarly hints that stated mate preferences might not map onto priorities in live dating contexts.\nFor these three reasons, it is plausible that men and women show consistent sex differences in their stated mate preferences because they are reporting consensual a priori theories about what characteristics in a romantic partner will inspire their interest. If individuals were to report not on hypothetical ideal partners but instead on the actual people they were currently romantically pursuing, it is an open question (based on the previous literature) whether sex differences would emerge\u2014and the a priori theories account presents a strong case for why they may not.\nThe Current Research\nTo explore how the traditionally sex-differentiated characteristics of physical attractiveness and earning prospects predict initial romantic attraction, we took a broad, panoramic snapshot of participants\u2019 romantic lives. Our procedures covered two distinct contexts: (a) a speed-dating event designed specifically for undergraduate students and (b) an intensive one-month follow-up. During this follow up, we examined in detail how participants\u2019 potential relationships developed, both with respect to their speed-dating \u201cmatches\u201d and with respect to other romantic interests whom participants met outside of speed-dating (\u201cwrite-ins\u201d). If stated mate preferences serve the function of directing romantic interest, we should confirm the following three hypotheses:\nH1. Sex differences in stated preferences. Men will state that they prefer physical attractiveness in a romantic partner more than women do, and women will state that they prefer earning prospects in a romantic partner more than men do. These established sex differences will be evident in reports of both an ideal partner and an ideal speed-date.\nH2. Sex differences in initiation. Given H1, men (compared with women) will demonstrate greater interest in and pursuit of potential partners they find attractive, and women (compared with men) will demonstrate greater interest in and pursuit of potential partners they judge to have good earning prospects. In addition, as partner preferences differ depending on the degree to which men and women approach potential partners with a short-term versus a long-term mindset, these sex differences might prove especially robust among individuals who are more (rather than less) interested in pursuing a long-term, serious relationship (this short-term/long-term mindset hypothesis is called H2A).\nH3. Individual differences in initiation. A participant who states a preference for physical attractiveness (or earning prospects) in a romantic partner will also demonstrate greater interest in and pursuit of potential partners he/she judges to be physically attractive (or to have good earning prospects). In other words, stated preferences will correlate with in vivo preferences (those revealed within the actual dating context).\nHowever, if stated preferences do not reflect participants\u2019 genuine introspective insight but rather their inaccurate a priori theories about what characteristics in a potential partner might inspire their romantic interest, H2, H2A, and H3 might not be confirmed.\nOne shortcoming of previous live dating research is that those studies have often employed only a single dependent variable (sometimes consisting of only a single item). Of course, there are many intervening steps between meeting someone and forming/ maintaining a romantic relationship with that person; these steps include the initial spark of interest, sharing contact information, initiating and enjoying time spent together, feelings of romantic passion, and so forth. Therefore, in the present report, we employ 17 different dependent variables (collectively referred to as relationship-initiation dependent variables) and draw conclusions by meta-analyzing results across these diverse measures.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Using flyers posted around campus and informational e-mails sent to the freshmen, sophomore, and junior class Listservs, we recruited 163 undergraduate students (81 women, 82 men) to participate in a study of romantic-attraction processes, including a speed-dating component (for greater procedural detail, see Finkel et al., 2007). Participants were 19.6 years old on average (SD 1.0 years); 36.2% were freshmen, 38.7% were sophomores, 21.5% were juniors, and 3.7% were seniors. (We recruited seniors less aggressively because they were scheduled to graduate approximately 6 weeks after the events.)

In addition, those who completed at least 9 of the 10 follow-up questionnaires were paid a bonus of $10."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Part 1: Pre-event questionnaire. The first part of the study consisted of a 30-min online pre-event questionnaire assessing background variables about the participants. Participants completed this questionnaire 6\u201313 days before attending a speeddating event.\nPart 2: Speed-dating. The second part of this study consisted of a full-fledged 2-hr speed-dating event at which participants pursued \u201cmatches\u201d with opposite-sex participants. Events were modeled loosely on procedures used by professional speed-dating companies and took place in a secluded art gallery located in Northwestern University\u2019s student union. Tables and chairs were positioned throughout the room such that each pair of speed-daters could communicate easily with one another while seated a comfortable distance away from other pairs. Nonalcoholic beverages, lighting, and music were selected to make the event elegant and were held constant across all speed-dating events.\nUpon each participant\u2019s arrival at the event, one research assistant gave him or her a name tag, clipboard, pen, a set of interaction-record questionnaires, and a unique ID (letters for women, numbers for men).

Next, a second research assistant took a digital photo of the participant and was willing to take additional photos until the participant was happy with one. Once all participants had arrived, the experimenter explained how the speed-dating event would proceed.\nFor three randomly determined speed-dating events, men remained seated while women rotated from man to man; for the remaining four speed-dating events, women remained seated while men rotated. Each speed-date lasted for 4 min; participants conversed freely during this time. After each speed-date, the experimenter blew a whistle to signal that participants should rotate to the location for their next speed-date. Before beginning this next speed-date, however, participants completed an interaction record about the previous date and jotted notes to themselves to take home. After 2 min passed, the experimenter signaled for participants to complete their interaction records and begin their next 4-min date. Participants dated all opposite-sex individuals present and had between 9 and 13 dates, depending on event attendance. Once all dates had been completed, the experimenter explained to the participants how to complete the matching process and remaining questionnaires.\nAfter the event, participants returned to the speed-dating Web site, where they indicated whether they would be interested in meeting again each person they had speed-dated. Participants clicked \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d next to the photograph and ID of each speed-dater. When two speed-daters replied \u201cyes\u201d to one another, this was called a \u201cmatch\u201d; only matches were later provided with the ability to contact one another (see below). Participants also indicated whether they would allow \u201cmissed matches\u201d (speeddaters who had said \u201cno\u201d to the participant but to whom the participant had said \u201cyes\u201d) to learn that the participant had said \u201cyes\u201d to them. If the participant allowed this option, the missed match was given the option of changing his/her previous \u201cno\u201d response to a \u201cyes,\u201d thus securing an extra match for both the participant and the missed match. In total, 100% of participants completed the matching process, and 54% chose the missedmatches option. Participants generated a total of 206 matching pairs (average number of matches per participant 2.53, SD 2.0).\nAt 5 p.m. the day following the speed-dating event, participants received an e-mail directing them to a Web site where they could view their matches. The Web site displayed the photograph, ID, and first name of each speed-dater with whom the participant had a match. Participants were also given the ability to change their \u201cno\u201d to a \u201cyes\u201d for any speed-daters who agreed to the missedmatches option described above. After completing a brief postmatch questionnaire, participants could then click on a button next to each match\u2019s photograph to get to the speed-dating messaging page. Participants could use this page to send a message to a match and to view messages received from that match.\nPart 3: Follow-up. Twenty-four hr after they had access to their match information (and 48 hr after the speed-dating event), participants received an e-mail directing them to a Web site where they could complete the first of 10 follow-up questionnaires. They received similar e-mails every 72 hr until the follow-up portion of the study was completed (30 days after the speed-dating event). They were instructed to complete each questionnaire before going to bed that night, although we accepted late questionnaires. Of the 92% of speed-dating participants who elected to take part in the\nfollow-up portion of the study, 69% completed at least 9 of the 10 questionnaires.\nOn each of the 10 follow-up questionnaires, participants responded to items about each speed-dating match. In addition, participants were asked to provide the name of anyone else (aside from their matches) whom they considered to be a romantic interest. After providing the name of this \u201cwrite-in\u201d target, they completed follow-up questions about this individual, in addition to their matches, at each wave. Participants could provide multiple write-in targets; altogether, participants reported on 143 write-ins over the course of the month. Most of the write-ins (78%) attended Northwestern University or lived in the Chicago/Evanston, Illinois area, whereas 20% were currently living or going to school elsewhere in the United States (no information was available for the remaining 2%). According to the participants\u2019 reports, the writeins were 20.1 years old on average (SD 2.0 years), participants had known the write-ins for an average of 380 days (Mdn 180 days), and they had been romantically interested in them for an average of 245 days (Mdn 68 days). We refer to follow-up questionnaire targets as either a \u201cspeed-date/match\u201d or \u201cwrite-in\u201d to reflect the two different ways a target could be included in the data set. Write-ins are useful because they can address whether any of the follow-up results can be explained away as strange anomalies that are only characteristic of relationships that grow out of a speed-date (see Eastwick & Finkel, in press-b; Finkel et al., 2007). Therefore, data pertaining to write-ins are presented separately from those pertaining to speed-dating matches."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "All measures included in the present report (except for \u201cyessing\u201d) were assessed on four different questionnaires: pre-event, interaction-record, postmatch, and follow-up. The present report focuses on the following three traits that might describe a romantic partner: physically attractive (assessed by the items \u201cphysically attractive\u201d and \u201csexy/hot\u201d), earning prospects (\u201cgood career prospects,\u201d \u201cambitious/driven\u201d), and personable (\u201cfun/exciting,\u201d \u201cresponsive,\u201d \u201cdependable/trustworthy,\u201d \u201cfriendly/nice\u201d). The first two constructs were examined because of their relevance to the literature on sex differences in mate preferences; the third serves as a useful comparison and includes characteristics that both men and women desire in a romantic partner (e.g., Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas, & Giles, 1999; see factor analysis that follows).\nStated mate preferences. Stated mate preferences were assessed in two different ways (ideal partner and speed-date) at two different times (pre-event and Wave 10 follow up). First, as part of the pre-event questionnaire, participants rated the importance of physically attractive ( .83), earning prospects ( .75), and personable ( .71) characteristics in an ideal romantic partner on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (extremely). We refer to these reports as pre-event ideal partner stated preferences.\nGiven that the present study was inspired by the literature on ideal partner preferences, these pre-event ideal partner reports seemed the most logical measures to use for construct validation. We conducted a factor analysis (principal axis factoring with promax rotation) on the eight items (see above) that were intended to assess the three ideal partner constructs of interest. Inspection of the scree plot revealed a three-factor solution: The two items assessing Physically Attractive loaded primarily on the first factor,\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nthe four items assessing Personable loaded primarily on the second, and the two items assessing Earning Prospects loaded primarily on the third (all factor loadings .5 with no double loadings).\nOf course, an ideal partner preference is context-free, and the principle of attitude\u2013behavior compatibility (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005) suggests that such a preference would best predict behavior when it refers to the same, specific context in which the behavior will take place. Therefore, also on the pre-event questionnaire, participants received the following instructions: \u201cHow much do you think the following characteristics will matter in your decision to \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 someone after your 4-minute date?\u201d Participants then responded to the identical items reported above that assessed Physically Attractive ( .84), Earning Prospects ( .72), and Personable ( .44) characteristics.2 We refer to these reports as pre-event speed-date stated preferences.\nOn the tenth and final follow-up questionnaire, participants again reported their ideal romantic partner preferences for Physically Attractive ( .76), Earning Prospects ( .79), and Personable ( .77), just as they had on the pre-event questionnaire. In addition, participants reported the likelihood that Physically Attractive ( .76), Earning Prospects ( .73), and Personable ( .58) characteristics would matter in their decision to \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d someone after a 4-min date should they go speed-dating again. These reports are referred to as Wave 10 ideal partner and Wave 10 speed-date stated preferences, respectively.\nPartner characteristics. As part of the interaction record, participants rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (extremely) the extent to which they thought each speed-dating partner was characterized by the identical items reported above that assessed Physically Attractive ( .95), Earning Prospects ( .86), and Personable ( .84) characteristics. In addition, on each follow-up questionnaire, participants used a 1\u20139 scale to rate the extent to which they thought each speed-dating match and write-in was characterized by the items assessing Physically Attractive ( .92), Earning Prospects ( .79), and Personable ( .81) characteristics.\nRelationship initiation dependent variables. On a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree), the interaction record assessed participants\u2019 reports of romantic desire for the speeddating partner (\u201cI really liked my interaction partner,\u201d \u201cI was sexually attracted to my interaction partner,\u201d and \u201cI am likely to say \u2018yes\u2019 to my interaction partner\u201d; .88) and chemistry with him or her (\u201cMy interaction partner and I seemed to have a lot in common,\u201d \u201c. . . seemed to have similar personalities,\u201d and \u201c. . . had a real connection\u201d; .91).\nAll postmatch questionnaire and follow-up questionnaire relationship-initiation dependent variables were assessed on scales from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). As part of the postmatch questionnaire, participants indicated for each match their level of match excitement (\u201cI am extremely excited that I matched with [name]\u201d), their initiation plans (\u201cI am very likely to initiate contact with [name]\u201d), and their initiation hopes (\u201cI hope that [name] initiates contact with me\u201d).\nOn each of the 10 follow-up questionnaires, participants responded to items pertaining to each speed-dating match and to each write-in. Furthermore, the items about each match/write-in were customized depending on the participants\u2019 answer to the following pivot question: \u201cWhat is the current status of your\nrelationship with [name]?\u201d Participants were given the following response options to this question: (a) dating seriously, (b) dating casually, (c) friend with romantic potential, (d) acquaintance with romantic potential, (e) friend without romantic potential, (f) acquaintance without romantic potential, (g) no relationship at all. Participants completed the pivot question about each match/ write-in every time they completed a follow-up questionnaire. If a participant selected option a, b, c, or d, this match/write-in was considered romantic, and if a participant selected option e, f, or g, this match/write-in was considered nonromantic. If a participant selected option g on two (or more) consecutive waves, no items were assessed for that match/write-in at that wave. A smaller subset of items was required for nonromantic compared to romantic matches/write-ins (for greater detail, see Finkel et al., 2007).\nIf participants selected either a romantic or a nonromantic response to the pivot question, participants completed an item assessing to what degree this particular match/write-in was someone they wanted to get to know better (\u201cI am eager to get to know [name] better\u201d). In addition, if participants responded \u201cyes\u201d that they had \u201chung out with [name] in person or corresponded with [name] not in person (e-mail, instant messaging, phone, etc.)\u201d since the last time they completed a follow-up questionnaire, they completed a one-item measure of date initiation (\u201cFor the most part, I was the one to initiate correspondence/hanging out with [name]\u201d) and a one-item measure of date enjoyment (\u201cCorresponding/hanging out with [name] has been enjoyable\u201d).\nIf participants selected a romantic response to the pivot question, they completed the following additional measures: a five-item measure of romantic passion (\u201cI feel a great deal of sexual desire for [name],\u201d \u201cI think [name] and I have \u2018soulmate\u2019 potential,\u201d \u201cI am romantically interested in [name],\u201d \u201c[name] is the only person I want to be romantically involved with,\u201d and \u201c[name] always seems to be on my mind\u201d; .84), three items assessing to what extent the participant desired a one-night stand, a casual relationship, and a serious relationship with the match/write-in (\u201cI would like to have a one-night stand with [name],\u201d \u201c. . . a casual relationship with [name],\u201d \u201c. . . a serious relationship with [name]\u201d), and an item assessing commitment to the match/write-in (\u201cI am committed to pursuing/maintaining a relationship with [name]\u201d).\nFinally, if participants responded \u201cyes\u201d that they had \u201cengaged in any romantic physical contact (kissing or other sexual activities) with [name]\u201d since the last time they had completed a follow-up questionnaire, they completed a one-item measure of sexual initiation (\u201cI basically initiated the physical contact with [name]\u201d), a one-item measure of sexual enjoyment (\u201cI enjoyed the romantic physical contact with [name]\u201d), and an item assessing to what\n2 Although we were dismayed by the low alpha of the Personable index for the speed-date preferences, we included it because the alphas for the Personable ideal-partner preferences and partner characteristics were acceptable. Although dropping the item fun/exciting might have produced a factor more similar to the Warmth/Trustworthiness factor identified by Fletcher et al. (1999), doing so actually reduced all relevant alphas in the present data set. Regardless, changing the Personable factor by dropping this item did not substantially alter the results reported in this article.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nextent the physical contact was a good idea (\u201chaving romantic physical contact with [name] was a bad idea [reverse scored]\u201d).3\nPotential moderator constructs. In the present report, we explore five moderators of H2 and H3. First, we describe the three constructs that were measured at the level of the individual participant (i.e., person-level moderators). Two of these three were intended to address H2A: Perhaps sex differences in the association between the relationship-initiation dependent variables and physical attractiveness or earning prospects will be larger for individuals who are more (compared with less) interested in acquiring a serious romantic relationship (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). The first moderator was desire for a serious relationship (target-general), assessed on the pre-event questionnaire by the item: \u201cThese days, how much would you like to have a serious relationship\u201d (1 not at all, 7 very much). The second moderator is a three-item measure of sociosexuality, a construct that assesses an individual\u2019s willingness to engage in short-term sexual relationships (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). The three items were assessed on the pre-event questionnaire (1 strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree) and were selected from the original Simpson and Gangestad (1991) inventory: \u201cSex without love is okay,\u201d \u201cI would have to be closely attached to someone (both emotionally and psychologically) before I could feel comfortable and fully enjoy having sex with him or her\u201d (reverse scored), and \u201cI can imagine myself being comfortable and enjoying \u2018casual\u2019 sex with different partners\u201d ( .86). The third was self-perceived mate value and was assessed on the pre-event questionnaire (1 strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree) by the items \u201cI am a desirable dating partner,\u201d \u201cIn general, I tend to have many options for romantic partners,\u201d and \u201cMembers of the opposite sex that I like tend to like me back\u201d ( .68). We used this construct to probe H3: Perhaps individuals are more likely to demonstrate interest in and pursue potential partners who approximate their ideals to the extent that they are high (or perhaps low) in selfperceived mate value.\nIn the present report, we explored two additional moderators that were assessed on the follow-up questionnaire about each match/write-in classified as romantic (i.e., target-specific moderators). The first is desire for a serious relationship (targetspecific), which also serves as one of the relationship-initiation dependent variables (see above). The second is partner-specific attachment anxiety, assessed by the items \u201cI need a lot of reassurance that [name] cares about me,\u201d \u201cI worry that [name] doesn\u2019t care about me as much I care about him/her,\u201d and \u201cI feel uncertain about [name]\u2019s true feelings for me\u201d ( .80). This construct represents the uncertainty and need for reassurance that individuals often experience in romantic relationships. Elsewhere (Eastwick & Finkel, in press-a), we have explored this construct in detail and argued that it is a common experience during the early stages of a romantic relationship. For the purposes of the present report, we hypothesized that partner-specific attachment anxiety could foster an empathy gap (Loewenstein, 2005) between participants\u2019 stated preferences (which they likely reported in a \u201ccool\u201d cognitive state) and the characteristics that actually inspire their passion for potential romantic partners. For simplicity, the analyses for the two target-specific moderators were conducted on the dependent variable romantic attraction ( .87); this DV is an average of the seven romantic-initiation dependent variable items (the five items encompassing passion, the get to know better item, and the com-\nmitment item), which (a) were necessarily assessed for that match or write-in at that wave and (b) were not obviously redundant with either moderator (e.g., the one-night stand and casual relationship items).\nAnalysis strategy. We used multilevel data-analytic strategies to examine the present data (Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Data collected prior to the follow-up questionnaires have a two-level structure: Measures assessed about each speed-date/match (Level 1) are nested within participant (Level 2). Data collected on the follow-up questionnaires have a three-level structure: Measures assessed on each of the 10 follow-up questionnaires (Level 1) are nested within each match/ write-in (Level 2), which are nested within participant (Level 3). For example, a participant who was a \u201cfriend with romantic potential\u201d with two different matches for all 10 follow-up questionnaires would provide 20 different associations between partner characteristics and passion (10 for each match). All analyses were carried out in SAS with either the NLMIXED procedure (to predict \u201cyessing\u201d using logistic regression) or the MIXED procedure (for all remaining dependent variables). The intercept was permitted to vary randomly at Level 2 and Level 3 (where applicable). All variables were left unstandardized (unless indicated otherwise); participant sex was coded male .5, female .5.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Stated Mate Preferences", "text": "Table 1 presents means for stated mate preferences separately by sex. In line with H1, the expected sex differences emerged. On the pre-event questionnaire, men (more than women) reported that the characteristic physically attractive was important in an ideal romantic partner and would matter in their decision to say yes to a speed-date. In addition, the same sex difference emerged 1 month later when participants again reported these ideal partner and speed-date stated preferences. The sex differences for physically attractive were medium to large in size (mean d .55), according to Cohen\u2019s (1992) conventions. In addition, women (more than men) estimated on the pre-event questionnaire that the characteristic earning prospects was important in an ideal romantic partner and would matter in their decision to say yes to a speed-date. One month later, this sex difference was marginally significant for participants\u2019 reports of an ideal partner but did not reach significance for the speed-date stated preferences. The sex differences for earning prospects were small to medium in size (mean d .35).

To test this hypothesis, we regressed the relationshipinitiation dependent variables (one at a time) onto physically attractive judgments separately for reports of speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins and separately for men and women. The Bs representing the associations between physically attractive and each dependent variable are presented separately by sex in the first four columns of Table 2. For dependent variables assessed prior to the follow-up questionnaire (above the dashed line), physically attractive judgments were assessed on the interaction record, whereas for dependent variables assessed on the follow-up questionnaire (below the dashed line), physically attractive judgments were assessed at the same follow-up wave.\nOverall, participants\u2019 judgments of a potential romantic partner\u2019s physical attractiveness positively and significantly predicted the relationship-initiation dependent variables. In addition, for each dependent variable, the significance of the difference between the male and female Bs was tested by the interaction term in a supplementary regression analysis that entered physically attractive, participant sex, and their interaction as predictors (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). Sporadic sex differences emerged for physically attractive (see bolded Bs in Table 2); for example, men were more likely than women to initiate correspondence/ hanging out with matches they found physically attractive (.35 vs. .10), whereas women were more likely than men to enjoy corresponding/hanging out with matches they found physically attractive (.22 vs. .11). A count of these sex differences reveals two cases in which the B was significantly more positive for men and three cases in which the B was significantly more positive for women out of 25 pairs of male/female regression Bs.\nTo gain a formal, less impressionistic sense of the big picture, we calculated the overall effect size r for the association between physically attractive and the relationship-initiation variables (see bottom of Table 2). We calculated these correlations using meta-\nanalytic models that included each relationship-initiation variable as a random effect and participant sex as a fixed effect (Cooper & Hedges, 1994; Konstantopoulos & Hedges, 2004). For example, each of the 28 speed-date/match Bs (see first two columns in Table 2) was first standardized and then weighted by the reciprocal of its variance (calculated from the Huber-White sandwich standard error);4 the intercept given by the model is the average r, and the fixed effect for sex indicates the average size of the sex difference across the DVs. This same procedure was implemented separately for speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins. In general, physical attractiveness predicted relationship initiation quite well: Correlations were .43 (men) and .46 (women) for reports of speeddating partners/matches and .26 (men) and .31 (women) for reports of write-ins.5 Finally, the size of the sex difference (i.e., the fixed effect of sex in the meta-analytic model, similar to the effect size q, which can be interpreted like a correlation, see Cohen, 1992) is presented in the final row of Table 2. For both speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins, the sex difference was nonsignificant. Descriptively speaking, both sex differences were extremely small (r .03, p .673, and r .05, p .499, for speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins, respectively) and, if anything,\n4 For \u201cyessing,\u201d the B estimate given by NLMIXED was first converted to a d(B 3/ ) and then to an r( d2/d2 4), and finally the variance of this correlation was calculated with the formula (1 r2)2/(N 2) (Haddock, Rindskopf, & Shadish, 1998; Rosenthal, 1994).\n5 Note that the smaller effect size for write-ins compared with matches is probably because of differences in variables assessed for these two kinds of targets; many of the largest effects were found for dependent variables assessed either on the interaction record or the postmatch questionnaire (which did not apply to write-ins), and effects for the eight dependent variables assessed for both matches and write-ins are roughly comparable in size.\nTable 1 Sex Differences in Stated Mate Preferences Among Speed-Daters\nStated preference\nParticipant sex\nSex differenceMale Female\nM SD M SD t df d\nPhysically attractive Pre-event ideal partner 8.04 1.10 7.18 1.31 4.52*** 156 0.71 Pre-event speed-date 7.78 1.08 7.00 1.60 3.64*** 140 0.57 Wave 10 ideal partner 8.01 0.81 7.62 1.22 2.02* 109 0.36 Wave 10 speed-date 7.64 1.20 6.90 1.46 2.85** 110 0.54 Earning prospects Pre-event ideal partner 6.91 1.53 7.73 1.36 3.61*** 161 0.57 Pre-event speed-date 4.42 1.96 5.05 2.19 2.47* 161 0.30 Wave 10 ideal partner 7.34 0.96 7.72 1.03 1.93\u2020 109 0.38 Wave 10 speed-date 5.12 1.94 5.42 1.93 0.79 110 0.16 Personable Pre-event ideal partner 8.10 0.73 8.10 0.71 0.01 161 0.00 Pre-event speed-date 7.03 1.06 7.21 1.09 1.05 161 0.17 Wave 10 ideal partner 8.12 0.68 8.20 0.74 0.60 109 0.11 Wave 10 speed-date 7.21 0.94 7.20 1.27 0.06 110 0.01\nNote. ns ranged from 45 to 82 men and from 66 to 81 women.

Although physical attractiveness appears to predict romantic interest in the early stages of potential relationships, we found no evidence for sex differences in its importance.\nH2 also suggests that finding a potential romantic partner to have good earning potential should better predict relationship initiation for women than for men. The four middle columns of Table 2 present the associations between participants\u2019 judgments of earning prospects and each dependent variable separately by sex and separately for speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins. Overall, participants\u2019 judgments of a potential romantic partner\u2019s earning prospects positively and significantly predicted the relationship-initiation dependent variables. Again, sporadic sex differences emerged for earning prospects (see bolded Bs in Table 2); surprisingly, at the event itself, men seemed especially interested (compared with women) in the speed-dating partners they felt had good earning prospects. A count of these sex differences across the 25 pairs of male/\nfemale regression Bs reveals five cases in which the B was significantly more positive for men and one case in which the B was significantly more positive for women. Again, more formally, we calculated the overall r for the association between earning prospects and relationship initiation using the same meta-analytic procedures described above. As displayed at the bottom of Table 2, earning prospects predicted relationship initiation, although the correlations were smaller than those found for physically attractive: Correlations were .19 (men) and .16 (women) for reports of speed-dating partners/matches and .16 (men) and .18 (women) for reports of write-ins. Again, there were no significant sex differences in these overall associations; the difference between the male and female rs were again descriptively very small (r .04, p .480, and r .02, p .825, for speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins, respectively), with one trending in the male direction and one trending in the female direction. Although earning prospects did positively predict romantic interest, again we found no evidence for sex differences in the importance of this variable.\nTable 2 Associations (Regression Bs) Between Partner Characteristics and Relationship-Initiation Dependent Variables\nDependent variable\nPhysically attractive Earning prospects Personable\nSpeed-date/match Write-in Speed-date/match Write-in Speed-date/match Write-in\nB B B B B B B B B B B B\nInteraction record Romantic desire .76*** .74*** .49*** .29*** .90*** .95***\nChemistry .44*** .51*** .50*** .32*** .89*** 1.02*** \u201cYessing\u201d 1.01*** .80*** .44*** .17*** .94*** 1.11*** Postmatch Excitement .49*** .44*** .14\u2020 .17* .28** .37***\nInitiation plans .44*** .41*** .07 .16* .10 .38*** Initiation hopes .40*** .48*** .00 .20** .00 .38***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Follow-up (all)\nGet to know better .46*** .39*** .48*** .37*** .27*** .28*** .34*** .23*** .64*** .60*** .56*** .44*** Date initiation .35*** .10 .09 .18* .20* .06 .16\u2020 .24* .10 .07 .07 .16 Date enjoyment .11\u2020 .22*** .35*** .37*** .22** .31*** .30*** .26*** .63*** .65*** .77*** .64*** Follow-up (romantic) Passion .31*** .39*** .30*** .43*** .13* .16* .08 .10\u2020 .27** .26*** .31*** .39***\nOne-night stand .07 .28*** .14 .07 .01 .25* .16\u2020 .19* .26\u2020 .23* .09 .09 Casual relationship .26*** .42*** .12 .05 .20** .25* .09 .12 .32** .32** .32** .06 Serious relationship .58*** .37*** .41*** .43*** .26** .17 .27** .07 .40** .23* .65*** .39*** Commitment .28** .45*** .32** .41*** .12 .14 .01 .20* .31* .40*** .39** .48*** Follow-up (sexual) Sexual initiation .22 .31* .19 .03 .08 .37* Sexual enjoyment .36*** .33*** .11 .10 .17 .14 Contact good idea .27 .42** .44* .53*** .14 .66***\nOverall r .43*** .46*** .26*** .31*** .19*** .16*** .16** .18** .29*** .32*** .25*** .27*** Sex difference r .03 .05 .04 .02 .03 .02\nNote. Regression Bs indicate the relationship between physically attractive, earning prospects, or personable partner characteristics and 17 relationshipinitiation dependent variables (each characteristic was regressed separately). Partner characteristics were measured on a 1\u20139 scale with higher numbers indicating greater presence of the characteristic in the partner. Relationship-initiation dependent variables were measured on a 1\u20137 scale, except for romantic desire and chemistry, which were measured on a 1\u20139 scale, and \u201cyessing,\u201d which is coded 1 for yes and 0 for no. Bs in the speed-date/match column were calculated on potential partners whom the participants met while speed-dating; Bs in the write-in column were calculated on potential partners whom the participants met independently of speed-dating. Bolded Bs indicate a significant or marginally significant sex difference; the bolded B is always the more positive of the two. Partner characteristics ( physically attractive, earning prospects, personable) were assessed either at the speed-dating event (above the dashed line) or at each follow-up wave (below the dashed line). The overall r row indicates the meta-analyzed effect size r across all Bs reported in the column. The sex difference r row indicates the size of the difference between men\u2019s reports ( ) and women\u2019s reports ( ); a negative r indicates that the characteristic was a stronger determinant of men\u2019s romantic interest. \u2020 p .10. * p .05. ** p .01. *** p .001.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nFinally, for comparative purposes, we examined the relationship between personable characteristics and the relationship-initiation variables, although we would not expect to find systematic sex differences in these associations. The final four columns of Table 2 present the associations between participants\u2019 judgments of personable and each dependent variable separately by sex and separately for speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins. Overall, participants\u2019 judgments of a potential romantic partner\u2019s personable characteristics positively and significantly predicted the relationship-initiation dependent variables. Three sex differences (out of 25) emerged for personable in the female direction (see bolded Bs in Table 2). Again, we calculated the overall r for the association between personable and relationship initiation using the same meta-analytic procedures described previously. As displayed at the bottom of Table 2, personable predicted relationship initiation moderately well: Correlations were .29 (men) and .32 (women) for reports of speed-dating partners/matches and .25 (men) and .27 (women) for reports of write-ins. As expected, there were no significant sex differences in these overall associations (r .03, p .714, and r .02, p .812, for speed-dating partners/matches and write-ins, respectively).\nThe preceding analyses revealed that participants\u2019 own judgments of the physical attractiveness and earning prospects of potential romantic partners predicted their romantic interest in those partners equally well for men and women. However, it could still be true that men (compared with women) are more romantically interested in objectively attractive potential partners and that women (compared with men) are more romantically interested in objectively ambitious potential partners. To explore this possibility, we obtained several alternative measures of partner characteristics. Because each speed-dater was rated by 9\u201313 other speeddaters on the characteristics physically attractive, earning prospects, and personable, we could create consensus ratings of these three characteristics for each target by averaging these 9\u201313 judgments. Interrater reliabilities for these judgments were strong: The physically attractive reliability was .92, the earning prospects reliability was .77, and the personable reliability was .79.\nFor each analysis presented in the \u201cspeed-date/match\u201d columns of Table 2, these consensus ratings were substituted in place of the subjective physically attractive, earning prospects, and personable judgments (no consensus ratings were available for write-ins). Using the same meta-analytic procedure reported above, we calculated overall rs that describe the association between each target\u2019s consensus characteristics and participants\u2019 reports on the relationship-initiation dependent variables with respect to that target. Overall rs and sex-difference rs are presented in the first three rows of Table 3. Physically attractive, earning prospects, and personable consensus ratings were positively and significantly associated with the relationship-initiation dependent variables for both men and women. As with the subjective judgments, however, the sex differences in these associations were small and nonsignificant.\nAll speed-daters had their photographs taken at the speed-dating event, affording an additional measure of physical attractiveness. Six independent coders (three women and three men) rated each photo on physical attractiveness ( .76); for each analysis presented in the first two columns of Table 2, these coder ratings were substituted in place of the subjective attractiveness judgments\n(photos were not taken of write-ins, so no coder-ratings were available). As shown in the fourth row of Table 3, the overall meta-analyzed rs for men and women were again positive and significant, but as with the subjective physical-attractiveness judgments, the sex difference was again small and nonsignificant.\nFinally, similar to an analysis conducted by Fisman et al. (2006), we used the 2000 census data (United States Census Bureau, 2000) to calculate the natural log of the median income of each participant\u2019s hometown (hometown was reported by zip code on the pre-event questionnaire). For each analysis presented in the fifth and sixth columns of Table 2, these ratings were substituted for the subjective earning-prospects judgments (no hometown zip codes were assessed for write-ins, so no income measure was available for these targets). As shown in the fifth row of Table 3, women demonstrated neither greater nor lesser romantic initiation toward men who were from wealthy hometowns, and men appeared to dislike women from wealthy hometowns, although this correlation was small (r .08). As with the subjective earning-prospects judgments, the sex difference was nonsignificant (r .06, p .134). Taken together, these five auxiliary analyses suggest that men and women did not differ in how these alternative measures of partner characteristics inspired their romantic interest, which is the same pattern of results revealed by participants\u2019 own subjective judgments (see Table 2). (We explore H2A regarding participants\u2019 short-term versus long-term orientations in the Moderator Construct Analyses section below.)"}, {"heading": "Individual Differences in Relationship Initiation", "text": "Considering that male and female participants differed in how important they rated physical attractiveness and earning prospects in an ideal partner and an ideal speed-date (H1), how is it that no sex differences emerged when predicting relationship-initiation variables from these same characteristics (H2)? This intriguing null finding suggests the possibility that stated ideal partner preferences may have been unrelated to what actually inspired romantic interest in the live dating context of this study (see also Iyengar et al., 2005). Therefore, we examined H3: If some participants reported an especially strong preference for a certain partner\nNote. Male and female r columns present the meta-analyzed effect size r between the independent variable (calculated with respect to speed-dates/ matches only) and all relationship-initiation dependent variables (see Table 2) for male and female participants, respectively. The sex difference r column indicates the size of the difference between men\u2019s reports and women\u2019s reports; a negative r indicates that the characteristic was a stronger determinant of men\u2019s romantic interest. ** p .01. *** p .001.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\ncharacteristic (e.g., physically attractive), did those same participants also demonstrate especially strong romantic interest in and pursuit of those romantic partners they judged to possess that characteristic? The context of the speed-dating event provides a rare opportunity to examine this individual-differences hypothesis; because participants met between 9 and 13 potential romantic partners at an event, we can assign each participant a unique B for how well his/her judgments of physically attractive (or earning prospects, or personable) predicted his/her reports of romantic desire, chemistry, or likelihood of \u201cyessing\u201d across all dates.6 If the stated preferences have predictive validity, a participant who stated that physical attractiveness was important in an ideal romantic partner or a speed-date should have shown a strong association (i.e., a large B) between judgments of his/her dates\u2019 physical attractiveness and his/her romantic desire for, chemistry with, and likelihood of \u201cyessing\u201d those dates. In other words, a participant\u2019s stated preferences and the in vivo preferences revealed by his/her own individual Bs should be positively correlated.\nTables 4, 5, and 6 present all correlations among participants\u2019 individual Bs (romantic desire, chemistry, and \u201cyessing\u201d) and his/her stated preferences (ideal partner and speed-date, both preevent and Wave 10) for physically attractive, earning prospects, and personable, respectively. There are two ways of scoring stated preferences in these analyses: Stated preferences can be withinperson centered (i.e., the raw, 1\u20139 values minus the participant\u2019s mean rating across all traits, also called an ipsative measure), or they can be left as their raw values. A high value for a withinperson centered stated preference indicates that the participant claimed to value that trait more than he/she values other traits, whereas a high value for a raw stated preference indicates that the participant claimed to value that trait more than other participants did. Because both approaches are meaningful, we present the within-person centered correlations above the diagonal and the raw-values correlations below the diagonal in Tables 4, 5, and 6. (Of course, the correlations among the three Bs do not change whether they are below or above the diagonal.)\nAcross Tables 4, 5, and 6, the three Bs correlated significantly with one another. For example, if a participant tended to romantically desire those dates he found physically attractive, he also tended to experience chemistry with those same dates he found\nattractive (r .62, p .001; see Table 4). Also, the four statedpreference assessments (both within-person centered and raw values) correlated highly with one another. If a participant reported a strong ideal partner preference before the event for someone with good earning prospects, she was more likely than other participants to also report a preference for such a partner while speed-dating (r .52, p .001), and at the Wave 10 follow-up as an ideal partner (r .53, p .001), and while speed-dating (r .39, p .001; see Table 5). However, the correlations between the Bs (in vivo preferences) and the stated-preference measures (both withinperson centered and raw values) were small: Out of 72 correlations, only 2 were significant and positive and 1 was actually significant and negative. For example, participants who reported at pretest that they would be more likely to say yes to a date who they felt was personable were in fact not significantly more likely to say yes to those dates (r .05, p .578; see Table 6). In summary, although participants\u2019 stated preferences were consistent across four different assessments, and although participants\u2019 in vivo preferences were consistent within a live dating context (i.e., the B correlations), participants\u2019 stated preferences were unrelated to their in vivo preferences.\nTables 4, 5, and 6 present results aggregated across sex; however, it is possible that this presentation could obscure sex differences in these correlations. To test for sex differences, we conducted regressions that predicted each variable in Tables 4, 5, and 6 from one of the remaining six variables in that table, participant sex, and their interaction. (We report this analysis on the withinperson centered stated preferences to keep the presentation manageable, but our conclusions were identical when we used the raw-values preferences.) Because the interaction with sex may\n6 Bs for \u201cyessing\u201d could not be computed for participants who said \u201cyes\u201d (n 6) or \u201cno\u201d (n 3) to all dates. Also, because a B for \u201cyessing\u201d is the natural log of an odds ratio, a number of large outliers emerged; participants who had \u201cyessing\u201d Bs beyond Tukey\u2019s inner fences (Myers & Well, 1995; Tukey, 1977) were considered missing (ns 12 for physically attractive, 15 for earning prospects, 25 for personable). Even with the inclusion of these outliers, however, none of the 24 nonsignificant correlations between a stated preference and the \u201cyessing\u201d Bs in Tables 4, 5, and 6 (the correlations of interest) became significant.\nTable 4 Correlations Between Participants\u2019 Romantic Desire, Chemistry, and \u201cYessing\u201d Bs and Stated Preferences for Physically Attractive\nVariable Romantic desire B\nChemistry B\n\u201cYessing\u201d B\nPre-event ideal partner\nPre-event speed-date\nWave 10 ideal partner\nWave 10 speed-date\nRomantic desire B \u2014 .62*** .24** .02 .07 .04 .01 Chemistry B .62*** \u2014 .16* .02 .03 .10 .08 \u201cYessing\u201d B .24** .16* \u2014 .10 .12 .02 .00 Pre-event ideal partner .03 .07 .09 \u2014 .62*** .68*** .55*** Pre-event speed-date .02 .06 .14 .61*** \u2014 .60*** .62*** Wave 10 ideal partner .08 .06 .06 .68*** .61*** \u2014 .55*** Wave 10 speed-date .00 .00 .01 .55*** .67*** .70*** \u2014\nNote.

Stated preferences were assessed both before the speed-dating event and at the 10th follow-up wave (1 month later).

For physically attractive, only 3 of these 42 regressions revealed a sex interaction (at p .05), for earning prospects, only 4 of these 42 regressions revealed a sex interaction, and for personable, only 6 out of these 42 regressions revealed a sex interaction. Furthermore, only 1 of these 13 sex-differentiated correlations was between a B and a stated preference (the correlations of interest), and this correlation remained nonsignificant for both men and women. Therefore, we find little evidence to suggest that the sexes differ in how well their stated preferences correlate with their in vivo preferences.\nFinally, we subjected the three in vivo preferences and the four within-person centered stated preferences (separately for Physically Attractive, Earning Prospects, and Personable) to a factor analysis to more formally test whether in vivo and stated preferences reflect two independent factors. (Again, results do not change appreciably when using the raw-values preferences.) The results of these three factor analyses (principal axis factoring with promax rotation) are presented in Table 7. In all three cases, two-factor solutions were suggested by parallel analyses (Hum-\nphreys & Montanelli, 1975; see also Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, & Strahan, 1999) in which the eigenvalues of the actual data are compared with eigenvalues of an equivalently sized set of random data. As expected, for all three sets of preferences, the three in vivo preferences loaded on one factor and the four stated preferences loaded on the other. Furthermore, the promax rotation is oblique and therefore permits the factors to be correlated; however, as shown in Table 7, the correlation between the two factors was generally quite weak across the three sets of preferences."}, {"heading": "Similarity Effects?", "text": "It is plausible that participants\u2019 awareness of their own standing on these partner characteristics ( physically attractive, earning prospects, and personable) inhibited the pursuit of their ideals. In other words, stated preferences may have failed to correlate with in vivo preferences not because participants\u2019 stated preferences were inaccurate, but instead because they anticipated rejection to the degree a partner outshined them on a particular characteristic. To explore this possibility, we conducted a series of regression equations with the following form:\nTable 5 Correlations Between Participants\u2019 Romantic Desire, Chemistry, and \u201cYessing\u201d Bs and Stated Preferences for Earning Prospects\nVariable Romantic desire B\nChemistry B\n\u201cYessing\u201d B\nPre-event ideal partner\nPre-event speed-date\nWave 10 ideal partner\nWave 10 speed-date\nRomantic desire B \u2014 .71*** .59*** .07 .09 .03 .03 Chemistry B .71*** \u2014 .48*** .11 .13 .13 .02 \u201cYessing\u201d B .59*** .48*** \u2014 .04 .08 .07 .12 Pre-event ideal partner .14 .16* .07 \u2014 .53*** .60*** .41*** Pre-event speed-date .10 .16* .08 .52*** \u2014 .44*** .53*** Wave 10 ideal partner .13 .15 .09 .53*** .38*** \u2014 .47*** Wave 10 speed-date .03 .03 .18 .39*** .53*** .44*** \u2014\nNote.

We regressed each of these three dependent variables on each of the three characteristics (nine total regressions).\nTo examine similarity effects, we conducted each of the nine regressions twice, as suggested by Griffin, Murray, and Gonzalez (1999): once for all reports in which participants scored higher than their speed-dating partner (SelfChari PartnerCharij) and once for all reports in which participants scored lower (SelfChari PartnerCharij). If 2 is positive when SelfChari PartnerCharij but negative when SelfChari PartnerCharij, this would indicate that participants desired similarity on that characteristic. Furthermore, stated-preference effects could emerge after accounting for these similarity effects: A positive PartnerCharij StatedPrefi interaction would indicate that having a strong stated preference leads participants to either (a) strongly deselect partners who fall below them on that characteristic or (b) strongly select partners despite the fact that they lie above them on that characteristic.\nNone of the nine regressions revealed any evidence that participants desired similarity. Whether speed-dating partners scored below or above the participant on a characteristic, participants significantly liked the partner more to the extent that he/she possessed greater levels of that characteristic (all 2s were positive; ts 2.68). Furthermore, none of the PartnerCharij StatedPrefi interactions were both positive and significant ( p .05), although two were p .10 and negative and three were p .10 and positive. These analyses suggest that participants did not experience inhibited romantic interest in speed-dating partners who exceeded them on a characteristic; on the contrary, higher physical attractiveness, earning prospects, or personable ratings\nwere consistently romantically inspiring regardless of self ratings, and stated preferences did not play a consistent role in moderating these effects."}, {"heading": "Moderator Construct Analyses", "text": "At this point, the data suggest a disconnect between the characteristics that participants claim to prefer in a romantic partner and the characteristics that participants actually value in a live dating context. To get a better sense of what might or might not be accounting for the effects reported above, we conducted several theoretically sensible moderational analyses.\nDesire for a serious relationship (target-general). Some prominent evolutionary theories (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson, 2000) would suggest that the null results for H2 (missing sex differences) are not meaningful without considering participants\u2019 short-term versus long-term mating orientations. After all, several previous reports have suggested that men\u2019s and women\u2019s ideal partner preferences change depending on whether they are considering a short-term or long-term relationship (e.g., Li & Kenrick, 2006). Therefore, we explored H2A: Might sex differences in the associations between the relationship-initiation dependent variables and physical attractiveness or earning prospects have emerged for participants who were more (compared with less) interested in having a long-term relationship? If so, we would expect to consistently find significant Partner Characteristic Sex Desire for a Serious Relationship (Target-General) interactions predicting the relationship-initiation dependent variables.7 We tested whether this three-way interaction was significant for every male/female pair of Bs displayed in Table 2 (with\n7 This three-way interaction tests whether any sex difference in the association between a partner characteristic and romantic interest is smaller for participants who experienced low compared with high desire for a serious relationship. Given ambiguities in the previous literature (e.g., Kenrick et al., 1993, vs. Li & Kenrick, 2006), we did not specifically hypothesize whether the sex differences would be reduced, nonexistent, or reversed for participants experiencing low desire for a serious relationship. Indeed, the three-way interaction could detect any of these patterns, and all of them would support prominent evolutionary models of mating (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson, 2000); we therefore tested for three-way interactions across all relevant moderator analyses.\nTable 7 Factor Loadings of Participants\u2019 Romantic Desire, Chemistry, and \u201cYessing\u201d Bs and Stated Preferences\nVariable\nPhysically attractive Earning prospects Personable\nFactor 1 Factor 2 Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 1 Factor 2\nIn vivo preferences Romantic desire B .04 .89 .11 .86 .11 .80 Chemistry B .06 .69 .04 .81 .10 .63 \u201cYessing\u201d B .04 .21 .08 .71 .04 .52 Stated preferences Pre-event ideal partner .78 .06 .79 .06 .53 .04 Pre-event speed-date .74 .02 .75 .03 .66 .08 Wave 10 ideal partner .82 .06 .67 .01 .73 .07 Wave 10 speed-date .71 .00 .62 .03 .56 .09 Factor correlation r .01 r .09 r .02\nNote.

In other words, we explored 11 possible three-way interactions in which speed-dating matches served as targets and 8 possible three-way interactions for the write-ins for each partner characteristic.\nFor the characteristic physically attractive, H2A predicts that these three-way interactions will be negative. That is, the two-way Physically Attractive Desire for a Serious Relationship (TargetGeneral) interaction (which tests whether physically attractive better predicts the dependent variable among individuals more compared with less interested in a serious relationship) should be more positive for men than for women. However, out of 11 possible three-way interactions for the speed-dating matches, 0 were significant and negative and 1 was actually significant and positive (i.e., the two-way interaction was more positive for women). Out of eight possible three-way interactions for the writeins, two were significant and negative and two were significant and positive. For the characteristic earning prospects, H2A predicts that these three-way interactions will be positive. That is, the two-way Earning Prospects Desire for a Serious Relationship (Target-General) interaction (which tests whether earning prospects better predicts the dependent variable among individuals more compared with less interested in a serious relationship) should be more positive for women than for men. Only 1 out of 11 possible three-way interactions for the speed-dating matches was significant and positive, and one out of eight possible three-way interactions for the write-ins was actually significant and negative (i.e., the two-way interaction was more positive for men). Finally, H2A would not necessarily predict the emergence of significant three-way interactions for the characteristic personable. In this case, 1 out of 11 possible three-way interactions was significant (and positive) for the speed-daters, and three out of eight possible three-way interactions were significant (and positive) for the writeins. In short, these analyses did not reveal compelling evidence that the sex differences predicted by H2 emerged more strongly for participants who were especially interested in acquiring a serious romantic relationship.\nSociosexuality. Sociosexuality refers to the degree to which individuals are willing (unrestricted) or unwilling (restricted) to engage in short-term, sexual relationships (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). Again, we examined H2A: It is possible that sex differences in Table 2 might emerge for individuals at the restricted (low) compared with the unrestricted (high) end of the sociosexuality scale. To explore this possibility, we conducted analyses identical to those reported above for desire for a serious relationship (targetgeneral). (Note that the predicted direction of effects reverses for sociosexuality because of how the items are scored.)\nNone of the 11 Physically Attractive Sex Sociosexuality interactions was significant for the speed-dating matches, and two of the eight possible three-way interactions for the write-ins were significant and negative (i.e., the opposite of the predicted direction). For the characteristic earning prospects, 0 of the 11 possible three-way interactions was significant for the speed-dating matches, and for the write-ins, 1 was significant and negative (the predicted direction) and 1 was significant and positive (the opposite of the predicted direction). For the characteristic personable, 1 out of 11 possible three-way interactions was significant (and negative) for the speed-dating matches, and one out of eight\npossible three-way interactions was significant (and negative) for the write-ins. Again, the data did not suggest that the sex differences predicted by H2 emerged more strongly for participants who were less (compared with more) willing to engage in short-term, sexual relationships.\nDesire for a serious relationship (target-specific). We also explored whether one of the relationship-initiation dependent variables, desire for a serious relationship, could serve as a moderator of the effects reported in Table 2. Because participants completed this item with regard to a specific target, it provides a more focused test of H2A than does the general, person-level desire-for-aserious-relationship item. However, because this target-specific desire-for-a-serious-relationship measure was assessed on each follow-up questionnaire for matches/write-ins classified as romantic (see Method section), it cannot be used to predict many of the relationship-initiation dependent variables (e.g., those assessed at the level of the target, such as \u201cyessing\u201d). For simplicity, we examined whether the three-way Partner Characteristic Sex Desire for a Serious Relationship (Target-Specific) interaction significantly predicted the amalgamated dependent variable romantic attraction, which was made up of all the romantic-initiation items that had to be available at each follow-up wave for each match or write-in classified as romantic (see Method section).\nFor the characteristic physically attractive, this three-way interaction was marginally significant and positive (the opposite of the predicted direction) for matches and was marginally significant and negative (the predicted direction) for write-ins. For the characteristics earning prospects and personable, the three-way interactions did not reach marginal significance for either speed-dating matches or write-ins. In total, we did not find compelling evidence for H2A using this target-specific desire-for-a-serious-relationship item. (Null or inconsistent results also emerged when we examined the moderational role of the two target-specific variables that assessed desire for a casual relationship and desire for a one-night stand.)\nAn astute reader might notice that in the first two columns of Table 2, physically attractive predicts desire for a one-night stand more strongly for women than for men but predicts desire for a serious relationship more strongly for men than for women. This pattern is consistent with H2A, and indeed, the Physically Attractive Sex interaction is significant if used to predict the difference between these two items (serious minus one-night stand). However, the Physically Attractive Sex interaction is not significant for the write-ins, and neither of the Earning Prospects Sex interactions is significant. Oddly, the Personable Sex interaction is significant for the write-ins; the sex-differentiated pattern is especially pronounced in this case but is not consistent with H2A. In short, one of the four predicted interactions was significant, and one of the two nonpredicted interactions was significant.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the three moderators used above to test H2A all demonstrated healthy variability in this sample. Desire for a serious relationship (target-general) had a mean of 5.0 (SD 1.6), sociosexuality had a mean of 3.2 (SD 1.8), and desire for a serious relationship (target-specific) had a mean of 4.8 (SD 1.8; across matches and write-ins). The range of all three variables included the entire 1\u20137 scale, and none had any outliers outside of Tukey\u2019s inner fences (Myers & Well, 1995; Tukey, 1977). It is also unlikely that all participants had solely short-term romantic goals in mind: For speed-dating matches, participants\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nwere most interested in a casual relationship (M 5.08), followed by a serious relationship (M 3.89), and were least interested in a one-night stand (M 3.20; all three means differ significantly at p .001). For write-ins, participants were most interested in a serious relationship (M 5.39), followed by a casual relationship (M 5.14), and were again least interested in a one-night stand (M 3.10; all three means differ significantly at p .03). In sum, the data suggest that participants\u2019 short-term versus long-term orientations had no bearing on our failure to confirm H2 in this study.\nPartner-specific attachment anxiety. We also conducted an exploratory analysis examining whether partner-specific attachment anxiety (e.g., Eastwick & Finkel, in press-a) might serve as a moderator of the effects presented in Table 2. We hypothesized that participants might show traditional sex differences on the characteristics that predict the relationship-initiation variables when they are not feeling particularly anxious or uncertain about what a potential romantic partner thinks of them. In other words, anxiety could be one emotion that fosters an empathy gap (e.g., Loewenstein, 2005) between the cool, rational mindset in which stated preferences are typically reported and the desire participants feel toward a real-life potential romantic partner. Perhaps it is easier to compare a target\u2019s qualities with some ideal romanticpartner template (a template which typically differs by sex) when one is not preoccupied with thoughts about whether that target is romantically interested in the self.\nTo illustrate, imagine a male participant who is not caught up in the throes of anxiety with respect to a certain physically attractive female target, yet he still remains romantically interested in her and recognizes that she is an \u201cobjectively\u201d good catch. It is easy to imagine that, in such a nonanxious state, men (compared with women) might be more inspired by a target\u2019s physical attractiveness and women (compared with men) might be more inspired by a target\u2019s earning prospects. However, as participants report increasing levels of partner-specific attachment anxiety, the traditional sex differences should become attenuated. This hypothesis suggests that a three-way Partner Characteristic Sex PartnerSpecific Attachment Anxiety interaction should emerge for the traditionally sex-differentiated characteristics physically attractive and earning prospects but not for personable in predicting romantic attraction. (We use this amalgamated dependent variable again because partner-specific attachment anxiety, like desire for a serious relationship [target-specific], was assessed only for matches/ write-ins classified as romantic.)\nFor the characteristic physically attractive, this three-way interaction was marginally significant and positive for matches; this suggests that, as predicted, physically attractive was a better predictor of romantic interest for men (compared with women) at low rather than high levels of partner-specific attachment anxiety. However, the three-way interaction did not achieve significance for the write-ins. For the characteristic earning prospects, the three-way interaction was marginally significant and negative for matches and significant and negative for write-ins; this suggests that, as predicted, earning prospects was a better predictor of romantic interest for women (compared with men) at low rather than high levels of partner-specific attachment anxiety. Finally, for the characteristic personable, the three-way interaction was not significant for either matches or write-ins, as expected.8 Although we view these results as preliminary and we await future research\nbefore drawing definitive conclusions, it is possible that the uncertainty or anxiety often associated with developing relationships may attenuate traditional sex differences in the characteristics that men and women consider important in a romantic partner.\nH3 moderation. Finally, we attempted to identify significant moderators of the 72 stated/in vivo correlations presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6. For example, it is plausible that participants showed greater correspondence between their stated and in vivo preferences to the extent that they were interested in having a long-term, serious relationship or to the extent that they had a restricted sociosexual orientation (these H3 moderational analyses can only be conducted with moderators measured at the level of the individual participant). If this were true, we would expect to find that desire for a serious relationship (target-general) positively interacted (and sociosexuality negatively interacted) with stated preferences to predict in vivo preferences. Separately for these two possible moderators, we conducted two regressions for each of the 72 correlations (total regressions per moderator 144), once with the stated preference serving as the dependent variable and once with the in vivo preference serving as the dependent variable (just as above when we explored sex differences in these correlations). The interaction of desire for a serious relationship (target-general) and these preferences was never significant and positive (the predicted direction) and was actually significant and negative in two cases. In addition, sociosexuality was only a significant and negative (the predicted direction) moderator in 1 of these 144 regressions; it was never significant and positive. Therefore, it appears unlikely that participants\u2019 desire for a serious relationship or their sociosexuality orientation were factors that could explain why their stated and in vivo preferences were uncorrelated.\nWe also explored the possibility that self-perceived mate value could moderate these 72 stated/in vivo correlations. Two patterns are plausible. For one, perhaps stated and in vivo preferences correlated poorly in this study because participants with low mate value felt they had little to offer in the dating arena and were therefore more likely to express interest in real-life potential partners who fell short of their stated ideal. On the other hand, perhaps individuals with high mate value possessed unrealistic ideals regarding romantic partners, and it would therefore be the low-matevalue participants who would be in a position to select partners who approximated their attainable ideals. The first hypothesis predicts that self-perceived mate value will positively interact with stated preferences to predict in vivo preferences (and vice versa), and the second hypothesis predicts that these interactions will be negative. Again, we conducted 144 regressions. The interaction of self-perceived mate value and these preferences was never significant and positive, and in nine cases (6% of the analyses), the interaction was significant and negative. We therefore find little consistent evidence that participants\u2019 self-perceived mate value (i.e., their own general self-assessment of success with the oppo-\n8 Of the three marginal or significant three-way interactions involving partner-specific attachment anxiety, only the following two-way simple slope of interest was reliable: The Physically Attractive Sex interaction was significant and positive for individuals scoring one standard deviation above the mean on partner-specific attachment anxiety (e.g., physically attractive predicted romantic attraction better for women than for men at high levels of anxiety). Thus, the present results do not allow for definitive conclusions about the precise pattern of these interactions.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nsite sex) significantly inhibited or augmented the pursuit of their ideals at the speed-dating event.\nTable 8 briefly summarizes the outcomes of each of the analyses reported in this article that tested a possible explanation for our failure to confirm H2 and H3.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we examined how participants\u2019 judgments of potential romantic partners\u2019 physical attractiveness, earning prospects, and personable characteristics predicted the romantic interest they felt toward those individuals. We advanced three hypotheses: Given that (a) participants demonstrated traditional stated-preference sex differences on the characteristics physically attractive and earning prospects, data should have revealed (b) sex differences in the associations between those characteristics and romantic interest in potential partners and (c) meaningful correlations between stated preferences and in vivo preferences revealed at the speed-dating event. The latter two hypotheses were unsupported. First, although physical attractiveness, good earning prospects, and personable characteristics were all positively and significantly associated with romantic interest, the data revealed no evidence of sex differences in these associations. We were also unable to find any evidence that these missing sex differences were related to participants\u2019 long-term versus short-term orientations, as might be predicted by some prominent evolutionary theories (e.g., Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Second, stated preferences were largely independent of in vivo preferences: For example, a participant who claimed to value physical attractiveness highly in a romantic partner was not significantly more likely than other participants to like, feel chemistry with, or say \u201cyes\u201d to the dates he found physically attractive.\nThese data offer support for the idea that mate preferences as reported in the typical stated-preference paradigm might reflect\nparticipants\u2019 a priori theories about the characteristics of a person that might inspire their romantic interest (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977; see Sprecher, 1989, for a similar perspective). Recall one Nisbett and Wilson (1977) example: Some participants watched a film while distracted by a noisy power saw and claimed that the noise negatively affected their impression of the film. In fact, participants who watched the movie without the distraction did not rate the film any more favorably. Although the power saw seemed like a plausible explanation for participants\u2019 dislike of the film, it actually had no discernable impact. Similarly, participants\u2019 stated mate preferences might overweight (or underweight) factors that seem like plausible (or implausible) reasons for liking one particular romantic partner more than another. If indeed participants\u2019 stated preferences derive from such plausibility judgments in lieu of genuine introspection, this could explain why they failed to predict judgments and behavior in this study.\nIt may initially seem absurd that something as important as one\u2019s mate preferences (as opposed to beliefs about distracting power saws) might merely reflect a priori theories constructed from na\u0131\u0308ve plausibility judgments. One possible resolution to this puzzle is that stated mate preferences may be subject to the empathy gap (Loewenstein, 2005) if one\u2019s preferences are reported coolly and rationally without fully accounting for the affect that often characterizes romantic processes. According to this theoretical perspective, we might expect that a priori theories will play a role in partner selection in the instances when participants somehow elude the powerful affect often associated with romantic attraction. In the present study, we found suggestive evidence that traditional sex differences in relationship initiation emerged for participants reporting low (compared with high) levels of one indicator of such affect: partnerspecific attachment anxiety.\nHowever, the a priori theories and (closely related) empathygap accounts are not the only plausible interpretations of the\nTable 8 Plausible Explanations for the Failure to Confirm Hypotheses 2 and 3\nAlternative explanation Supported?\nFor missing sex differences (Hypothesis 2) \u25cf Sex differences might emerge using consensus or objective measures of partner characteristics Unsupported \u25cf Sex differences might emerge for participants who are more (compared to less) interested in a serious relationship\nin general Unsupported\n\u25cf Sex differences might emerge for participants who have a restricted (compared to an unrestricted) sociosexual orientation\nUnsupported\n\u25cf Sex differences might emerge for participants reporting high (compared to low) interest in a serious relationship with a specific partner\nUnsupported\n\u25cf Sex differences might emerge for participants reporting low (compared to high) levels of partner-specific attachment anxiety\nModestly supported\nFor poor correlation of stated and in-vivo preferences (Hypothesis 3) \u25cf Participants might exhibit diminished interest in partners who exceeded their self-ratings on a particular\ncharacteristic (i.e., they anticipated rejection) Unsupported\n\u25cf Correlations might be stronger for participants who are more (compared to less) interested in a serious relationship in general\nUnsupported\n\u25cf Correlations might be stronger for participants who have a restricted (compared to an unrestricted) sociosexual orientation\nUnsupported\n\u25cf Correlations might be stronger for participants who are especially high (or especially low) in self-perceived mate value\nUnsupported\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npresent data. For example, the closed field of eligible partners at the speed-dating event itself might have inspired individuals not to act on their preferences but rather to simply pursue the best of the available options. Individual preferences might exert more of an influence in an open-field situation in which participants are not guaranteed a face-to-face interaction with all the desirable individuals present.9 Nor does the a priori theories account suggest that stated mate preferences are not worthy of empirical study. Quite the contrary, the present results highlight new research possibilities that will facilitate a better understanding of (a) when and how romantic-partner ideals impact partner selection and (b) how those ideals come to be sex differentiated in the first place. Below, we explicate some of these possibilities and highlight what the present work does and does not say about the processes underlying romantic-partner selection."}, {"heading": "Alternative Explanations, Limitations, and Future Directions", "text": "Comparison with previous literature. Although on the surface it appears anomalous that these data revealed no evidence of sex differences in the importance of physical attractiveness and earning prospects, the results are actually quite consistent with previous findings. As reported in the introduction section, other studies have found that physical attractiveness is a similarly strong determinant of men\u2019s and women\u2019s desirability in speed-dating (Kurzban & Weeden, 2005) and regular dating (Feingold, 1990) contexts. Kurzban and Weeden (2005) and Fisman et al. (2006) did not find a significant sex difference in the (weak) effect of income (or hometown income) on speed-daters\u2019 desirability; we, too, found weak effects for this variable and no significant sex difference. Iyengar et al. (2005) also reported small correlations between speed-daters\u2019 stated preferences and their \u201cyessing\u201d Bs, very similar to those reported here. In an article that specifically explored sex differences in a speed-dating context, Fisman et al. (2006) reported that men were more likely than women to say \u201cyes\u201d to a speed-dating partner they found to be physically attractive. In fact, our data showed this same sex difference (see Table 2, third row, first vs. second columns), but we would hesitate to conclude that this sex difference alone demonstrates that physical attractiveness is more important to men. It does suggest that men may be more eager than women to obtain the contact information of a physically attractive other, but as illustrated by our range of dependent variables, exchanging contact information is merely one step on the road to relationship initiation. The fact that this particular sex difference reverses at other points in the process (e.g., feeling chemistry, date enjoyment) recommends employing a range of dependent variables as investigators to further unravel how partner characteristics impact the process of selecting a romantic partner. Last, although we found no evidence that participants preferred similarity on these particular characteristics, other researchers have in fact had similar difficulty uncovering similarity effects (especially on physical attractiveness) in live dating contexts (Walster et al., 1966, cf. Berscheid, Dion, Walster, & Walster, 1971).\nMoreover, we are not the first to recommend examining whether participants\u2019 stated mate preferences predict their interest in reallife romantic partners. The sex difference in the preferred age of one\u2019s mate has enjoyed such validation: For example, Buss (1989)\nreported substantial correlations between national averages of men\u2019s and women\u2019s preferences for a younger/older mate and national statistics on age difference at marriage (see also Kenrick & Keefe, 1992). At this time, it is unclear why preferences for characteristics such as physical attractiveness or earning prospects in a mate operate differently in live romantic contexts compared with age preferences. Future reports that directly compare the functional role of preferences for romantic partners\u2019 characteristics and for romantic partners\u2019 age (perhaps at different points in women\u2019s ovulatory cycles; e.g., Haselton & Miller, 2006) are sure to reveal fascinating insights.\nSample considerations. The participants in this sample were all undergraduate students at a medium-sized private university in the midwestern United States. In addition, all participants were willing to go speed-dating, an activity that probably does not appeal to everyone (cf. Eastwick & Finkel, in press-b; Finkel et al., 2007). It would be a tremendous stretch from the current data to suggest that physical attractiveness or earning prospects are never associated with sex-differentiated romantic interest in actual dating partners. Our sample may have been especially egalitarian; sex differences might have emerged had our sample been composed of participants with more traditional values or perhaps socialites actively striving to date individuals who closely approximate the cosmopolitan ideal. However, the most important threat to the generalizability of the present sample was successfully dodged: Traditional sex differences did emerge on the ideal partner and speed-date stated preferences. This sample may have been unusual in various ways, but it was not unusual in this key respect. In fact, because these are bright, motivated college students who probably enjoy introspecting about their romantic lives, it is reasonable to suggest that the individual-differences hypothesis (H3) was probably especially likely to receive support in this sample. The fact that these students seemed to have little introspective access to their own romantic-partner preferences does not bode well for less psychologically curious individuals. And although it may be true that college students are less likely than adults to have figured out what they want in a romantic partner, this work was intended to address previous studies on sex differences, the better part of which employed college student samples. Nevertheless, firm conclusions await replication across diverse samples.\nOne aspect of this sample leaves open a strong form of a hypothesis originally advanced by Li, Bailey, Kenrick, and Linsenmeier (2002): It may be that the characteristics that are considered necessities (as opposed to luxuries) in a mate are especially sex differentiated. For example, if women consider earning prospects to be a necessity in a mate, they may be especially unwilling (compared with men) to consider a potential partner who falls below some acceptable threshold on this trait. Because all of the men in this sample were attending a respectable university, it is possible that all the men exceeded this threshold. Thus, the present data show that men and women do not differ in their earningprospects preference once this threshold is met but cannot establish whether there are sex differences in the threshold itself. This necessities-versus-luxuries interpretation, however, is unlikely to\n9 Of course, the write-in targets came from an open field of eligible partners, and we did not find evidence for sex differences among those data (i.e., H2 was unsupported). Nevertheless, we could only directly test H3 using the in vivo preferences calculated at the speed-dating event.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\napply to physical attractiveness, as it would be difficult to argue that all of our participants were above some minimal standard on this dimension.\nMate selection versus mate retention. An emerging body of research has recently demonstrated that romantic-partner ideals are important within established romantic relationships (Fletcher & Simpson, 2000). For example, romantic partners who idealize one another are less likely to break up (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996), and participants report greater satisfaction with their present relationship to the extent that their partner matches their ideals (Fletcher et al., 1999). Although the present report casts some doubt on the notion that mate preferences serve the function of mate selection, this extant research on ideals suggests that mate preferences may instead serve the function of mate retention. Although this selection/retention distinction is surely not a strict dichotomy, it allows for the possibility that at moments of deliberative choice during the course of one\u2019s relationship (e.g., whether to marry one\u2019s partner), an individual might compare his or her partner to a set of ideal preferences and decide whether or not the relationship is worth continuing (Fletcher & Simpson, 2000; Gagne\u0301 & Lydon, 2004). It is certainly plausible that traditional measures of stated mate preferences (e.g., Hill, 1945) might predict mate retention\u2014this may indeed be how such preferences play a functional role.\nTwo pieces of evidence will be critical to confirm this materetention hypothesis. First, the mate-retention account suggests that sex differences should emerge in how the characteristics physically attractive and earning prospects are associated with relationship dissolution. We know of no data indicating that (a) men are more likely than women to end a relationship with a partner who is judged unattractive or (b) women are more likely than men to end a relationship with a partner who is judged to have poor earning prospects, but these hypotheses are certainly reasonable and testable. Second, for understandable reasons, studies that have examined the role of partner ideals in established romantic relationships typically assess participants\u2019 ideals after they are already in a relationship. Although it would certainly be difficult to assess ideals before participants meet a long-term romantic partner, such a procedure would avoid the problem of participants\u2019 ideals becoming \u201ccontaminated\u201d by the characteristics of a current partner. In fact, one recent study indeed found that participants changed their ideals such that they placed more importance on the positive characteristics of their current romantic partner, even after dating for only a few months (Fletcher, Simpson, & Thomas, 2000). Research that explores whether partner ideals (a) predict sex differences in relationship dissolution and (b) persist before, during, and after the initiation of a relationship will be critical for the argument that mate preferences serve the function of mate retention.\nAccuracy and awareness. We cannot establish definitively that participants are wholly unaware of the qualities that initially appeal to them in a romantic partner. The strongest evidence for such a claim in the present data set comes from the speed-date preferences, which required participants to report what qualities would appeal to them on a 4-min date. Even this focused set of items failed to predict participants\u2019 judgments and behavior reliably (see Tables 4, 5, and 6). (These results also suggest that the problem of attitude compatibility, Ajzen, 2005, does not explain why stated mate preferences failed to translate into sex differen-\ntiated romantic interest.) On the other hand, our participants were likely aware that characteristics such as physical attractiveness have a positive (as opposed to negative) impact on their liking for someone. A distinction raised by Wilson and Gilbert (2003) in their review of the affective-forecasting literature is perhaps relevant: People are generally good at predicting the valence of their emotions but make interesting and systematic errors when predicting the intensity of their emotions. Had we assessed unappealing characteristics in this study, our participants\u2019 predictions might have been accurate regarding valence (I like reliability and dislike laziness) but inaccurate regarding intensity (I like reliability more than I like physical attractiveness). To be sure, this conjecture will require additional research."}, {"heading": "Conclusions and Future Directions", "text": "What role do mate preferences play in the process of early romantic-relationship development? The implicit and consensual answer has until now been simple: Preferences guide behavior by directing men and women to select and pursue whatever potential romantic partner most closely approximates their typically sexdifferentiated ideals. Support for this account had been demonstrated in paradigms in which participants were provided with written or visual stimuli (e.g., personal ads, photos), but support was less robust once participants interacted with flesh-and-blood potential romantic partners. In the present study, we took a comprehensive snapshot of participants\u2019 romantic lives in an effort to improve understanding of how exactly people go about the process of romantic-partner selection. Our efforts revealed no discernable functional role for mate preferences in determining whom participants desired and pursued for a romantic relationship.\nWe have suggested that participants\u2019 stated mate preferences may reflect their a priori theories about the characteristics of a potential romantic partner that will inspire their interest\u2014in other words, people do not truly know what they desire in a romantic partner. However, there are two related interpretations of the current data that are decidedly less extreme: Participants\u2019 stated mate preferences may have validity (e.g., they predict mate retention), but participants either (a) do not compare a potential romantic partner with an ideal until after a relationship has begun or (b) do attempt such a comparison but it is flawed in some respect. We hope that these possibilities will inspire future research and shed new light on the processes underlying romantic-partner selection.\nReferences\nAjzen, I. (2005).

Murray, Jaye L. Derrick, and Sadie Leder University at Buffalo, The State University of New York\nJohn G. Holmes University of Waterloo\nA model of risk regulation is proposed to explain how low and high self-esteem people balance the tension between self-protection and connectedness goals in romantic relationships. This model assumes that interpersonal risk automatically activates connectedness and self-protection goals. The activation of these competing goals then triggers an executive control system that resolves this goal conflict. One correlational study and 8 experiments manipulating risk, goal strength, and executive strength and then measuring implicit and explicit goal activation and execution strongly supported the model. For people high in self-esteem, risk triggers a control system that directs them toward the situations of dependence within their relationship that can fulfill connectedness goals. For people low in self-esteem, however, the activation of connectedness goals triggers a control system that prioritizes self-protection goals and directs them away from situations where they need to trust or depend on their partner.\nKeywords: relationships, risk, connectedness, self-protection\nAsk somebody to love you Takes a lot of nerve Ask somebody to love you You got a lot of nerve\n\u2014Paul Simon, \u201cLook at That\u201d (1999)\nSimon\u2019s observation that love requires taking risks aptly captures a basic approach\u2013avoidance conflict in interpersonal life. Risking thoughts and behaviors that increase closeness necessarily increases both the likelihood and pain of rejection (Murray, Holmes, & Collins, 2006). Consequently, to satisfy connectedness goals (Baumeister & Leary, 1995), people need to compromise self-protection concerns. Perhaps nowhere is this conflict more poignant than in people\u2019s romantic relationships. Imagine that Sally has a bad day at work and comes to her husband Harry for consolation. Her willingness to increase dependence by seeking Harry\u2019s support is critical for fostering a satisfying connection to Harry (Collins & Feeney, 2000), but in seeking Harry\u2019s support, she also risks his criticism or rebuff. Moreover, the pain of rejection and relationship loss only increases the more Sally comes to depend on Harry for comfort.\nTo satisfy self-protection concerns, Sally should be motivated to think and behave in ways that limit her dependence on Harry\u2019s actions in the short term and diminish the long-term potential pain of relationship loss (Murray et al., 2006). However, to meet basic goals for a close, satisfying connection with Harry, she needs to risk substantial dependence (Kelley, 1979). People in satisfying relationships routinely enter into situations that give a partner considerable power over their outcomes and think in ways that invest great importance in the relationship (Gagne & Lydon, 2004; Murray, 1999). For instance, they respond to the partner\u2019s needs as they arise and, trustingly, leave the timing of repayment open-ended (Clark & Grote, 1998). They also overlook or excuse their partner\u2019s transgressions, risking the chance of similar misdeeds and hurts in the future (Rusbult, Verette, Whitney, Slovik, & Lipkus, 1991).\nTo effectively negotiate interpersonal life, people need a regulatory system in place to balance the tension between connectedness and self-protection goals (Murray et al., 2006). This article presents one correlational and eight experimental studies illustrating how this risk regulation system operates in romantic relationships for people who are differentially sensitive to rejection\u2014 specifically, people relatively low versus high in self-esteem (Leary & Baumeister, 2000). We hope to demonstrate that interpersonal risk automatically activates the goals of seeking connection and avoiding rejection. This goal conflict then triggers a corrective, executive control system\u2014one that typically interferes with the fulfillment of connectedness goals for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people. In the remainder of this introduction, we detail the operation of this system and then describe our research strategy.\nThe Risk Regulation System\nThe goal of the risk regulation system is to optimize the sense of safety or comfort that is possible given one\u2019s relationship circumstances. This sense of assurance or safety is experienced as a feeling of relative invulnerability to hurt. To optimize this sense of\nSandra L. Murray, Jaye L.

In particular, it shifts the priority given to the goals of seeking closeness and protecting oneself against rejection so as to minimize the likelihood and pain of being hurt and vulnerable (Murray et al., 2006).\nSuch a system is needed to govern or arbitrate people\u2019s behavior in risky situations\u2014situations of dependence where one partner\u2019s actions constrain the other\u2019s capacity to satisfy important needs and goals. Couples are interdependent in multiple ways, ranging from deciding whose movie preference to favor on a given weekend to deciding what constitutes a fair allocation of household chores. Couples must also negotiate different personalities, such as merging one partner\u2019s laissez-faire nature with the other\u2019s more controlled style (Kelley, 1979). Given multiple layers of interdependence, areas of incompatibility and conflict are inevitable\u2014 raising the possibility that one\u2019s partner might not prove to be responsive to one\u2019s needs.\nOnce the specter of rejection is raised, people must choose how much dependence (and, thus, how much vulnerability) they safely can risk (Kelley, 1979). Throughout the course of the relationship, partners need to make iterative and often unconscious choices between seeking connection (increasing dependence) and selfprotection (decreasing dependence). Consequently, to risk being in the relationship, people need a system in place that functions to keep them feeling reasonably safe in a context of continued vulnerability (Murray et al., 2006).\nFigure 1 illustrates how the risk regulation system operates to\ngovern people\u2019s choices in dependent situations. Situations that involve interpersonal risk and vulnerability automatically activate two competing goals\u2014the goal of seeking connection (Path A) and the goal of protecting against rejection (Paths B and C). The link between risk and the appetitive goal of connection reflects the functionalist argument that the best means of managing a capricious and dangerous world is to seek connection to others who will meet one\u2019s needs (Bowlby, 1969; Kelley, 1979; Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003; Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). The link between risk and the aversive goal of self-protection (Path B) and between connectedness and self-protection goals (Path C) reflect the unfortunate reality that others will not always be motivated to do so. Certain situations, such as conflicts of interest, are also riskier than others. In such situations, even generally responsive others might not meet one\u2019s needs. Certain people, such as those low in self-esteem (Murray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, & Kusche, 2002), high in attachment anxiety (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003), or high in rejection sensitivity (Downey & Feldman, 1996), are more hurt by another\u2019s inattentiveness. For these reasons, the combination of risk and the desire to seek connection activates the goal of self-protection.\nThe model further stipulates that the intensity of the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals depends on the immediacy of the provoking risk. The moderating path (Path D) linking risk immediacy to the strength of connectedness and selfprotection goals captures this assumption. Imagine that Harry\u2019s best friend broke a promise to him\u2014a threat that is less immediate\nbecause it arises from the external relationship world. Such risks induce feelings of vulnerability and activate the goal of approaching his spouse Sally for comfort (Bowlby, 1969). Needing her comfort then activates the goal of protecting against the possibility of Sally\u2019s rejection or nonresponsiveness to his need for support (Path C). Now imagine that it is Sally who broke a promise\u2014a threat that is more immediate because it arises internal to Harry\u2019s relationship world. Such an experience with risk directly activates connectedness (Path A) and self-protection goals (Path B) and thereby intensifies the goal conflict (because risks internal to the relationship activate self-protection goals both directly [Path B] and indirectly [Path C]). Consequently, Harry\u2019s desire to approach Sally is likely to be all the more ambivalent when the provoking risk is internal to his relationship because he needs the comfort of the very person who made him feel hurt and vulnerable.\nOnce activated, whether directly (Path B) or indirectly (Path C), the goal of protecting the self against rejection then triggers an executive control system (Path E). This system functions as a stop\u2013go routine\u2014one that resolves the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals by helping people identify which specific situations should be avoided and which situations are safe to approach. The dotted line spanning uncontrolled to controlled processes at the bottom of Figure 1 reflects the assumption that the operation of the control system (and its behavioral output) requires progressively greater cognitive resources than does initial goal activation.\nThe paths internal to the control system (Paths F and G) illustrate the two interconnected \u201cif . . . then\u201d contingency rules that direct Sally toward the situations where it feels safe to increase dependence on Harry and away from situations where caution seems needed (Murray et al., 2006). The rules serving this directive function involve (a) an appraisal rule that assesses the likelihood of a partner\u2019s acceptance or rejection in the situation (Path F) and (b) a signaling rule that links state perceptions of a partner\u2019s acceptance or rejection to the experience of gratified or hurt feelings and coincident gains or losses in self-esteem (Path G). The assessed risk and pain of rejection then regulate people\u2019s subsequent willingness to risk greater dependence with a specific partner (Path H). For people to pursue activated connectedness goals in response to risk, they should perceive reason to trust in their partner\u2019s responsiveness to their needs in these situations (Reis, Clark, & Holmes, 2004), and the prospect of approaching the partner should affirm rather than threaten the self (Murray, Griffin, Rose, & Bellavia, 2003).\nThe existing literature provides good initial support for the basic assumptions underlying the risk regulation model. First, indirect evidence suggests that interpersonal risk activates connectedness goals. General concerns about interpersonal rejection (whether chronic or acute) sensitize people to social cues in their environment. Rejection by strangers in a computerized chat room increases people\u2019s memory for (positive and negative) social events in another\u2019s purported diary (Gardner, Pickett, & Brewer, 2000). Chronically desiring greater social connection also increases people\u2019s accuracy in detecting social cues, such as vocal tone and facial expression, that reveal which specific others might be capable of meeting needs for social connection (Gardner, Pickett, Jefferis, & Knowles, 2005; Pickett, Gardner, & Knowles, 2004). Rejection by strangers increases people\u2019s tendency to behave in ways that might elicit positive social responses from novel others:\nIt increases willingness to solicit friendships (Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, & Schaller, 2007), conform (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2001), and work harder on a collective task (Williams & Sommer, 1997). Indirectly priming rejection by priming failurerelated thoughts also activates thoughts of seeking proximity to others (Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000) and increases the accessibility of a romantic partner\u2019s name (Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002).\nSecond, considerable evidence suggests that people are motivated to avoid situations where they might be rejected or hurt. Leary and Baumeister (2000) argued that avoiding rejection is so important that the self-system evolved to gauge rejection threats. They argued that self-esteem is a sociometer that measures a person\u2019s perceived likelihood of being accepted by others and regulates behavior. In this metric, painful drops in self-esteem signal rejection and motivate people to avoid hurtful situations (MacDonald & Leary, 2005). Consistent with this logic, being ostracized by strangers or anticipating a future absence of social connection decreases people\u2019s willingness to put themselves in situations where they might be vulnerable to others. Such experiences both decrease people\u2019s willingness to sacrifice their own interests to benefit others (Twenge, Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, & Bartels, 2007) and increase their willingness to aggress against offending others (Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, & Stucke, 2001).\nThird, models of attitudes, emotion, and personality assume that both approach\u2013appetitive and avoidance\u2013aversive goal systems regulate behavior (Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999; Carver, Sutton, & Scheier, 2007; Gable, 2005; Gable, Reis, & Elliot, 2000; Higgins, 1998). Our model converges with these traditions in assuming that ambivalence is a poor guide to behavior and that effective action requires the resolution of goal conflict (Cacioppo et al., 1999). This assumption also resonates with Lewin\u2019s classic conceptions of the life space (Deutsch & Krauss, 1965; Hall & Lindzey, 1957) and depictions of approach\u2013avoidance conflicts within learning theory traditions (Dollard & Miller, 1950; Epstein, 1982).\nIn Lewinian terms, the need for assurance from threat activates a tension system. This tension system imbues situations likely to heighten vulnerability concerns with negative valence and situations likely to minimize such concerns with positive valence. The respective strength of these valences then orients behavior. If rejection is more hurtful than acceptance is gratifying, the push to self-protect (and avoid negative situations) will be stronger than the pull to connect (and approach positive situations). In fact, the closer Sally gets to Harry in such situations, the more motivating the goal of avoiding rejection becomes (because rejection becomes a greater concern the closer Sally gets to meeting her connectedness goals). However, the pull to connect will be stronger than the push to avoid if acceptance is more gratifying than rejection is hurtful.\nModerating Risk Regulation: General Expectations of Acceptance\nFor the risk regulation system to be functional in regulating goal pursuit, it needs to adapt itself to suit specific relationship circumstances. If Sally generally perceives Harry to be responsive to her needs, becoming wary of Harry at the first sign of insensitivity is not the optimal means of sustaining the needed sense of assurance. However, if Sally generally perceives Harry to be unresponsive,\nsuch a response might be Sally\u2019s best available means of sustaining some minimal sense of safety from harm. To respond dynamically and efficiently in ongoing situations of dependence, the control system depicted in Figure 1 needs a heuristic means of estimating the level of risk inherent in newly encountered situations.\nThe moderating path (Path I) linking perceptions of a partner\u2019s acceptance to the operation of the control system illustrates how this calibration process occurs (Murray et al., 2006). Perceptions of a partner\u2019s acceptance and responsiveness\u2014expectations that reflect properties of a person\u2019s disposition and specific relationship experiences\u2014interact with features of the event to control the sensitivity of the appraisal and signaling rules that guide subsequent behavior in risky situations (Murray, Bellavia, Rose, & Griffin, 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). How might this risk regulation system operate for low and high self-esteem people?\nGeneral expectations of rejection, such as those embodied in low self-esteem, make specific rejection experiences all the more painful and motivating (Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Nezlek, Kowalski, Leary, Blevins, & Holgate, 1997). People with low selfesteem also underestimate how much their dating or marital partner values and loves them (Murray, Holmes, Griffin, Bellavia, & Rose, 2001). Consequently, situations of dependence are inherently riskier for low self-esteem people because feeling rejected poses a larger proportional loss to a precarious and easily threatened sense of their worthiness of interpersonal connection. A control system that prioritizes self-protection (prevention) goals in such situations (Higgins, 1996)\u2014one that is calibrated to quickly detect rejection, strongly signal the possibility of further hurt, and then motivate interdependence-minimizing behaviors\u2014best affords low self-esteem people (i.e., lows) some minimal continued sense of assurance or safety from harm.\nConsistent with these hypotheses, people with low self-esteem are quick to perceive rejection in events as innocuous as a partner being in a bad mood (Bellavia & Murray, 2003) or a partner identifying a negative quality in them (Murray et al., 2002). Low self-esteem people then respond to induced anxieties about rejection by minimizing their partner\u2019s value and, thus, blunting the anticipated pain of rejection in advance. They rely less on their partner as a source of self-esteem and comfort (Murray, Holmes, MacDonald, & Ellsworth, 1998), and they also evaluate their partner\u2019s qualities more negatively (Murray et al., 1998, 2002).\nFor people high in self-esteem (i.e., highs), there is little need for such a self-protectively calibrated executive control system. For highs, robust and optimistic expectations of a partner\u2019s (and others\u2019) acceptance render specific rejections less painful (Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). Consequently, a control system that prioritizes connectedness (promotion) goals in such situations (Higgins, 1996)\u2014one that is calibrated to readily perceive acceptance, weakly signal the potential for hurt, and then motivate connection or interdependence-increasing behaviors\u2014should better afford highs a continued sense of safety or assurance in the relationship (Murray et al., 2006). Consistent with this logic, people with high self-esteem even appraise their own faults as evidence of their partner\u2019s acceptance (Murray et al., 1998). They also respond to induced concerns about their dating partner\u2019s likely annoyance with them by reporting greater feelings of closeness to their partner (Murray et al., 2002, Experiment 2).\nIn sum, when the specter of interpersonal risk and vulnerability activates connectedness goals, people with high self-esteem should be more likely to actualize this goal than people with low selfesteem. This should occur precisely because the activation of connectedness goals also activates the signature style underlying the operation of that person\u2019s risk regulation system.\nResearch Strategy and Hypotheses\nAt least five major postulates follow if the risk regulation system operates as we have hypothesized. These postulates informed both our research strategy and hypotheses."}, {"heading": "One", "text": "People with high self-esteem should report stronger chronic desires for connectedness and weaker chronic concerns with selfprotection relative to people with low self-esteem. Their goal pursuits should also be differentially contingent on circumstance. Greater relationship stability and, thus, greater reason to trust in the partner\u2019s availability should foster stronger desires to connect to the partner for both. However, such reason to trust in the relationship\u2019s stability should temper self-protection concerns only for high self-esteem people.\nAccordingly, in an initial correlational study, we administered measures of global self-esteem, connectedness goals (i.e., focus on relationship positives), and self-protection goals (i.e., focus on relationship negatives) to people in dating relationships. We expected people with high self-esteem to report stronger connectedness goals and weaker self-protection goals. We also expected people in longer relationships to report greater focus on seeking connectedness regardless of self-esteem. However, we expected such evidence of a partner\u2019s continued availability to temper self-protection concerns for high self-esteem, but not low selfesteem, people."}, {"heading": "Two", "text": "If the general prospect of interpersonal risk and vulnerability automatically activates connectedness goals (Path A in Figure 1), making salient the external reality that others can be a source of interpersonal hurt and disappointment should heighten the desire to connect to the romantic partner for both low and high selfesteem people. The automatic activation of this goal should be evident in spontaneous, implicit associations to risk and in the desire to focus on positive aspects of the relationship rather than perseverate on the negative (Elliot, Gable, & Mapes, 2006; Gable, 2005). We assume that even expressed or self-reported desires to focus on the positive tap more automatic processes because activating wishes or aspirations may involve less cognitive deliberation than executing such goals (Kunda & Spencer, 2003).\nAccordingly, in Experiment 1, we primed the general salience of external interpersonal risk by asking participants to think of a time when a significant other disappointed them. We then measured the speed with which they identified connectedness words in a lexical decision task. We expected both low and high self-esteem people to identify connectedness words more quickly in the face of risk. In Experiment 2, we primed general interpersonal risk and measured the strength of connectedness and self-protection goals\nwithin the current dating relationship (i.e., focus on positives and gains vs. negatives and losses). We expected both low and high self-esteem people to report stronger desire to see the positive when risk was salient."}, {"heading": "Three", "text": "If connectedness goals activate self-protection goals (Path C in Figure 1), priming approach/connectedness goals should activate the signature style underlying a person\u2019s control system (Path E). Consequently, for people high in self-esteem, activating connectedness goals should trigger their execution or application (because the risk regulation systems of highs place greater weight on connectedness). In contrast, for people low in self-esteem, activating connectedness goals should trigger their suppression (because the risk regulation systems of lows place greater weight on selfprotection). Consistent with our distinction between goal activation and execution, current models of stereotyping assert that the respective strength of potentially competing goals, such as acquiring knowledge and enhancing the self, governs whether activated stereotypes are applied to specific group members (Kunda & Spencer, 2003). In a similar vein, Macrae and Johnston (1998) argued that even goals activated without conscious awareness can be overridden by explicit situational cues that suggest goal pursuit might be hazardous or risky.\nFor people high in self-esteem, activating connectedness goals should result in desires for connection that match behavioral intentions and implicit associations to risk that match more deliberative responses. First, when interpersonal risk is primed (and connectedness goals are thus activated indirectly), high self-esteem people should seek out risky situations of dependence within their relationship (e.g., self-disclosing, seeking support). Second, directly priming approach/connectedness goals should also result in positive implicit and explicit associations to the partner. This convergence in more and less deliberative responses should emerge precisely because the control system of highs typically prioritizes connectedness over self-protection.1\nFor people low in self-esteem, the desire to connect should not translate into greater intention to seek connection by entering into risky situations of interdependence. Instead, they should suppress such goals when contemplating which actions to take in their relationships, much as people motivated to avoid prejudice resist applying stereotypes when they sense their activation (Kunda & Spencer, 2003). Accordingly, the simultaneous activation of connectedness and self-protection goals should result in implicit associations to the partner that reflect the desire to connect but, in stark contrast, avowed behavioral intentions that reflect the need to distance. In a sense, the heart might seek closeness, whereas the mind resists it. Signs of such an approach\u2013avoidance conflict are evident among people most wary of interpersonal dependence. In a study of transference, young women with a history of parental abuse responded with positive facial affect to a novel other who resembled the abusive parent, yet they reported mistrusting and not caring about this novel other (Berenson & Andersen, 2006). When primed to think about being disappointed by a significant other, people anxious\u2013ambivalent in attachment style were quicker to identify \u201ctalk\u201d in a lexical decision task, but they professed trusting their partner less (Mikulincer, 1998).\nAccordingly, in Experiment 2, we included dependent measures tapping the willingness to risk interdependence. We expected high self-esteem, but not low self-esteem, people to respond to interpersonal risk (and, thus, the indirect activation of connectedness goals) by expressing stronger intentions to enter dependent situations within their relationships. In Experiments 3 and 4, we directly primed approach/connectedness goals and then measured explicit reports of relationship closeness (Experiments 3 and 4) and implicit associations to the partner (Experiment 4). Among high self-esteem people, we expected priming approach goals to produce greater feelings of connection to the partner on both implicit and explicit measures. Among low self-esteem people, we expected priming approach goals to activate positive implicit associations to the partner (reflecting the activation of connectedness goals) and diminished reports of closeness on the explicit measure (reflecting the operation of a self-protectively calibrated control system)."}, {"heading": "Four", "text": "If risk regulation involves a secondary corrective or executive control system, its operation should require greater cognitive resources than the activation of connectedness goals consumes. Consequently, experiences that impair executive control should not affect the activation of connectedness goals, but they should impair correction. This logic stems both from models of interpersonal perception and attribution (Gilbert, 1989; Macrae, Bodenhausen, Schloerscheidt, & Milne, 1999) and from models of selfregulation (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000). For instance, Gilbert (1989) argued that the attribution processes that correct unwarranted dispositional inferences occur only if a person has sufficient cognitive resources. Similarly, Muraven and Baumeister (2000) argued that people are successful in overriding automatic impulses only if they have sufficient self-regulatory resources for selfcontrol available.\nIf the risk regulation system does require executive control, even low self-esteem people should react to risk salience by pursuing connectedness goals in situations where executive control is usurped (and the operation of their self-protectively calibrated risk regulation system is compromised). In Experiments 5 and 6, we manipulated general or external interpersonal risk and executive control. We manipulated executive control by depleting selfregulatory strength (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) and by increasing cognitive load (Gilbert, 1989). We then measured people\u2019s intention to enter risky relationship situations. When risk was primed and executive control was usurped, we expected low selfesteem (and high self-esteem) people to seek greater interdependence, reporting behavioral intentions likely to fulfill activated connectedness goals."}, {"heading": "Five", "text": "If the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should be sensitive to variations in the strength of connectedness and self-protection goals. First, risks that stem from the partner\u2019s\n1 We are not trying to argue that the distinction between goal activation and execution will always map perfectly onto the distinction between more automatic and more controlled processes (Kunda & Spencer, 2003).\nactions (i.e., an internal threat) should strengthen the activation of self-protection goals (Path D in Figure 1). Consequently, even people normally inclined to trust might reduce dependence in situations where rejection risks are more immediate. Moreover, acting on such self-protection goals might require little executive control. Imagine that Sally routinely criticizes Harry\u2019s productivity and organizational skills. After a stressful day at work, even a high self-esteem Harry might fear approaching Sally for support. With repeated experience, keeping his distance in such situations could even become his automatic response (Bargh & Ferguson, 2000).\nWe examined this possibility in Experiment 7 by manipulating the salience of the actual romantic partner\u2019s past transgressions. We then measured the activation of connectedness and selfprotection goals in a lexical decision task. We expected even high self-esteem people primed with their partner\u2019s transgressions to show heightened activation of self-protection goals when circumstances warranted it\u2014that is, when they had not already forgiven the transgression.\nSecond, people normally prone to self-protect should become all the more cautious in situations where the pain of rejection is intensified. For instance, a low self-esteem Harry should be even more hesitant to increase interdependence in those situations where he really needs reassurance (i.e., stronger connection goal) and Sally seems disapproving. When needs to connect are heightened, the potential of rejection should be of even greater concern, polarizing behavior (Epstein, 1982). We examined this possibility in Experiment 8 by manipulating the strength of approach/ connectedness goals and the severity of the actual dating partner\u2019s criticism. We then measured people\u2019s willingness to increase interdependence by seeking and providing support. When the desire to approach or seek connection is heightened, we expected a partner\u2019s criticisms to sting all the more, motivating low selfesteem people to actively distance themselves from caregiving situations that highlight the need to be interdependent."}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "This article presents the first experimental test of a new theoretical perspective on risk regulation (Murray et al., 2006). It departs from prior research in three major ways. First, it demonstrates that the general salience of interpersonal risk automatically activates the goal of seeking connection to one\u2019s current romantic partner for both low and high self-esteem people. In contrast, prior research on dependence regulation processes assumed that rejection activated only the desire to self-protect among lows (Murray et al., 1998, 2002). Second, it demonstrates that risk regulation involves a secondary, executive control system that routinely thwarts connectedness desires for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people. Third, it demonstrates how fluidly and flexibly the calibration of the risk regulation system shifts to accommodate the immediacy of the threat and the strength of connectedness and self-protection goals.2\nA Preliminary Look: Self-Esteem and Goal Contingency\nIf the risk regulation system operates as hypothesized, low and high self-esteem people should put different weight on pursuing connectedness and self-protection goals within their relationships. Their goal pursuits should also be differentially sensitive to ongo-\ning relationship circumstance. Specifically, greater relationship duration should predict heightened connectedness desires for both. However, such evidence of a partner\u2019s continued availability should dampen self-protection concerns only for highs. In this correlational study, we modeled our measures of connectedness and self-protection goals after measures of promotion and prevention goals developed by Lockwood, Jordan, and Kunda (2002). The measure of connectedness goals tapped people\u2019s desire to nurture and focus on positive experiences in the relationship, such as thinking of fun things to do together\u2014a motivational precondition for connectedness. The measure of self-protection goals tapped people\u2019s preoccupation with avoiding negative experiences in the relationship, such as trying to minimize conflicts\u2014a motivational precondition for self-protection (Gable, 2005). Defining connectedness and self-protection goals in this way parallels measures of friendship approach and avoidance goals, which are defined as the desire to approach positive relational outcomes and avoid negative relational outcomes, respectively (Elliot et al., 2006).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred twenty-seven undergraduates currently involved in exclusive dating relationships completed a short questionnaire in exchange for extra credit toward their introductory psychology class.

We then measured goal activation using a lexical decision task. Using this implicit measure allowed us to see whether risk primes connectedness without people\u2019s conscious awareness or control. As active goals increase the cognitive accessibility of goal-relevant information (Aarts, Dijksterhuis, & De Vries, 2001; Shah, Friedman, & Kruglanski, 2002), we expected high and even low selfesteem participants primed with risk to identify words associated with seeking connection more quickly.

Impressively, this effect is opposite to what one might expect on the basis of a semantic priming effect, and it emerged regardless of people\u2019s chronic self-esteem level. However, people\u2019s greater speed in recognizing connectedness words in response to risk might simply reflect the activation of a schema rather than a goal per se (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). Elliot and Freyer (in press) argued that behavioral intentions toward a goal object are elemental to goals and, thus, basic to demonstrating their existence. Accordingly, we obtained direct measures of behavioral intentions to approach or avoid situations of dependence in subsequent experiments.\nExperiment 2: Interpersonal Risk and Behavioral Intentions\nExperiment 1 suggested that making the general risks of interdependence salient automatically activates connectedness goals. Does this indirect activation of connectedness goals then trigger self-protection goals and the operation of the control system\u2014a corrective system that intervenes between goal activation and execution? If it does, priming interpersonal risk should have different effects on the behavioral intentions of low and high selfesteem people. People with high self-esteem should intend to act on the basis of heightened desires for connection, risking greater interdependence within their current dating relationship. However,\npeople with low self-esteem should be more cautious, resisting interdependence despite the goal of connecting. We designed Experiment 2 to examine these hypotheses. We asked experimental participants to describe a time when a significant other hurt or disappointed them. We then measured people\u2019s desire to connect to the partner and focus on the positive aspects of their relationship and their intention to behave in ways that might actually fulfill such goals. To do this, we developed two new measures of people\u2019s intention to enter specific risky relationship situations\u2014 concrete situations that diagnose a partner\u2019s motives by affording the partner the opportunity to behave selflessly or selfishly (Kelley, 1979).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Ninety-two undergraduates involved in exclusive dating relationships participated in exchange for credit in their introductory psychology class.

Importantly, this latter effect was specific to the interpersonal risk prime. We believe that the comparative caution of low self-esteem people reflected the operation of a self-protectively calibrated risk regulation system. However, the null effects of condition for low self-esteem people limited our ability to draw the conclusion that low self-esteem people were actually executing self-protection goals in this situation. We designed Experiments 3 and 4 to provide stronger evidence that the desire to approach triggers a self-protectively calibrated risk regulation system for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people.\nExperiment 3: Approach Goals and Risk Regulation 1\nIf activating connectedness goals triggers self-protection goals and the control system, implicitly priming the general goal of approaching a desired state should have different effects on low and high self-esteem people. Priming approach goals should trigger defensive attempts to distance among low self-esteem people (because the prospect of being closer automatically triggers the operation of a self-protectively calibrated control system). How-\n8 The fact that low-esteem people reported stronger desires to focus on the positive within their relationships when they were reminded of a time when they disappointed another points to one possible way in which they might stabilize their relationships against their more destructive behaviors. Specifically, knowledge of their failures in other relationships may motivate lows to try to do better in the current one. Consistent with this logic, low self-esteem people engage in reparative relationship behaviors provided those behaviors do not put them at any real risk of rejection (Murray et al., 2007).\n9 Low self-esteem participants reported greater willingness to risk interdependence than high self-esteem participants in the control condition. Although this might seem counter to our theoretical model, this is not surprising from our vantage point. Given heightened desires for social connection (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs, 1995), low self-esteem people likely want greater levels of interdependence in their relationships. However, when the prospect of being hurt and vulnerable is salient, such hopes seem to be quickly set aside (as our model would anticipate).\never, priming approach goals should activate a congruent desire to draw closer to the partner among highs. In Experiment 3, we implicitly primed participants with the general goal of approaching a desired state and then measured feelings of closeness to the dating partner.

Though unexpected, these effects also suggest that self-protective efforts to minimize dependence generally require executive control. In its absence, even low selfesteem people describe their relationship as a valued context for fulfilling connectedness needs.\nExperiment 7: Risk Immediacy and Self-Protection Goals\nExperiments 1 and 2 suggested that interpersonal risk automatically activates connectedness goals. The activation of such approach goals then triggers the operation of the control system and its signature tendency to prioritize connectedness or self-protection concerns (Experiments 3 and 4). Consequently, low self-esteem people defend against heightened needs for connectedness by resisting dependence. In contrast, high self-esteem people react to increased desires for connection by seeking out situations in their relationships likely to fulfill this goal. However, when the operation of this corrective system is compromised, even low selfesteem people act on heightened needs for connectedness and seek out interdependent situations in the face of risk (Experiments 5 and 6).\nIf the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should also be sensitive to variations in the strength of connectedness and self-protection goals. Specifically, feelings of vulnerability that arise directly from the partner\u2019s actions should heighten selfprotection concerns (Paths B and D in Figure 1). As a result, even high self-esteem people might prioritize self-protection goals in situations where the need for caution is likely to be more pressing than usual. Imagine that experience has taught a high self-esteem Harry that Sally can\u2019t be relied upon to respond sympathetically to his work woes. In this limited domain, he might self-protect and avoid closeness. In fact, with repeated experience, such pocketed avoidance might become habitual and activated automatically when the pressure to disclose in this domain arises (e.g., Neal, Wood, & Quinn, 2006). In Experiment 7, we increased risk immediacy by having participants vividly describe a time when their current partner hurt or disappointed them. We then measured the implicit activation of connectedness and self-protection goals using the lexical decision task from Experiment 1. When risk was immediate, we expected even high self-esteem people to show heightened activation of self-protection goals when they had not forgiven their partner\u2019s transgression (and, thus, these limited circumstances warranted caution).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred six undergraduate native English speakers currently involved in exclusive dating relationships participated in exchange for course credit.

When high self-esteem people had not forgiven their partner\u2019s transgression, reminders of this hurt increased the cognitive accessibility of self-protection words and decreased the accessibility of connectedness words. They were both quicker to identify selfprotection words and slower to identify connectedness words in the partner risk than in the control condition, suggesting differential goal activation. However, being reminded of this hurt actually seemed to suppress self-protection goals when high self-esteem people had forgiven the transgression. They were slower to identify self-protection words in the partner risk than in the control condition. The responses of high self-esteem people thus reveal implicit associations to risk that mirror more deliberative considerations. Unforgiven transgressions compelled more caution and less connectedness seeking. In contrast, it was forgiving the transgression (and the specter of being closer to the partner) that heightened self-protection for low self-esteem people. When lows had forgiven the transgression, they were actually quicker to identify self-protection words in the partner risk than in the control condition. The responses of low self-esteem people thus reveal implicit associations to risk that belie their more deliberative judgments. For lows, forgiving the transgression seemed to make the prospect of rejection of greater concern, prompting greater defensiveness even in goals that were activated automatically.\nExperiment 8: Connectedness Goals Amplify SelfProtection Concerns\nIf the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should also be sensitive to the magnitude of the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals. Stronger desires to approach the partner should increase concerns about rejection (because rejection hurts more in the context of greater need). Activating approach goals should intensify the pressure to self-protect and reduce risk (Epstein, 1982). This should be especially true for people prone to self-protect, such as those low in self-esteem. They should become all the more resistant to dependence in situations where the desire to approach makes a partner\u2019s rejection of greater concern. In Experiment 8, we manipulated both the strength of approach goals and the severity of the dating partner\u2019s criticism. We then measured the willingness to increase interdependence by seeking and\nproviding support within the relationship. We hoped to further replicate the opposite and ironic effect that approach goals have on the behavior of lows. That is, we expected a partner\u2019s criticisms to sting all the more when approach goals were activated, motivating low self-esteem people to distance themselves from support situations.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Ninety-one couples currently involved in exclusive dating relationships participated in exchange for course credit or tickets for a lottery drawing.

To achieve this end, the target participants received a one-page questionnaire that asked them to list important aspects of their partner\u2019s character that they disliked.

When primed with the goal of approaching a desired state, people who had recently been hurt by their partner actually reported less desire to nurture their relationship on the measure of connectedness goals.\nSuch paradoxical effects of approach goals were particularly evident among low self-esteem people. For lows, the stronger the goal to approach the partner, the more motivating the goal of avoiding rejection seemed to become. In particular, getting closer seemed to make\nthe prospect of rejection more aversive for lows, prompting greater defensiveness on the measures of behavioral intention. Specifically, when primed with approach, low self-esteem people internalized their partner\u2019s criticism, worrying that their partner saw them as generally undesirable. They protected against such feelings of vulnerability by reducing their future willingness to seek and provide support, a component of interdependence critical for maintaining satisfying relationships (Collins & Feeney, 2000). However, the behavior of these low self-esteem people shifted once the partner sought support and, thus, the prospect of connection guaranteed no risk of rejection (as our model would predict). Specifically, when approach goals were activated, low self-esteem people in the partner criticism condition actually provided objectively more supportive notes than did control participants. Thus, the partner\u2019s expression of vulnerability in soliciting support seemed to obviate concerns about rejection, allowing low self-esteem people to act on the basis of heightened needs for connection.\nGeneral Discussion\nA great irony of interpersonal life is this: The romantic relationships that have the most potential to satisfy adult needs for interpersonal connection are the very relationships that necessitate risking the most (Baumeister, Wotman, & Stillwell, 1993). Given the vulnerability inherent in narrowing one\u2019s social connections to focus on one partner, some level of circumspection is required and appropriate. However, to be happy over the longer term, people need to set rejection concerns aside and risk substantial dependence (Murray et al., 2006). Unfortunately, people low in self-\nTable 17 Summary of Regression Analyses in Experiment 8\nDependent measure\nSelf-esteema Partner criticisma Approach goala Self-Esteem Criticismb Self-Esteem Approachb Criticism Approachb Three-wayc\nt t t t t t t\nConnectedness goals .21 1.93\u2020 .01 1 .06 1 .18 1.75\u2020 .05 1 .25 2.40* .12 1.13 Self-protection goals .48 4.96** .07 1 .10 1.05 .15 1.56 .03 1 .04 1 .07 1 Perceptions of partner\u2019s disregard .51 5.55** .02 1 .11 1.12 .20 2.25* .10 1.07 .11 1.24 .20 2.26* Seeking support interdependence .44 4.42** .02 1 .05 1 .15 1.49 .01 1 .14 1.42 .21 2.09* Support in note .01 1 .07 1 .17 1.53 .17 1.56 .08 1 .24 2.21* .19 1.75\u2020 State self-esteem .72 9.59** .07 1 .05 1 .06 1 .22 3.06** .01 1 .04 1\na The error terms for the ts are based on 87 degrees of freedom for all the measures except support in note (df 77). b The error terms for the ts are based on 84 degrees of freedom for all the measures except support in note (df 74). c The error terms for the ts are based on 83 degrees of freedom for all the measures except support in note (df 73). \u2020 p .10. * p .05. ** p .01.\nesteem\u2014the very people most in need of social connection\u2014are the least likely to take the kinds of interdependence risks that forge satisfying relationships."}, {"heading": "Balancing Connectedness and Self-Protection Goals", "text": "The correlational study captured the conflicted motivations of people low in self-esteem. For lows, greater relationship longevity predicted heightened desires to focus on the positive, connectedness-promoting aspects of the relationship. However, this greater objective reason to trust in the partner did not abate their concerns about vulnerability and loss. Instead, they tended to express stronger self-protection concerns in longer relationships. In contrast, high self-esteem people were appropriately judicious, more desirous of connection and less concerned about selfprotection when they had greater reason to trust in the relationship\u2019s stability.\nThe risk regulation system depicted in Figure 1 sheds light on exactly how and why such differential dynamics emerge. This model assumes that the strongest, initial, and automatic response to the salience of external interpersonal risk is to seek connection to the partner (Path A in Figure 1). This reflects the functionalist argument that the most effective means of dealing with an unpredictable world is to forge the types of interpersonal connections that will ensure one\u2019s needs are met (Kelley, 1979; Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003; Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). Consistent with this logic, participants reminded of the risks of depending on significant others were quicker to identify connectedness words in a lexical decision task (Experiment 1), suggesting that risk automatically activates the goal of seeking connection. Such heightened needs for connection also surfaced in people\u2019s self-reported goals. Participants primed with the risks of depending on others reported stronger desires to nurture the positive aspects of their relationships (Experiments 2 and 5). They also tended to report stronger desires to pursue positive life outcomes (Experiment 2). However, when an event internal to the relationship made rejection salient, self-protection goals evidenced readier activation (Paths B and D). The partner\u2019s criticism suppressed connectedness goals for both low and high self-esteem people when they were primed with the general goal of approaching a desired state (Experiment 8). For people high in self-esteem, thinking of a partner transgression they had not forgiven also suppressed the activation of connectedness goals and heightened the activation of self-protection goals on the lexical decision task (Experiment 7).\nOnce activated, self-protection goals then trigger an executive control system. This system optimizes assurance by directing people toward situations that offer a safe level of dependence. This intervening step between goal activation and execution reflects the reality that needs for connection are not likely to be met in all situations (Paths C and E in Figure 1). The control system exists to resolve any conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals and to provide a clear direction for behavior (Cacioppo et al., 1999)\u2014a directive that prioritizes self-protection for people low in self-esteem and connectedness for people high in self-esteem.\nThe conflict low self-esteem people experience between connectedness and self-protection goals evidenced itself in ambivalent associations to risk. Although low self-esteem people reacted to risk by aspiring to focus on the positive, connectedness-promoting\naspects of their relationships, they did not take the actual steps necessary to increase interdependence (Experiment 2). Instead, directly priming the general goal of approaching a desired state triggered risk regulation processes that served self-protection goals. When primed with approach goals, low self-esteem people reported feeling less close to their dating partner (Experiments 3 and 4)\u2014suggesting that the mere prospect of getting closer (evidenced in more positive implicit associations to the partner) activated the goal of keeping a safer distance (Experiment 4). They were also quicker to identify self-protection words in a lexical decision task when reminded of a partner transgression they had already forgiven (Experiment 7). Such data further suggest that the goal of getting closer (captured by the inclination to forgive) makes the goal of avoiding rejection all the more motivating. In fact, a partner\u2019s criticism actually hurt low self-esteem people more when they were primed with approach than with avoidance goals. They then seemed to defend against this hurt by reporting less willingness to seek and provide support in their relationships (Experiment 8). However, a slight shift in circumstance prompted the expression of connectedness goals. When hurt but motivated to approach, lows wrote objectively more supportive notes in response to their partner\u2019s clear and direct expression of need and receptiveness to connection. Thus, low self-esteem people seem perfectly willing to seek connection in situations that guarantee no risk of rejection (as our model would predict). In fact, low selfesteem people effectively minimize the chance of rejection by engaging in safe instrumental behaviors, such as finding a partner\u2019s lost keys, that increase a partner\u2019s dependence on them without increasing the risk of rejection (Murray et al., 2007).\nRather than experiencing an acute conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals, high self-esteem people acted on the basis of heightened needs for connection in most circumstances\u2014seeking out the interdependent situations capable of fulfilling these goals. They responded to the general salience of interpersonal risk by reporting greater willingness to enter interdependent situations within their relationships (Experiment 2). When we directly primed the general goal of approaching a desired state, high self-esteem people reported feeling closer to their partners on both implicit and explicit measures (Experiment 4). When reminded of a partner transgression they had forgiven, they were also slower to respond to self-protection words in a lexical decision task (Experiment 7), suggesting that overriding selfprotection goals can become an automatic aspect of risk regulation for people high in self-esteem.\nDo the divergent responses of low and high self-esteem people indicate the operation of a secondary, corrective control system? If risk regulation requires executive control, taxing executive strength should usurp correction, but it should not affect the activation of connectedness goals (Gilbert, 1989). Therefore, taxing executive strength should increase the likelihood that both low self-esteem (and high self-esteem) people will seek to fulfill connectedness goals. Consistent with this logic, merely making low self-esteem people cognitively busy increased the strength of connectedness goals (Experiment 6). When self-regulatory capacities were depleted, low self-esteem participants also responded to the general salience of risk by reporting diminished self-protection concerns and heightened dependence on their current dating partner (Experiment 5). Most critical, when executive strength was taxed, low and high self-esteem people both responded to the\nreminder of the risks of depending on others by seeking out risky but connectedness-promoting situations of interdependence within their dating relationships.\nLimitations of the current data deserve mention. First, risk had a statistically significant main effect on the measure of connectedness goals only in Experiment 2. To examine the strength of the risk-connectedness main effect on this measure, we meta-analyzed the main effects of risk condition on connectedness goals across Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 8. Winer\u2019s (1971) combined test revealed that the meta-analytic effect of risk was strong and significant (d .30, z 2.75, p .01). Second, the predicted Risk Executive Strength interaction predicting the willingness to risk interdependence composite was significant in Experiment 6 but only marginally significant in Experiment 5. A meta-analysis of this effect across Experiments 5 and 6 revealed a significant Executive Strength Risk interaction (d .35, z 2.58, p .05). This further suggests that risk automatically activates connectedness goals (because people seek greater interdependence in response to risk when executive strength is impaired).\nThird, the measure of self-protection goals revealed significant interactive effects involving condition only in Experiment 5. Low self-esteem people primed with risk actually reported less concern about rejection when self-regulatory strength was depleted. Such insight was not apparent in the other experiments\u2014something that is perhaps unsurprising given people\u2019s limited access to the contents of their consciousness (Wilson, 2002). In the experiments involving general (i.e., external) manipulations of risk, the evidence for the activation of self-protection goals remained largely indirect. We inferred the operation of these goals from the absence of behavioral intentions to risk interdependence in Experiment 2 and the effects of depleting executive strength on the intention to risk interdependence in Experiments 5 and 6. However, when the romantic partner\u2019s actions made risk salient, we found stronger direct evidence of the activation of self-protection goals: Unforgiving highs and forgiving lows were quicker to identify selfprotection words when reminded of their partner\u2019s transgression in Experiment 7. Low self-esteem people primed with approach goals also reported markedly decreased intentions to provide unsolicited support to a rejecting partner in Experiment 8.\nOf course, we cannot argue that self-esteem actually caused any of the effects we attribute to it. Fortunately, we do not wish to make this argument. Rather, we assume that self-esteem has its moderating effects because it functions as a powerful dispositional proxy for expectations of the partner\u2019s acceptance and responsiveness (Murray et al., 2006). If that is the case, other dispositions that capture general expectations of partner responsiveness, such as attachment anxiety (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003), rejection sensitivity (Downey & Feldman, 1996), or self-esteem that is contingent on interpersonal acceptance (Crocker & Wolfe, 2001), should have comparable effects on risk regulation. Direct measures of felt acceptance, such as trust in a partner\u2019s responsiveness (Holmes & Rempel, 1989) or perceptions of the partner\u2019s regard for the self (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003), should have parallel, and even stronger, effects.\nWe included Bartholomew and Horowitz\u2019s (1991) four-category attachment measure in the background measures in Experiments 1, 2, and 4\u20138 to examine the former possibility. We then reconducted the analyses in each experiment, using rejection anxiety as a moderator in place of self-esteem. Although this measure does not\nprovide as sensitive a barometer as current ones (e.g., Fraley, Waller, & Brennan, 2000), anxiety about rejection did reveal effects that paralleled the moderating effects of self-esteem we observed in Experiments 2, 4, and 7.16,17"}, {"heading": "Exploring Alternative Explanations", "text": "The risk regulation model contends that self-esteem moderates people\u2019s responses to risk because chronic expectations of a specific partner\u2019s acceptance determine the calibration of the risk regulation system. Alternate explanations are possible, however.\nPerhaps low self-esteem people generally responded more selfprotectively to risk because the disappointment episodes they generated disproportionately sampled experiences within romantic relationships. To examine this possibility, we computed the correlation between self-esteem and the type of disappointment (romantic vs. not) in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6. The average correlation was near zero and nonsignificant in each experiment. Maybe, though, high self-esteem, but not low self-esteem, people sought greater interdependence in the face of risk because they recalled less serious interpersonal disappointments in the first place. If that were the case, the comparative caution of lows might be an appropriate response to the contingencies they faced. To examine this possibility, we coded the narratives in Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 7 for event severity (e.g., \u201cGiven the scope of things that can happen in life, how serious is the event described?\u201d). We then reconducted our analyses including severity as a control variable.18 All of the main effects of condition and the moderating effects of self-esteem remained significant.\n16 Given the multiple ways one might tap expectations of a specific partner\u2019s acceptance and responsiveness\u2014our hypothesized moderator\u2014 readers might wonder why we focused on global self-esteem. We utilized the Rosenberg (1965) measure because it captures stable, cross-situational expectations of acceptance (Leary & Baumeister, 2000). Such expectations should be more sensitive to the cross-situational manipulations of risk we used in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6 than expectations that are specific to the relationship. We also favored this measure for testing risk regulation dynamics because it can tap negative evaluative associations to the self without requiring people to articulate fears about rejection in relationships. Consequently, it acts as a kind of projective test for capturing the kinds of doubts about one\u2019s worthiness that should create interpersonal problems even for people who do not or cannot articulate these problems. Given that our data suggest that much of low self-esteem people\u2019s motivational conflict may occur outside their awareness, such sensitivity is critical from our perspective.\n17 Some readers might wonder whether satisfaction moderates risk regulation dynamics. We do not believe that satisfaction is likely to be a strong moderator because it represents an evaluative statement about the relationship that captures the outcome of such risk regulation dynamics (Murray et al., 2006). For instance, self-esteem and perceptions of a partner\u2019s regard for the self predict changes in relationship satisfaction over time (Murray et al., 2000). As an outcome variable, satisfaction should function as only a poor proxy for the true moderating influences (i.e., self-esteem, perceived regard). We included a one-item measure of relationship satisfaction as a premeasure in each of the experiments to examine this logic. As we expected, further analyses did not reveal any systematic and significant moderating effects of satisfaction.\n18 Participants in the experimental conditions consistently described more serious and upsetting events than did control participants.\nAlternately, low self-esteem people might have reacted to heightened motivations to connect by distancing because priming approach goals reduced regulatory fit and increased negative affect (Higgins, 2000). If that were the case, the distancing effects observed in Experiments 3, 4, and 8 might reflect the contaminating effect of negative mood or diminished state self-esteem on relationship judgments (Schwarz, 1990). To examine this possibility, we reconducted our analyses, including the dependent measures of mood (Experiment 4) and state self-esteem (Experiments 3 and 8) as control variables. All of the main effects of condition and the moderating effects of self-esteem remained significant. On a related note, risk might have activated stronger self-protection goals for low than high self-esteem people because risk generated more negative affect for lows. Accordingly, we reexamined the moderating effects of self-esteem observed in Experiments 2, 6, and 7 in analyses that also controlled for mood. All of the main effects of condition and the moderating effects of self-esteem remained significant."}, {"heading": "Optimizing Assurance by Regulating Risk", "text": "The present experiments provide strong and convergent support for the operation of the risk regulation system. When the external world signals risk, such experiences motivate people to seek safety through connection to their romantic partner (Path A in Figure 1). The desire to seek connection then primes self-protection goals (Path C), triggering an executive control or stop\u2013go system that tells people which specific situations are safe to approach (Path E). When operative, this control system directs low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people away from situations of dependence in their relationships, frustrating the goal of seeking greater connection (Path H). When realities within the relationship itself signal risk, such experiences heighten the activation of selfprotection goals (Paths B and D), resulting in distancing efforts that are evident both in people\u2019s relatively more automatic associations to risk and in their behavioral intentions.\nOur model of the risk regulation process complements theoretical perspectives on both self-regulation and the mental representation of interpersonal goals. In pursuing self-regulatory goals, low self-esteem people generally are more self-protective than highs\u2014 favoring those opportunities to affirm the self that seem safe (Baumeister, Tice, & Hutton, 1989; Heimpel, Elliot, & Wood, 2006). For instance, low self-esteem people who desire interpersonal approval react to negative feedback about their likeability by wanting to appear more physically attractive to others but not by wanting to appear more warm\u2014a more concrete and presumably safer means of self-enhancement (Park & Crocker, in press). This article extends such logic by illustrating how self-protection can trump competing goal considerations for low self-esteem people in relationships. Consistent with our emphasis on the goal conflict inherent in specific relationship situations, attachment and social cognition researchers argue that goals are central to the content of significant-other representations (e.g., Collins & Read, 1994; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). In fact, specific concrete goals, such as seeking support, being cooperative, or being smart, are activated automatically when significant-other representations are primed (Baldwin, 1992; Fitzsimons & Bargh, 2003; Gillath et al., 2006; Shah, 2003). The current results extend this research by illustrating\nhow specific (risky) situations can prompt the association of the partner with conflicting goals.\nAspects of the risk regulation model require refinement. Subsequent research could examine whether correction might be preempted if repeated experience with a partner in a specific situation has revealed little cause for concern. For instance, if Harry is consistently reassuring when Sally voices worries about her weight, this specific situation might cease to activate selfprotection goals. Consequently, Sally\u2019s willingness to seek out Harry for support in this domain might become automatic (and no longer require the safety check afforded by the risk regulation system). In contrast, if Harry is consistently critical when Sally expresses an opinion contrary to his own, such situations might cease to activate connectedness goals. Instead, Sally\u2019s selfprotective decision to keep such opinions to herself might become automatic, no longer requiring executive control to be enacted. Thus, examining how experience tailors risk regulation processes in repeatedly encountered situations remains an important task.\nSubsequent research might also examine whether the output of the risk regulation system is evident in behavioral responses that require less deliberative control. Recent research has suggested that people\u2019s goal pursuits are evident in automatic evaluations (Ferguson, 2007). This raises the possibility that situations that involve dependence, such as seeking or providing support, might evoke different automatic responses as a function of executive strength. Risk might heighten positive implicit associations to support-seeking situations for both low and high self-esteem people when cognitively busy. However, when low self-esteem people have the executive strength necessary to correct, such situations might elicit negative implicit evaluations. Subsequent research might also examine the mechanisms internal to the control system, examining whether the \u201cif . . . then\u201d contingencies surrounding appraisal and signaling processes (Paths F and G in Figure 1) are more likely to be activated when executive strength is intact than when executive strength is usurped (as the model would anticipate).\nSubsequent research might also extend the risk regulation model to nonromantic relationship domains. Risk regulation dynamics should be most pronounced in relationships where two conditions are met: (a) Each partner\u2019s dependence is volitional, and thus, each partner must make decisions about how much dependence to risk; and (b) rejection is painful because the value of the partner\u2019s regard and caring cannot be not easily substituted for by another person\u2019s. It is in such situations where people should need the greatest sense of assurance that seeking connection is not likely to result in rejection. Consequently, risk regulation dynamics might be more pronounced in relationships between parents and adult children or between best friends (DeHart, Murray, Pelham, & Rose, 2003) than in relationships between parents and young children or in relationships between casual friends or coworkers.\nFurther research might also examine whether features of people\u2019s working models that are not available to consciousness moderate risk regulation dynamics in ways that parallel the effects of consciously considered beliefs. Examining the moderating effects of implicit self-esteem could be particularly fruitful. For instance, people who are low on both implicit and explicit selfesteem might be so practiced in defending themselves against rejection that avoidance becomes an automatic response to risk. However, people with high implicit, but low explicit, self-esteem\nmay possess a hidden resilience that strengthens the activation of connectedness goals. In contrast, people with low implicit, but high explicit, self-esteem may possess a hidden vulnerability that strengthens the activation of self-protection goals (Jordan, Spencer, Zanna, Hoshino-Browne, & Correll, 2003). Working models of self that convey such conflicting messages might then heighten goal conflict (because one system prioritizes connectedness, whereas the other prioritizes self-protection). Consequently, the relationship behavior of such individuals should be highly ambivalent, especially in situations where executive strength and, thus, the capacity to resolve such conflict are impaired."}, {"heading": "The Self-Fulfilling Effects of Risk Regulation", "text": "As being hurt is an inevitable part of romantic life, the challenge in maintaining a satisfying relationship rests in preventing such situated threats from impeding connectedness goals. However, for people with low self-esteem, the slightest offense is likely to be seen as a sign of impending rejection, motivating them to selfprotect and distance themselves from the sting of any further perceived slights. Such efforts to minimize risk would be appropriate if people with low self-esteem actually possessed partners who valued and loved them less and treated them less well. This is not the case (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000).\nInappropriately calibrated attempts to self-protect may result in the people who most need to see signs of a partner\u2019s acceptance behaving in ways that undermine the resource of an admiring partner that they need to preserve. For instance, women who chronically anticipate rejection behave more negatively toward their partner during conflicts and elicit more rejecting behavior in that specific instance (Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri, 1998). Moreover, on days after rejection-sensitive women feel acutely rejected by their dating partner, their partner reports greater dissatisfaction (Downey et al., 1998). In the diary study reported by Murray, Bellavia, et al. (2003), the spouses of people who felt less positively regarded (correctly) believed they were the target of more hurtful and rejecting behaviors on days after lows had felt most rejected\u2014and it was only then that they actually became annoyed and rejecting toward their partner.\nBy putting self-protection at a greater premium than connection, people who feel less positively regarded, such as those low in self-esteem, may create long-term interpersonal realities that defeat their hopes and confirm their fears. Supporting this analysis, a longitudinal daily diary study of married couples suggested that the chronic activation of dependence-minimizing behaviors has a corrosive effect on relationships over time (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). Specifically, men were more likely to become dissatisfied over the year when women\u2019s behavioral response to feeling rejected was to self-protect and to behave negatively toward their spouse (Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Negotiating romantic life necessitates continual efforts to resolve a constantly and newly unfolding conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals. Ironically, the situations that offer the greatest opportunity to satiate connectedness goals, such as situations where a partner\u2019s support or sacrifice is needed, are\nthe situations where rejection hurts the most (Kelley, 1979). The risk regulation system operates to resolve this conflict, optimizing feelings of assurance by directing people toward situations that seem to offer a safe level of dependence. Unfortunately, for people low in self-esteem, this regulation system is overly conservative, prioritizing self-protection to a degree that undermines the bonds they want to create.\nReferences\nAarts, H., Dijksterhuis, A., & De Vries, P.

McCrea University of Konstanz\nResearchers interested in counterfactual thinking have often found that upward counterfactual thoughts lead to increased motivation to improve in the future, although at the cost of increased negative affect. The present studies suggest that because upward counterfactual thoughts indicate reasons for a poor performance, they can also serve as excuses. In this case, upward counterfactual thoughts should result in more positive self-esteem and reduced future motivation. Five studies demonstrated these effects in the context of self-handicapping. First, upward counterfactual thinking was increased in the presence of a self-handicap. Second, upward counterfactual thoughts indicating the presence of a self-handicap protected self-esteem following failure. Finally, upward counterfactual thoughts that protect self-esteem reduced preparation for a subsequent performance as well as performance itself. These findings suggest that the consequences of upward counterfactuals for affect and motivation are moderated by the goals of the individual as well as the content of the thoughts.\nKeywords: counterfactual thinking, self-handicapping, self-protection, motivation\nCounterfactual thinking involves considering how a past event could have been better or worse. Those thoughts that identify how an outcome could have been worse (e.g., \u201cAt least I passed the test, I could have failed\u201d) are referred to as downward thoughts, whereas those that identify how an outcome could have been better (e.g., \u201cIf I had studied more, I could have gotten an A\u201d) are referred to as upward thoughts (Markman, Gavanski, Sherman, & McMullen, 1993, 1995; Roese, 1994).\nAn extensive body of research has documented the consequences of these thoughts for affect and subsequent behavior (for reviews, see Epstude & Roese, 2008; Markman & McMullen, 2003; Roese & Olson, 1995a; Sanna, Carter, & Small, 2006). Previous research on counterfactual thinking has found that individuals often compare counterfactual alternatives to reality, leading to an affective contrast effect (Markman & McMullen, 2003; McMullen, 1997). Thus, upward counterfactual thoughts can lead to more negative affect, whereas downward counterfactual thoughts can lead to maintained or more positive affect (Boninger, Gleicher, & Strathman, 1994; Markman et al., 1993, 1995; Roese, 1994). These findings led to the conclusion that downward counterfactuals often serve an affective (i.e., mood maintenance) function (Markman et al., 1993; Roese, 1994).\nIn terms of the behavioral consequences of counterfactual thinking, past researchers have often found that upward counterfactuals\nlead to greater intentions to prepare, greater task effort, and improved performance (Markman et al., 1993; Markman, McMullen, & Elizaga, 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008; Roese, 1994), suggesting that upward counterfactual thoughts often serve a preparative function. Several possible processes underlying this effect have been suggested, although they may operate in tandem and are not mutually exclusive (Epstude & Roese, 2008). Thinking \u201cIf I had studied more I would have gotten an A\u201d might lead to increased studying because the individual is less satisfied with his or her performance and thus more motivated to improve (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008), because the thought identifies a potentially useful behavior (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese, 1994; Roese & Olson, 1995b), or because the individual experiences increased self-efficacy (Tal-Or, Boninger, & Gleicher, 2004). Supporting the proposed motivational benefits of counterfactual thinking, numerous studies have shown that performance benefits of counterfactual thinking only occur when accompanied by negative affect (Markman et al., 2008; McMullen & Markman, 2000; Myers & McCrea, 2008). Thus, counterfactual thinking appears to involve a tradeoff of protecting affect for improving future performance.\nMore recent research has suggested that these consequences of upward and downward counterfactual thinking can also be reversed. The Reflection Evaluation Model (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; McMullen, 1997) holds that focusing individuals on the counterfactual alternative (i.e., reflection) rather than on a comparison of this alternative with the obtained outcome (i.e., evaluation) leads to more positive affect as a result of making upward compared to downward counterfactuals and increased preparation and motivation as a result of making downward compared to upward counterfactuals. Thus, fantasizing that an outcome could have been better leads to more positive affect, which in turn undermines efforts to improve in the future (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008).

Consider for a moment the thought, \u201cIf I had studied more, I could have gotten an A.\u201d In those cases in which the individual is motivated to achieve, such a thought would lead one to experience disappointment and self-directed anger because a better outcome could have been obtained. These emotions would in turn motivate efforts to improve subsequent academic performance. This type of effect has been documented extensively in counterfactual studies (e.g., Markman et al., 1993, 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008; Roese, 1994). However, in situations in which the individual is motivated by self-protection concerns, the same thought could be used to suggest that a poor grade was due to a lack of effort rather than a lack of ability or intelligence. As a result, one might expect this same type of thought to protect self-esteem following a failure (thus serving an affective function) but undermine motivation to improve.\nThere is of course a large literature demonstrating that the impact of performance feedback on self-esteem is moderated by attribution processes. Failures lead to lower self-esteem when attributed to internal stable causes, such as ability, than when attributed to external or unstable causes, such as low effort or task difficulty (Covington & Omelich, 1979; McFarland & Ross, 1982; Weiner, 1985). Research on counterfactual thinking has shown that there are also close links between these thoughts and causal judgments, particularly blame assignment, although they do not completely overlap with attribution processes (Branscombe, Wohl, Owen, Allison, & N Gbala, 2003; Creyer & Guerhan, 1997; Mandel, 2003; Mandel & Lehman, 1996; Wells & Gavanski, 1989). For example, one could say a fire destroyed the house but that this outcome could have been prevented had the fire department responded more quickly. It is therefore likely that the ramifications of counterfactual thoughts for blame and responsibility should influence subsequent affect and self-esteem, independent of attribution processes. Counterfactual thoughts blaming low ability for a poor performance are likely to result in decreased self-esteem, relative to counterfactuals placing blame on more unstable factors (see also Covington & Omelich, 1979; Weiner, 1985).\nIndeed, research has demonstrated that counterfactuals mutating aspects of the self as opposed to more external factors have more negative consequences for emotion and well-being following a negative event. For example, counterfactuals that mutate aspects of the self following a failure lead to increased shame (Niedenthal, Tangney, & Gavanski, 1994) and regret (Sevdalis & Kokkinaki, 2006), and agreement with such thoughts predicts increased selfblame and worse psychological well-being following a traumatic event (Branscombe et al., 2003). Individuals also demonstrate a number of self- and group-protective biases in counterfactual thinking. For example, following a negative outcome, individuals are more likely to generate counterfactuals indicating that it was unforeseeable (Markman & Tetlock, 2000b). They are also more likely to agree with upward counterfactuals when seeking to lower\nexpectations for future performances (Sanna, Chang, & Meier, 2001). Following a failure relevant for the self or an ingroup, individuals tend to mutate external factors more than they do internal factors; conversely, following a success, they tend to mutate internal factors more than they do external factors (Goerke, Mo\u0308ller, Schulz-Hardt, Napiersky, & Frey, 2004; Roese & Olson, 1993). This pattern of counterfactual mutation is not found or is reversed for the outcomes of others (McCrea, 2007; Roese & Olson, 1993). Thus, there is increasing evidence that counterfactual thoughts are biased by self-protection concerns. However, to date there has not been direct evidence for the use of counterfactuals to blame poor outcomes on unstable factors (such as lack of effort) nor has research examined the consequences of such thoughts for self-esteem and motivation.\nSelf-Handicapping\nThe current studies sought to provide evidence for the ability of upward counterfactuals to excuse poor performances in the context of self-handicapping. Self-handicapping involves creating or claiming an obstacle prior to a performance (Berglas & Jones, 1978; Jones & Berglas, 1978). In the event of a failure, one can point to the self-handicap as the reason a better outcome was not obtained and thereby protect self-esteem and conceptions of ability (Feick & Rhodewalt, 1997; McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett, & Fairfield, 1991). Past research has shown that individuals use a variety of strategies to self-handicap, including withdrawing effort (Hirt, Deppe, & Gordon, 1991; Hirt, McCrea, & Kimble, 2000), listening to distracting music (Shepperd & Arkin, 1989b), or ingesting drugs or alcohol (Berglas & Jones, 1978; Jones & Berglas, 1978) prior to an important exam or performance. Self-handicapping is more likely to occur when individuals are feeling uncertain about an important performance. For example, receiving noncontingent success feedback (Berglas & Jones, 1978) or experiencing uncertainty and concern as a result of public self-focus (Hirt et al., 2000) increases self-handicapping. Men are also more willing to engage in active, behavioral forms of self-handicapping, such as withdrawal of preparation effort, taking drugs or alcohol, or listening to distracting music, than are women (Hirt et al., 1991, 2000; McCrea, Hirt, & Milner, 2008; Rhodewalt, 1990; Shepperd & Arkin, 1989b). This difference appears to be due to the fact that women place more value on putting forth one\u2019s best effort than do men (McCrea, Hirt, Hendrix, Milner, & Steele, in press; McCrea et al., 2008).\nResearch has also demonstrated that self-handicapping is effective in protecting self-esteem and conceptions of ability in the face of failure. Specifically, the presence of a handicap allows individuals to shift attributions for a poor performance from ability to the handicap (Feick & Rhodewalt, 1997; McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Rhodewalt et al., 1991). In addition, self-handicapping maintains self-evaluations of ability in a specific domain, as well as global self-esteem, despite failure (Feick & Rhodewalt, 1997; McCrea & Hirt, 2001).\nCounterfactual Thinking and Self-Handicapping\nGiven the relationship between counterfactual thinking, blame assignment, and affect, as well as the reliance of the selfhandicapping strategy on manipulating subsequent attributions, it\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nmay prove interesting to examine the role of counterfactual thinking in self-handicapping. S. J. Sherman and McConnell (1995) noted that, by deliberately creating obstacles to success, the selfhandicapping strategy appears to increase the likelihood that upward counterfactuals will be generated. Self-handicaps are likely to be the focus of counterfactual explanations for a poor performance because they represent an \u201cabnormal\u201d condition (Kahneman & Miller, 1986). However, at least with regard to self-esteem, the consequences of upward counterfactuals that identify a selfhandicap are likely to be positive rather than negative. That is, in the context of self-handicapping, thinking \u201cIf I had studied more, I would have gotten an A\u201d should maintain self-esteem following a poor performance (S. J. Sherman & McConnell, 1995). Thus, counterfactuals are particularly likely to excuse failure when the thought identifies a salient self-handicap. In attribution terms, counterfactuals that identify unstable factors as having prevented a better performance should serve to protect self-esteem following failure (see also Covington & Omelich, 1979; Weiner, 1985).\nIn addition to examining the consequences of using excusing upward counterfactual thoughts for self-esteem, the present studies examine how future motivation is likely to be impacted. If increased motivation resulting from counterfactual thinking is dependent upon the experience of negative affect, then it may not occur for upward thoughts that identify an excuse for failure. That is, an excuse may allow the individual to be satisfied with his or her performance despite failure, thus eliminating the motivation to improve in the future. Interestingly, this would suggest that selfhandicapping on an initial performance is likely to decrease motivation to improve. As a result, preparatory effort and subsequent performance should suffer. This prediction, although untested to date, would potentially account for past findings that selfhandicapping behavior can undermine long-term academic performance (McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Urdan, 2004; Zuckerman, Kieffer, & Knee, 1998).\nStudy 1\u2013\u2013Counterfactuals in the Classroom\nStudy 1 sought to provide initial evidence for the use of upward counterfactuals as excuses in a situation in which individuals would be motivated by self-protection concerns. Specifically, participants generated counterfactual thoughts following a midterm examination in their psychology course in which a lack of study effort could have served as a self-handicap. Individuals reporting low preparatory effort for the course exam were expected to generate more upward counterfactual thoughts about their effort relative to those reporting high preparatory effort for the exam. Furthermore, controlling for reported effort, individuals were expected to experience higher self-esteem as a result of generating upward counterfactuals about a lack of effort. Given that past work has shown that upward counterfactuals involve a tradeoff of increased negative affect for increased preparative intentions and performance (Markman et al., 1993; Myers & McCrea, 2008; Roese, 1994), individuals using upward counterfactuals to excuse a poor performance should experience less dissatisfaction and therefore be less motivated to improve in the future. Thus, individuals generating more upward counterfactuals about effort should report higher intentions to prepare in the future but only when these thoughts are accompanied by lower self-esteem. These effects of counterfactual thinking were expected to be limited to\nthose specifically related to the handicap. Given that other counterfactuals are likely to mutate a mix of external and internal, stable and unstable factors, no predictions were made with regard to the effects of thoughts unrelated to the handicap for self-esteem or subsequent motivation.\nFinally, attributions to effort were measured to assess whether effects of counterfactual thinking occurred independently of causal attribution. Based on previous research showing that counterfactual thinking and attribution are related but independent processes (Mandel, 2003; Mandel & Lehman, 1996), it was predicted that effort attributions would show similar effects but would not account for the effects of counterfactuals concerning the handicap.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 125 (35 men, 90 women) Indiana University students in two sections of a social psychology course who participated in return for extra credit in the course. There was no mention of self-handicapping or counterfactual thought in either class. Both sections used the same text, the same test format, and the same timing of the test."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "Study 1 involved three sessions, following the methods of McCrea and Hirt (2001). The first session occurred at the beginning of the semester. The second occurred approximately 1 week before a midterm exam in the course. The third occurred approximately 1 week after the exam, immediately after participants learned their score.\nSession 1. Participants were told that the experimenters were interested in how students at large and small universities prepare for exams. They completed a detailed informed consent form and were assured their responses would be kept confidential, being identified only by a unique code. They were asked to complete a personality profile that included Rosenberg\u2019s (1965) self-esteem measure, answering on a 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree) scale.\nSession 2. Participants were told that the researchers were interested in a number of factors, such as class size, that might influence how students prepare for tests. Participants were asked to complete several demographic measures, to provide their most recent GPA (high school or college) and college entrance exam scores (on a scale ranging from 1 600 SAT or 18 ACT to 10 1500\u20131600 SAT or 34\u201336 ACT), and to complete several items concerning the characteristics of their class and the instructor to solidify the cover story.\nSession 3. The final session occurred immediately after participants learned their score on the test. Participants indicated their score (percent correct) on the exam. They were then asked to list any thoughts they had about their test score. Thus, there were no explicit instructions concerning counterfactual thoughts. Participants then were asked whether their performance was due to their amount of effort, rated on a scale ranging from 1 (disagree very much) to 7 (agree very much), and completed a measure of mood and self-esteem. They indicated to what extent they felt each of 30 mood and self-esteem adjectives (adapted from McFarland &\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nRoss, 1982) at that moment using a 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much) scale.\nThey next indicated how much effort they had put into studying for the exam (see also McCrea & Hirt, 2001). Participants completed measures assessing how much they had read the textbook, attended office hours, went to review sessions, used flash cards, asked the instructor questions, and asked other students questions. They responded to these items using a 0 (not at all) to 6 (great deal) scale. They also indicated how hard they had studied overall on a 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much) scale and reported how many days before the exam they had studied. Finally, participants reported their intentions to study for the next exam in the class using the same items. At the end of the final session, the full purpose of the experiment, reason for the use of deception, and expected results were discussed with participants. The confidentiality of their responses was again stressed.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Overview", "text": "Regression analyses were utilized due to the continuous nature of the data. All variables were centered around the mean and significant interactions were probed using simple-slope tests calculated at 1 standard deviation from the mean (Aiken & West, 1991). Predicted scores were plotted at 1 standard deviation from the mean and 95% confidence intervals for the simple slopes were also calculated (Tabachnik & Fidell, 2001). Reported study effort items were highly correlated, as were the future study intention items. They were therefore standardized and summed to form single indices (reported study effort .69; future study intentions .83). Means, standard deviations, and interitem correlations for the future study intention items are provided in Table 1. Based on correlational and reliability analyses, a postexam state self-esteem index (worthless, depressed, incompetent, stupid, inadequate, shame; .96) and a positive mood index (joyful, delighted, happy, excited, glad, satisfied, confident; .97) were created (see also McCrea & Hirt, 2001). Higher scores on the self-esteem index reflected less (i.e., more negative) self-esteem. Initial analyses revealed no significant effects of gender, and so this variable is not discussed further. Univariate and bivariate statistics for the main variables are presented in Table 2."}, {"heading": "Counterfactual Thoughts", "text": "Two coders identified any thoughts that indicated how the test score could have been better or worse. Only those thoughts mentioning a factor that could have affected the outcome of the psychology exam (and not things affecting other events or the person\u2019s emotional state) were included. Thus, thoughts expressing satisfaction or disappointment with the outcome were excluded. Those thoughts indicating how the test score could have been improved above the actual score were coded as upward, whereas those thoughts indicating how the test score could have been worse than the actual score were coded as downward. Due to the open-ended nature of the thought listing instructions, it was not crucial that the thought followed a strict if\u2013then format but rather that the thought indicated that the outcome could have been different. For example, the thought, \u201cThe essay is what messed up my grade because I hadn\u2019t studied that subject thoroughly enough,\u201d was classified as an upward counterfactual even though the if\u2013then phrasing was not explicitly given. In addition, the content of the counterfactual thoughts was classified as concerning either the amount (or lack) of study effort and preparatory behavior or other miscellaneous factors. Included in the miscellaneous category were thoughts about interest in and importance of the exam, the difficulty of the exam, understanding the material, stress or anxiety, attention and concentration, time allowed for the exam, etc. For example, the thought \u201cI think I could have done better if I would have put a little more time studying [sic]\u201d was classified as a study thought, whereas the thought \u201cSome of the questions I missed, first I\u2019d circled the right answer and then I doubted myself so I changed them\u201d was classified as miscellaneous. Interrater agreement for these judgments was 83% ( .53), and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Participants generated relatively few (f 18) downward counterfactual thoughts, and so they were excluded from the analyses.1\n1 Including downward thoughts in the analyses either as a separate variable or by creating an index by subtracting the number of downward counterfactual thoughts from the number of upward counterfactual thoughts (see also Markman et al., 1993, 1995) did not alter the results. The number of downward thoughts predicted increased positive affect, but there were no other effects of these thoughts.\nTable 1 Future Study Intention Interitem Correlations (Study 1; N 125)\nItem Textbook Flashcards Asking instructor Asking others Office hours Review session Days Overall\nTextbook \u2013\u2013 Flashcards .42 \u2013\u2013 Asking instructor .20 .27 \u2013\u2013 Asking others .29 .39 .49 \u2013\u2013 Office hours .36 .35 .48 .42 \u2013\u2013 Review session .35 .38 .37 .39 .46 \u2013\u2013 Days .41 .33 .13 .32 .38 .44 \u2013\u2013 Overall .63 .47 .23 .35 .50 .46 .40 \u2013\u2013 M 4.90 3.14 2.08 2.40 1.54 3.24 5.25 5.98 SD 1.56 2.49 1.78 1.98 1.70 2.41 3.66 0.96\np .05. p .01. p .001.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nThe number of upward study counterfactual thoughts (f 28) and upward miscellaneous counterfactual thoughts (f 47) were separately regressed on performance on the exam and on the reported study effort index.

This finding is consistent with past counterfactual research that has shown that individuals are likely to mutate exceptional or abnormal conditions, particularly after a negative outcome (Kahneman & Miller, 1986; Wells & Gavanski, 1989), as well as with the predictions of S. J. Sherman and McConnell (1995) that self-handicapping should increase upward counterfactual thinking. Rather than leading to affective contrast effects, upward counterfactual thoughts identifying an unstable factor in the form of a self-handicap excused poor performance and therefore protected self-esteem (see also Covington & Omelich, 1979; Weiner, 1985).\nThe second purpose of the study was to examine the consequences of excusing upward counterfactuals for future motivation. Consistent with past research that has shown that upward counterfactuals improve subsequent motivation only when accompanied by negative affect (Markman et al., 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008), upward study counterfactual thoughts were associated with higher intentions to study in the future when individuals experienced negative self-esteem as a result of a poor performance. However, as predicted, the reverse effect held for those experiencing less negative self-esteem. Among these individuals, upward study counterfactual thoughts were associated with lower study intentions. In other words, it appears that the preparative effect of upward counterfactual thinking can be undermined or even reversed when these thoughts can serve to excuse a poor performance.\nIt is also important to note that the effects of upward study counterfactuals were independent of attributions to effort. Thus, although the present findings reveal the usefulness of applying models of attribution (e.g., Weiner, 1985) to counterfactual thinking, they also replicate past research that has shown that causal attribution and counterfactual thinking are independent processes (Mandel, 2003; Mandel & Lehman, 1996).\nStudy 2\u2013\u2013Manipulating the Availability of a SelfHandicap\nStudy 2 was designed to replicate the finding that the availability of a self-handicap increases the generation of upward counterfactuals identifying the handicap following failure and that the generation of these thoughts serves to protect self-esteem. To provide a stronger test of these hypotheses, I experimentally manipulated the presence of a handicap. Consistent with past work examining the reduction of task effort as a self-handicap, participants were told that they would be taking a test of intelligence but\nFigure 2.

The presence of a handicap was varied by inducing individuals to practice for 10 min or to not practice at all (see also Brown & Josephs, 1999; Rhodewalt et al., 1991). A modified induced compliance procedure (cf. Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959; Smith, 1961) was utilized so that participants felt that their behavior had been freely chosen and that counterfactuals generated about the handicap would identify a controllable behavior. This procedure was important in order to ensure that participants would view the handicap as mutable and that individuals could at least theoretically regret their lack of effort. All participants then completed the actual exam and were given failure feedback. It was predicted that the presence of a handicap (i.e., lack of adequate practice effort) would result in an increase in upward counterfactual thinking, specifically about the handicap itself. The lack of adequate practice should provide a salient reason for poor performance. Furthermore, generating relatively more upward counterfactual thoughts about practice was not expected to predict lower self-esteem in the no-practice (handicap present) condition. In this condition, upward counterfactual thoughts identifying lack of effort should serve as an excuse for failure. Because this excuse was not present in the practice (handicap absent) condition, a negative relationship between upward counterfactual thinking about practice and self-esteem was expected in this condition. As in Study 1, no specific predictions were made for thoughts unrelated to the handicap.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 125 (64 men and 61 women) Indiana University students in an introductory psychology course. They took part in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two practice conditions."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "Upon entering the lab, participants completed a detailed informed consent statement and were then asked to complete the Rosenberg (1965) Self-Esteem scale while the main experiment was being prepared. They were told that this measure was part of a questionnaire for a colleague at another university. Collected questionnaires were placed in an envelope addressed to this researcher. They were then told that the main experiment would involve taking a nonverbal test of intelligence called the CultureFair Intelligence Test (Cattell & Cattell, 1961). They were shown four example items, taken from the conditions subtest of the Culture-Fair Intelligence Test. The experimenter led the participants through the first two examples to ensure participants understood the instructions. Participants completed the third and fourth examples on their own. They were told they were correct on the third example and incorrect on the fourth to increase their uncertainty about the exam and make self-handicapping more desirable (cf. Berglas & Jones, 1978; Hirt et al., 2000; Thompson, 2004).\nAll participants were told that prior research had indicated that practice ensures that the Culture-Fair Intelligence Test is accurate but that lack of adequate practice can result in a score that is lower than warranted by the person\u2019s actual intelligence (cf. Hirt et al.,\n1991, 2000). Participants were also told that the researchers were interested in examining the effect of practice on the exam, and so they were asking participants to either complete a set amount of practice problems or to not practice at all. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of two practice conditions.\nIn the practice condition, participants were told that a computer error had resulted in the experimenter\u2019s running too many people in the no-practice condition, and so the participants were asked if they would not mind being in the practice condition (see also Brown & Josephs, 1999). Once participants had agreed to practice, they were asked again and told that it was their choice to make, in order to reinforce the notion that the choice to practice was their own (cf. Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959; Smith, 1961).\nIn the no-practice condition, participants were told that a computer error had resulted in the experimenter\u2019s running too many people in the practice condition, and so they were asked if they would not mind being in the no-practice condition. The same procedure to reinforce the notion of free choice was used. In this manner, participants were provided with a viable excuse for any subsequent poor performance.\nImmediately following these instructions, participants were asked to what extent they understood the instructions and felt pressured to practice or not practice, responding on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) scale. Following these questions, participants in the practice condition began the practice exam, entering their answers into the computer. They completed 10 practice items without a time limit. Participants in the no-practice condition did not receive any practice items. All participants then began the actual exam, entering their answers into the computer. Following the exam, all participants received failure feedback indicating that they had correctly answered 6 out of 20 problems, placing them in the bottom 35% of college students. After reading their feedback, they were given instructions concerning the generation of counterfactual thoughts. These instructions, adapted from Roese and Olson (1995c), were as follows:\nWe are interested in individual differences and how they relate to performance on the nonverbal test. One such difference is the thoughts people have about a test. For example, people often have thoughts like \u201cIf only. . .\u201d or \u201cAt least. . .\u201d when thinking about a past performance. People often think about the things that could have happened right before or during such a test, including things they might have done themselves, that could have changed their score on the test.\nWe would like you to write the thoughts of this type you are having right now about the nonverbal test you just took. For example, you could think, \u201cIf only I had ______, I would have done better on the nonverbal test.\u201d Alternatively, you could be thinking, \u201cAt least ______ happened, or I might have done worse on the nonverbal test.\u201d\nParticipants were reminded to write thoughts identifying how their performance on the test could have been different. They were then given 5 min to list up to 15 counterfactual thoughts, entering them into the computer.\nParticipants then completed a state self-esteem and mood measure, as in Study 1. Additional positive self-esteem items were included in order to have a more balanced measure. Participants indicated the extent to which they felt each of the items at that moment, using a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) scale.\nParticipants next indicated to what extent they attributed their performance to their practice effort on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nmuch) scale and completed a final manipulation check item concerning to what extent the experimenter had told them that practice is helpful for the nonverbal exam, responding on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) scale. They were then completely debriefed regarding the purpose of the study and need for deception. Specifically, they were told that the feedback they had received was the same for all participants and therefore should not be considered indicative of their actual intelligence.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Overview", "text": "Initial analyses revealed no gender differences, and so this variable is not considered further.

Furthermore, higher numbers of upward practice thoughts predicted more negative self-esteem in the practice condition, consistent with past work showing affective contrast effects of upward counterfactual thinking (Boninger et al., 1994; Markman et al., 1993; Roese, 1994). However, the number of upward practice thoughts was unrelated to postexam self-esteem in the no-practice condition. Thus, upward counterfactual thoughts identifying an existing handicap predicted maintained self-esteem. These findings are consistent with models of attribution (e.g., Weiner, 1985) predicting that attributing a failure to an unstable cause protects self-esteem. However, replicating Study 1, the effects of counterfactual thoughts were not accounted for by attributions to effort, suggesting counterfactuals are independent of attribution processes (see also Mandel, 2003; Mandel & Lehman, 1996).\nStudy 3\u2013\u2013Manipulating Counterfactual Direction\nStudies 1 and 2 demonstrated that upward counterfactual thoughts pointing to an available self-handicap predicted maintained self-esteem after a failure. Furthermore, excusing upward counterfactuals predicted reduced future study intentions. However, due to the correlational nature of these findings, the causal effect of these thoughts on self-esteem and subsequent motivation is still unclear. Furthermore, these studies did not allow comparison to a control condition in which participants did not consider counterfactuals. To provide stronger evidence for the claim that upward counterfactual thoughts protect self-esteem when pointing to a self-handicap, the direction of counterfactual thinking was manipulated in Study 3. Specifically, participants were induced to practice inadequately for an exam and subsequently told that they had failed, as in Study 2. They were then exposed to downward counterfactuals, upward counterfactuals, or were assigned to a no-counterfactual control condition, and completed a state selfesteem measure. It was predicted that, in the presence of a handicap, individuals would report more positive self-esteem after considering upward counterfactuals pointing to the handicap as having prevented better performance, relative to those in the control condition, and no different or perhaps more positive than those considering downward counterfactuals.\nA second purpose of the study was to replicate the finding from Study 1 that upward counterfactuals predict lower subsequent preparation intentions when accompanied by more positive selfesteem. To provide stronger evidence for these effects on subsequent motivation to improve, participants in the present study were given a surprise opportunity to practice for a second version of the exam. The number of items attempted and the time spent practicing were recorded to provide a behavioral measure of subsequent preparation. It was predicted that individuals would practice less in the upward counterfactual condition than they would in the control and downward counterfactual conditions, as these thoughts would\nFigure 3.

A potential drawback of the design of Study 1 was that participants knew that they would have the opportunity to take a similar test again in the future. Outcomes that can be changed in the future more often lead to affective assimilation for counterfactual thinking (Boninger et al., 1994; McMullen & Markman, 2002). An alternative explanation for the self-esteem findings in Study 1 then could be that individuals generating more upward counterfactual thoughts felt relieved because they knew they could study more in the future and improve their performance. Of course, this contradicts the finding that these same individuals intended to study less in the future. Nonetheless, it is important to rule out this possible explanation by demonstrating that participants would show the same effects for self-esteem and preparatory behavior when they were initially unaware that a second performance opportunity would arise.\nStudy 3 sought to demonstrate these effects with a different type of academic performance, specifically a mathematics test. Furthermore, the evaluative threat of the performance was increased by placing participants under conditions of public self-focus via a closed-circuit camera. Previous research has shown that such conditions increase the likelihood of self-handicapping behavior (Hirt et al., 2000)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Participants were 73 (39 women, 34 men) University of Konstanz students, recruited in return for research credit or \u20ac5 payment.

Participants were told this questionnaire was required for all those participating in studies in the Social and Motivational Psychology department. Questionnaires were identified only by a unique code.\nParticipants arrived individually at the laboratory and were told the experiment dealt with performance on a mathematics test. They were told that prior research had shown that individuals respond more honestly when they are observed, and that for this reason, they would be observed via a video camera connection to the experimenter\u2019s computer monitor (cf. Hirt et al., 2000). Participants were shown that the camera and the video display were on and working and then completed a consent statement agreeing to be involved in the study.\nThe test was described as measuring not only math ability but also the ability to solve problems logically. Participants were told the experimenters were interested in individual differences in\nperformance on this test, and so they would also be completing personality measures. They were then told that one disadvantage of the math test was that it was not predictive of actual ability if test takers had not completed a short practice test in order to \u201cwarmup\u201d (cf. Hirt et al., 1991, 2000). They were told that this effect was being further evaluated and that therefore they would be assigned to practice either the entire recommended 10-min period or only a 2-min period. These instructions were repeated through a test of understanding to ensure that participants had paid attention. As in Study 2, the experimenter explained that a previous programming error had resulted in assigning everyone to the practice condition, and therefore there were not enough people who had insufficiently practiced. The experimenter asked all participants to be in the low-practice condition, and this choice was reinforced through additional questioning.\nParticipants then completed the 2-min practice session and began the actual 20-item exam. The exam was adapted from the mathematics section of the I-S-T 2000R (Amthauer, Brocke, Liepmann, & Beauducel, 2001). After the completion of the exam, participants were informed that they had answered 11 out of 20 correct, placing them in the 35th percentile of university students. Participants were then told that they would read 10 statements made by previous participants about their performance on the exam. They were asked to carefully read the statements and relate them to their own performance on the math test. They were then randomly assigned to read one of three different sets of statements. In the upward counterfactual condition, participants read 5 counterfactual statements indicating that a greater amount of practice would have improved their performance (e.g., \u201cIf I had practiced more, I would have done better\u201d) and 5 neutral statements (e.g., \u201cThe test was interesting\u201d). In the downward counterfactual condition, participants read 5 downward counterfactual statements indicating that less practice would have undermined their performance (e.g., \u201cIf I had practiced less, I would have done worse\u201d) and the 5 neutral statements. A mix of neutral and counterfactual statements was utilized in order to reduce suspicion on the part of participants. In the control condition, participants read 10 neutral statements. In all conditions, the 10 statements were each presented for 30 s, and the order of the statements was randomized.\nFollowing exposure to the counterfactual statements, participants completed the state self-esteem measure. As in Study 2, they indicated to what extent they felt each of the items at that moment using a 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much) scale. After completing this measure, participants were told that they would be completing a second version of the math test. There had been no mention of the second test prior to this point. They were told that in this second version of the test, speed of response was considered such that it was important to be fast as well as correct. They were told that the second version of the test was also influenced by practice but that because of the speed component, the amount of practice they had on the previous version had no real effect on this second version. Therefore, they were told it was important to again practice 10 min in order to make the scores of the test a true measure of their mathematical ability. Participants could decide how much or how little they practiced for the test. After each answered item, participants could decide whether to continue or quit the practice session.

They indicated whether the experimenter had said that practice affected the test on a 1 (no effect) to 5 (strong effect) scale. They were also asked whether they believed practice affects the test using the same scale. Next, participants were asked how important it was for them to perform well on the test using a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very important) scale and whether the test was valid using a 1 (not at all) to 5 (very valid) scale.

Planned comparisons were therefore conducted on the speed of practice (those not practicing at all were considered missing), after controlling for Rosenberg Self-Esteem scores and perceived importance and validity of the exam. There was a significant effect of test importance, .313, t(56) 2.38, p .05, f2 .09, such that those perceiving the test as more important practiced more slowly. There were no effects of Rosenberg Self-Esteem or test validity on speed scores (ts 1, ns). More importantly, there were no differences between conditions for either the unstandardized residual scores or the raw speed scores (all ts 1.68, ps .09). Indeed, practice speed was actually nonsignificantly slower in the upward counterfactual condition (M 2.76 items per minute) compared to the control condition (M 4.09 items per minute).

It is also important to note that these effects occurred despite participants not being aware that they would be able to repeat the performance. Previous research has shown that upward counterfactuals result in less negative affect when the event is repeatable (Boninger et al., 1994; McMullen & Markman, 2002). Because participants were initially unaware of the opportunity to practice for an additional exam, the more positive selfesteem reported by participants in the upward counterfactual condition is unlikely to be due to participants feeling more prepared.\nThis interpretation is also reinforced by the finding that the preparative function of upward counterfactual thinking was eliminated when these thoughts could serve as an excuse. Rather than demonstrating increased motivation to practice, individuals practiced significantly less for the second exam after exposure to the upward counterfactual thoughts than they did after exposure to downward counterfactuals. Indeed, examining the practice measures more closely reveals that 5 participants in the upward counterfactual condition failed to practice a single item, whereas only 1 participant in the downward and control conditions combined failed to practice. Thus, the effects on future study intentions observed in Study 1 were replicated using an experimental manipulation of counterfactual direction and measuring actual practice behavior. The benefits of counterfactual thinking for preparation and motivation appear to be dependent on whether the thought serves a self-protective or mood-maintaining function for the individual rather than on the direction (upward or downward) of the thought. When upward counterfactual thoughts do not result in dissatisfaction with the performance, they no longer have positive benefits for future motivation (see also Markman & McMullen, 2003; Myers & McCrea, 2008).\nStudy 4\u2013\u2013Manipulating Counterfactual Content\nThe consequences of upward counterfactuals identifying a selfhandicap for self-esteem and subsequent motivation have thus far been explained with reference to classic models of attribution (Covington & Omelich, 1979; Weiner, 1985), as well as past findings in the self-handicapping literature (McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Rhodewalt et al., 1991) that have proposed that attributing a poor performance to an unstable cause (such as a self-handicap) serves to protect self-esteem. To test this explanation more directly, in Study 4, I manipulated whether participants were exposed to upward counterfactuals suggesting that either a self-handicap (i.e., an unstable factor) or a lack of ability (i.e., a stable factor) was to blame for a poor math performance. A second goal of the present study was to replicate the previous findings with a different type of self-handicap. Rather than practicing insufficiently, participants were induced to listen to distracting noises while completing the math test (Rhodewalt et al., 1991; Shepperd & Arkin, 1989b). It was expected that upward counterfactual thinking would protect self-esteem only when the thoughts pointed to noise as having prevented a better score on the math test.\nFurthermore, it was predicted that motivation to improve on a subsequent test would be lower when poor performance was excused by upward counterfactuals. To test this notion, participants were asked to select the level of distraction they would experience during a surprise second version of the math test. It was expected that individuals exposed to upward counterfactual\nthoughts suggesting that the noise was to blame for their poor performance would be more likely to listen to distracting noise during the second math test than would those exposed to counterfactual thoughts suggesting that their own lack of ability was to blame. Based on pretesting and past findings demonstrating that men are more likely than women to self-handicap by placing themselves in distracting environments (Rhodewalt, 1990; Rhodewalt et al., 1991; Shepperd & Arkin, 1989b), only men participated in the present study."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Participants were 40 male University of Konstanz students. Four participants expressed suspicion of the procedure and were therefore excluded. Two additional participants were excluded due to an equipment malfunction causing the distracting noise not to play properly. The remaining 34 participants were randomly assigned to one of three (handicap, ability, or control) counterfactual conditions."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Participants again completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale as part of a prescreening measure prior to the experimental session. Upon entering the laboratory for the experimental session, participants were told the study dealt with math performance and environmental noise, and they completed a consent form as in prior studies. They were informed they would be taking a math test and that performance on this test could be affected by different types of sounds (see also Rhodewalt et al., 1991; Shepperd & Arkin, 1989b). They were told that the investigators wished to further examine this finding and that therefore they would be asked to listen to either performance-enhancing or performance-impairing noises during the test. As in prior studies, participants were told a computer error had resulted in too many participants being assigned to listen to the helpful noises. For this reason, they were asked if they would listen to the distracting music, and this choice was reinforced. They then were asked to wear a pair of headphones and complete a 20-item math test (again adapted from Amthauer et al., 2001) while listening to a sampling of annoying traffic and construction noises. The noises were presented at a comfortable listening volume (approximately 45\u201350 dB), at a level that is rated as \u201chighly annoying\u201d by less than 5% of individuals and far below the standard pain threshold of 110 dB (see Algom, Raphaeli, & Cohen-Raz, 1986; Ouis, 2001, for reviews). The noises were thus designed to be distracting rather than stressful.\nFollowing the exam, participants received failure feedback and were assigned to one of the three counterfactual conditions. They read 10 statements supposedly written by a previous participant. Those in the handicap condition read 5 thoughts indicating that the person\u2019s performance could have been improved if (s)he had been less distracted or had chosen a less impairing noise selection (e.g., \u201cIf only I had listened to more neutral noises, I would have achieved a better result\u201d) and 5 neutral statements. Participants in the ability condition read 5 thoughts indicating that the person\u2019s performance could have been improved if (s)he was better at math or had made fewer mistakes (e.g., \u201cMy performance would maybe\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nhave been better if I was better at math\u201d) and 5 neutral statements. Those in the control condition read 10 neutral statements that did not indicate how the person\u2019s performance could have been different (e.g., \u201cI am surprised about my score\u201d). Each thought was presented for 30 s and participants were asked to relate the thought to their own performance on the math test.\nFollowing the counterfactual manipulation, participants completed the postperformance self-esteem measure, as in prior studies. They were then told that they would be given a chance to complete a different version of the exam in which speed is factored into the scoring. As in Study 3, there had been no mention of this test prior to this point. They were told that for this second version of the exam, they could choose the level of distraction of the noise they would hear during the test using a scale from 1 ( performance hindering) to 7 ( performance facilitating). After this selection was made, participants were told they had been assigned to a control condition and would not need to complete the second test. They completed manipulation checks concerning whether noise could affect their math performance, as well as the importance and the validity of the test as in Study 3, and they were then fully debriefed as in prior studies and given the opportunity to see their actual exam score.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Overview", "text": "As in previous studies, the postperformance self-esteem items (worthless [reversed], inadequate [reversed], shame [reversed], dumb [reversed], unable [reversed], proud, competence, resourceful, capable) were combined into a single measure ( .69).

In contrast, when upward counterfactuals identified a lack of ability or mistakes as having prevented better performance, self-esteem was equivalent to levels reported in the control condition. These findings thus directly support the contention that counterfactuals identifying relatively more unstable factors as having prevented a better outcome serve to protect self-esteem, consistent with past attribution and self-handicapping research (e.g., Covington & Omelich, 1979; Feick & Rhodewalt, 1997; McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Rhodewalt et al., 1991; Weiner, 1985). Furthermore, when upward counterfactuals identified a handicap, motivation to improve (as measured by the selection of more helpful noise) was reduced. This latter finding is particularly noteworthy given that only these thoughts contained the information that more helpful noise would have improved performance. Thus, the benefits of counterfactual thinking for preparation in this study seemed to be driven more by motivational considerations than by the identification of a useful strategy.\nStudy 5\u2013\u2013Reduced Motivation or Increased SelfHandicapping?\nA remaining question concerns the source of the reduced preparative effects observed when upward counterfactuals concern a self-handicap. Thus far, it has been argued that this effect occurs\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nbecause excusing failure leaves the individual relatively more satisfied with the performance and thus less motivated to improve in the future. A growing literature has demonstrated that counterfactuals benefit future performance only when accompanied by negative affect (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; McMullen & Markman, 2000; Myers & McCrea, 2008). However, it is possible that the effects in the present studies are rather due to an increase in the motivation to self-handicap on the subsequent task.5 One could argue that counterfactuals mentioning the self-handicap make this self-protective strategy more cognitively accessible, consistent with past work demonstrating situational priming of goals (Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, & Troetschel, 2001). Alternatively, because the counterfactual mentioning the self-handicap excuses poor performance, the individual may continue to positively evaluate his or her ability and thus is motivated to continue protecting this self-concept by selfhandicapping on subsequent tasks. In contrast, those who have not excused a poor performance would already suffer from lowered self-esteem and thus have nothing left to protect. Selfhandicapping is reduced after failure feedback (Berglas & Jones, 1978; Higgins & Harris, 1988; Thompson, 2004) and is generally construed as an attempt to protect positive yet fragile self-views (Harris & Snyder, 1986; Jones & Berglas, 1978). Study 5 was therefore designed to examine whether decreased task motivation or increased self-handicapping motivation better accounts for the present effects. Participants were induced to practice insufficiently and assigned to consider either handicap-related upward counterfactual thoughts or control thoughts, as in Study 3. However, rather than assessing desire to engage in a behavior that could undermine performance (e.g., reduced subsequent practice or listening to distracting noises), participants\u2019 actual effort and performance on the task was measured. To assess motivation to self-handicap, participants were told that performance on the second exam was undermined by high stress levels and that they would therefore be asked to complete a stress measure. A number of previous studies have shown that individuals will claim stress as a handicap, and both men and women are willing to self-handicap in this manner (Hendrix & Hirt, 2008; Hirt et al., 1991; McCrea & Hirt, 2001). Thus, if the self-handicapping account is correct, exposure to the self-handicap-related upward counterfactuals should result in higher stress reporting but have no effect on task motivation, compared to control thoughts. In contrast, if the motivation account is correct, there should be no effects of counterfactual thought on stress reporting, but task effort and performance should be reduced after exposure to the self-handicap-related upward counterfactuals."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "Participants were 28 (14 women, 14 men) University of Konstanz students.

After receiving the practice instructions, participants completed an initial 2-min (insufficient) practice session, the first math exam, and received failure feedback. Following exposure to either the handicap-related (i.e., lack of practice) upward counterfactual thoughts or the control thoughts, participants were given instructions concerning a surprise second math exam. They were told that the second exam includes a time component and therefore is strongly affected by one\u2019s current ability to concentrate. Individuals experiencing stress in their lives can become distracted and, as a result, not perform as well. Participants were therefore asked to complete a 32-item stress inventory (adapted from Kanner, Coyne, Schaeffer, & Lazarus, 1981). This measure served as an assessment of self-handicapping (see also Hendrix & Hirt, 2008; Hirt et al., 1991).\nFollowing the stress inventory, participants began the second math exam.

Furthermore, as a proportion of items attempted, participants in the control condition outperformed those in the handicap-related counterfactual condition (see Table 6).\nIn summary, the results strongly support the conclusion that considering counterfactuals about a self-handicap reduces motivation to improve on subsequent tasks. There did not appear to be any evidence that these thoughts increased the desire to selfhandicap. Future researchers should continue to examine this question however. Certainly, it can be argued that reduced concern with success might increase the attractiveness of self-handicaps (see also Oleson, Poehlmann, Yost, Lynch, & Arkin, 2000).

Selfhandicapping tends to be increased when one feels uncertain about a prior success rather than a prior failure (Berglas & Jones, 1978; Thompson, 2004). The notion that counterfactuals motivate individuals to self-handicap would perhaps find support when these thoughts have been made after a successful performance, particularly for downward counterfactuals indicating that a worse performance could have been obtained.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present studies sought to demonstrate that upward counterfactual thoughts can serve to excuse a poor performance (see also S. J. Sherman & McConnell, 1995). This proposed effect of counterfactual thinking was examined in the context of selfhandicapping. It was predicted and found that (a) the presence of a self-handicap increases the availability of upward counterfactual thoughts, (b) upward counterfactual thoughts indicating that a self-handicap prevented a better outcome result in more positive self-esteem following failure, and (c) these same thoughts reduce motivation to adequately prepare for and do well on an upcoming performance. Furthermore, evidence for these relationships was observed in laboratory and field settings, with different types of academic tests, for both intended and actual behavior, and with both spontaneously generated and experimentally manipulated counterfactuals."}, {"heading": "Counterfactual Thinking and Self-Protection", "text": "Counterfactual thinking has been linked in numerous studies to causal reasoning (Branscombe et al., 2003; Mandel, 2003; Mandel & Lehman, 1996; Wells & Gavanski, 1989). Furthermore, past research has shown that the locus of counterfactual mutation affects judgments of blame (Branscombe et al., 2003; Creyer & Guerhan, 1997), regret (Sevdalis & Kokkinaki, 2006), and emotion (Niedenthal et al., 1994). The present research extends these findings, showing that counterfactual thoughts also influence subsequent self-esteem and that stability of the mutated factor moderates these effects. Specifically, counterfactuals concerning unstable causes, such as a lack of effort, protected self-esteem following a negative performance (see also Covington & Omelich, 1979; McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Rhodewalt et al., 1991; Weiner, 1985). It is important to note that, although these effects are consistent with\nmodels of attribution, the consequences of counterfactuals for state self-esteem appeared to be independent of causal attributions, supporting past work showing that they are related yet independent processes (Mandel, 2003; Mandel & Lehman, 1996).\nThe present studies also extend past work showing that although upward thoughts often result in more negative affect, these effects can also be reversed. For example, when individuals \u201creflect\u201d on counterfactual alternatives, vividly imagining how the outcome could have been different, they are more likely to experience positive affect as a result of upward counterfactual thinking (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; McMullen, 1997). Similarly, the possibility to change an outcome in the future or a focus on process accountability results in affective assimilation (Boninger et al., 1994; Markman & Tetlock, 2000a; McMullen & Markman, 2002). Likewise, upward counterfactuals that can excuse a poor performance (i.e., by identifying an unstable factor as having prevented a better outcome) seem to lead to more positive self-esteem.\nThe ability of upward counterfactuals to excuse failure by shifting blame to unstable factors adds to a growing literature demonstrating the role of self-protection concerns in counterfactual thinking. For example, individuals have been shown to use counterfactual thoughts to deny responsibility for negative outcomes (Markman & Tetlock, 2000b), make negative outcomes seem better by comparison (Markman et al., 1993), lower future expectations (Sanna et al., 2001), and suggest that external rather than internal factors prevented a better outcome for self and important ingroups (Goerke et al., 2004; McCrea, 2007; Roese & Olson, 1993).\nIn addition to stressing the importance of the content of the counterfactual thought in determining affect and motivation, the present research also suggests that the same thought can have differing effects depending on the situational context. For example, the presence of a self-handicap in Study 2 altered the affective and motivational consequences of upward counterfactuals concerning preparative effort by allowing them to serve as an excuse. Furthermore, the consequences of these thoughts are likely dependent upon the goals of the individual to either protect the self or to improve. In many past studies, it appears that self-improvement motivations took precedence. As a result, individuals were more willing to accept increased negative affect in return for performance gains (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Myers & McCrea, 2008; Roese, 1994). In contrast, in the present studies, participants were motivated to excuse failure, and thus subsequent preparation and performance were reduced.\nWhat then determines whether a particular counterfactual thought serves to excuse poor performance or to identify ways to improve and increase goal striving? A consideration of variables that motivate self-handicapping behavior may provide a starting point for answering this important remaining question. Although not an exhaustive list, tasks that are important and that have implications for self-evaluations of ability and intelligence (Shepperd & Arkin, 1989a, 1989b), the experience of noncontingent success (Berglas & Jones, 1978; Thompson, 2004), the presence of an audience (Hirt et al., 2000; Kolditz & Arkin, 1982), the adoption of performance rather than mastery goals (Elliot, Cury, Fryer, & Huguet, 2006; Urdan, 2004), and the framing of a task in prevention rather than promotion terms (Hendrix & Hirt, 2008) have all been shown to increase self-handicapping behavior. Thus,\nTable 6 Study 5 Results\nCondition Stress index\nNumber of items\nattempted Number correct Percent correct\nHandicap (n 13) M 60.23 8.85 5.62 62.1% SD 12.37 3.91 3.04 18.5% Control (n 15) M 55.33 11.20 8.20 74.3% SD 12.30 2.81 2.18 16.0% t 1.05 1.85 2.61 1.87 p (one-tailed) .15 .05 .01 .05 2 .04 .11 .21 .12\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nthese conditions would also likely motivate individuals to use counterfactuals for self-protection rather than for selfimprovement. In addition, the consequences of counterfactual thinking may be moderated by variables relating to the arousal of self-enhancement versus self-assessment motives (Sedikides & Strube, 1997; Trope, 1986). For example, trait uncertainty (Sorrentino & Hewitt, 1984; Trope, 1986), high trait malleability (Dunning, 1995; Dweck & Leggett, 1988), and the prior satisfaction of self-protection and emotion-regulation concerns (D. K. Sherman & Cohen, 2006; Trope, Ferguson, & Raghunathan, 2001) may all increase the desire to use counterfactuals to accurately assess performance and spark self-improvement. These are fascinating questions for future research."}, {"heading": "Implications for the Effectiveness of Self-Handicapping", "text": "In both Studies 1 and 2, the presence of a handicap in the form of reduced preparative effort increased the generation of upward counterfactual thoughts. These findings support the theorizing of S. J. Sherman and McConnell (1995) that self-handicapping appears to be intended to increase the availability of upward counterfactual thoughts that identify the handicap as having prevented a better performance. This effect also supports norm theory, in that the presence of a clear obstacle to success is likely to be seen as \u201cabnormal\u201d (Kahneman & Miller, 1986) and thus more mutable. The finding that the increased availability of upward counterfactual thoughts can protect self-esteem following failure generates a number of interesting predictions concerning the effectiveness of different types of self-handicaps. Previous research has shown that counterfactuals, particularly when upward, are more likely to focus on controllable actions (Girotto, Legrenzi, & Rizzo, 1991; Markman et al., 1995; Roese & Olson, 1995c). Furthermore, selfhandicapping is related to prevention-based regulatory focus (Hendrix & Hirt, 2008), and a prevention focus in turn is linked to an increase in the mutability of actions relative to inactions (Roese, Hur, & Pennington, 1999). These findings suggest that selfhandicaps that involve a more active and controllable behavior (e.g., taking drugs or alcohol) may be more likely to elicit excusing counterfactuals than do uncontrollable or inactive handicaps (e.g., claiming lack of sleep). Indeed, the use of the induced compliance procedure in the present studies was designed to allow participants to generate upward counterfactual thoughts about a controllable self-handicap. On the other hand, such controllable, intentional handicaps are more likely to increase suspicion in others, rendering them less effective as impression-management strategies (Baumgardner & Levy, 1988; Hirt, McCrea, & Boris, 2003). It is not clear whether self-handicaps that are intentional are also less effective in self-protection. Self-handicaps may require a degree of selfdeception in order to protect self-esteem, such that individuals must convince themselves that the handicap was not intentional (Higgins & Berglas, 1990). If so, then controllable handicaps might actually be less effective in protecting self-esteem. These issues await further research."}, {"heading": "Consequences of Self-Handicapping and Counterfactual Thinking for Performance", "text": "One of the most intriguing aspects of the current research is the finding that excusing a poor performance undermines subsequent\nmotivation to improve in the future as well as actual future performance. The preparative benefits of counterfactual thinking have been linked to the identification of useful strategies (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Markman & McMullen, 2003; Roese, 1994; Roese & Olson, 1995b), increased self-efficacy and feelings of preparedness (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Markman et al., 1995; Tal-Or et al., 2004), and increased motivation driven by negative affect (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008). According to the reflection evaluation model (Markman & McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008), negative affect generated by upward counterfactual thinking is used as input into decisions of whether a goal has been reached. As a result, motivational and preparative benefits of upward counterfactuals are only observed when individuals process the thoughts in an evaluative mode and, as a result, experience increased negative affect (Markman et al., 2008). Consistent with this view, the present studies demonstrated that upward counterfactuals improve preparative behavior and performance only when they are not used to excuse a poor performance.\nOne slight difference between past studies (e.g., Markman et al., 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008) and those presented here is the role played by mood in the former and state self-esteem in the latter in determining subsequent motivation. Although further research is required to clarify these findings, one can tentatively suggest that the importance of the task for self-definition is critical here. The tasks in the present studies were designed to be ego threatening, whereas the tasks in earlier research (Markman et al., 2008; Myers & McCrea, 2008) were not. Thus, individuals may have viewed satisfaction with the self (rather than mood) as a more valid cue for motivation in the present studies.\nEpstude and Roese (2008) classify the mechanisms by which counterfactuals can influence behavior as reflecting a contentspecific pathway (i.e., increasing the specific behavior mentioned in the thought) or a content-neutral pathway (e.g., increasing motivation or self-efficacy). The results of the present studies seem to be most consistent with a content-neutral, motivational process. In contrast to a strict content-specific benefit, participants at times behaved in a manner completely at odds with the strategy mentioned in the thoughts. For example, participants in Study 4 were least likely to choose to listen to helpful noise for the subsequent test when they considered how the distracting noise had impaired their performance. It is also not the case that these effects can be easily explained by underlying changes in self-efficacy. Preparative effects and performance benefits were found in those conditions in which self-esteem was low. Future researchers should address the question of when counterfactuals influence performance via a content-specific pathway and when they influence performance via a content-neutral pathway, as well as to what extent these different mechanisms can work in tandem (Epstude & Roese, 2008). I am currently pursuing these issues in my laboratory.\nFinally, in addition to clarifying the process by which counterfactuals influence subsequent motivation and performance, the present results suggest that self-handicapping can impair long-term achievement by undermining subsequent motivation to improve. Such a mechanism has not been previously demonstrated in the self-handicapping literature. Empirical studies of the performance consequences of self-handicapping have yielded mixed results. Although self-handicapping likely reduces evaluation apprehen-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nsion and thus may benefit performance at times (Leary, 1986), handicaps involving a lack of preparation or impairment likely directly undermine performance (Elliot et al., 2006; McCrea & Hirt, 2001). Indeed, long-term academic performance seems to be negatively related to the tendency to self-handicap, in particular to reduced study effort (McCrea & Hirt, 2001; McCrea et al., in press; Urdan, 2004; Zuckerman et al., 1998). It has generally been assumed that such reduced study effort reflects ongoing selfhandicapping behavior (McCrea & Hirt, 2001; Zuckerman et al., 1998). However, the current studies suggest that merely blaming one\u2019s failure on a handicap can reduce subsequent motivation to prepare, resulting in worse performance. Thus, poor study effort and declining academic performance may reflect reduced motivation resulting from self-esteem protection. To the extent that individuals are unwilling to accept responsibility for their poor performance, they are unlikely to engage in self-improvement or apply any \u201clessons learned\u201d to a subsequent task. Indeed, a wider literature suggests that excuse-making and self-protection can undermine attempts to gain control over challenging situations and pursue important goals (Baumeister & Tice, 1985; Crocker, Brook, Niiya, & Villacorta, 2006; Rothbaum, Weisz, & Snyder, 1982). Researchers interested in the effects of self-handicapping on performance should therefore examine reduced motivation and task disengagement as possible causes of long-term performance impairment."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Past research on counterfactual thinking has emphasized the various functions for the individual that these thoughts can serve. Counterfactual thoughts have been argued to serve either a preparative function or an affective function. The present research demonstrates that upward counterfactual thoughts can excuse poor performances, consistent with an affective function, but at a cost to any preparative function. Particularly in the case of selfhandicapping, upward counterfactuals may allow individuals to continue to believe that they could have succeeded, yet make actual achievement less likely. In other words, upward counterfactuals offer self-handicappers the opportunity to be \u201clegends in their own minds,\u201d maintaining the belief that they have ability despite objective evidence to the contrary.\nReferences\nAiken, L.

Davies University of British Columbia, Okanagan\nRuth Ditlmann Yale University\nJennifer Randall Crosby Agnes Scott College\nThis research demonstrates that people at risk of devaluation based on group membership are attuned to cues that signal social identity contingencies\u2014 judgments, stereotypes, opportunities, restrictions, and treatments that are tied to one\u2019s social identity in a given setting. In 3 experiments, African American professionals were attuned to minority representation and diversity philosophy cues when they were presented as a part of workplace settings. Low minority representation cues coupled with colorblindness (as opposed to valuing diversity) led African American professionals to perceive threatening identity contingencies and to distrust the setting (Experiment 1). The authors then verified that the mechanism mediating the effect of setting cues on trust was identity contingent evaluations (Experiments 2 & 3). The power of social identity contingencies as they relate to underrepresented groups in mainstream institutions is discussed.\nKeywords: identity threat, African Americans, diversity, stigma\nDecades after colleges and universities across the country began actively recruiting minority students, many campuses are more diverse than ever. But that does not mean that students connect across racial and ethnic lines. . . . The whole discussion used to be about numbers. . . . Now it is about what kind of educational environment is in place.\n\u2014The New York Times\nThis description captures the predicament facing American mainstream institutions today. From university classrooms to corporate offices, institutions have become more demographically diverse (Mannix & Neale, 2005). Yet, a remaining challenge in realizing an integrated society is making these settings function so that people in them feel safe and trusting. For individuals whose identities have been historically devalued, these settings can prompt a basic question: How does one know whether one\u2019s social identity places one under threat?\nOur research begins with an assumption: Settings themselves have the power to signal the degree of threat or safety a person will experience. That is, certain features or cues in a setting may create the expectation that a person\u2019s treatment will be contingent on one of their social identities. Social identity contingencies are possible judgments, stereotypes, opportunities, restrictions, and treatments that are tied to one\u2019s social identity in a given setting (Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). Such cues as the number of individuals who share a given identity or the nature of the diversity philosophy at play are cues that might convey contingencies attached to particular social identities. Accordingly, these cues can determine\u2014independent of any personal experience in the setting\u2014the extent to which a person will trust and feel comfortable in a given setting.\nSubstantial progress has been made in detailing the consequences of contending with the threat of being judged through the\nValerie Purdie-Vaughns and Ruth Ditlmann, Department of Psychology, Yale University; Claude M.

Yet, considerably less is known about people\u2019s appraisal of what a given setting might be like further upstream, before they experience the setting directly. If aspects of a setting convey devaluation of one\u2019s group identity, a person may chose not to enter the setting or may leave before ever reaching the performance stage. Given the impairing effect of stereotype threat at the performance stage, a deeper understanding of which cues lead people to appraise settings as likely to be threatening or safe is desirable. Illuminating this process may establish how people come to sense a \u201cthreat in the air\u201d in settings where stereotypes about their group are relevant.\nThe first objective of the present research was to identify social identity contingencies that are relevant to African Americans\u2019 racial identity in corporate settings. Because corporate workplaces can be ambiguous with respect to whether African American identity is valued (Sinclair & Kunda, 1999), African Americans\u2019 beliefs and expectations may vary with small changes in cues relevant to the workplace. Our second objective was, therefore, to identify situational cues that are also relevant to African Americans\u2019 racial identity in the corporate workplace. The present research focused on the number of other minority group members in the setting and the diversity philosophy of the setting; that is, whether the setting stresses a principle of colorblindness or a principle of valuing diversity. Our final objective was to examine the types of identity contingencies that African Americans expected to face in response to the interaction of these cues and the implications of these expectations for African Americans\u2019 trust and feelings of comfort.\nIdentity-Threatening and Identity-Safe Settings\nPeople who belong to stigmatized groups may question whether their group is valued in mainstream settings (e.g., workplaces, schools, religious settings), especially in ones in which their group has been historically discriminated against or stereotyped (Allport, 1954; Major & O\u2019Brien, 2005; Steele et al., 2002). We use the term social identity contingencies to refer to the range of vulnerabilities and opportunities a person expects to face based on the settings\u2019 response to one or more of the person\u2019s social identities. When group members expect their social identity contingencies to be negative or to confirm that their group will be devalued, the setting can be characterized as threatening. When group members expect their social identity contingencies to be positive or neutral, the setting can be characterized as identity-safe. Accordingly, social identity contingencies convey the degree of threat or safety with which one perceives the setting.\nBecause people\u2019s concerns about their identity value are tied to specific settings (Goffman, 1963), group members draw information from situational cues that hold relevance for the value and the status accorded to their group. Situational cues can be physical\u2014 rows of Razor scooters outside an Internet company may be a cue for an \u201cold school\u201d programmer, ideological\u2014a competitive versus relational ethos in a science department may be a cue for a female scientist\u2014or social\u2014the presence of neighbors from the same small town may be a cue for an immigrant family. Any\nobject, event, person, or place that activates a particular social identity can be a situational cue (Abrams & Hogg, 1999; Goffman, 1971; Warr, 1990).\nThe central hypothesis we test is that situational cues trigger people\u2019s expectations about the kinds of social identity contingencies they may face, and these expectations affect whether people can trust and feel comfortable in a given setting. People trust settings that are impartial, that are consistent with a person\u2019s values, and that convey belongingness (Buchan, Croson, & Dawes, 2002; Tyler, 2001). Distrust of a setting undermines outcomes critical to success, such as motivation (Cohen, Steele, & Ross, 1999) and achievement (Irving & Hudley, 2005). These implications are consistent with identitythreatening and identity-safe environments.\nThe notion that situational cues have implications for social identity salience is supported by several lines of research. Goffman (1971) noted that people attend to cues that convey whether their immediate surroundings are normal or physically safe. Stereotype threat research shows that watching stereotypic television commercials (Davies et al., 2005), being outnumbered in a math classroom (Inzlicht & Ben-Zeev, 2000; Inzlicht & Good, 2006), or hearing a rumor about a sexist tutor (Adams, Garcia, PurdieVaughns, & Steele, 2006) are all cues that may cause underperformance in test-taking situations. It is also known that people attend to prejudice-relevant cues when making attributions of discrimination (Feldman-Barrett & Swim, 1998; Inman & Baron, 1996; Major, Quinton, & Schmader, 2003).\nIt is important to note that these findings emphasize the consequences of contending with cues after one has entered a setting and is performing some role-relevant behavior. The present investigation extends this past research in two significant ways. First, in the present research, we focus on individuals attending to situational cues to gauge whether threat is potentially on the horizon. Although researchers have theorized about how people appraise cues as they initially enter settings (for reviews, see Major & O\u2019Brien, 2005), empirical research establishing how threat is initiated at this early stage is lacking. Second, in the present research, we explore institutional cues rather than interpersonal ones. The cues we investigated are divorced from interpersonal interactions. One question relevant to stigmatization processes is what aspects of an environment convey threat in the absence of intentional discrimination. We suggest that the present research can help answer this question.\nSocial Identity Contingencies\nOur first objective was to identify possible social identity contingencies that are relevant to African Americans\u2019 racial identity in corporate settings. One set of contingencies may involve African Americans\u2019 concerns about confirming negative stereotypes about their intellectual ability. Negative stereotypes are one of many social identity contingencies (Steele et al., 2002). Another set may relate to expectations about the value of African American racial identity compared with other identities (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). In response to these contingencies, African Americans may develop expectations of discrimination or marginalization.\nHowever, there are also other, perhaps more subtle, social identity contingencies that may arise. A predominantly White corporate setting may lead African Americans to suspect that their\nidentity is merely different or counternormative (Kanter, 1977; Yoshino, 2006). As a consequence, African Americans may expect to face social exclusion if they fail to conform to established norms (Walton & Cohen, 2007) or to face added scrutiny due to the salience of their racial identity (McGuire, McGuire, Child, & Fujioko, 1978). However, contingencies are not necessarily always negative. African Americans may recognize that their racial identity is irrelevant or neutral in a given setting or is even positive in some respects\u2014for instance, if one\u2019s differentness creates positive visibility (Kanter, 1977). Threatening and positive contingencies may even be present simultaneously; in this case, it is the net effect of these countervailing weights that determines one\u2019s overall sense of trust and comfort in the setting.\nWhen situational cues convey threatening identity contingencies, or when threatening contingencies outweigh positive ones, we expect African Americans to distrust the setting. When cues refute threatening identity contingencies, however, or when positive contingencies outweigh threatening ones, we expect African Americans to trust the setting. We measured identity contingencies via participants\u2019 open-ended descriptions of the setting (Experiment 1), responses to diagnostic scenarios that may activate threat (Experiment 2), and measures assessing the degree to which racial identity is perceived to be relevant to others\u2019 evaluations and assessments (Experiment 3).\nCues Triggering Social Identity Contingencies\nOur second objective was to identify cues relevant to African Americans\u2019 racial identity in the corporate workplace and to test whether the cues activate or refute these social identity contingencies. The first cue we examined was the number of people in a setting who share a given social identity. High or low minority representation is identity-relevant for African Americans because it influences friendship networks (Kanter, 1977), hiring decisions (Yoder, Crumpton, & Zipp, 1989), token status (Lord & Saenz, 1985; Sekaquaptewa & Thompson, 2003), and performance (Inzlicht & Ben-Zeev, 2000)\u2014all factors that affect one\u2019s fate in the setting.\nWe expect that high minority representation will not activate threatening identity contingencies among African Americans. Numbers can serve as evidence of nondiscrimination, as well as evidence that one\u2019s identity is valued. In contrast, we expect low minority representation to cause one of two effects. On the one hand, it can activate threatening identity contingencies if African Americans perceive small numbers as conveying discrimination or marginalization. On the other hand, it can refute threatening identity contingencies if African Americans expected small numbers to be benign. For instance, if African Americans expected that their racial identity would be valued or would not be limited in the setting despite low minority representation (Kanter, 1977) then small numbers should be perceived as nonthreatening. Because low minority representation is open to both threatening and safe interpretations, African Americans may attend to additional cues\u2014such as the stated diversity philosophy\u2014to disambiguate its meaning.\nTwo prominent diversity philosophies represent opposing sides of America\u2019s debate concerning how to achieve positive intergroup relations: One is based on theories of assimilation, or colorblindness, and the other is based on theories of multiculturalism, or valuing diversity (Markus, Steele, & Steele, 2000; Plaut, 2002; Verkuyten, 2005; Wolsko, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2000).\nTheir prominence as equally well-intentioned guiding philosophies in workplace settings make them a rich second cue to explore.\nAssumptions underlying the colorblind philosophy include notions that people are universally similar and that group differences should be minimized1 (Levy, West, & Ramirez, 2005; Markus et al., 2000; Schofield, 1986). Traditionally, this philosophy has been invoked to reduce discrimination. Interpreted in this way, a colorblind diversity philosophy is not diagnostic of marginalization, and we expect this cue to refute African Americans\u2019 expectations of threatening identity contingencies. Yet, colorblindness can be interpreted in another way. Colorblindness can also be seen as a means to ignore or invalidate the challenges that come with stigmatized group identities (Bonilla-Silva, 2006). Interpreted in this way, a colorblind diversity philosophy is diagnostic of marginalization, and we expect this cue to activate threatening social identity contingencies.\nAssumptions underlying the value-diversity philosophy include notions that group differences should be the basis for mutual respect and that these differences should be valued (Fredrickson, 1999; Markus et al., 2000; Sears, Citrin, Cheleden, & van Laar, 1999). Interpreted in this way, we expect this cue to refute threatening identity contingencies. But like colorblindness, the valuediversity philosophy can also be interpreted in a different, more negative way. It could be taken to mean that minority group members will be valued only for their difference (Carter, 1991). Perhaps if African Americans already perceive a setting to be safe, then introducing messages that claim to value diversity may trigger this more negative interpretation.\nIn addition to examining the effects of each cue, a third objective of the present research is to explore how these two cues interact. Three models are relevant to the present analysis: a dominance model, a consistency model, and a dynamic interactive model.\nFirst, one cue may be so dominant as to overshadow the signal of the other cue. Given past research highlighting the centrality of minority representation to one\u2019s daily experiences, African Americans might attend to minority representation cues and discount diversity philosophy cues. If this is correct then regardless of an institution\u2019s stated diversity philosophy, African Americans should be more likely to expect threatening identity contingencies when exposed to low minority representation cues rather than high minority representation cues.\nSecond, inconsistent setting cues may be more threatening than consistent ones. People are more likely to attend to inconsistent and novel category conjunctions than to consistent and familiar conjunctions (Hutter & Crisp, 2005; see also, Kunda, 1990). From this reasoning, it would seem that low minority\n1 A brief discussion of colorblind philosophy versus assimilationist philosophy is warranted. Policies with a colorblind approach tend to emphasize personal identity and de-emphasize ethnic and racial categories (see Plaut, 2002; Schofield, 1986). Policies with an assimilationist approach tend to emphasize changing the behavior and beliefs of the minority group to blend in with the majority group (see Fredrickson, 1999; Verkuyten, 2005). We observed that corporate literature in the United States tends to frame corporations\u2019 diversity philosophy as colorblind (i.e., \u201crace, gender does not matter here\u201d) rather than as assimilationist (i.e., \u201cchange your group identity to be like us\u201d). Hence, the present research focuses on colorblindness rather than on assimilation.\nrepresentation coupled with a value-diversity philosophy would convey threatening identity contingencies. Presumably, these inconsistent cues indicate a form of hypocrisy that triggers concerns about the setting.\nThe third model allows for an interactive effect such that the perceived meaning of diversity philosophy cues may change depending on higher or lower levels of minority representation cues. Peoples\u2019 attitudes toward ideologies change in different social contexts, and this is particularly true of ideologies such as colorblindness, which are open to multiple interpretations (Levy et al., 2005). Applied to the current paradigm, the dynamic interactive model suggests that as minority representation changes from low to high, African Americans\u2019 appraisal of the colorblind cue may change from threatening to benign. Although the same effect is plausible for the value-diversity cue, its positive valence in corporate settings (Thomas, 2001) may make this cue more impervious to interactive effects.\nPresent Research\nIn the present experiments, we tested the postulated effect of minority representation and diversity philosophy cues on the kinds of social identity contingencies that African Americans expect to face in workplace settings. We exposed African American professionals to hypothetical corporate settings by developing corporate brochures and supplementing them with a corporate booth designed to look like a consulting firm on a recruiting trip. Minority representation was presented as the number of minority staff members included in brochure photographs. Diversity philosophy cues were presented as a quotation from the company president.\nThe purpose of Experiment 1 was to establish the kinds of social identity contingencies African Americans would spontaneously report. We also explored how cues might interact to convey identity contingencies and how expectations of these contingencies affected African Americans\u2019 trust and feelings of comfort. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the underlying mechanism mediating the effect of the stated cues on African Americans\u2019 trust is their expectations of negative identity contingencies. In Experiment 3, we tested one intervention that could alter the way African Americans interpret setting cues, and we examined whether this intervention neutralized threatening identity contingencies and restored African Americans\u2019 trust.\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, we exposed African American professionals to different combinations of minority representation and diversity philosophy cues. We tested whether these cues affected the kinds of identity contingencies African Americans generated and the implications for African Americans\u2019 trust and feelings of comfort. Participation in Experiments 1 and 2 were restricted to African Americans because other experiments consistently showed that the cues and the experimental paradigm under examination do not affect the trust and comfort levels of White Americans.2 Accordingly, this experiment took the form of a 2 (minority representation: high vs. low) 2 (diversity philosophy cue: colorblind vs. value-diversity) between-subjects factorial design.\nTo measure expectations of social identity contingencies, we used a qualitative methodology developed to assess cross-cultural\nidentity concerns (Tsai, 2001). Participants completed open-ended descriptions of concerns they expected to have in response to the workplace they read about. We were interested in the effect of condition on the overall number of identity contingencies participants reported and in the balance of threatening versus affirming identity contingencies. After completing open-ended descriptions, participants rated how much trust and comfort they anticipated feeling in the setting.\nThe dynamic interactive model predicts that African Americans\u2019 trust would diminish and that their expectations of social identity contingencies would increase when one cue changes the interpretation of other cues. Other models might predict that trust would diminish when cues are inconsistent or when one cue is dominant in the setting.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We recruited 62 African American professionals (40 women, 22 men) from an African American networking mixer in the San Francisco Bay area.

Next, two coders independently categorized the photographs as to whether minority group members were represented. Only photographs with 100% agreement by both coders were selected at this stage. Finally, photographs depicting higher or lower proportions of minorities were matched to be similar in group composition. This selection process identified 6 photographs: 3 that reliably depicted high minority representation and 3 that reliably depicted low minority representation. It is important to note that photographs depicted a broad range of demographic diversity (see Appendix A)."}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "Social identity contingencies.

This\ntechnique controls for variation in overall number of responses given by a participant (Kanagawa, Cross, & Markus, 2001; see also, Tsai, 2001). Participants provided an average of 7.23 response units and there were no significant differences in the number of responses provided across condition, (Fs 1). Percentages are presented in all text and tables.\nTo illustrate the kinds of responses African American professionals spontaneously reported, we examined the top five categories of free responses in order from highest to lowest frequency. The category with the highest frequency of responses was \u201cconcern about being devalued due to racial identity\u201d (M 17.81%, SD 21.29). This category reflected contingencies such as African Americans\u2019 expecting to be passed over for promotions, feeling excluded from social events, and feeling that their race would be relevant to how others view them. The category with the next highest frequency of responses was \u201cconcern about my potential job in the company\u201d (M 15.83%, SD 21.58), followed by \u201cskepticism about company diversity policies\u201d (M 12.68%, SD 19.56), \u201cconcern that the company is overly competitive\u201d (M 10.55%, SD 15.98), and \u201cpositive treatment in company due to racial identity\u201d (M 9.62%, SD 18.07). See Table 1 for all categories and percentages.\nIf minority representation and diversity philosophy cues convey the degree of threat or safety that one should expect in a given setting, then different combinations of these cues should lead African Americans to expect greater or fewer social identity contingencies. This hypothesis was tested by first subtracting the percentage of positive identity contingencies (category positive treatment by company due to racial identity) from the percentage of negative identity contingencies (category concern about being devalued due to racial identity). This technique is commonly used when computing the valence of a thought protocol (Maheswaran & Chaiken, 1991). Social identity contingency data were examined with a 2 (minority representation cue: high or low) 2 (diversity philosophy cue: colorblind or value-diversity) ANOVA. The results yielded only a significant interaction, F(1, 57) 8.88, p .004. When minority representation was high, participants in the colorblind condition expected relatively fewer threatening social identity contingencies (M 9.70%, SD 32.28) than did participants in the value-diversity condition, (M 14.30%, SD 26.83), F(1, 57) 5.31, p .02, 2 .09. But when minority representation was low, participants in the colorblind condition (M 24.63%, SD 27.38) expected relatively more threatening social identity contingencies than did participants in the valuediversity condition (M 5.00%, SD 27.32), F(1, 57) 3.64, p .058, 2 .06. The contrast testing the difference between the low minority representation and colorblind condition and all the other conditions was again consistent with the cue interactive model, F(1, 57) 6.09, p .02, 2 .10.\nFor exploratory purposes, we also tested whether African Americans\u2019 expectations of social identity contingencies mediated the effect of setting cues on trust. In a series of regression analyses recommended by Baron and Kenny (1986), participants who read about a company characterized by a low minority representation and a colorblind philosophy felt significantly less trust than did participants in the other three conditions, which did not differ significantly from one another, ( .59, t 5.61, p .001). Participants in the low minority representation and colorblind condition also reported relatively\nmore negative social identity contingencies than did participants in the other three groups, which again, did not differ significantly from one another, ( .30, t 2.39, p .02). However, in the final step, participants\u2019 social identity contingencies did not predict trust when controlling for the low minority representation and colorblind condition (t 1)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "For African American professionals, minority representation and diversity philosophy cues interacted to signal the degree of identity-contingent threat or safety that they expected to experience in corporate settings. These cues also affected their anticipated trust and feelings of comfort. When more minorities were depicted in the newsletter, participants were more likely to trust the company than when there were fewer minorities. Yet, when few minorities were depicted in the newsletter, participants in the colorblind condition felt less trust and comfort in the company setting than did participants in the value-diversity condition. Our analysis of trust ratings of participants in the low minority representation and colorblind condition versus ratings in the other three conditions revealed a trust gap of approximately 42%. African Americans\u2019 expectations of social identity contingencies did not mediate the effect of setting cues on trust in this experiment. We used open-ended responses to assess social identity contingencies, and this measure may have been insensitive to mediational analysis.\nIt is noteworthy that African Americans\u2019 expectations of social identity contingencies extended beyond the negative stereotypes about intellectual ability that have been the focus of much of the stereotype threat research. The qualitative responses of African American professionals focused largely on concerns about their degree of fit with the setting itself. For instance, one participant expected a mismatch between her values and the demands of the setting: \u201cFeeling pressure to go to a music club and really hating the music but not feeling comfortable enough to complain.\u201d Another participant explicitly mentioned treatment: \u201cMy main concern would be how they would treat people of color. This is a company about money and performance not ethics.\u201d Positive social identity contingencies focused on the absence of concerns in the setting; \u201cI would imagine a positive collaborative experience with individuals on the project teams.\u201d\nIt is interesting to note that participants in the high minority representation and value-diversity condition reported as many threatening identity contingencies as reported by participants in the low minority representation and colorblind condition. Again, the balance of positive and negative contingencies mattered. Just as low minority representation coupled with colorblindness can raise concerns, two seemingly positive cues may raise concerns about being valued only on the basis of one\u2019s identity. But, the difference between the two conditions appears to be that whereas in the high minority representation and value-diversity condition, one\u2019s race is salient, in the low minority representation and colorblind condition, only threats associated with one\u2019s identity are salient.\nFinally, the results of Experiment 1 provided clues about how situational cues might interact. Our findings are consistent with the cue interactive model. Once minority representation changed from large to small, African Americans\u2019 trust in a colorblind setting diminished and the number of threatening social identity contin-\ngencies increased because the meaning of colorblindness changed from affirming to threatening.\nExperiment 2\nThe purpose of Experiment 2 was to test whether expectations of threatening identity contingencies mediated the effect of colorblind and low minority representation cues on African Americans\u2019 trust. To assess identity contingencies, we drew from one of social stigma\u2019s classic paradigms: exposing participants to an attributionally ambiguous scenario (Crocker & Major, 1989) and testing whether only colorblind and low minority representation cues triggered identity-contingent devaluation. Specifically, participants learned that the company executive board dismissed an African American junior colleague while promoting a White senior colleague. The scenario was designed such that prior to cue exposure, participants were unsure whether the dismissal involved discrimination.\nOur interest was not in the consequences of perceiving a discriminatory cue on expectations of discrimination. Rather, our hypothesis was that cues that are seemingly irrelevant to overt prejudice\u2014in this paradigm, a setting with few minorities and a colorblind diversity philosophy\u2014would be enough to trigger expectations of discrimination. Accordingly, our primary dependent measure was expectations of identitycontingent devaluation in relation to the dismissal. We predicted that participants in the low minority representation and colorblind condition would show higher levels of concern that the dismissal was identity-contingent than would participants in any of the other conditions. We further predicted that expectations of identity-contingent devaluation would mediate the effect of setting cues on trust and feelings of comfort.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We recruited 60 African American professionals (42 women, 18 men) from the same African American networking mixer in the San Francisco Bay area (i.e., the same type of event at which Experiment 1 was conducted).

The trust gap between participants in this one condition and participants in the other three conditions was approximately\n32%, a finding similar to the gap found in Experiment 1. Moreover, participants in this condition were more likely to view a hypothetical situation in which an African American employee was fired as contingent on race than were participants in the other three conditions. These findings are striking given that the stated cues never explicitly mention prejudice. Yet, after exposure to this combination of cues, our participants anticipated that the setting would be threatening for themselves or for a member of their group. Finally, as predicted, participants\u2019 social identity contingencies mediated the link between setting cues and trust.\nExperiment 2 further established that the combination of cues we tested interacted because they invoked different meanings. For African Americans in corporate settings, the value-diversity cue has one meaning; it is identity-affirming. The colorblind diversity cue has two meanings; it conveys tolerance and intolerance (Levy et al., 2005). When minority representation was high, African Americans expected their identity to be irrelevant. When minority representation was low, they expected their identity to be contingent in a setting with a colorblind diversity philosophy but irrelevant in a setting with a value-diversity philosophy.\nExperiment 3\nIf, as Experiment 2 suggests, a colorblind philosophy conveys racial intolerance when paired with low minority representation, then neutralizing African Americans\u2019 concerns about such intolerance should reduce threatening identity contingencies and restore trust. The primary objective of Experiment 3 was to test this reasoning.\nIn this experiment, all participants (African American and White professionals) were presented with a setting depicting a low minority representation and a colorblind diversity philosophy. We developed a cue that conveyed either high or low fairness, using an ostensible independent auditing firm survey. When people are assured that procedures in a given setting are fair and that personal opinions are valued, people perceive the environment to be fair and just (for reviews, see Tyler & Huo, 2002). Accordingly, we manipulated high or low values for three items on the auditing survey (i.e., the company\u2019s decisions were based on merit, all people could be themselves and still be successful, the supervisor\u2019s decisions reflected company ideals). We reasoned that African Americans required objective and explicit evidence of fairness to offset the threatening interpretation of low minority representation and colorblind cues.\nIf this cue conveyed a broad message of fairness, then all groups should benefit from it. But if our setting cues activated contingencies tied to a minority identity then Whites should be unaffected by this manipulation. Accordingly, we included White professionals, resulting in a 2 (participant race: African American or White) 2 (fairness: high or low) between-subjects design. To address potential demand characteristics from the first two experiments, we ran Experiment 3 in a different location and used experimenters of various ethnicities.\nTo measure identity contingencies, participants assessed how much they expected their racial identity to be relevant to others\u2019 perceptions of them in the company. This was one identity contingency that African Americans commonly reported in Experiment 1. Participants next completed our measure of trust. Finally, we included three additional constructs that might inform our\ntheory and help to rule out alternative explanations. Two items measuring racial identity were included with the expectation that threatening cues would heighten the relevance of racial identity and safe cues would diminish its importance. Two items verifying that African American and White participants did not differ in their attitudes about the importance of fairness in the workplace or in their performance expectations were also included.\nWe predicted that the high fairness cue would reduce expectations of threatening identity contingencies and restore trust for African American professionals but not for White professionals. Further, we predicted that African Americans\u2019 reported identity contingencies should again mediate the effect of the stated cues on trust. Finally, for African American professional, but not for White professionals, we expect the high fairness cue to decrease the importance of racial identity and the low fairness cue to increase the importance of racial identity.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We recruited 90 African American and White working professionals from three coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay area and the greater New Haven, Connecticut area.

Indeed, the trust gap found in the previous two experiments was eliminated.\nAfrican American participants in the high fairness condition were also less likely to expect that their race would be relevant to how they were perceived by others. Replicating our findings from Experiment 2, these identity contingencies mediated the effect of the fairness cue on African Americans\u2019 trust of the corporate setting. White professionals showed no effect of the fairness condition. This finding is consistent with the assertion that our setting cues do not undermine feelings of trust and safety for White professionals in the way that these cues do for historically marginalized groups.\nIn sum, Experiment 3 is important because it helps explain why the low minority representation and colorblind cues convey threat. In response to these cues, African Americans expect that their race will be problematized. Here, the colorblind diversity cue is interpreted negatively, which activates expectations of threatening identity contingencies and undermines African Americans\u2019 institutional trust. But when an invocation of fairness allays their concerns, African Americans no longer expect that their identity will be problematized in the setting. The colorblind diversity cue here is interpreted positively. This interpretation does not activate threatening identity contingencies and maintains African Americans\u2019 feelings of trust and safety in the setting.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present investigation began with the idea that situational cues in a given setting convey one\u2019s social identity contingencies\u2014possible judgments, stereotypes, opportunities, restrictions, and treatments that are tied to one\u2019s social identity in a given\nsetting. When cues convey the threat of identity-contingent evaluations, trust in the setting can be undermined. When cues signal affirming contingencies or evaluations that are not identitycontingent, trust can be sustained. We tested the hypothesis that for African Americans, minority representation and diversity philosophy cues would interact to convey social identity contingencies, which in turn, would affect their trust. The three experiments we have presented support this reasoning.\nIn Experiment 1, we examined how setting cues triggered African Americans\u2019 spontaneous reports about the kinds of identity contingencies they expected to face in the workplace. When minority representation was low, African Americans who were exposed to colorblind cues reported the greatest number of threatening and the fewest number of affirming identity contingencies. Moreover, these cues diminished their trust. For all other combinations of cues, African Americans reported relatively fewer threatening identity contingencies, and their trust in the setting was sustained. In Experiment 2, African Americans read about a situation designed to diagnose their expectations of identity contingencies\u2014an attributionally ambiguous confrontation in the workplace. We tested whether the same cues\u2014small minority representation coupled with colorblindness\u2014would again convey more threatening identity contingencies than any other combination of cues. They did. These cues led African American professionals to expect that a confrontation in which an African American employee was fired was contingent on race. Moreover, identity-contingent evaluations mediated the effect of setting cues on trust.\nIn Experiment 3, we tested an intervention designed to refute expectations of threatening identity contingencies and to restore African Americans\u2019 trust. African American and White professionals were exposed to small minority representation and colorblind cues. Our results confirmed that for African Americans but not Whites, a simple yet powerful invocation of fairness effectively closed the trust gap despite exposure to negative setting cues. And, for African Americans, identity-contingent evaluations\u2014a measure assessing the degree to which their identity would be relevant to how others perceived them\u2014again mediated the effect of cues on trust. Taken together, these experiments show that features of mainstream settings can convey threatening identity contingencies among African Americans that manifest in lower trust and comfort in the setting. But these experiments also show that this sense of threat can be lifted and one\u2019s sense of trust restored, even when some of the cues in the setting still signal the need for vigilance."}, {"heading": "Consideration of Processes Underlying Cue Interaction", "text": "Our results suggest that when people face multiple situational cues, those indicating minority representation and the stated diversity philosophy interact. We proposed three models about how situational cues might convey threatening or affirming identity contingencies. Our results are most consistent with the notion that it was the ambiguity of the cues that led them to dynamically interact.\nLow minority representation may have been more ambiguous than high minority representation. Token status research shows that people may interpret a setting with few minorities as genuine or as merely symbolic (Kanter, 1977; Sekaquaptewa & Thompson, 2003). If African Americans perceived low minority representation\nas ambiguous then they would have interpreted it as symbolic\u2014 and thus identity-contingent\u2014when paired with colorblindness and as genuine\u2014and thus identity-irrelevant\u2014when paired with valuing diversity. Similarly, colorblindness may have been more ambiguous than the value-diversity philosophy. Public policy makers use colorblindness to endorse and to undermine policies such as affirmative action because it can convey either racial tolerance or intolerance, as noted previously (Glazer, 1997; Levy et al., 2005). If African Americans perceived colorblindness as ambiguous then they would have interpreted it as identitycontingent when paired with low minority representation and as identity-irrelevant when paired with high minority representation. Although we did not directly test this reasoning, our best assessment of how cues interacted is that low minority representation and colorblindness cues were sufficiently ambiguous for one cue to have changed the meaning of the other.\nOur analysis raises an important question: Does the model of cue interaction apply for all combinations of cues or only for ambiguous ones? To thoroughly answer this question, one might work toward developing a taxonomy of cues with different properties. Cues may vary in their degree of ambiguity, as well as in their strength, vividness, self-relevance, and relevance to a particular setting. Although this is beyond the scope of the present investigation, future research in this area would benefit greatly from an exploration of the general properties of cues."}, {"heading": "Identity Contingencies and Alternative Explanations", "text": "Some may argue that our findings reflect people\u2019s concerns about their future performance in potentially threatening settings, and low expectations about one\u2019s performance have been shown to affect performance, motivation, effort, and efficacy in academic and workplace settings (Bandura, 1977; Cadinu, Maass, Frigerio, Impagliazzo, & Latinotti, 2003; Stangor, Carr, & Kiang, 1998). Although both expectancy and identity contingency paradigms allow one to evaluate future probabilities, the processes they emphasize are substantially different. In performance expectation paradigms, people hold concerns about their ability to accomplish a specified task. In our identity contingency paradigm, setting cues activate expectations about how one may be treated. In the present experiments, participants were not evaluated on the basis of their performance nor were they ever under the impression that they would be. In addition, Experiment 3, which directly assessed performance expectations, revealed no differences by race or by condition in participants\u2019 expectations about their ability to perform in the setting.\nA second alternative explanation would be that the results were due to stereotype threat, especially insofar as our procedures involved assessments of threatening environments. Two considerations, we believe, distinguish stereotype threat from social identity contingencies. First, for stereotype threat process to occur, a person must be aware of the content of a negative stereotype and must engage in a behavior that may confirm the stereotype (Steele & Aronson, 1995). As we stated earlier, participants in our experiments never engaged in any behaviors relevant to the workplace setting about which they were briefed nor were they led to believe they would engage in behaviors where they risked being reduced to a stereotype. Negative stereotypes were relevant to our experimental settings, but we simply note that being perceived through\nthe lens of a negative stereotype is one of many different types of identity contingencies a person may face.\nSecond, research on stereotype threat seems to be of limited relevance in understanding our findings with respect to diversity ideologies. If African Americans were concerned with being judged stereotypically, than an ideology of colorblindness\u2014which emphasizes ignoring group memberships\u2014should allay these concerns. But to the extent that African Americans are attentive to cues signaling how they will be valued and treated, ignoring group membership is threatening when it implies that a setting values prototypicality or sameness. In workplaces where prototypical behaviors are often linked to American majority groups, colorblind cues should activate threat. This is precisely what occurred in the present experiments. Our finding that colorblindness can undermine trust\u2014though inconsistent with stereotype threat\u2014is quite consistent with our identity-contingency framework.\nIn our view, the notion that African Americans attend to setting cues that activate or refute identity contingencies is an initial stage that\u2014depending on the outcome of this process\u2014may give rise to stereotype threat. When situational cues do activate threatening identity contingencies, this type of setting may give rise to stereotype threat when is subject to evaluative tasks. For instance, African American professionals should show decrements in test performance when the minority representation is low and the diversity philosophy is colorblind but not when it is valuing of diversity. This is one direction we are currently investigating.\nWe believe that the current findings provide compelling new evidence for the role of setting cues in signaling the threat or the safety one may expect in a given setting. Each group at risk of devaluation holds a core set of identity-based concerns. Similar to Walter Mischel\u2019s (1973; Shoda, Mischel, & Wright, 1994) \u201cif . . . then\u201d personality dynamics, our social identity framework stems from an interaction between cues in the environment and group identity. Ongoing research in our laboratory, for instance, reveals that the identity contingencies of female professionals in corporate workplaces revolve around interpersonal power dynamics, whereas the identity contingencies of female scientists are similar to those of African Americans in corporate settings (i.e., fairness; Grewal & Purdie-Vaughns, 2007). Here, different settings give rise to different contingencies for professional women. In other studies, we have found that gay men are more attuned to social intimacy cues in corporate settings than are heterosexual ones (Sedlovskaya & Purdie-Vaughns, 2007). For sexual minorities, intimacy cues in corporate settings raise the possibility that one\u2019s sexual identity may be exposed and devalued. Following Goffman\u2019s (1971) recommendations, our framework suggests a research strategy for understanding the process of stigmatization among multiple groups at risk of devaluation. Engaging in close analysis of distinctive cues and identities may be an important next step to research on the social construction of stigmatization."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Issues for Future Research", "text": "It is worth noting limitations in the present research. First, the experiments depicted only corporate settings. It is possible that recent corporate scandals in American society (Bohnet & Meier, 2005) may have heightened African Americans\u2019 sense that corporate settings are ambiguous with respect to attitudes toward their racial group. This problem is balanced, we would argue, by the\nrecognition that the business domain is the largest employer of American citizens and is the most likely setting African Americans will face. Moreover, African Americans are more likely to obtain bachelor\u2019s degrees in business or law than in any other domain (Harvey & Anderson, 2005). A second limitation concerns the sample and recruitment method. Although an effort was made to randomly select African Americans at the networking events where Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted, restricting our recruited sample to participants who normally attend such events could limit the generalizability of our results. Experiment 3, however, which was conducted in a different field setting, had effects consistent with Experiments 1 and 2."}, {"heading": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "In closing, we return to questions with which we began. What might our research illuminate about settings where people from diverse backgrounds are likely to participate? How might such settings function to make everyone feel safe and trusting regardless of their group-based and personal differences? First, our research illuminates the challenges that diversity contexts may pose. Most schools and workplaces\u2014reflecting the broader society\u2014are saturated with cues that signal devaluation of certain social identities: for example, low minority representation, few individuals from underrepresented groups in positions of power, and curricula and practices that inadvertently marginalize certain group identities. Reducing identity-related threats that are rooted in the setting may therefore be the most effective intervention to improve intergroup relations. Second, we suggest, there is a need to recognize that no single factor is likely to relax identity-based threats for all groups engaged in the setting. Certain cues may make a situation identity-safe, but only when presented in the context of other cues in the setting.\nIn conclusion, our research demonstrates that a variety of cues may threaten a person based on group identity. We demonstrate that one\u2019s identity and contingencies that go with that identity are derived from social context. In this respect, then, there is the possibility of a solution. The experience of threatening identity contingencies can be reduced by small yet powerful changes in the setting that diminish both the threat and its perception.\nReferences\nAbrams, D., & Hogg, M.

Four-yearolds performed a task in which they saw a target (e.g., a split square, red on the left and green on the right) followed by a brief delay and thenwere asked to find the target in an array including the target, its reflection (e.g., red on the right and green on the left), and a square with a different geometric split. Errors were overwhelmingly reflections. This finding shows that the children failed to maintain color-location conjunctions. Performance improved when targets were accompanied by sentences specifying color and direction (e.g., \u2018\u2018the red is on the left\u2019\u2019), but not when the conjunction was highlighted using a nonlinguistic cue (e.g., flashing, pointing, changes in size), nor when sentences specified a nondirectional relationship (e.g., \u2018\u2018the red is touching the green\u2019\u2019). The relation between children\u2019s matching performance and their long-term knowledge of directional terms suggests two distinct mechanisms by which language can temporarily bridge delays, providing more stable representations.\nThere is a natural tension in the cognitive sciences between the view that cognitive systems are specialized and possibly modular and the fact that these systems regularly interact in everyday tasks. A paradigm case involves language and vision: The two systems have structures that are quite different, embodying different representational bases and computational properties, yet the systems obviously interact, as people can talk about what they see. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms underlying the interactions between language and vision, and even less is known about how they emerge during\ndevelopment. In this article, we report experiments showing that language serves at least one clear function as it interacts with the visual system: It can help maintain the conjunction of visual features\u2014color and location\u2014that is otherwise quite fragile.\nOur framework for thinking about language-vision interactions starts with Jackendoff\u2019s (1987) observation that although language and vision are specialized, each can enhance functions that are weak in the other. For example, language can naturally capture the distinction between a category exemplar (\u2018\u2018a chair\u2019\u2019) and a token of that category (\u2018\u2018my chair\u2019\u2019); vision can naturally capture the distinctions among geese, ducks, and swans (e.g., neck length). Thus, language and vision are complementary, each adding selectively to the expressive power of the other.\nUsing this framework, we tested the possibility that language enhances cognitive representations, affording additional expressive power beyond what vision alone provides. This possibility fits squarely within current debates about the effects of language on thought. Views range from strongly Whorfian, suggesting that language causes new kinds of representations in domains such as space and number (Carey, 2001; HermerVazquez, Spelke, & Katsnelson, 1999; Levinson, 1996), to strongly anti-Whorfian, suggesting that language merely reflects what people can already represent (Munnich & Landau, 2003; Papafragou, Massey, & Gleitman, 2002). Through our studies, we explored a third possibility: Language may temporarily enrich areas of visual representation that are fragile on their own. We considered a test case that is well known to vision scientists: the difficulty of forming and maintaining feature conjunctions (e.g., color and location). This process appears to require focused attention in adults (e.g., Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wheeler & Treisman, 2002). We asked whether language can play a role in forming or maintaining such conjunctions in young children, who have underdeveloped control of attention and for whom language may therefore play an especially crucial role.\nEvidence suggests that in adults, attention is required to form and maintain feature conjunctions.

The latter finding suggests that in conjunction search, individual items must be attended separately. More dramatic is the occasional failure to bind: When people observe a briefly presented display containing a red O next to a green L, they may mistakenly report that they have seen either a red L or a green O. Such illusory conjunctions reflect failure to bind color and shape, a process requiring active allocation of attention to the target\u2019s location (Treisman & Schmidt, 1982).\nIf attention is the mechanism for binding and maintaining feature conjunctions, then young children, who undergo prolonged development of attention (Ruff & Capozzoli, 2003), might bind features incorrectly more often than adults. Although we know of no direct evidence for illusory conjunctions in young children, binding color and location and maintaining such conjunctions may be difficult for them. Hoffman, Landau, and Pagani (2003) found that 6-year-olds given a complex matching task with targets that were internally split by color (e.g., red on the left and green on the right) often erroneously matched these targets to their reflections (e.g., green on the left and red on the right).\nLanguage might help children maintain such color-location conjunctions. Spivey, Tyler, Eberhard, and Tanenhaus (2001) showed that adults\u2019 performance in traditional conjunction search is modulated on-line by language. In that study, participants searched for targets defined by two features, for example, a red vertical line among green vertical and red horizontal lines. When participants heard a question instructing them what to look for (e.g., \u2018\u2018Is there a red vertical?\u2019\u2019) just prior to onset of the display, Spivey et al. found the standard increase in reaction time as set size increased. But this effect was reduced when the instructions were presented concurrently with the onset of the display. Spivey et al. argued that as soon as the color word was heard (e.g., \u2018\u2018red\u2019\u2019), participants narrowed their attention to items that had the named property (e.g., the red items), essentially creating an efficient search for a single feature (e.g., vertical orientation). Spivey et al. concluded that language can temporarily drive attention, thus modulating visual feature processing.\nLanguage might have especially pronounced effects in children. Smith and her colleagues argued that during word learning, language comes to automatically direct young children\u2019s attention to relevant object properties (e.g., Smith, Jones, & Landau, 1996). In this view, naming an object drives attention to that object. The same mechanism might also result in enhanced binding and maintenance of object-internal properties. Such a mechanism is similar to temporary deictic pointers (or indexes), which have been argued to powerfully modulate cognitive activities (Ballard, Hayhoe, Pook, & Rao, 1997; Pylyshyn, 2003).\nEncoding spatial relationships (e.g., color and location) might be especially susceptible to effects of language. Gentner (e.g., Loewenstein & Gentner, 2005) has proposed that relational la-\nbels invite children to extract abstract properties and relations, moving them away from analyses of single properties. For example, 3-year-olds match using object identity when instructed to look for \u2018\u2018the same\u2019\u2019 object, but match using relational (sizebased) concepts when instructed to look for \u2018\u2018the baby\u2019\u2019 (i.e., smallest) object (Ratterman & Gentner, 1998). Language could also be crucial to forming and maintaining visual property conjunctions that are fragile on their own.\nIn our experiments, we asked whether children experience failures to maintain feature conjunctions, whether language can play a role in strengthening these representations, and, if so, what aspects of language work and by what mechanism. We first asked whether labeling the target with an object name increases the likelihood of correctly binding and maintaining color and location.\nEXPERIMENT 1"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Twenty-four 4-year-olds (mean age5 4 years 6 months, range5 4 years 0 months through 5 years 0 months) were randomly assigned to a label (n 5 12) or a no-label (n 5 12) condition."}, {"heading": "Design, Stimuli, and Procedure", "text": "On each trial in the no-label condition (see Fig. 1a), one of eight different targets appeared at the top center of a computer screen.

Thus, hearing the location of the red part helped children select the target. How did this verbal information help? One possibility is that the children correctly represented the directional word on each trial (top, bottom, left, or right) and used this word plus their visual representation of the target\u2019s split to encode and retain the location of the red part over the delay. This explanationmight work for the terms top and bottom, but it does not work for left and right. In the production test, the children correctly produced top and bottom on 98.3% of the trials calling for these terms, and in the comprehension test, they placed the X in the correct location on 89.7% of the trials asking them to indicate the top or bottom. Thus, they knew the spatial meanings of these terms. However, the same children produced left and right correctly on only 64.3% of the trials in the production test calling for these terms, and placed the X in the correct location on only 66.5% of the trials asking them to indicate the right or left. Errors on left and right trials showed that the children\u2019s knowledge of these two terms included the correct (horizontal) axis, but not the direction: Left and right confusion errors accounted for 94% of the errors in production and 91% of the errors in comprehension.\nProduction was reliably worse for left and right than for top and bottom, t(21) 5 4.03, p < .01, prep > .96, d 5 1.25, as was comprehension, t(21) 5 3.54, p < .01, prep > .95, d 5 1.09. 2\nDid children use their long-term knowledge of the four directional terms to select the correct test item?

We return to this issue in Experiment 4.\nDirectional language helped children retain the color and location structure of the targets, but how? One possibility is that directional language drew attention to the red part and its location. If so, one might expect nonlinguistic attentional cues to work as well.

The failure of the nonlinguistic manipulations suggests that the language effects were not due to general attentional enhancement; the failure of the relational nondirectional terms (e.g., touching) suggests that the effects were specific to directional terms.\nWe suggest two possible mechanisms to account for these results. Both mechanisms entail the momentary use of language to enhance the maintenance of color-location combinations. We propose that some children used their long-term, stable knowledge of the directional terms to maintain the conjunctions of color and location. Although the children retained the geometric split (e.g., vertical) with or without language (as shown by the high percentage of trials on which either the match or the reflection was chosen in all conditions), children who also had strong knowledge of the directional terms and their syntax could use this knowledge to create a \u2018\u2018hybrid\u2019\u2019 representation that allowed both geometry and the color-location conjunction to be maintained over the 1-s delay. This mechanism would be shortlived in that it would operate solely to bridge the brief delay, but it would depend on long-term knowledge of the directional meanings of the terms. The linguistic representation would serve to represent the conjunction of color and location\u2014not well retained with vision alone\u2014but it would not be required to represent the geometry of the target (which was maintained with or without language).\nA different mechanism is required, however, to explain the performance of children who did not have strong knowledge of the terms, that is, those who knew that left and right were opposite ends of the horizontal axis, but did not know which end was which. We suggest that for these children, the directional terms may have acted as temporary directional pointers. When children saw the target and heard \u2018\u2018The red is on the left,\u2019\u2019 their (partial) understanding of left could have been temporarily matched to their current representation of the red part\u2019s location, in effect, telling them which direction was left. This representation\u2014again temporary\u2014could have been used to bridge the delay, allowing a correct match. Ten minutes later, when these\nchildren were given the production and comprehension tasks, this representation was gone, resulting in failure to distinguish between left and right.\nBoth of these mechanisms suggest that language and vision can interact to create powerful but temporary hybrid representational schemes. These schemes were used to augment the representation of the target in the context of the task, working to maintain the conjunction of color and location in the moment of test.\nOur proposed mechanisms are consistent with recent findings showing that language provides a powerful but temporary modulation of attention (Smith et al., 1996; Spivey et al., 2001), and also consistent with the growing recognition that many cognitive functions are mediated by temporary \u2018\u2018pointers\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018indexes\u2019\u2019 that can enhance performance, especially by reducing the burden of visual-spatial memory (Ballard et al., 1997; Pylyshyn, 2003). The fact that our nonlinguistic manipulations did not have the same effects as language suggests that language provides a particularly powerful means of encoding and carrying forward visual information, at least in children. We do not know whether this is also true for adults; however, preliminary findings in our lab show that verbal shadowing in this task drives adults\u2019 performance down to that of 4-year-olds, with the same predominance of errors of reflection. This suggests that language might be automatically and obligatorily recruited in adults when they perform tasks such as ours, a notion that is consistent with other findings supporting the idea that adults automatically use language in complex cognitive tasks (e.g., Spelke & Tsivkin, 2001). Over development, language may become an obligatory driver of attention, fostering selective but temporary encoding of certain properties of the world (see Landau, Dessalegn, & Goldberg, in press, for discussion).\nOur broader conclusions point to a resolution of some current issues regarding language and thought. We take a position consistent with a strongly anti-Whorfian view and suggest that for children to use the language of left and right correctly, they must first be able to represent these directions nonlinguistically.\n194 Volume 19\u2014Number 2\nat NANYANG TECH UNIV LIBRARY on May 26, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nLanguage can maintain only what is already represented. However, our findings suggest that using language to enrich a visual representation might really enhance one\u2019s capabilities. Our specific example is limited, but it opens up the possibility that many so-called Whorfian effects are, in fact, effects of the temporary modulation of attention through language.

The prevalent view of automaticity and control implies that an unconscious mode of goal pursuit can only reproduce formerly learned actions, and therefore that its usefulness in novel environments is very limited. Our results demonstrate that this conclusion is not always warranted, as nonconscious goal pursuit facilitated participants\u2019 learning of the structure of completely novel environments. Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism\u2019s nonconscious goals.\nTo what degree can people count on unconscious processes to pilot them toward the future they desire, that is, toward their goals? Successfully attaining one\u2019s goals (defined here as desired end states) depends critically on one\u2019s sensitivity to the ever-changing environment and its affordances. Because of the environment\u2019s complexity, however, the crucial task of identifying goal-relevant structures is far from trivial. In the study reported in this article, we examined whether nonconscious goal pursuit (NCGP) can increase the likelihood of learning goalrelevant structures in the environment, thereby boosting the likelihood of goal attainment.\nOne answer to the question we have posed may come from recent dual-system models of reasoning. These models share an all-encompassing assumption that there are two qualitatively\ndifferent mental systems, one that is associative and one that is rule based (e.g., Evans, 2003; Sloman, 1996; Strack & Deutsch, 2004; but see Keren & Schul, 2007; Osman, 2004). The rulebased system has the ability to reason, deliberate, formulate strategies, and pursue them, and is generally assumed to require consciousness and mental resources. The associative system, in contrast, is assumed to operate automatically, triggering elements from past experience by way of spreading activation.\nGiven these pervasive models, it seems natural to conclude that consciously controlled goal pursuit is delegated to the rulebased system, and hence this form of goal pursuit is viewed as productive, deliberative, and flexible, and as involving intention and conscious monitoring (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2002). Similarly natural is the conclusion that NCGP is delegated to the associative system, and hence this form of goal pursuit is viewed as reproductive, unintentional, and inflexible. Indeed, this is the spirit of recent models of NCGP (e.g., Bargh, 1990; Kruglanski et al., 2002), which adopt the theoretical view that NCGP is based on unintentional and nonconscious reproductions of past associations. Put differently, these models assume that a nonconscious goal can trigger an action (broadly defined) if that action has formerly been chosen to attain that goal.\nAccordingly, the lion\u2019s share of past research on NCGP has concentrated on overlearned (i.e., strongly associated) means and goals. For example, Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, and Troetschel (2001) found that people who had been primed with the goal of achievement invested more effort than those who had not been so primed (see also Stajkovic, Locke, & Blair, 2006); Aarts, Gollwitzer, and Hassin (2004) found an increase in the help given to people of the opposite sex when the goal of obtaining sex was activated; and Fishbach, Friedman, and Kruglanski (2003) found that people were more likely to refrain from sweet temptations when the goal of dieting was indirectly triggered than when no goal was triggered.\nStill, given the dynamic nature of human environments (whether in the physical, the social, or the mental realm), strictly Address correspondence to Baruch Eitam, Ran R.

For a system that is very limited in its conscious processing ability (Kahneman, 1973) yet hasmany concurrent goals, such a limitationmay even be detrimental. Our study, then, examined whether this restriction on NCGP can be rejected. Are nonconscious goals beneficial in situations that require mastering novel environments?"}, {"heading": "THE PRESENT RESEARCH", "text": "Based on the arguments we have just discussed, our general hypothesis was that NCGP can help people achieve their goals even in novel environments, that is, in environments with which they have no prior experience. In particular, we investigated the hypothesis that NCGP can facilitate learning the structure of novel environments. To do this, we examined how NCGP influences performance on implicit-learning tasks.\nResearch on implicit learning has established that humans can learn and use complex patterns of information without intending to learn them and without being aware of the patterns (e.g., Nissen & Bullemer, 1987; Reber, 1967, 1993; for a recent review, see Frensch & Ru\u0308nger, 2003). In fact, humans\u2019 ability to learn relations implicitly seems to exceed their ability to process this type of information consciously (cf. Halford, Baker, McCredden, & Bain, 2005).\nTraditionally, implicit learning was assumed to be a bottomup, unselective, data-driven process (e.g., Cleeremans, 1993; Hayes & Broadbent, 1988). Therefore, researchers assumed it was not influenced by an individual\u2019s goals (cf. Lewicki, Hill, & Czyzewska, 1992). Recent evidence, however, suggests that selective attentionmay play a role in implicit learning (Jiang&Chun, 2003; Jime\u0301nez & Me\u0301ndez, 1999; Turk-Browne, Junge, & Scholl, 2005). These findings, together with the conjecture that attention is influenced by goal-driven prioritization of information processing (e.g., Eriksen & Hoffman, 1972; Posner, 1980), suggest to us that implicit learning could be affected by the organism\u2019s NCGPs.\nWe hypothesized that NCGP can enhance implicit learning and conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. In both, we examined whether priming an achievement goal affected performance on an implicit-learning task. To prime this goal, we used the \u2018\u2018unrelated experiments\u2019\u2019 paradigm (Chartrand & Bargh, 1996). Briefly, following completion of a first \u2018\u2018experiment\u2019\u2019 (in actuality, a goal-priming procedure), participants were presented with \u2018\u2018the second experiment\u2019\u2019\u2014an implicit-learning task.\nEXPERIMENT 1: LEARNING TO CONTROL A DYNAMIC SYSTEM"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Fifty-one Hebrew University undergraduates participated in the experiment in exchange for course credit or pay. They were run\nindividually and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: priming or control."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Upon arriving at the lab, participants were informed that the experimental session consisted of two \u2018\u2018unrelated experiments.\u2019\u2019 The first was introduced as a pilot test in which participants were asked to perform a word-search task. Specifically, participants were given a 10 10 array of letters in which they had to search for 13 target words. In the goal-priming condition, 7 of these words were associated with achievement (ambitious, aspiration, competition, excellence, first, race, andwin). In the control condition, these words were replaced by motivationally neutral ones (carpet, diamond, farm, hat, table, topaz, and window). After completing this task, participants in both groups were thanked and introduced to what was described as the second experiment, in which they were given an implicit-learning task.\nImplicit-Learning Task. The task was modeled after one used by Berry and Broadbent (1984, Experiment 1). A simulation of a dynamic system was presented to participants as a sugar factory, and in each of the 60 trials, participants were asked to reach a production level of 9,000 T of sugar by controlling the number of employees in the factory. Critically, participants were not given the rule that relates the number of employees to sugar production.1 Because the system was dynamic, learning was a necessary condition for attaining the target production value consistently. Participants in past research showed a gradual improvement in their ability to reach the target\u2014that is, they showed learning\u2014but could not fully verbalize the nature of the relationship even after hundreds of trials (e.g., Stanley, Mathews, Buss, & Kotler-Cope, 1989). For this reason, learning in this task is considered largely implicit.\nAwareness Probes. After participants completed the implicitlearning task, we assessed their knowledge of the relation between the number of employees and the factory\u2019s production (henceforth, the structure). Previous research with this paradigm utilized two different methods of assessing knowledge (e.g., Berry & Broadbent, 1984, 1987), and we used both. First, we asked participants to describe, in their own words, what determined sugar production. They were offered a monetary bonus for a correct description. These descriptions were scored on the following scale: 05 no knowledge, 15 partial knowledge, 25 complete knowledge. Next, participants were given five prediction problems. Each provided information about the current production and number of employees and the required target production for the next trial. The task was to determine the number of employees needed to achieve the target. Participants\n1If n is the current trial, then the rule relating the number of employees to production of sugar was {2 [number of employees on trial n] [tons of sugar on trial n 1] 1 noise}, where the noise was equal to 1,000 times 1, 0, or 1 (chosen randomly).\n262 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat EMORY UNIV on April 19, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nwith perfect knowledge of the rule should have been completely successful. Therefore, this measure of explicit knowledge ranged from 0 (no correct answer) to 5 (all answers correct).\nParticipants also answered items about their motivation. Two of these items assessed their explicit motivation to perform the task: \u2018\u2018How important was it for you to succeed in this task?\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018How important was it for you to find a strategy that would allow you to control the factory?\u2019\u2019 The third item assessed participants\u2019 intention to learn the structure by asking them how important it was to \u2018\u2018learn the rule by which the factory operated.\u2019\u2019 Ratings were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important).\nFinally, three items assessed whether participants believed the cover story, and whether they had any suspicion regarding the priming manipulation. First, they were asked to speculate, in their own words, on \u2018\u2018the purpose of the word-search task\u2019\u2019 (which served as the priming manipulation). Next, they were asked \u2018\u2018whether there was anything noteworthy in the wordsearch task,\u2019\u2019 and last, they were asked directly whether the word-search task had affected their performance on the sugarfactory task in any way."}, {"heading": "Measure of Learning", "text": "As the sugar-factory paradigm introduces a completely novel environment, all participants begin the task with equal ignorance. Given that this environment is dynamic, one\u2019s level of performance depends on one\u2019s depth of learning.

Many studies using this task have demonstrated that people can learn complex sequences without intending to learn them and without being aware of having done so (e.g., Seger, 1997).

They were run individually and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: priming or control."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Participants started with a goal-priming procedure that was identical to that in Experiment 1. They were then introduced to the SRT task.\nSRTTask. In each trial of the SRT task, participants were shown a circle that appeared in one of four possible locations on a horizontal line on a computer screen. They were instructed to indicate the circle\u2019s location by pressing one of four keys (\u2018\u20183,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u20185,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u20187,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u20189\u2019\u2019). The circle disappeared immediately after the response, and the next circle appeared 200ms later. An error was signaled by a red \u2018\u2018X\u2019\u2019 that appeared in the center of the screen and remained until the participant responded correctly.\nThe task began with a practice block in which the location of the circle was randomly determined. The purpose of this block was to familiarize participants with the task and to discourage them from attempting to learn the sequence explicitly (cf. Reed & Johnson, 1994; Seger, 1997). Next, participants underwent four training blocks. Critically, in these blocks, the sequence of locations in which the circle appeared was fixed. (If \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 indicates the left-most location and \u2018\u20184\u2019\u2019 the right-most, the sequence was 1324323432; see Stadler, 1992). This sequence was repeated five times per block. All blocks were 50 trials long.\nFollowing the four training blocks, participants engaged in three test blocks (50 trials each). In the first and third blocks (henceforth, random blocks), the locations of the circle were randomly determined.2 In the second test block, however, locations followed the fixed sequence used during learning (cf. Seger, 1997).\nIn this paradigm, participants are instructed tomerely react to the individual circles. Nothing in the instructions or the explicit structure of the task indicates the existence of a learnable underlying structure. Hence, learning in this paradigm is considered unintentional.\nAwareness Probes. After participants completed the SRT task, we assessed their awareness and explicit knowledge of the learned sequence. First, they were asked to describe the sequence in their own words (Seger, 1997). These verbal descriptions were scored using slight modifications of Seger\u2019s (1997) scoring criteria. Then, after being informed that the locations were displayed in a fixed sequence, participants were requested to generate a sequence of 10 locations that would follow the fixed sequence (cf. Destrebecqz & Cleeremans, 2001). These locations were indicated graphically. A computerized scoring algorithm assessed the level of fit between each of the generated sequences and the actual sequence used in the training blocks, yielding a knowledge score that ranged from 0 (no knowledge) to 10 (full knowledge).3\nThree items assessed participants\u2019 explicit achievement motivation. First, they were asked to rate how important it was for them to respond quickly. Second, they were asked to rate how important it was for them to respond accurately. A third item asked participants how important it was for them to succeed. A fourth item assessed participants\u2019 intention to learn the sequence, asking how important it was for them to \u2018\u2018learn the rule by which the stimulus locations were determined.\u2019\u2019 All ratings were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important).\nIn addition, participants answered questions measuring their awareness of the goal priming.

As in Experiment 1, participants\u2019 improved learning in the priming condition was not accompanied by an increase in their motivation or in their explicit knowledge.\nTraditionally, implicit learning was considered to be an automatic, unintentional process that is blind to the organism\u2019s goals. In other words, researchers assumed that one implicitly learns structures of the environment whether or not these structures are relevant to one\u2019s goals (e.g., Hayes &Broadbent, 1988). Recently, however, this view has been challenged: It has been shown that implicit learning occurs only for goal-relevant dimensions (Eitam, Schul, & Hassin, 2007; Jime\u0301nez & Me\u0301ndez, 1999; Turk-Browne et al., 2005; see also Frensch & Ru\u0308nger, 2003). The current results lend further support to the emerging view that implicit learning is a motivated process: We manipulated an internal state and showed that implicit learning is affected by the organism\u2019s goals.\nHow do goals affect implicit learning? Currently, few studies provide data to guide an answer to this question, but we offer the following speculation. Past research has suggested that attention plays a role in implicit learning (Jime\u0301nez &Me\u0301ndez, 1999; TurkBrowne et al., 2005; but see Jiang & Leung, 2005). We speculate, therefore, that NCGP of the kind we examined here has access to the regulation of attention, so that processing of goalrelevant information is prioritized. Future research should examine this possibility, and test whether the cognitive system actively searches for goal-relevant structures in the environment and whether such structures are prioritized after being identified as goal relevant.\nWewould like to emphasize two theoretical implications of the current results. First, the results suggest that current models of NCGP should be expanded in a way that will allow them to go beyond reproduction of past associations. Although the current results suggest that NCGP can recruit implicit-learning mechanisms, the exact nature of this recruitment\u2014and hence, the exact nature of the proposed expansion\u2014awaits further investigation. Furthermore, it may well be the case that implicit learning is not the only way in which NCGP can enhance adaptation to changing environments (cf. Hassin, Bargh, & Zimerman, in press). Some of us have previously argued that NCGP can recruit working memory (Hassin, 2005; Hassin, Aarts, Eitam, Kleiman, & Custers, in press).\nSecond, our results suggest that NCGP, which has traditionally been ascribed to the associative reasoning system, can perform functions ascribed to the rule-based system. This suggests that the demarcation between the rule-based and associative systems may not be as clear as previously thought, and calls into question the usefulness of that dichotomy.\nTo conclude, the results of these two experiments reveal an unconscious process that has both an advantage over conscious processing and an ability to serve the organism\u2019s current goals. Such unconscious processes may be responsible for far more of human ability than is yet recognized.\nAcknowledgments\u2014The article is based on parts of the first\nauthor\u2019s dissertation, which was supported by a Golda Meir\nfellowship to the first author and by Israeli Science Foundation\nGrants 846/03 and 1035/07 to R.R.H. and Grant 371/04 to\nY.S.

Men perceive more sexual intent in women\u2019s behavior than women perceive or report intending to convey. Although this finding has been attributed to gender differences in the threshold for labeling ambiguous cues as sexual in nature, little research has been conducted to determine etiology. Using a model that differentiates perceptual sensitivity from decisional bias, we found no evidence that men have lenient thresholds for perceiving women\u2019s nonverbal behavior as indicating sexual interest. Rather, gender differences were captured by a relative perceptual insensitivity among men. Just as in previous studies, men were more likely than women to misperceive friendliness as sexual interest, but they also were quite likely to misperceive sexual interest as friendliness. The results point to the promise of computational models of perception in increasing the understanding of clinically relevant social processes.\nDecoding sexual intent is an arguably difficult task, particularly if the perceiver hopes to decode intent early in an interaction. Women may smile, sustain eye contact, increase physical proximity, or touch their partner to convey romantic or sexual interest. However, all of these cues also could be used to convey simple warmth, friendliness, or platonic interest. Given ambiguity in separating sexual interest from platonic interest and the\noverlapping nonverbal cues used to signal these two kinds of interest, it should come as no surprise that individuals often disagree about the meaning of nonverbal sexual signals. In particular, men often disagree with women about the presence or degree of women\u2019s sexual intent (see Farris, Treat, Viken, & McFall, 2008, for a review). Men consistently rate female targets as intending to convey a greater degree of sexual interest than do women who rate the same targets\u2014a finding that has been remarkably consistent across studies ranging from those using still photographs and video vignettes to those using live, unscripted interactions (e.g., Abbey, 1982; Abbey & Melby, 1986; Shotland & Craig, 1988). This gender difference in ratings of sexual intent is stable, is readily replicable, and has a medium effect size (Farris et al., 2008).\nThe effect is not confined to the lab. In a large survey of university women, 67% reported that they had experienced an incident in which a male acquaintance misperceived their friendliness to be an indication of sexual interest, and 26% reported that such an event had occurred within the past month (Abbey, 1987; see also Haselton, 2003). In most cases, the negative consequences of sexual misperception will not extend beyond minor social discomfort. However, among a subgroup of individuals, sexual misperception may play an etiological role in the process that ultimately leads to sexual coercion. Sexually coercive men are more likely than noncoercive men to report incidents of sexual misperception (Abbey & McAuslan, 2004; Abbey, McAuslan, & Ross, 1998). Thus, understanding the etiology of gender differences in perception of sexual intent may provide insight into the origins of this normative effect and also inform efforts aimed at preventing sexual coercion.\nTwo main theories have been offered to explain the source of these observed gender differences. The first is a decisionalAddress correspondence to Coreen Farris, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, 1101 E. 10th St., Bloomington, IN 47405, e-mail: cofaris@indiana.edu.\n348 Volume 19\u2014Number 4Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science\nthreshold (or bias) theory, according to which men require fewer impelling cues than women before labeling a woman\u2019s behavior as sexual (Haselton & Nettle, 2006; Koukounas & Letch, 2001; Shotland & Craig, 1988). In this interpretation, men and women perceive the same positive behavioral cues, but men are more likely to label those cues as indicative of sexual interest because they have a more lenient decisional threshold than women do. Women are assumed to wait for more compelling sexual-interest cues before being willing to apply the label of sexual interest. It has been suggested that men may develop lenient thresholds for sexual interest through socialization processes that encourage men to be sexually avid and dominant (Abbey, 1982). Evolutionary psychologists have also been strong proponents of a bias interpretation of gender differences in perception of sexual interest, suggesting that it would have been sexually adaptive for men to have a low threshold for detecting probable or even possible mating partners (Haselton & Buss, 2000).\nThe second theory regarding the source of the gender difference posits that men misperceive sexual interest not because they have a low threshold for labeling sexual interest, but rather because they are less sensitive to women\u2019s nonverbal cues than women are and find it perceptually difficult to differentiate the subtle cues that discriminate women\u2019s sexual interest from their platonic interest (Abbey & Harnish, 1995, p. 298; Farris et al., 2008). This theory places men\u2019s performance in perception of sexual interest within the broader context of studies demonstrating that compared with women, men are less sensitive to emotional signaling across a broad range of affect categories (Hall, 1978; McClure, 2000). Such insensitivity may be particularly relevant among young men who are just entering the dating system, and therefore may not have acquired the experience necessary to reliably and accurately discriminate between women\u2019s platonicand sexual-interest cues. If differences in sensitivity to intent describe the perceptual process by which men\u2019s and women\u2019s judgments come to differ, then one would expect that compared with women, men would make more decisional errors in both directions; that is, they not only would be more likely to mistake women\u2019s friendliness for sexual interest, but also would be more likely to mistake women\u2019s sexual interest for friendliness.\nDespite strong theory and empirical interest in this area, the underlying source of observed gender differences in sexual perception has never been empirically measured and tested. Fortunately, measurement models capable of determining if gender differences in classification patterns reflect bias differences in decisional thresholds or relative insensitivity to different affective categories can be readily translated from simple perception applications in cognitive science. In fact, the implementation of these models in clinical cognitive science is part of a general movement to translate cognitive models in order to be more quantitatively and theoretically explicit about socially and clinically relevant processes (e.g., McFall & Treat, 1999; Neufeld, 2007). Luce\u2019s choice model (Luce, 1959, 1963; Macmillan & Creelman, 2004), closely aligned with the more com-\nmonly utilized signal detection theory (SDT; Green & Swets, 1966), provides a simple, computational model that matches the current needs of the field. It provides two parameter estimates that model the perceptual and decisional mechanisms that underlie previously documented gender differences in judgments about women\u2019s interest. Fitting the model to participants\u2019 identification data provides separate estimates of decisional bias and perceptual sensitivity for each individual. By collapsing individual estimates across gender, one can assess the separate contributions of bias and sensitivity to the observed gender differences in identification.\nIn the current study, we sought first to replicate the finding that men are more likely than women to misperceive women\u2019s friendliness as sexual interest. Provided this historically stable empirical result was replicated in our data, we sought to extend the analysis by modeling the underlying source of the gender difference using Luce\u2019s (1959) choice model. Given that formal computational models have never been employed to parse the source of the gender difference, and given that strong theoretical context supports both bias and sensitivity explanations, we approached the research from an exploratory perspective, with an emphasis on methodology capable of uncovering support for one or both theories. In addition, we examined men\u2019s and women\u2019s response to women\u2019s negative nonverbal cues in order to provide a dating-relevant counterpoint that would help clarify the specificity versus generalizability of any gender differences in the perception of women\u2019s nonverbal cues."}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Two hundred eighty heterosexual undergraduate men (63.6%) and women (36.4%) participated in exchange for course credit.

Initially, a sample of 497 undergraduate men provided normative ratings of 1,127 images of undergraduate women who displayed a variety of emotions and wore different clothing styles. The men used 7-point scales to rate how friendly, sexually interested, sad, rejecting, attractive, and provocatively dressed each woman was. Those images rated above the median on the scales of interest were retained for consideration. From this group, we selected images such that approximately half of the retained images were rated above the midpoint for provocative dress. Note that the women in the photos were instructed to select clothing from their own wardrobes; therefore, the variance along the clothing-style continuum is representative of the range of clothing styles that a college student would observe among his or her peers.\nAs the final step in generating the photo set, we asked a new sample of undergraduates (80 men and 80 women) to categorize the women in the photographs as friendly, sexually interested, sad, or rejecting. A photograph was retained if the majority of men and the majority of women categorized the picture into the same affect group. We used a majority criterion, rather than a strong-consensus criterion, to ensure some variability within each category, as variability is required to model the theoretically relevant perception parameters. Finally, in selecting the photographs to be used in the experiment, we examined attractiveness ratings from the original normative sample and ensured that attractiveness was held constant across the four target types. The final set of 280 photographs consisted of 70 images in each of the four affect categories."}, {"heading": "Analysis", "text": "Choice-model parameters, sensitivity and bias, were estimated for each participant individually (see Luce, 1959, 1963; Macmillan & Creelman, 2004, pp. 95\u201397, 247\u2013250). The sensitivity parameter a provides a quantitative estimate of an observer\u2019s ability to perceptually distinguish between categories. It is computed as follows:\na \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi H\u00f01 FA\u00de \u00f01 H\u00deFA s ;\nwhere H is the proportion of hits (i.e., the probability of correctly identifying the target) and FA is the proportion of false alarms (i.e., the probability of incorrectly identifying a nontarget as the target). The formula essentially computes a ratio of correct responses to incorrect responses, and thus the value of alpha increases positively as discrimination improves. This general formula is modified for forced-choice tasks with two or more alternatives, such as the identification task we used. For the current study, ln(a) was used to estimate sensitivity:\nln\u00f0a\u00de \u00bc ln Q P\u00f0RijSi\u00de P\u00f0RjjSi\u00de h i ffiffiffi 2 p m\u00f0m 1\u00de ;\nwhere m is the number of response categories, P(Ri|Si) is the probability of a correct response to stimulus i, and P(Rj|Si) is the probability of an incorrect response to stimulus i. Ln(a) is zero when the participant is wholly unable to perceive the category structure and increases positively as sensitivity improves. In our stimulus set, near-perfect sensitivity would correspond to an estimate of 4.63. We calculated four sensitivity estimates, one corresponding to each of the four affect categories (the participant\u2019s ability to discriminate friendliness from all other categories, sexual interest from all other categories, etc.). Readers more comfortable interpreting sensitivity within a signal detection framework may find it helpful to approximate the SDT sensitivity parameter (d0) by dividing ln(a) by 0.81 (Macmillan & Creelman, 2004).\nThe bias parameter quantifies an observer\u2019s response prefer-\nence. The general formula is as follows:\nb \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u00f01 H\u00de\u00f01 FA\u00de\nH\u00f0FA\u00de\ns :\nThus, b is the ratio of the observer\u2019s tendency to use one response over another. For identification tasks with more than two response categories, bias can be computed as a ratio between two response tendencies (Macmillan & Creelman, 2004). We chose to examine the theoretically relevant pairs friendly versus sexually interested (positive affect) and sad versus rejecting (negative affect). The bias parameter can be thought of as an estimate of the threshold at which the participant\u2019s categorization of women\u2019s behavior switches from one category to another. It was computed as follows:\nln bi\nbj\n\u00bc\nln Q P\u00f0RijSk\u00de\nP\u00f0RjjSk\u00de h i m ;\nwhere bi/bj is the ratio of a subject\u2019s bias to provide response i over his or her bias to provide response j, P(Ri|Sk) is the probability of providing response i to stimulus k, and P(Rj|Sk) is the probability of providing response j to stimulus k.\nFor the current study, two decisional-bias estimates were computed for each participant. Positive-affect bias, ln(bfr|bsi), refers to the category boundary between friendliness (\u2018\u2018fr\u2019\u2019) and sexual interest (\u2018\u2018si\u2019\u2019). A value near zero indicates balanced category responses (i.e., the participant was no more likely to respond that positive affect reflected friendliness than to respond that it reflected sexual interest). This estimate becomes increasingly positive the more likely participants are to indicate that positive affect reflects friendliness and becomes increasingly negative the more likely participants are to indicate that positive affect reflects sexual interest. Computing this estimate allowed us to evaluate the prediction that men would be biased to perceive sexuality in women\u2019s ambiguous nonverbal behavior. A significantly lower bias estimate for men than for women would indicate that men have a lower threshold for perceiving sexual intent in women\u2019s nonverbal displays.\n350 Volume 19\u2014Number 4\nThe second bias estimate captures negative-affect bias, ln(bsd|brj), or the category boundary between sadness (\u2018\u2018sd\u2019\u2019) and rejection (\u2018\u2018rj\u2019\u2019). Negative-affect bias increases positively as participants become more likely to respond that negative affect is sadness and declines negatively as participants become more likely to respond that negative affect is rejection.\nIn our stimulus set, almost exclusive reliance on one category response would produce a bias estimate of 6.55 for either positive-affect bias or negative-affect bias. Relying on one category for 70% of all judgments, with equally distributed errors, would produce a bias estimate of 1.95."}, {"heading": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "A general linear model (GLM) approach was used to explore gender differences in heterosocial perception as quantified by the choice-model parameters of sensitivity and bias.

Of course, inaccuracy is the effect of specific interest, particularly in the set of images normatively judged to portray friendliness, as misclassification of friendly women as sexually interested has been the primary area of interest in previous research.

Post hoc analyses revealed that both men and women were more sensitive to cues signaling friendliness than to cues signaling sexual interest (Tukey\u2019s HSD, p< .01). However, perceptual sensitivity varied as a function of clothing style among men only. The provocativeness of target women\u2019s clothing was not associated with men\u2019s sensitivity to friendliness; however, when a target woman was signaling sexual interest, men were more sensitive to her nonverbal cues when she was dressed provocatively (ln(a) 5 1.39), rather than conservatively (ln(a) 5 0.86, p < .01).\nGender differences in sensitivity also characterized decoding of women\u2019s negative-affect cues.

The positive values of the parameter estimates indicate that both men and women were biased to assume that positive affect was friendliness, rather than sexual interest (within this image set). A significant interaction between gender and clothing style, F(1, 278) 5 22.49, p < .001, Zp 2 \u00bc :075, depicted in Figure 2, revealed that women modified their decisional criterion for detecting sexual interest on the basis of clothing style (Tukey\u2019s HSD, p < .01). They adopted a more lenient criterion for labeling positive affect sexual interest when target women were dressed provocatively and a more stringent criterion when target women were dressed conservatively.

Men found platonic-interest cues to be less discriminable from sexual-interest cues than women did. Just as in previous research, they made some mistakes in perceiving sexual intent in friendly displays, but they also misperceived friendliness in sexual-interest displays. That is, they oversexualized some women, but were quite likely to undersexualize other women. Although the methodology varied from that used in early research (we employed an identification paradigm and a series of photographs), the effect sizes (d 5 0.38\u20130.40) were consistent in magnitude with the average effect sizes reported in previous investigations (Farris et al., 2008). Employing a model-based approach capable of parsing decisional bias from perceptual insensitivity, we found no evidence that men\u2019s performance differed from women\u2019s because of a gender difference in decisional thresholds for positive-affect targets. Relative to women, men did not oversexualize the image set, and their decisional criteria for detecting sexual intent were no more or less lenient than women\u2019s. For this image set, the underlying etiology differentiating men\u2019s performance from women\u2019s performance was perceptual sensitivity.\nIn the case of negative affect, men also showed a relative insensitivity to nonverbal cues. Women were more sensitive than men to the distinction between sadness and rejection; however, the effect size for the gender difference in sensitivity was larger within positive-affect categories than within negative-affect\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nFriendly Sexually Interested\nTarget Category\nFriendly Sexually Interested\nTarget Category\nS en\nsi tiv\nity Conservatively Dressed Provocatively Dressed\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nS en\nsi tiv\nity\nConservatively Dressed Provocatively Dressed\nFig. 1.

This might suggest that although there is a general tendency for women to be more successful than men at decoding nonverbal cues (Hall, 1978; McClure, 2000), there is a particularly pronounced gender difference when nonverbal cues are sexual in nature. Future research that will continue to explore the magnitude and the boundaries of gender differences in social perception is warranted. In any case, within the realm of sexual bargaining, and sexual coercion in particular, skill in decoding sexual intent may be principally crucial in successfully negotiating sexual relationships, and warrants continued attention.\nIt is important to note that participants in this study were asked to judge affect from relatively impoverished stimuli. Social and sexual communication often occurs in a dynamic and reciprocal interchange between actors. Over time, perceivers may accumulate information about a potential partner\u2019s interest in order to change or refine interpretation of that person\u2019s behavior. It will be important for future research to explore gender differences in bias and sensitivity in response to richer stimuli, such as videotaped vignettes or scripted, live interactions, in order to establish whether gender differences in sensitivity generalize to such stimuli (and whether gender differences in bias come into play). At the same time, first-impression judgments, such as those captured in responses to briefly displayed still photographs, may also influence social perception across longer time scales, and thus merit continued consideration.\nFinally, the question remains as to how to resolve the lack of gender differences in the bias parameter with women\u2019s observations of their own social interactions. Women self-report many incidents in which their attempts to be friendly are misperceived as displays of sexual interest (Abbey, 1987), but do not seem to have the opposite problem of displaying sexual interest only to have it ignored as mere friendliness (Haselton, 2003). If men misperceive positive-affect cues more often than women because of greater insensitivity, should they not take sexual interest to be friendliness as often as they take friendliness to be sexual interest? Are the unequal frequencies of reports of the two types of misperception an indicator that men have a relative bias in the natural environment, even if they fail to display that bias in the laboratory?\nWe believe that women\u2019s self-reports do not challenge the laboratory findings for several reasons. First, women\u2019s observations about misperception of their intent would be reliable only if women had access to the internal perceptual and decisional processes of their social partners, but this is an unlikely assumption. Instead, women probably rely on men\u2019s behavioral cues to infer men\u2019s perception of interest. The behavioral cues that suggest a man has misperceived friendliness as sexual interest are more likely to be inappropriate and memorable than the cues that suggest a man has misperceived sexual interest as friendliness. Indeed, a man who has misperceived sexual intent as friendliness may not provide any diagnostic behavior cues (failure to pursue could be an indicator of misperception, but\ncould just as easily be explained by noninterest). Thus, women may note misperceived friendliness more readily than misperceived sexual interest.\nSecond, the behavioral cues often attributed to misperceived friendliness (e.g., continued advances) may not be produced solely by misperception, but may also be produced after a man accurately perceives noninterest but continues to approach in order to convince, cajole, or persuade. Finally, and most important, base rates must be considered before concluding that observed frequencies of misperceived friendliness versus misperceived sexual interest reflect bias (Dawes, 1986). Base rates of friendliness and sexual interest in the natural environment are likely to be widely discrepant. A woman may have dozens if not hundreds of friendly interactions with men for every one interaction in which she signals sexual interest. Thus, there are many more opportunities for insensitivity to be exposed (and noted by women) within friendly interactions than within interactions characterized by sexual interest. Women\u2019s reports of experiencing misperception of friendliness more frequently than misperception of sexual interest are not inconsistent with gender differences in sensitivity, and may be explained by the unequal base rates of women\u2019s use of friendliness and sexual-interest cues.\nIn summary, parameter estimates provide preliminary support for the argument that disagreements between men and women about the meaning of women\u2019s positive-affect displays are the result of a perceptual difference such that men have more difficulty discriminating sexual interest from friendliness, rather than the result of a tendency among men to oversexualize women\u2019s nonverbal displays. By relying on rigorous, computational modeling techniques, the measurement strategy for the present study was well matched to the theoretical question of interest and made it possible to parse the perceptual and decisional processes hypothesized to underlie the observed disagreement between men and women.\nAcknowledgments\u2014This research was supported by grants\nfrom the National Institute of Mental Health (T32-MH17146)\nand National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (F31-\nAA016055)."}]}, {"paper_id": 111, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02057.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 1.0, "Fold_Id": 1.0, "filename": "janiszewski2008.pdf", "title": "Precision of the anchor influences the amount of adjustment.", "content": [{"text": "been used to account for a wide variety of numerical judgments. Five studies show that adjustment away from a numerical anchor is smaller if the anchor is precise than if it is rounded. Evidence suggests that precise anchors, compared with rounded anchors, are represented on a subjective scale with a finer resolution. If adjustment consists of a series of iterative mental movements along a subjective scale, then an adjustment from a precise anchor should result in a smaller overall correction than an adjustment from a rounded anchor.\nThe anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) has been used to account for a wide variety of numerical judgments, including appraisals of home values (Northcraft & Neale, 1987), estimates of risk and uncertainty (Wright & Anderson, 1989), and estimates of future performance (Switzer & Sniezek, 1991). In all these cases, the explanation rests on the claim that a numerical judgment can be influenced by the prior consideration of a numerical anchor (i.e., referent). For example, Northcraft and Neale (1987) asked real estate agents to estimate the appraised value of a home. Agents who received an information packet that included a higher list price estimated a higher appraisal value. Northcraft and Neale proposed that the agents started the judgment process by rejecting the list price as an accurate estimate and then adjusted downward until they reached a plausible estimate. Adjustments tend to be insufficient, so the final appraisal values were biased in the direction of the initial anchor value.\nTwo fundamental questions concerning numerical judgments are, when do people adjust, and what factors influence the amount of adjustment? With respect to the first question, recent evidence suggests that when people perceive that an anchor is diagnostic but incorrect, they often attempt to adjust from that anchor when formulating their estimate (Epley & Gilovich, 2001, 2005, 2006). For example, consider how people might respond if asked, \u2018\u2018Is the freezing point of vodka 32 1F?\u2019\u2019 and then \u2018\u2018What is the freezing point of vodka?\u2019\u2019 Although they know that the freezing point of vodka is not 32 1F, many people perceive that this anchor is diagnostic because it is the freezing point of water. Hence, a downward adjustment from this anchor is a legitimate strategy for making an educated guess at the answer to the second question.\nWith respect to the second question, there are many factors that influence the amount of adjustment from a diagnostic anchor. These factors include the perceived relevance of the anchor to the judgment (Mussweiler & Strack, 1999), beliefs about the degree of error of the anchor (Gilbert, 2002; Wegener & Petty, 1995), and the ambiguity and uncertainty associated with the anchor (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1985). The common theme underlying all of these influences is that reduced confidence in the accuracy of a diagnostic anchor will lead to a greater amount of adjustment. We believe that there is an additional, arguably more fundamental, factor that influences the amount of adjustment from a plausible anchor. If adjustment is viewed as movement along a subjective representational scale, then the resolution of this scale might also influence the amount of adjustment. X units of adjustment along a fine-resolution scale will cover less objective distance than the same number of units of adjustment along a coarse-resolution scale. As a consequence, there will be less adjustment when numerical judgments are made using subjective scales with a finer resolution.

Respondents read the scenarios one at a time and provided a numerical estimate for each scenario before moving on to the next.\nNine of the scenarios investigated price estimates (plasma TV, quick-melt cheese, beach house, pet rock, figurine) or estimates of attribute values (grams of protein in a health drink, pen life in kilometers, basketball shooting percentage, Hummer height).

Second, it does not appear that respondents took a proportion of the anchor value to calculate their estimated value. If respondents were using a proportion rule, then the estimates associated with the rounded anchors should have been between the estimates associated with the precise under and precise over anchors.\nEXPERIMENT 2\nA plausible alternative explanation for the results of Experiment 1 is that they were due to a difference in objective scale ranges. That is, a precise anchor might evoke a narrower range of plausible responses than a rounded anchor. If the adjustment from the anchor value is a constant percentage change within the objective range of plausible responses, then the narrower range in the precise-anchor condition would result in less adjustment than observed in the rounded-anchor condition.\nIn Experiment 2, we manipulated the objective scale range independently of anchor precision. For example, the following information was added to the plasma-TV scenario in the broadrange condition (note that precise over anchors were not in-\ncluded in this experiment): \u2018\u2018You also know that electronics stores canmakemargins as high as 40%, suggesting that the cost could be as low as $3,000/$2,998, although these types of margins are usually for peripherals like headphones and/or iPod holders.\u2019\u2019 In the narrow-range condition, a 20% margin was suggested in this scenario, and the possible actual cost was given as $4,000 or $3,998. If anchor precision influences the resolution of the respondent\u2019s subjective scale, then the effect of anchor precision on estimates would be independent of the effect of scale range. If anchor precision influences the range of plausible objective values and not scale resolution, then the effect of anchor precision either would be overwhelmed by the manipulation of scale range or would correlate with the observed effect of range."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Eighty-five students from an undergraduate subject pool participated in this experiment for extra credit.

After responding to all five scenarios, respondents reconsidered each scenario and provided a range of plausible estimates.\nTo ensure that we would obtain a range effect, we set the lower values in the broad range to correspond to the lowest estimates reported in Experiment 1.

Experiment 3 addressed the possibility that precise anchors led to smaller adjustments because respondents perceived them as more accurate or valid (i.e., reliable) than rounded anchors. To test this hypothesis, we added a reliable-rounded-anchor condition to the precise- and rounded-anchor conditions. In the reliable-rounded-anchor condition, information was added to the rounded-anchor materials to make participants more confident in the anchor. For example, the plasma-TV scenario was modified by adding,\nAll you know are the following three things. First, the plasma TV should cost less than the retail price of $5,000. Second, you have checked the price of the plasma TVat three other stores in the area. They were all selling the plasma TV for $5,000. Third, you checked on-line and the lowest price you saw was $5,000.\nSimilar modifications were made to the four other scenarios presented to participants (beach house, figurine, Hummer, pet rock).\nWe expected that making an anchor more reliable would lead to less adjustment. We also expected that the effect of the reliability manipulation would be independent of the effect of anchor precision. If a reliable rounded anchor is perceived as more reliable than a precise anchor, but a precise anchor results in less adjustment than a reliable rounded anchor, then the reliability of the anchor cannot be responsible for the anchorprecision effect."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Forty-five students from an undergraduate subject pool participated in the experiment for extra credit.

Thus, participants made larger adjustments from the reliable rounded anchors than from the precise anchors, even though they found the reliable rounded anchors to be more reliable than the precise anchors. We note that the reliability measures and estimate values differed between the rounded and reliable-rounded conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that the reliability scale had different representational properties across conditions (Birnbaum, 1999).\nEXPERIMENT 4\nIf rounded and precise anchors influence scale resolution, then estimates based on these anchors should diverge more as the number of units of adjustment increases. For example, suppose that a rounded anchor evokes a subjective scale with units that are twice the width of those in a subjective scale evoked by a precise anchor. Also suppose that the motivation to adjust influences the number of units of adjustment. As the motivation to adjust increases and the number of units of adjustment increases correspondingly, the amount of adjustment on the coarse-resolution scale should increase at a faster rate than the amount of adjustment on the fine-resolution scale (i.e., motivation to adjust and scale resolution should interact)."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Experiment 4 included two subexperiments in which motivation to adjust and width of the scale unit were manipulated between subjects. The high-motivation-to-adjust condition was created by removing information from the scenarios used in Experiment 2 (the scenarios from Experiment 2 were used without alteration in the low-motivation-to-adjust condition). For example, sentences in the plasma-TV scenario that encouraged a slight adjustment (\u2018\u2018items are priced very close to their actual cost . . . actual cost would be only slightly less than $5,000\u2019\u2019) were replaced with a sentence that encouragedmore adjustment (\u2018\u2018What is your estimate of the TV\u2019s actual cost?\u2019\u2019). Experiment 4a (n 5 59) manipulated the width of the scale unit by manipulating the precision of the anchor (i.e., rounded anchor for broad width and precise anchor for narrow width). The remainder of the procedure mimicked the procedure in Experiment 1 (e.g., open-ended responses). Experiment 4b (n 5 149) manipulated width of the scale unit by replacing the open-ended response format with a demarcated line.

The symmetry of results across the two subexperiments suggests that the precision of an anchor influences the resolution of the underlying subjective response scale.\nQUASI-EXPERIMENT 5\nReal estate agents are sensitive to numerical anchors (Northcraft & Neale, 1987). We examined the possibility that home buyers exhibit similar behavior by analyzing 5 years of home sales data (N 5 25,564) from Alachua County, Florida. First, each list price was coded as being precise to the ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, or ones. Discussions with brokers revealed that prices precise to the tens or ones (n 5 492) often indicate sales due to foreclosure; because such sales are not representative home sales, we excluded these data from our analysis. Second, the sales-price ratio (sale price/list price) was used to exclude sales that were completed at or above the list price, as these sales often involved a \u2018\u2018bidding war\u2019\u2019 (n 5 12,491). The final sample included 12,581 homes priced between $600 and $2,000,000 (Mdn 5 $130,000).\nAfter we controlled for the list price, F(1, 12,577) 5 23.88, there was a main effect of list-price precision on the sales-price ratio, F(2, 12,577)5 207.08,o25 .015. There was a difference between the sales-price ratios for list prices that were precise to the hundreds (M 5 0.950, MSE 5 0.0006) and list prices that were precise to the thousands (M5 0.935,MSE5 0.001), F(1, 12,577) 5 139.51, prep 5 .996, o 2 5 .01; there was also a difference between the sales-price ratios for list prices that were precise to the thousands and list prices that were precise to the ten thousands (M 5 0.910, MSE 5 0.003), F(1, 12,577) 5 114.96, prep 5 .996, o 2 5 .008. An ancillary analysis showed that the difference between the amount of adjustment to a rounded versus a precise anchor increased as the number of days\nVolume 19\u2014Number 2 125\nthe home was listed on the market increased, F(2, 12,578) 5 8.80, o2 5 .001. For example, the difference between the salesprice ratios for prices precise to the hundreds and prices precise to the ten thousands increased as the number of days the home was listed increased from less than 40 days (M100s 5 0.962, M10,000s 5 0.939, Mdifference 5 0.023) to more than 100 days (M100s 5 0.936, M10,000s 5 0.886, Mdifference 5 0.05). If the number of days a home is listed influences the buyer\u2019s motivation to adjust, then the effect of anchor precision should increase as the number of days increases."}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "The results of the five studies allow us to draw two conclusions, with different levels of confidence. First, a precise anchor results in less adjustment than a rounded anchor. The anchor-precision effect is robust. It occurred with regularity across a large number of replicates, both inside the laboratory and in the field. Second, it appears plausible that anchor precision influences resolution of the subjective scale, which in turn influences the amount that people adjust from an anchor. This claim is more difficult to substantiate because the resolution of a subjective scale must be inferred from response patterns, and because there are other factors (e.g., objective scale range, confidence in the anchor value) that also contribute to the amount of adjustment. There are also other adjustment strategies that might be used (e.g., proportion of the anchor value).\nThe anchor-precision effect may be operative in a large number of real-world circumstances, influencing negotiations, assessments of health risk, and assessments of present and future value. For example, Galinsky and Mussweiler (2001) found that the initial offer in a negotiation acts as an anchor, and hence has a significant influence on the settlement amount. Our results suggest that the influence of the initial offer will be stronger when the initial offer is precise, rather than rounded. Also, Michie, Lester, Pinto, and Marteau (2005) showed that patients are sensitive to the manner in which medical information is communicated. Patients seem to understand estimates of life expectancy and treatment responsiveness better when such information is presented in general terms (e.g., \u2018\u2018moderate risk,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018high risk\u2019\u2019), rather than in specific terms (e.g., 40%, 80%; Brun & Teigen, 1988). Yet, to the extent that patients adjust initial estimates to account for family history, personal motivation, and other variables, general terms may encourage more adjustment and alter treatment choices.\nAnchor precision may also influence the confidence intervals people use to make decisions. Confidence intervals surrounding numerical values or estimates influence search for information, resource allocation, and willingness to execute a decision (Soll & Klayman, 2004). Yet, despite the importance of estimated confidence intervals, people are poor at generating them. For example, when people are asked to make an estimate and surround it with a 90% confidence interval, the interval includes\nthe correct answer about 50% of the time, owing to the interval being too narrow (Klayman, Soll, Gonza\u0301lez-Vallejo, & Barlas, 1999). One factor that may contribute to the narrowness of such confidence intervals is the resolution of the subjective scales used to generate the initial values (Soll & Klayman, 2004). If people begin the estimation process by generating an initial estimate, the precision of this initial estimate will influence the resolution of the subjective scale and the size of the confidence interval. Thus, policymakers should be able to increase the size of confidence intervals by encouraging people to generate a rounded initial estimate, and hence to use a coarse-resolution subjective scale."}]}, {"paper_id": 112, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02041.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 1.0, "Fold_Id": 10.0, "filename": "mckinstry2008.pdf", "title": "Action dynamics reveal parallel competition in decision making", "content": [{"text": "http://pss.sagepub.com/ Psychological Science\nhttp://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/1/22 The online version of this article can be found at:\nDOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02041.x\n2008 19: 22Psychological Science Chris McKinstry, Rick Dale and Michael J.

The motoric component of this competition was reflected in trajectories\u2019 sample entropy. Sample entropy is a measure representing the \u2018\u2018disorder\u2019\u2019 of a time series. For each trajectory\u2019s sequence of x-axis changes (Dx), we computed this measure by first determining the number of windows of size 3 (M3) that stayed within a given tolerance (the standard deviation of Dx). We then counted the number of sequences that were retained when the window size was extended to 4 (M4). Sample entropy was then given by ln (M4/M3) (Dale, Kehoe, & Spivey, 2007; Richman & Moorman, 2000). Sample entropy was higher for middle-truth-value questions than for low- and high-truth-value questions (see Fig. 1d), quadratic r 5 .70, F(1, 9) 5 8.7, p < .05, prep 5 .939. These results show that both the spatial extent (see Figs. 1a and 1b) and the temporal dynamics (see Figs. 1c and 1d) of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition (Rosenbaum, 2005). Our results are consistent with previous claims regarding proposition verification (Barres & JohnsonLaird, 2003; Clark & Chase, 1972; Gilbert, 1991). Specifically, we found that evaluating a proposition as false exhibits more difficulty compared with evaluating a proposition as true. Not only were \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 responses slower than \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 responses, but the \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 alternative conspicuously competed with the \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 alternative.\nThus, reasoning about the truth value of a proposition exhibits a significant a priori bias toward \u2018\u2018truth,\u2019\u2019 and this bias must be overcome before a \u2018\u2018false\u2019\u2019 response can come to fruition. These continuous arm-movement data are consistent with a dynamic decision process that continuously flows into the parallel competition and continuous blending of evolving motor commands (Cisek & Kalaska, 2005). Therefore, theoretical frameworks based on dynamic, embodied, and distributed processing may apply not only to perception, attention, and categorization (Dale et al., 2007; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Song & Nakayama, 2006; Spivey et al., 2005), but also to high-level cognition. Put simply, when actions accompany thinking, they are part and parcel of it.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank David Rosenbaum and Jerome\nBusemeyer for comments, and Nick Hindy for data collection."}]}, {"paper_id": 113, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02089.x", "O_within_CI_R": 0.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 1.0, "Fold_Id": 9.0, "filename": "armor2008.pdf", "title": "Prescribed optimism: Is it right to be wrong about the future?", "content": [{"heading": "Short Report", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Prescribed Optimism", "text": "Is It Right to Be Wrong About the Future?"}, {"heading": "David A.

However, normative conclusions about the impropriety of optimistic bias rest on an untested assumption: that people desire to be accurate when making personal predictions.

Specifically, we asked participants (N 5 383) to imagine one of four different settings in which predictions (a) would be relevant and (b) might range from overly pessimistic to overly optimistic. These settings, chosen for breadth, included decisions about a financial investment, an academic-award application, a surgical procedure, and a dinner party. For each setting, we created eight vignettes by independently manipulating three variables known to be related to optimism: commitment (whether the decision to engage in a particular action has or has not been made; Armor & Taylor, 2003), agency (whether the decision to commit was, or will be, made by the protagonist or by another person; Henry, 1994), and control (the degree to which the protagonist can influence the predicted outcome; Klein & Helweg-Larsen, 2002).1 Each participant was randomly assigned to one setting and received all eight vignettes, in counterbalanced order, within that setting.\nOne third of participants (n 5 127) were asked to provide prescriptions (i.e., to indicate whether it would be best to be overly pessimistic, accurate, or overly optimistic) for each of the eight vignettes. In order to have descriptive benchmarks for these prescriptions, we asked another third of participants (n 5 128) to indicate what kind of prediction the protagonist in each vignette would make, and the final third (n5 128) to indicate what kind of prediction they themselves would make. Response options ranged from 4 (extremely pessimistic) through 0 (accurate) to14 (extremely optimistic).

These results suggest that optimistic biases may be more than just an unwanted and unintended consequence of motivated reasoning (Kunda, 1990), basic cognitive processes (Buehler, Griffin, & Ross, 2002), or evolutionary forces (Haselton & Nettle, 2006).

Although the episodic specificity of past events declines as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is true for future events. In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants generated past and future events. Transcriptions were segmented into distinct details thatwere classified as either internal (episodic) or external. Older adults generated fewer internal details than younger adults for past events, a result replicating previous findings; more important, we show that this deficit extends to future events. Furthermore, the number of internal details and the number of external details both showed correlations between past and future events. Finally, the number of internal details generated by older adults correlated with their relational memoryabilities, a finding consistentwith the constructiveepisodic-simulation hypothesis, which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly recombine details from past events into novel scenarios.\nConsiderable research has documented age-related changes in the functioning of episodic memory (Craik & Salthouse, 2000). As has been the case with most theoretical and empirical work on episodic memory, research on aging memory has traditionally focused on the recollection of past events. However, episodic memory allows individuals to project themselves both backward and forward in subjective time; representations of both past and future events can contain rich contextual details about events specific in time and place (Tulving, 1983). Recently, there has been growing interest in the role of episodic memory in simu-\nlating or imagining future episodes and scenarios (for recent reviews, see Buckner &Carroll, 2007; Schacter&Addis, 2007a; Schacter, Addis, & Buckner, 2007). The main purpose of the present study was to compare younger and older adults\u2019 ability to simulate future personal events and past personal events.\nThe conceptual framework for our study is provided by the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis (Schacter & Addis, 2007a, 2007b; see also Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997), which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly recombine details from past events. According to this view, (a) past and future events draw on similar information stored in episodic memory and rely on similar cognitive processes during construction (e.g., self-referential processing and imagery), and (b) episodic memory supports the construction of future events by extracting and recombining stored information into a simulation of an event that never occurred previously in that exact form. We consider evidence supporting the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis and then spell out the implications for aging memory.\nConverging lines of evidence have demonstrated considerable overlap in the cognitive properties and neural substrates of past and future events (Buckner & Carroll, 2007; Schacter & Addis, 2007a). It has been shown that although representations of past events are associated with more perceptual detail than are representations of future events, factors influencing the phenomenology of past events influence the phenomenology of future events in the same way. For instance, D\u2019Argembeau and van der Linden (2004) and Szpunar and McDermott (in press) demonstrated that temporally close events in either the past or the future had more detailed representations than temporally distant events. Moreover, Szpunar and McDermott found that increased familiarity of the event context increased the amount of detail in representations of past and future events. It has also been shown that individual differences in imagery ability and emotion regulation influence the qualities of representations of past and future events (D\u2019Argembeau & van der Linden, 2006).

For example, we (Addis et al., 2007) examined the neural correlates of past and future events during (a) an initial construction phase in which participants generated a past or future event in response to a cue (e.g., \u2018\u2018dress\u2019\u2019) and (b) an elaboration phase in which participants generated as much detail as possible about the event. Despite some neural differences during the construction phase, there was neural overlap between the past and future tasks; neural overlap was even more apparent during the elaboration phase. Results were consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis in that this common past-future network of medial prefrontal, temporopolar, hippocampal-parahippocampal, and medial and lateral parietal regions was remarkably similar to the network consistently engaged by retrieval of past autobiographical events (Maguire, 2001).\nThis finding of common neural activity associated with past and future events is consistent with the case reports of two amnesic patients: K.C., who developed severe amnesia after a head injury that damaged the medial temporal and frontal lobes (Rosenbaum et al., 2005; Tulving, 1985), and D.B., who developed memory problems after cardiac arrest (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002). Both of these patients were reported to have difficulty envisaging future personal events. Amore recent study showed that 4 of 5 amnesic patients with bilateral hippocampal damage had difficulties imagining new experiences, and in particular, had difficulty forming coherent imagined events (Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, & Maguire, 2007). Finally, Williams et al. (1996) demonstrated reduced specificity of representations of both past and future events in suicidally depressed patients.\nTaken together, these lines of evidence support the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis and provide a basis for generating hypotheses concerning simulation of future events as people grow older. Healthy older adults exhibit a number of deficits in episodic memory, but two are especially relevant to the simulation of future events and to the constructive-episodic-\nsimulation hypothesis. First, older adults sometimes have difficulties with relational processes that link together elements of an episode (e.g., Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996; Lyle, Bloise, & Johnson, 2006). As noted earlier, the constructive-episodicsimulation hypothesis holds that construction of future events relies on recombining elements of past episodes, which draws on relational processes. Second, previous work has shown that aging is associated with reductions in the episodic specificity of past events. Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, and Moscovitch (2002) examined age-related changes in the episodic quality of past events using the Autobiographical Interview (AI), a measure that distinguishes episodic information from other, \u2018\u2018external\u2019\u2019 details (e.g., semantic information, other external events, repetitions) in a participant\u2019s description of a past event. This analysis revealed that older adults recalled significantly fewer episodic details and tended to produce more external information than younger adults did.\nGiven these findings of age-related reductions in episodic specificity of past events and age-related impairment in relational processing, which is likely relevant to construction of future events, we hypothesized that older adults would exhibit reduced episodic specificity in their simulations of future events, compared with young adults. We also hypothesized that such a deficit would be correlated with performance on a memory task sensitive to relational processing."}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Seventeen young and 17 older adults with no history of neurological or psychiatric impairment gave informed written consent in a manner approved by the Harvard Institutional Review Board.

Although studies with young adults have sampled events further into the past or future (e.g., 20 years in Addis et al., 2007), the advanced age of the older adults meant that this was not feasible in the current study. Both time periods (weeks and years) for one temporal direction (past or future) were completed before the conditions in the other temporal direction began.

The event generated in response to a cue word did not have to strictly involve the named object; participants were encouraged to freely associate so that they would be successful in generating an event. Each event was required, however, to be temporally and contextually specific (i.e., episodic), occurring over minutes or hours, but not more than 1 day. Future events had to be plausible, given the participant\u2019s plans, and novel, that is, not previously experienced by the participant. Participants were asked to try to experience events from a field perspective (i.e., from the perspective of being there) rather than an observer perspective (i.e., from an external vantage point in which they observed themselves).\nFor the duration of each trial, the relevant cue word was displayed on a computer screen along with the task instruction (\u2018\u2018recall past event\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018imagine future event\u2019\u2019) and time period. When necessary, general probes were given to clarify instructions and encourage further description of details. After 3 min, a bell sounded to indicate the end of the trial. The participant then\ndated the event and rated it on 5-point scales for level of detail (15 vague with no/few details, 55 vivid; for brevity, results for this variable are not discussed, given that more extensive measures of detail were obtained using the AI), emotionality (i.e., intensity of emotion experienced upon recalling or imagining the event; 1 5 nonemotional, 5 5 highly emotional), and personal significance (i.e., how life-changing the event was or would be; 1 5 insignificant, 5 5 life-changing).

For each participant, events generated in response to the first four randomly presented cue words in each condition were scored by one of three scorers. First, the central event was identified; if more than one event was mentioned, the event that was discussed in most detail and that occurred over a brief time frame was selected as the central event. The transcription was then segmented into distinct details, or chunks of information (e.g., a unique occurrence or thought), and these details were categorized as internal (episodic information relating to the central event) or external (nonepisodic information, including semantic details and information concerning extended events that are not specific in time and place, and repetitions). For each event, the numbers of internal and external details were tallied, and the totals were then averaged across the four events in each condition to create internal and external AI scores for each condition for each participant. Interrater reliability of scoring, established on the basis of 20 events scored by all three raters and an intraclass correlation analysis, was high (two-way mixed model; standardized Cronbach\u2019s a 5 .96 for internal AI scores and .92 for external AI scores). Note that all scorers were blind to group membership, but given that event content could imply group membership, we ensured that the principal scorer (who scored 288 of the 512 event transcripts) was blind to the hypotheses of this study."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Phenomenology of Past and Future Events", "text": "Table 2 summarizes the phenomenological qualities of the past and future events generated by participants.

Thus, any group differences in\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 35\nat TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY on December 16, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nthe AI scores cannot be accounted for by recency. This analysis did reveal, however, a main effect of time period, F(1, 30) 5 231.72, prep > .99, Z 2 5 .89, confirming that events in the year conditions (past few years, next few years) were significantly more distant than events in the week conditions (past few weeks, next few weeks). There was also a significant effect of temporal direction, F(1, 30) 5 10.23, prep 5 .97, Z 2 5 .25, with past events being more distant than future events, and a significant interaction of time period and temporal distance, F(1, 30) 5 11.17, prep 5 .98, Z 2 5 .27, indicating that within the week condition, past events were closer to the present than future events, whereas within the year condition, past events were further from the present than future events.

Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that older adults produced more emotional events than younger adults (U5 73.00, prep 5 .89).

Additionally, temporally close events contained more internal details than distant events, F(1, 30)5 4.12, prep 5 .88, Z 2 5 .121 (see Fig. 1c). No such effects were evident for external details.\nCombining the data for the two age groups, we found that past and future internal AI scores were significantly correlated (r 5 .82, prep > .99), as were past and future external AI scores (r5 .65, prep> .99; see Fig. 2). In contrast, past internal and external AI scores were uncorrelated (r 5 .001, prep 5 .50), as were future internal and external AI scores (r 5 .07, prep 5 .61). For older adults, we also computed correlations between AI scores and neuropsychological measures. To measure relational episodic memory, we used the Recall Total Score from the Verbal Paired Associates I (VPA) subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale\u2013Third Edition; studies have demonstrated that this score is sensitive to medial temporal function (Glisky, Polster, & Routhieaux, 1995; Lezak, 1995). To measure executive functioning, we used the Digit Span Backwards subscale from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Third Edition, the number of categories achieved on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; i.e., the number of card-sorting rules, out of six, that the participant applies correctly on 10 successive trials), and phonemic fluency (i.e., the number of words generated in response to the letters F, A, and S; Glisky et al., 1995; Lezak, 1995). VPA performance was significantly and positively correlated with the number of internal details in the descriptions of past (r 5 .43, prep 5 .88) and future (r 5 .55, prep 5 .94) events (see Fig. 3). External AI scores, however, did not correlate with relational memory (past events: r 5 .23, prep 5 .73; future events: r 5 .01, prep 5 .51; see Fig. 3). Digit Span Backwards scores\n36 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\nat TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY on December 16, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\ncorrelated with internal AI scores, and this relationship was significant for future events (past events: r 5 .41, prep 5 .86; future events: r 5 .47, prep 5 .90). There were no correlations between this measure and external AI scores (past events: r 5 .09, prep5 .60; future events: r5 .06, prep5 .56). Moreover, the other two measures of executive functioning showed no correlations with either internal or external AI scores. For phonemic fluency, correlational analysis yielded r values of .07 (prep 5 .57) for past internal details, .13 (prep 5 .63) for past external details, .04 (prep 5 .54) for future internal details, and .20 (prep 5 .70) for future external details. The corresponding values for the WCST were .08 (prep 5 .58), .22 (prep 5 .72), .002 (prep 5 .50), and .08 (prep 5 .59). Note that the lack of correlations with WCST scores may reflect the restricted variance of these scores."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our data show that the age-related reduction in the episodic specificity of past events (Levine et al., 2002) extends to future events, a finding consistent with recent findings of similar temporal distributions for past and future events generated by older adults (Spreng & Levine, 2006). Compared with young\nadults, older adults generated significantly fewer internal, episodic details, and more external details, when remembering past events or imagining future events. It seems unlikely that the group difference in the emotional intensity of events (i.e., greater emotional intensity for events generated by older adults than for events generated by young adults) can account for the age-related reduction in specificity, as these two effects were in opposite directions.\nThe striking similarity between the episodic specificity of past and future events was also reflected in the strong correlations between the past and future internal (.82) and external (.65) AI scores. These correlations are similar to, but stronger than, the correlations Williams et al. (1996) reported for depressed patients (r5 .57), and they likely reflect the sensitivity of the AI to the specificity of autobiographical events. Notably, only the correlations between past and future events were significant; correlations between past internal and external scores and between future internal and external scores were negligible.\nOur data provide further support for the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis. Not only do the common age-related deficits for past and future internal details support the hypothesis, but so too does the positive correlation between degree of impairment and performance on VPA, an episodic-\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 37\nat TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY on December 16, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nmemory measure that probes the ability to integrate information and form relations between items (i.e., relational memory). Paradigms using paired associates (e.g., pairs of words or objects) are known to engage the hippocampus (Giovanello, Schnyer, & Verfaellie, 2004) and are sensitive to medial temporal function (Glisky et al., 1995). The association of episodic specificity of past and future events with this measure of relational memory is consistent with reports that patients with medial temporal damage experience difficulty imagining future events (Hassabis et al., 2007; Rosenbaum et al., 2005; Tulving, 1985). Furthermore, the correlation between VPA performance and the specificity of remembered past events dovetails with the idea that the retrieval of past autobiographical events requires reintegration of various episodic details (Moscovitch et al., 2005). Given that age-related deficits in episodic memory are pronounced for relational-memory tasks (Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996; Lyle et al., 2006; Spencer & Raz, 1995), it is not entirely surprising that the episodic specificity of past events was also reduced in older adults. Moreover, the strong correlation between VPA performance and the episodic specificity of future events suggests that imagining detailed future events also relies on relational memory and the ability to recombine and integrate details from various episodic memories. Indeed, Hassabis et al. (2007) noted that even if hippocampal amnesic patients could imagine some details about a future experience, their imagin-\n38 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\nat TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY on December 16, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nings lacked overall coherence. Additionally, we (Addis et al., 2007) found not only that the construction of past and future events engaged the left hippocampus, but also that construction of future events recruited the right hippocampus as well. We suggested that this recruitment of additional hippocampal resources may reflect the increased relational processing required when recombining disparate details into a unique coherent event. Further research is needed, however, to examine whether the generation of past and future episodic details is associated specifically with relational episodic memory, or whether it also correlates with other measures probing different types of memory, including semantic memory.\nThe specificity of these findings to memory functions also remains to be determined. Do cognitive abilities aside from\nmemory, such as executive functions, contribute to the generation of past and future episodic details? There was evidence that the episodic specificity of past and future events correlates with one measure of executive functioning, Digit Span Backwards. This observation suggests that executive functioning plays a role in event-generation tasks, as well as in digit-span tasks, which would not be entirely surprising, given that both tasks should engage attention and that executive functions are known to be involved in the retrieval (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000; Moscovitch, 1992) and specificity (Dalgleish et al., 2007) of past events. Although other studies have found specificity of future events and executive measures tapping verbal generation (e.g., phonemic fluency) to be uncorrelated (Williams et al., 1996), as reported here, neuroimaging studies suggest that the left pre-\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 39\nat TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY on December 16, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nfrontal cortex plays a role in both generative processing and construction of future events (Addis et al., 2007). Future research is required to better characterize the nature of prefrontal contributions to the generation of past and future events.\nThe preserved ability of older adults to generate external details suggests that the age-related reduction in internal details does not simply reflect a general reduction in verbal output. This observation is further supported by the lack of correlation between AI scores and phonemic fluency. It is possible that differences in the narrative styles of young and older adults influenced the types of details generated and the apparent difference in the episodic specificity of events. For instance, older adults may have provided more external details as a result of their breadth of knowledge and wisdom (Labouvie-Vief & Blanchard-Fields, 1982) and as a means of placing events within broader and more meaningful contexts (Levine et al., 2002), whereas young adults may have adhered to the instructions to focus on a specific event. If older adults spent more of their 3-min retrieval time providing external information, their time spent producing internal details may have been minimized. If this were the case, one would expect the internal and external AI scores to have been negatively correlated. However, these correlations were negligible, which suggests that the generation of internal details was unrelated to the generation of external details and that the age-related reduction in internal details was not simply a function of focusing on external information. Rather, it was likely due to some other mechanism, and the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis suggests that the most likely candidate is relational episodic-memory function.\nThis study also provided an opportunity to examine the ways in which past and future events differ, for instance, with respect to phenomenological qualities. Representations of past and future events should differ in some respects, given previous evidence showing differences between remembered and imagined events. Thus, one would expect past and future events to differ at least in the amount of detail produced, as suggested by the reality-monitoring framework, which posits that real events contain more detail than imagined events (Johnson, Foley, Suengas, & Raye, 1988). Indeed, our study replicated previous work by D\u2019Argembeau and van der Linden (2004) in that we found past events contained, on average, more details than future events. We also replicated D\u2019Argembeau and van der Linden\u2019s finding that personal significance is greater for future than for past events, a pattern likely reflecting the fact that future events can be relevant to one\u2019s current goal states in a way that past events, by definition, are not.\nTemporal distance also influenced event phenomenology. Events weeks into the past or future contained significantly more internal details than temporally distant events, a finding that is consistent with previous results (D\u2019Argembeau & van der Linden, 2004; Szpunar & McDermott, in press) and that provides some support for the idea that temporally close events are representedmore concretely (cf. temporal construal theory; Trope&\nLiberman, 2003). Temporally distant events tended to be rated as more personally significant than close events, possibly because one can focus on insignificant, everyday events within temporally close time frames, but only more important events stand out when one is projecting further out in time. However, although D\u2019Argembeau and van der Linden (2004) found this same pattern for future events, they found the opposite effect for past events (i.e., close events were more personally significant than distant events).\nIn summary, this study demonstrates that the age-related reduction of episodic specificity evident for past events extends to future events, a finding consistent with data from patients suggesting that deficits in memory can be associated with difficulties in imagining future experiences. Both the number of internal details and the number of external details showed strong positive correlations between past and future events\u2014further evidence of the close linkage of mental representations of past and future events. Finally, in older adults, the integrity of relational memory was positively correlated with the ability to generate internal, but not external, details for both past and future events. This finding is consistent with data from hippocampal amnesic patients and with neuroimaging data implicating the hippocampus in the generation of both past and future events. Moreover, this finding is consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis (Schacter & Addis, 2007a, 2007b), suggesting that relational memory is an important component process of both remembering the past and imagining the future, likely supporting the reintegration of details for remembering past events and the recombination of details for imagining novel future events.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank Lucia Lee, Anne Reed, and\nKatherine Chan for transcribing interviews; Lara Markstein for\nscoring interviews; and anonymous reviewers for providing in-\nsightful comments.

We conducted two experiments that addressed this question. In Experiment 1, the experimenter left while two novel objects were placed where the child could see both, but the experimenter would be able to see only one. The experimenter returned, looked directly at the mutually visible object, and said either, \u2018\u2018There\u2019s the [novel word]!\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the [novel word]?\u2019\u2019 Two- through 4-year-olds selected the target of the speaker\u2019s gazemore often on there trials than on where trials, although only the older children identified the referent correctly at above-chance levels on trials of both types. In Experiment 2, the experimenter placed a novel objectwhere only the child could see it and left while the second object was similarly hidden. When she returnedandasked, \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the [novelword]?\u2019\u2019 2- through 4-year-olds chose the second object at abovechance levels. Preschoolers do not blindly follow gaze, but consider the linguistic and pragmatic contextwhen learning a new word.\nWhen learning an object name, young children often assume that the name refers to the object the speaker is looking at, even if the children themselves are looking at a different object when the word is used (e.g., Baldwin, 1991). Eye gaze cannot be a necessary cue for word learning; blind children can learn object names, after all, and children can infer that a word refers to an object even if the speaker is not looking at it (e.g., through mutual exclusivity\u2014Markman &Wachtel, 1988; when learning names for absent referents\u2014Akhtar & Tomasello, 1996). Even so, eye gaze does seem to be sufficient for word learning.\nWhat does this indicate about how children learn the meanings of words? Such results are often taken as demonstrating the importance of social cognition in word learning, under the assumption that children use a speaker\u2019s eye gaze as a cue to referential intent (e.g., Bloom, 2000). According to another account, however, children attend to a speaker\u2019s line of regard because of simpler, possibly unlearned, orienting responses (e.g., Moore & Corkum, 1994; but see Woodward, 2003); once they have done so, they come to associate the object they are attending to and the word they are hearing (Smith, Jones, & Landau, 1996; Plunkett, 1997). The precise details of such claims differ, but they share the view that, regardless of what role social cognition plays in other aspects of word learning, this primary and early-emerging sensitivity to eye gaze is unmediated by any inferences about the speaker\u2019s referential intent.\nThe two accounts can be distinguished by what they predict about how mandatory this sensitivity to eye gaze is. If children use gaze cues out of an understanding that eye gaze reflects the speaker\u2019s meaning, gaze information should be exploited when it reveals the speaker\u2019s intent, but ignored when it is irrelevant or uninformative. We tested this hypothesis in two studies.\nEXPERIMENT 1: VISUAL PERSPECTIVE\nIn Experiment 1, the child and the speaker explored two novel unnamed objects together. Then, in the speaker\u2019s absence, the objects were placed such that the speaker would be able to see only one of them, although the child could see both. The speaker returned, looked at the mutually visible object, and said, \u2018\u2018There\u2019s the [novel word]!\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the [novel word]?\u2019\u2019 If children mandatorily follow eye gaze to a target object when learning a new word, they would be expected to map the word to the mutually visible object in both conditions. Alternatively, if children are sensitive to the speaker\u2019s visual perspective and use gaze information in word learning only when it is informative, they would be expected to disregard eye-gaze cues on where"}, {"heading": "Address correspondence to Erika Nurmsoo, University of Bristol, Department of Experimental Psychology, 12a Priory Rd., Bristol,", "text": "BS8 1TU, Great Britain, e-mail: nurmsoo@aya.yale.edu.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 211Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at UNIV OF MICHIGAN on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\ntrials and instead map the word to the object hidden from the speaker."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Thirty-two older children (M 5 49 months, range 5 46\u201354 months; 16 boys and 16 girls) and 32 younger children (M5 31 months, range 5 25\u201336 months; 13 boys and 19 girls) were tested in a university lab or at their day-care center."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "We used an opaque cardboard screen (32 cm 22 cm) containing two compartments, one with and the other without a window.

These findings might seem surprising, given that older children and adults have difficulty with similar tasks. For example, Epley, Morewedge, and Keysar (2004) explored perspective taking by having a speaker ask participants to move objects from one location to another in an upright array of boxes. They found that 6-year-olds and even adults often failed to take into account the speaker\u2019s visual perspective, responding as if the speaker could see an object that was visible\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 213\nat UNIV OF MICHIGAN on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nonly to the participant (but see Nadig & Sedivy, 2002). This task differs from our own in that it involves a much more complex array of objects and requires participants to determine the referents of existing words, not to make sense of new ones. Our study shows that 4-year-olds, and to some extent 2-year-olds, are able to consider the speaker\u2019s perspective in a referential task when given a simpler context.\nOur findings are consistent with those of Moll and Tomasello (2006), who found that when an adult asked for help searching for an object, 2-year-olds did not offer the object in plain view, but instead fetched the object visible to the child but hidden from the adult. In this task, however, the adult\u2019s eye gaze alternated between the visible object and the location of the hidden object, whereas in the parallel condition in our Experiment 1, the adult\u2019s eye gaze was directed at the mutually visible nontarget object, making the mapping problem more difficult. Although 2-year-olds were not able to correctly select the hidden object on these trials, as a group they did not mistakenly map the novel word to the target of the adult\u2019s gaze.\nThese findings provide support for a pragmatic approach to word learning, in which children do not simply follow surface cues to the speaker\u2019s referential intent, but instead seek to understand the situation as a whole. Studies consistent with this perspective have shown that somewhat older children do not learn a new label despite clear referential cues toward a novel object when the reliability of the speaker is called into question. For example, Koenig and Harris (2005) showed that 4-year-olds, and in some cases 3-year-olds, preferred to learn a novel label from a previously reliable speaker rather than from one who claimed ignorance of the names of familiar objects or who labeled them inaccurately (see also Birch, Vauthier, & Bloom, in press; Jaswal & Neely, 2006; Nurmsoo & Robinson, in press). And Sabbagh and Baldwin (2001) found that when a speaker explicitly claimed ignorance about the correct referent of a novel word (e.g., \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know what a blicket is. Maybe it\u2019s this one.\u2019\u2019), 3- and 4-year-olds did not learn the word. The present set of studies adds to this body of research, by showing that even when faced with a speaker who shows every sign of competent naming, and no uncertainty about the meaning of a novel label, children do not rely solely on eye-gaze cues to determine the referent of the new word, but use additional pragmatic or linguistic information to infer the correct target.\nExperiment 2 demonstrated that when two objects were hidden from the speaker, who could be seen as ignorant about the location of only one of them, 2- to 4-year-olds correctly identified the speaker\u2019s intended referent when she asked, \u2018\u2018Where is the [novel word]?\u2019\u2019 This finding converges with research suggesting that children use other cues to a speaker\u2019s referential intent when eye-gaze information is not sufficient. For example, when preschoolers are told, \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s find the toma,\u2019\u2019 they will map toma to the object that satisfies the searcher even when multiple novel objects are examined (and rejected; Tomasello & Barton, 1994) or when the unseen novel object is hidden in a locked toy\nbarn (Akhtar & Tomasello, 1996). Somewhat older children are sensitive to a speaker\u2019s false beliefs when interpreting the meaning of a novel word used to refer to the contents of a container, mapping the word to the object that the speaker falsely believes is hidden within (Carpenter, Call, & Tomasello, 2002; Happe & Loth, 2002).\nThere is considerable evidence, then, that children will track other cues to a speaker\u2019s referential intent when there are no eyegaze cues that can be used to identify the correct target. We have shown here that preschoolers are sensitive to a speaker\u2019s referential intent even when eye-gaze cues are present and directed at an incorrect target. Preschoolers do not blindly follow the direction of gaze."}]}, {"paper_id": 116, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02136.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 1.0, "Fold_Id": 6.0, "filename": "vul2008.pdf", "title": "Measuring the crowd within: Probabilistic representations within individuals.", "content": [{"heading": "Short Report", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Measuring the Crowd Within", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Probabilistic Representations Within Individuals", "text": "Edward Vul1 and Harold Pashler2\n1Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and 2Department of Psychology,"}, {"heading": "University of California, San Diego", "text": "A crowd often possesses better information than do the individuals it comprises. For example, if people are asked to guess the weight of a prize-winning ox (Galton, 1907), the error of the average response is substantially smaller than the average error of individual estimates. This fact, which Galton interpreted as support for democratic governance, is responsible for the success of polling the audience in the television program \u2018\u2018Who Wants to be a Millionaire\u2019\u2019 (Surowiecki, 2004) and for the superiority of combined over individual financial forecasts (Clemen, 1989). Researchers agree that this wisdom-of-crowds effect depends on a statistical fact: The crowd\u2019s average will be more accurate as long as some of the error of one individual is statistically independent of the error of other individuals\u2014as seems almost guaranteed to be the case.\nWhether a similar improvement can be obtained by averaging two estimates from a single individual is not, a priori, obvious. If one estimate represents the best information available to the person, as common intuition suggests, then a second guess will simply add noise, and averaging the two will only decrease accuracy. Researchers have previously assumed this view and focused on improving the best estimate (Hirt & Markman, 1995; Mussweiler, Strack, & Pfeiffer, 2000; Stewart, 2001).\nAlternatively, initial estimates may represent samples drawn from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministic best guesses. According to this account, the average of two estimates from one person will be more accurate than a single estimate, so long as the noise contained in the two estimates is at least somewhat independent. Ariely et al. (2000) predicted that such a benefit would accrue from averaging probability judgments within one individual, but did not find evidence of such an effect. However, probability judgments are known to be biased toward extreme values (0 or 1), and averaging should not reduce the bias of estimates; if guesses are sampled from an unbiased distribution, however, averaging\nshould reduce error (variance; Laplace, 1812/1878; Wallsten, Budescu, Erev, & Diederich, 1997).\nProbabilistic representations have been postulated in recent models of memory (Steyvers, Griffiths, & Dennis, 2006), perception (Kersten & Yuille, 2003), and neural coding (Ma, Beck, Latham, & Pouget, 2006). It is consistent with such models that responses of many people are distributed probabilistically, as shown by the wisdom-of-crowds effect.

This result indicates that subjects did not produce a second guess by simply perturbing the first; rather, the error of the two guesses was somewhat independent. This benefit of averaging cannot be attributed to subjects\u2019 finding more information between guesses, because second guesses were less accurate than first guesses (see Fig. 1a) in both the immediate condition, t(254)5 3.6, p < .01, and the delayed condition, t(172) 5 2.8, p < .01. Moreover, the benefit of averaging was greater when the second guess was delayed by 3 weeks than when it was immediate; that is, the difference in error between the first guess and the average was greater in the delayed condition than in the immediate condition, t(426)5 2.12, p< .05. The 95% confidence intervals for percentage of error reduced relative to the first guess were [2.5%, 10.4%] in the immediate condition and [11.6%, 20.4%] in the delayed condition. Thus, one benefits from polling the \u2018\u2018crowd\u2019\u2019 within, and the inner crowd grows more effective (independent) when more time elapses between guesses.\nWe compared the efficacy of within-person averaging and across-person averaging via hyperbolic interpolation (see Fig. 1b). The error of the average guess across all people corresponds to the bias of the distribution of beliefs in the population. According to the central limit theorem, if different subjects\u2019 deviations from the group bias are independent, the mean squared error of the average of N guesses from N people should\nbe a hyperbola that converges to the group bias as N goes to infinity. This hyperbola fits the across-person averages perfectly (R2 5 1). However, N guesses from one person are not as beneficial as N guesses from N people. The reduction in mean squared error from averaging N guesses from one person can be described as 1/[1 1 l(N 1)], where l is the proportion of an additional guess from another person that an additional guess from the same person is worth; when l is 1, averaging in a second guess from the same person confers the same benefit as averaging in a second guess from a different person; when l is 0, averaging in a second guess from the same person confers no benefit at all. The value of l can be estimated by interpolating the benefit of within-person averaging onto the hyperbola representing the benefit of across-person averaging. Thus, we computed howmany different-person guesses one would need to average together to attain the same error as in the average of two guesses from one person. This value is 1.11 (l 5 0.11) for two immediate guesses and 1.32 (l5 0.32) for two delayed guesses. Simply put, you can gain about 1/10th as much from asking yourself the same question twice as you can from getting a second opinion from someone else, but if you wait 3 weeks, the benefit of reasking yourself the same question rises to 1/3 the value of a second opinion. One potential explanation of the cost of immediacy is that subjects are biased by their first response to produce less independent samples (a delay mitigates this anchoring effect).\n646 Volume 19\u2014Number 7\nat GEORGIAN COURT UNIV on March 6, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from"}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Although people assume that their first guess about a matter of fact exhausts the best information available to them, a forced second guess contributes additional information, such that the average of two guesses is better than either guess alone.

In the attraction effect, a difficult choice between two options is swayed by the presence of a seemingly irrelevant \u2018\u2018decoy\u2019\u2019 option. We replicated this effect and the finding that the effect increases when people have depleted their mental resources performing a previous self-control task. Our hypothesis was based on the assumption that effortful processes require and consume relatively large amounts of glucose (brain fuel), and that this use of glucose is why people use heuristic strategies after exerting self-control. Before performing any tasks, some participants drank lemonade sweetenedwith sugar,which restores blood glucose, whereas others drank lemonade containing a sugar substitute. Only lemonade with sugar reduced the attraction effect. These results show oneway inwhich the body (blood glucose) interacts with the mind (self-control and reliance on heuristics).\nThe capacity for rational choice based on intelligent analysis and reasoning is one of the most remarkable and distinctive attributes of the human mind. But human decision making does not always adopt such high levels of analysis. Many of the choices people make are quick and effortless, and people\u2019s decisions are often based on previously established heuristics, rather than a thorough application of the strict rules of logic. This inconsistency in human reasoning has been explained\nthrough dual-process accounts of decisionmaking. According to these accounts, one reasoning process makes quick and automatic judgments based on associative and intuitive feedback, and the other process is more effortful and relies on the application of normative rules of reasoning. That judgment outcomes vary across contexts is said to be, in part, a reflection of these complementary systems.\nIn the present research, we sought to establish psychological and physiological causes for the reliance on one decision-making process over the other. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that more blood glucose (which serves as fuel for the brain) is needed for the effortful, rule-based process than for the less effortful process, so that the former type of decision making is impaired when glucose has been depleted by prior, even irrelevant, activities. For our test, we used a specific pattern of intuitive, heuristicbased decision making that has been identified in previous work. We sought to show (a) that the influence of this heuristic is increased when cognitive resources, presumably including blood glucose, have been depleted by prior acts of self-control and (b) that effortful processing can be increased (and the reliance on heuristics reduced) by administering a snack that restores blood glucose to its normal levels."}, {"heading": "TWO DECISION SYSTEMS", "text": "Several accounts have analyzed human reasoning into two complementary processes.

Common to all these models of reasoning is the idea that one of these systems (System 2) is more effortful and rule based, whereas the other (System 1) is relatively effortless and relies on quick associations and heuristics.\nTheories of reasoning differ in their descriptions of the relative adaptiveness of the two systems. For example, early work charting the limitations of human rationality described the heuristic-based System 1 process as both biased and prone to systematic error (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982). Furthermore, Kahneman (2003) proposed that one major purpose of the rule-based System 2 process is to monitor System 1 decisions and to correct them when they are in error. Alternative accounts have characterized System 1 processes as providing a fast and frugal substitute for expensive System 2 thinking (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996), and, indeed, some evidence suggests that the role of intuitive, heuristic strategies is to usurp effortful, analytical processes over time, so that comparable benefits can be achieved with much less effort (Reyna & Ellis, 1994).\nThe aim of the current study was not to compare the adaptive value of the two reasoning systems, but to examine a potential asymmetry in the demands that they exert. We proposed that the effortful System 2 process requires access to limited psychological and physiological resources, and we anticipated that when we manipulated the availability of these resources in a decision-making context, we would observe concordant changes in System 1 versus System 2 processing."}, {"heading": "THE ATTRACTION EFFECT", "text": "Huber, Payne, and Puto (1982; also Simonson, 1989) identified a useful procedure for studying the different reasoning processes. In their study, some participants faced a difficult decision between two options that traded off on important, relevant dimensions. Other participants faced a choice between those same two options plus a third, \u2018\u2018decoy\u2019\u2019 option. The decoy option resembled one of the others but was inferior to it in every respect. Logically, participants should have ruled out the decoy, which would have left them facing the same two options as in the basic, two-option version of the dilemma. Thus, their choices should have exactly paralleled those of the participants who had only those two options to begin with. The researchers found, however, that even though no one chose the decoy, participants came to favor whichever of the original options was similar to the decoy. In other words, the decoy exerted an irrational bias (attraction) on the two prime options. This phenomenon is called the attraction effect or the asymmetric dominance effect.\nBecause the attraction effect exerts a seemingly irrational influence on the decision process, its impact on choice can be\nseen as working through the intuitive System 1 process rather than the rule-based System 2 process. Indeed, Dhar and Simonson (2003) concluded that the attraction effect operates primarily through intuitive and perceptual System 1 processes, and recent findings have suggested that when cognitive (System 2) resources are low, the attraction effect tends to be increased (Pocheptsova, Amir, Dhar, & Baumeister, 2007). Furthermore, work by Simonson (1989) suggests that the attraction effect serves as a likely tiebreaker when thorough, effortful analysis fails to produce a clear preference. Thus, the attraction effect is greatest when analytical System 2 processes fail and the decision-making process defers to System 1."}, {"heading": "DEPLETED RESOURCES AND BLOOD GLUCOSE", "text": "Research on self-regulation and the self\u2019s executive function has established that they rely on a limited resource. Early studies found that after people engaged in one act of self-control, their performance on subsequent and seemingly irrelevant self-control tasks was impaired (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, & Baumeister, 1998). These findings suggested that some resource needed for optimal control on the second task had been depleted during the first task.\nThe limited resource used for self-control is also used for effortful decision making. Vohs et al. (2007) showed that making multiple or difficult decisions led to subsequent decrements in self-control, as if the same vital resource was needed for both kinds of tasks. In an unpublished study, Pocheptsova et al. (2007) reversed this procedure to assess the effects of acts of self-control on subsequent decision making. They found that heuristic-based decision-making processes, including those that drive the attraction effect, were significantly stronger among depleted participants than among those who were not depleted. These findings support the argument that System 1 processes gain increased influence when scarce cognitive resources do not allow for optimal System 2 reasoning.\nWhat is the nature of the resource that is depleted? The lay term willpower has a long history, but has not generally been accorded much respect in psychological theorizing. Gailliot and Baumeister (2007) proposed that willpower is more than a metaphor and that blood glucose may be an important physiological basis for it. Glucose is fuel that is consumed to provide energy for all brain activities, but some brain processes consume much more energy than others. A series of studies byGailliot et al. (2007) showed that blood glucose levels dropped when people performed laboratory tasks that required self-control (but not neutral tasks) and that these low levels of blood glucose were significantly correlated with poor performance on subsequent behavioral measures of selfcontrol. These studies also showed that replenishing blood glucose with a drink containing sugar counteracted the depletion and restored self-control performance to a good level, whereas sugar-free diet drinks had no such effect.\n256 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat UCSF LIBRARY & CKM on March 10, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from"}, {"heading": "THE PRESENT RESEARCH", "text": "In the present experiment, we sought to provide evidence for a causal relation between blood glucose and effortful (System 2) decision processes. To do this, we applied the resource-depletion and glucose-snack manipulations to participants who then confronted the attraction problem. We sought, first, to replicate the attraction effect (Huber et al., 1982), in which the presence of a decoy option (that hardly anyone would actually choose) sways preferences between the other two options. In addition, we sought to replicate the finding that ego depletion, caused by prior exertion of self-control on a seemingly irrelevant task, intensifies the attraction effect (cf. Pocheptsova et al., 2007). To manipulate depletion, we adapted a procedure originally developed by Gilbert, Krull, and Pelham (1988). In this procedure, participants watch a silent video depicting a woman talking while a series of words flashes on the screen. In one condition, participants are instructed to avoid looking at the words, and if they do find themselves looking at the words, they are to bring their attention immediately back to focus on the woman. This task requires the deliberate control of attention and therefore should deplete the limited resources (i.e., willpower and glucose) needed for selfcontrol and other System 2 activities. Other participants watch the same video without any special instructions.\nThe prime goal of this work was to test our novel hypothesis that blood glucose reduces the attraction effect and restores effortful decision making. To do this, we adapted the glucose manipulation used by Gailliot et al. (2007). All participants drank a glass of lemonade, which by random assignment had been sweetenedwith either sugar or Splenda. The latter is a sugar substitute that tastes like real sugar (especially in lemonade). For present purposes, the key is that Splenda does not contribute anything to blood glucose. To the extent that effortful choice requires blood glucose, Splenda should not restore the necessary resources for effortful thought as effectively as sugar does.\nOurmain prediction was therefore that the attraction effect would be stronger among depleted participants (i.e., those who had performed a previous task requiring self-control) who drank lemonade made with Splenda. We reasoned that their blood glucose levels would have been reduced by the prior act of self-control, and that lemonade made with Splenda would be useless for raising those levels back to normal. In contrast, we predicted that participants who were depleted but then consumed sugar would be restored to a normal level of blood glucose and therefore would be less prone to rely on the heuristic, low-effort decision-making style.\nWe also included conditions in which nondepleted participants drank either kind of lemonade. Our prediction was that when blood glucose was already at a normal level, there would be no benefit to be gained from consuming additional sugar, and so the type of lemonade would make no difference. These participants would show at best a weak attraction effect. But if the type of lemonade had some effect on decision making other than by counteracting depletion, we would be able to find that\neffect by examining the choices made by these nondepleted participants."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "One hundred twenty-one participants took part in the experiment in exchange for partial credit in their psychology course.

They were told they would first drink and rate a beverage and then form an impression of someone by watching a video.\nAfter giving informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to receive a lemonade beverage that had been sweetened with either sugar (glucose condition) or Splenda (placebo condition). The lemonade was administered first because it takes time (10\u201312 min) for glucose to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Neither the experimenter nor the participant was aware of which sweetener had been used. The experimenter then left the room while participants rated the drink for quality of taste, pleasantness, and how difficult it was to drink. A 4-min period was allocated for these ratings (partly to allow time for the glucose to be metabolized). Participants were instructed to sit quietly after completing the ratings and to await the experimenter\u2019s return.\nAfter 4 min, the experimenter returned and gave participants instructions for the impression-formation task. Participants were told that they would watch a 6-min video (without sound) of a woman being interviewed by an off-camera interviewer. The experimenter said that the research was aimed at elucidating how people interpret nonverbal behaviors. As the woman was interviewed, the video displayed a series of common words (e.g., shoe) for 10 s each. These words appeared in black text in a white box in the lower portion of the screen. By random assignment, half the participants were instructed not to read or look at any of the words (depletion condition). If they caught themselves looking at the words, they were supposed to redirect their gaze immediately to the woman. The other half of the participants were given no such instructions (no-depletion condition).\nAfter participants watched the video, they completed the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS; Mayer & Gaschke, 1988). The combination of the 4-min lemonade manipulation, the 6-min video, and the BMIS ensured that more than 10 min had elapsed since participants drank the lemonade, so we assumed that by the time they completed the BMIS, the sugar was metabolized and was therefore becoming available as glucose in the bloodstream.

The simple and seemingly unrelated act of drinking a beverage sweetened with sugar restored the capacity for effortful, System 2 reasoning and decreased reliance on heuristic-based System 1 reasoning, thereby decreasing the observed attraction effect.\nIn recent years, most interest in the mind-body interface has focused on the brain, but the brain depends on the body for its fuel. Specifically, brain processes use energy from glucose in the bloodstream. Although all brain activities require some of that fuel, some activities are much more expensive than others in the sense that they consume a notable amount of the supply and therefore deplete what is left in the blood. Recent work has indicated that self-control is one such expensive process (Gailliot et al., 2007). The present work suggests that effortful decision making is another process that draws heavily on the same resource. Most important, we showed that the outcome of a decision process could be changed by manipulations aimed at increasing or decreasing the available supply of blood glucose.\nMany dual-process models of reasoning posit that expensive and effortful choice is a key criterion for distinguishing between modes of decision making (e.g., Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Kahneman, 2003; Reyna&Ellis, 1994), and the current data are consistent with this view. Previous work on self-control suggests that the feature common to expensive (and hence depleting) cognitive processes is that they require active and effortful guidance by the self, usually to select between many potential thoughts, rules, or behaviors (Baumeister et al., 1998). If System 2 reasoning strategies share a limited resource with self-control, then it is plausible that System 2 decision making may be defined by a similar deliberation by the self. Thus, System 2 decision making may involve analyses that are expensive and effortful, and that enable people to choose between multiple options.\nAlternative models of reasoning have characterized System 2 processes primarily as logical (De Neys, 2006; Epstein, 1994) or based on the application of rules (Sloman, 1996). Tomodify such models, we propose that the difference between rule- or logicbased processes and heuristic-based processes may be meaningful only when the former involve effortful choice. In decisionmaking contexts in which the conclusions or the means for obtaining them have been previously established (thereby obviating choice), an application of normative rules is more likely to resemble heuristic strategies than the effortful and analytical strategies that rely on blood glucose. For example, long division requires an application of the normative rules of math and logic, but the rules to be applied have been predetermined. Therefore, the methods for long division and similar rule-of-thumb processes are not likely to exert the same demands as effortful forms of rule-based choice. The proper complement to heuristic-based processing may be not rule-based processing per se, but rather the effortful rule-based processing that is required for making novel decisions. It is perhaps only the latter type of decision making that one can expect to be impaired when cognitive resources are scarce or need to be conserved.\nFurthermore, the current data may speak to the relationship between the two systems of decision making. We found that heuristic influence was more prevalent when physiological resources were low than when they were at baseline levels. Thus, although some models have described the development of decision making as progress away from expensive analysis and toward more efficient, intuitive strategies (Reyna & Ellis, 1994), heuristics may not usurp System 2 processes completely. The current findings suggest that as heuristics form, they may serve as a default strategy, rather than as a blanket replacement for costly System 2 thinking. This idea is consistent with Kahneman\u2019s (2003) view of System 2 as a monitor of System 1 output. Although System 1 decisions are the default, System 2 processes may override System 1 processes when their conclusions are undesirable. According to this view, a lack of System 2 resources should not affect heuristic processing when heuristics produce perfectly sound conclusions, which some models of decision\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 259\nat UCSF LIBRARY & CKM on March 10, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nmaking suggest they generally do (e.g., Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Reyna & Ellis, 1994). But when a heuristic can be seen as irrelevant or irrational, as happens in the case of the attraction effect in the current study, its influence will be conditional upon whether cognitive resources are at an adequate level for System 2 processes to override it.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We are grateful to the Templeton Foun-\ndation for funding this project.

The ERN is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the medial prefrontal cortex implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. Affective and motivational variables influence the magnitude of the ERN, which suggests that the ERN may relate to emotional or motivational aspects of error detection. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the ERN may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors. We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors. Thus, response errors prime defensive motivation\u2014and the ERN predicts individual differences in the aversive response to errors.\nResearch on error processing has grown over the past 15 years, in part because of the discovery of the error-related negativity (ERN; Falkenstein, Hohnsbein, Hoormann, & Blanke, 1991; Gehring, Coles, Meyer, & Donchin, 1995). The ERN is a sharp negative deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) that peaks approximately 50 ms after an unintended response (Falkenstein, Hoormann, Christ, & Hohnsbein, 2000). The ERN is maximal over fronto-central recording sites, and evidence from source localization (Holroyd, Dien, & Coles, 1998), intracerebral recording (Brazdil, 2005), and magnetoencephalography (Miltner et al., 2003) indicates that the ERN is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC is richly interconnected with both limbic and prefrontal areas of the brain, and is ideally situated to respond to, and integrate, cognitive and affective information (Bush, Luu, & Posner, 2000).\nAlthough the ERN is known to occur immediately following the commission of an error, there remains considerable debate as to its functional significance and the specific process it indexes. Computational models suggest that the ERN reflects either the coactivation of erroneous and error-correcting responses (conflict theory; Yeung, Cohen, & Botvinick, 2004) or the evaluation, based on expectations developed during learning history, that events are worse than anticipated (reinforcementlearning theory; Holroyd & Coles, 2002). Both the conflict and reinforcement-learning theories, then, highlight specific cognitive functions subserved by the ACC in their conceptualization of the ERN.\nGiven the involvement of the ACC in pain, depressed mood, and other distressed states, Luu, Collins, and Tucker (2000) proposed that the ERN may signify affective processing in response to errors. In fact, there is ample evidence that the ERN can be modulated by motivational and affective variables (cf. Hajcak, Moser, Yeung, & Simons, 2005). In between-groups designs, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (Gehring, Himle, & Nisenson, 2000; Hajcak, Franklin, Foa, & Simons, in press; Hajcak & Simons, 2002), depression (Chiu & Deldin, 2007), and more generalized anxiety (Hajcak, McDonald, & Simons, 2003a, 2004) have exhibited increased ERNs compared with control participants\u2014a finding consistent with the notion that affective psychopathology is associated with hyperresponsivity to negative information. Other studies have suggested a possible relation between the ERN and individual differences in punishment sensitivity (Boksem, Tops, Wester, Meijman, & Lorist, 2006; Dikman & Allen, 2000). It is important to note that most of these results cannot be accounted for simply by differences in error rates and reaction time, and they suggest that the ERN varies as a function of motivational states and traits.\nIn a broader context, errors are maladaptive responses that may place an organism in danger and threaten its safety. It stands to reason that error detection should prompt defensive motivation\u2014and rapidly activate those reflexes and dispositions toward action that protect the organism (Gray, 1994).

Although errors prompt heart rate deceleration and skin conductance responses (Hajcak, McDonald, & Simons, 2003b, 2004), this pattern of autonomic reactivity is consistent with either an orienting or a defensive response to errors (Cook & Turpin, 1997).\nThe human startle response, in contrast, is a well-validated and specific measure of defensive activation (Lang, 1993; Lang, Davis, & O\u0308hman, 2000). The startle response is a reflex in which the body contracts into a defensive posture and is typically measured in humans by recording blink magnitude from the obicularis oculi in response to a sudden and loud acoustic probe. The magnitude of the startle response can be modulated by aversive stimuli and settings: Startle is potentiated when participants view threatening stimuli (Bradley, Codispoti, & Lang, 2006; Bradley, Moulder, & Lang, 2005; Lang et al., 2000) and when they anticipate an electric shock (Curtin, Patrick, Lang, Cacioppo, & Birbaume, 2001; Grillon, Ameli, Merikangas, Woods, & Davis, 1993). These findings are consistent with the notion that aversive stimuli prime defensive reflexes.\nIn the present study, we sought to determine whether defensive responding would similarly be increased following errors, compared with correct responses. To evaluate this possibility, we measured the human startle response 300 ms following errors and correct responses. We hypothesized that startle responses would be larger after errors than after correct responses. To evaluate the role of startle predictability, we included both predictable and unpredictable startle probes on correct trials. Additionally, we simultaneously measured error-related brain activity to determine whether individuals with larger ERNs would demonstrate greater startle potentiation following errors. If the ERN reflects a motivationally relevant correlate of error processing, larger ERNs should predict greater startle potentiation following errors."}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": "Thirty-one undergraduate students (26 male, 5 female) participated in this study. No participants discontinued their participation in the experiment once it had begun, and all received course credit for their participation.\nThe task was an arrow version of the flankers task (cf. Hajcak et al., 2005). On each trial, five horizontally aligned arrowheads were presented, and participants had to respond to the direction of the central arrowhead by pressing the left or right mouse button. On compatible trials, all five arrowheads pointed in the same direction (either left or right), and on incompatible trials, the central arrowhead pointed in the direction opposite the direction of the flanking arrowheads. Compatible and incompatible trials were equally frequent, and all stimuli were presented for 200 ms with an intertrial interval that varied randomly from 500 to 1,000 ms. Participants performed eight blocks of 30 trials. At the end of each block, participants received performance feedback designed to encourage fast and accurate re-\nsponding. If performance was 75% correct or lower, the message \u2018\u2018Please try to be more accurate\u2019\u2019 was displayed; performance above 90% correct was followed by \u2018\u2018Please try to respond faster\u2019\u2019; if performance was between these levels, the message \u2018\u2018You\u2019re doing a great job\u2019\u2019 was displayed. All participants performed one practice block of 30 trials.\nThe startle response was measured using standard procedures for assessing defensive reactivity (Bradley et al., 2005, 2006; Curtin et al., 2001; Grillon et al., 1993; Lang et al., 2000): Startle was elicited with a 105-dB burst of white noise that had a 50-ms duration and instantaneous rise time. The startle probe was delivered on 10% of all trials in the practice block; in the actual experiment, startle probes were presented on 50% of error trials, on 50%of correct trials that followed errors, and on a random 4% of other correct trials. Thus, some startle probes were predictable (after both errors and correct trials that followed errors), whereas others were not (randomly selected correct trials). Accordingly, there were three trial types: error trials, predictable correct trials (i.e., correct trials on which the startle probe was predictable), and unpredictable correct trials (i.e., correct trials on which the startle probe was not predictable). In all cases, the startle probe was presented 300 ms after the response.\nContinuous electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded using an ActiveTwo head cap and the ActiveTwo BioSemi system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Recordings were taken from 64 scalp electrodes based on the ten-twenty system, as well as from two electrodes placed on the left and right mastoids. The electrooculogram (EOG) generated from blinks and eye movements was recorded from four facial electrodes: two approximately 1 cm above and below the participant\u2019s right eye, one approximately 1 cm to the left of the left eye, and one approximately 1 cm to the right of the right eye. The startle response was measured with two electrodes placed approximately 12 mm apart under the participant\u2019s left eye on the obicularis muscle. As per BioSemi\u2019s design, the ground electrode during acquisition was formed by the Common Mode Sense active electrode and the Driven Right Leg passive electrode. All bioelectric signals were digitized on a laboratory microcomputer using ActiView software (BioSemi). Sampling was at 1024 Hz.\nOff-line analysis was performed using Brain Vision Analyzer software (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). For the startle data, EMG activity was band-pass filtered (28\u2013512 Hz; 24 dB/ octave roll-off), rectified, then low-pass filtered at 30 Hz (24 dB/ octave) and baseline-corrected. Individual trials were examined and rejected if the startle reflex began less than 20 ms following probe onset. The number of excluded startle trials was 1.42 (SD 5 1.43) for predictable correct trials, 1.42 (SD5 1.57) for unpredictable correct trials, and 2.26 (SD 5 2.42) for error trials.\nEEG data were rereferenced to the numeric mean of the mastoids and band-pass filtered with cutoffs of 0.1 and 30 Hz. The EEG was segmented for each trial, beginning 200 ms before\n104 Volume 19\u2014Number 2\nat KAI NAN UNIV on March 7, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nthe response and continuing for 800 ms. The EEG was corrected for blinks and eye movements using the method developed by Gratton, Coles, and Donchin (1983). Specific intervals for individual channels were rejected in each trial using a semiautomated procedure, with physiological artifacts identified by the following criteria: a voltage step of more than 50.0 mV between sample points, a voltage difference of more than 300.0 mVwithin a trial, and a maximum voltage difference of less than 0.50 mV within a 100-ms interval. The average number of trials excluded from ERP analyses was 2.03 (SD5 5.22), or 0.87% of possible trials.\nStartle response magnitudes and latencies were quantified in terms of the peak in the 20- to 120-ms window after the presentation of the startle probe. The ERN was defined as the average activity in a 0- to 100-ms window following response onset on error trials. The ERN and startle responses were statistically evaluated using SPSS (Version 14.0) General Linear Model software, with Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied to p values associated with multiple-df, repeated measures comparisons."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "On average, participants made 23.39 (SD5 9.68) errors. Figure 1 presents the average startle magnitude as a function of trial type. As hypothesized, the magnitude of the startle response differed as a function of trial type, F(2, 60)5 5.64, p< .05. Post hoc one-tailed t tests confirmed that startle magnitudes were larger following errors than following correct trials, whether the startle was predictable, t(30)5 2.51, p< .01, or unpredictable, t(30) 5 2.61, p < .01; startle magnitude did not vary as a function of predictability on correct trials, t(30)5 0.99, p> .30. Across participants, the magnitude of the error-potentiated startle did not correlate with the number of errors (r5 .06, p > .75). Although the latency of the startle response was shorter when the probe was predictable (error trials: M 5 96 ms, SD 5 24 ms; predictable correct trials:M5 92 ms, SD5 20 ms) than when it was unpredictable (unpredictable correct trials: M 5 100 ms, SD 5 20 ms), this difference was not statistically significant, F(2, 60) 5 1.46, p > .20.\nThe illustration in Figure 2 shows the scalp topography of the difference in ERPs between error and correct trials in the 0- to 100-ms window following responses. At FCz, where the difference was numerically maximal, a one-sample t test confirmed that the ERN was significantly less than zero, t(30) 5 3.83, p < .001. Grand-average ERP waveforms for correct and error trials at FCz are presented on the right in Figure 1. The ERN is evident as the negative deflection that peaks approximately 50 ms after an incorrect response.\nTo determine whether themagnitude of the ERN predicted the increase in startle following errors, we first defined startle potentiation for each participant as the startle magnitude after errors minus the average of startle responses on predictable correct and unpredictable correct trials. The amplitude of the ERN predicted the degree to which errors potentiated the startle response (see Fig. 2; r5 .38, p< .05).1 Because themagnitude of the ERN is negative and startle potentiation following errors is positive, this negative correlation indicates that individuals with larger error-related brain activity were characterized by larger increases in startle responses after errors."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to use startle methodology to directly evaluate affective processing following errors. Our findings are consistent with the notion that errors prompt defensive motivation: Startle magnitude was larger after the commission of errors than after correct responses. Our data indicate that, like threatening stimuli and the anticipation of shock, which have previously been shown to increase the startle response (Bradley et al., 2006; Grillon et al., 1993), errors also potentiate reflexes that are inherently defensive. These data fit well within previous work demonstrating peripheral autonomic response to errors (Hajcak et al., 2003b, 2004), but go further to suggest that errors prompt both orienting and defensive responses.\nIn the present study, larger startle potentiation following errors was predicted by an increased ERNmagnitude. Notably, the magnitude of the error-potentiated startle was not related to the size of the error positivity\u2014the positive deflection in the ERP that follows the ERN. This suggests that early error processing indexed by the ERN may uniquely serve to prime defensive\n1The error positivity (Pe) was scored at Pz, where it was maximal, as the average activity in a 200- to 400-ms postresponse window on error trials on which a startle probe was not presented; unlike the ERN, however, the Pe did not correlate with the magnitude of the error-potentiated startle (r 5 .04, p > .80). Across participants, the magnitudes of the ERN and Pe were both uncorrelated with the number of errors (r 5 .21, p > .30, and r 5 .33, p > .05, respectively). To determine whether the inclusion of startle probes in the present study might have made errors unusually aversive and increased the ERN, we ran 36 participants in a paradigm that was identical except that no startle probes were presented. The mean ERN in those participants ( 3.32 mV, SD 5 6.11 mV) did not differ from the mean ERN in the present study ( 3.54 mV, SD 5 6.52 mV), t(65) 5 0.21, p > .60. This finding suggests that the presence of startle probes did not influence the magnitude of the ERN.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 2 105\nat KAI NAN UNIV on March 7, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nmotivational systems. Current computational models suggest that the ERN signals the need to increase cognitive control following errors (Holroyd & Coles, 2002; Yeung et al., 2004). The present data, however, suggest that the ERN may also serve a more basic motivational function: to activate defensive systems in the service of protecting the organism. This view is consistent with existing data relating the ERN to sensitivity to negative, but not positive, stimuli and feedback (Boksem et al., 2006; Frank, Woroch, & Curran, 2005).\nSeveral studies have provided evidence supporting a relation between the ERN and individual differences in emotionality: Individuals who experience more anxiety and sensitivity to punishment have larger ERNs (Boksem et al., 2006; Hajcak et al., 2003a, 2004; Luu et al., 2000). Increased startle responses and an increased ERN have both been related to heightened risk for anxiety disorders (Grillon, 2002). Moreover, the current data suggest that individuals with increased ERNs process errors as more threatening and aversive. That is, anxious individuals who are characterized by increased ERNs may exhibit a greater defensive response to errors compared with nonanxious individuals. Within Gray\u2019s (1994) theory, these data are consistent with\nthe notion that the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) responds to signals of nonreward and punishment, and that functioning of the BIS relates to the experience of anxiety and fear.We are currently pursuing a line of research relating the BIS, ERN, and errorpotentiated startle to further evaluate this possibility.\nIn the present study, startle probes were presented just 300ms after both correct and erroneous responses. Thus, the facilitated startle following errors appears to reflect relatively rapid defensive mobilization. An important unanswered issue concerns the mechanism whereby errors rapidly increase defensive responding. In light of the association between the ERN and error-potentiated startle, one possibility is that early ACC activity directly activates circuits in the brain (e.g., the amygdala) that are critical to defensive mobilization and startle potentiation. Future studies might further examine the time course of error-potentiated startle\u2014to determine how early the potentiated startle begins, and for how long it persists, following errors. Additional research might also examine the underlying mechanisms whereby errors increase the startle response.\nAlthough errors may directly prime startle, it is also possible that emotional valence mediates the relation between error\n106 Volume 19\u2014Number 2\nat KAI NAN UNIV on March 7, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\ndetection and increased startle, and other peripheral psychophysiological measures, such as facial EMG, could be used to test this possibility. It is worth acknowledging that in the present study, startle probes were presented on amuch larger percentage of error than correct trials. This was necessary in light of the fact that errors are relatively rare in speeded response tasks. Although startle probes were therefore more predictable on error than on correct trials, we manipulated predictability on correct trials. Although the magnitude of the startle response on correct trials was equivalent when the probe was predictable and when it was unpredictable, it is possible that the presence of startle probes made errors particularly aversive. This possibility could be evaluated in future studies by asking participants how they felt about making mistakes both in a condition with startle probes and in a condition without startle probes.\nOverall, the current study indicates that errors are motivationally salient events that prime defensive systems: The startle response is potentiated following errors, compared with correct responses. Insofar as the magnitude of the ERN predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors, these data further highlight the role of the ERN in affective and motivational responses to errors. Following previous work on the ERN and startle, future studies should evaluate how error-potentiated startle varies as a function of individual difference variables.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We give special thanks to E.

We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.\nAs people go about their daily lives, they seem to effortlessly manage the extremely rich and detailed stream of information entering their eyes. For the most part, people successfully navigate through busy intersections; find items of interest, such as food or friends; and understand complex social situations\u2014 all just by the simple act of looking. However, despite these many successes, there are also countless demonstrations that people fail to notice potentially important visual events, particularly when their attention is focused elsewhere. For example, traffic accidents often involve drivers \u2018\u2018not seeing\u2019\u2019 clearly visible obstacles (e.g., McLay, Anderson, Sidaway, & Wilder, 1997). Such occurrences are typically interpreted as attentional\nlapses: It seems that people have a severely limited ability to perceive, understand, and act upon information that falls outside the current focus of attention.\nEven when attention is focused intensely on a particular object, however, people do not experience \u2018\u2018blindness\u2019\u2019 for all other visual information. The purpose of the current study was to probe what type of representation can be maintained outside the focus of attention. In so doing, we emphasized the distinction between local visual features and statistical summary features. Local visual features are properties that describe an individual item, independently of other items. For example, the size and the location of an individual object are local visual features. In contrast, there are a variety of statistical summary features that represent information at a more abstract level, collapsing across local details (Ariely, 2001; Chong & Treisman, 2003, 2005b). For the present study, we focused on relatively simple summary features, such as the center of mass of a collection of objects (henceforth, the \u2018\u2018centroid\u2019\u2019), which is essentially the mean position of the group. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that withdrawing attention impairs perception of local features more than it impairs the perception of summary features.\nObject location was used as a test case for investigating whether summary features can be represented more robustly than local visual features outside the focus of attention. We used a multiple-object-tracking task (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988) in which eight objects moved around the display. The primary task was to attentively track a subset of four target objects while ignoring four distractor objects. This attentionally demanding tracking task drew focal attention toward the targets and away from the distractors (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Sears & Pylyshyn, 2000). At a random time during each trial, all items disappeared briefly (200 ms), and then all but one or four randomly chosen targets or distractors reappeared. Participants had to localize either the single missing item (individual test) or the centroid of the missing group of items (centroid test). Because distractors receive less attention than targets, we predicted that Address correspondence to George Alvarez, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, 46-4078, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, e-mail: alvarez@ mit.edu.\n392 Volume 19\u2014Number 4Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science\nlocalizing missing distractors would be more difficult than localizing missing targets. However, of principal interest was whether the distractor centroid would be represented more robustly than the individual distractor positions, indicating a relative sparing of summary features outside the attentional focus.\nAcross three experiments, we varied the extent to which subjects could selectively attend to targets. In Experiment 1, targets and distractors were physically identical and moved among each other, making selective target processing most difficult. In Experiment 2, targets were white and distractors were black, and this separation of targets from distractors in feature space facilitated target selection. In Experiment 3, targets and distractors were again identical, but target selection was facilitated by spatially separating targets from distractors, such that the focus of attention was far removed from the distractors. We found that selective processing of the targets improved in Experiments 2 and 3 relative to Experiment 1, to the extent that in Experiments 2 and 3, participants performed at chance level when asked to localize a single missing distractor. In contrast, we found in all experiments that participants could accurately localize the distractor centroid, even when individual distractors were localized at chance levels.

However, the amount of attention was not enough to localize individual distractors as accurately as individual targets.\nIn contrast, there was no significant difference in localization error for targets and distractors in the centroid-test condition, t(7) 5 1.07, p 5 .321, r2 5 .14 (see Fig. 2b). Thus, despite noisy individual representations of distractor locations\u2014as evidenced by error on the individual tests\u2014participants could determine the location of the distractor centroid as well as the location of the target centroid. Performance was again better than chance for both targets, t(7) 5 4.08, p 5 .005, r2 5 .70, and distractors, t(7) 5 5.48, p 5 .001, r2 5 .81.\nCould this remarkable level of accuracy in localizing distractor centroids be achieved by sampling just one or two distractors and making an informed guess about where the centroid would be located? To assess this possibility, we ran Monte Carlo simulations to determine how well participants could judge the location of the distractor centroid by pooling one, two, three, or four noisy individual samples. We assumed that estimates of individual item positions are noisy and estimated the amount of noise from performance on the individual tests. The distribution of errors was approximately normal, and so the model assumed that each individual item position was represented with independent, normally distributed noise with a standard deviation estimated separately for each observer. For example, if each distractor\u2019s position could be estimated within 41 1.51 on average for a given observer, we could simulate how accurately the centroid of all four distractors could be determined if one, two, three, or four estimates were averaged. The results of this simulation suggested that, given how noisy the individual estimates appeared to be, participants would have had to pool signals from all the distractors to achieve the level of accuracy we observed. Guessing any four random positions on the screen and pooling those estimates would not yield this level of performance; only if these very noisy individual estimates were centered on the actual distractor positions would pooling them enable participants to localize the centroids as accurately as they did.1\nIt appears that observers can make accurate judgments about distractors as a group by pooling information from all the individual distractors, even when the individual details of the distractors are not represented accurately. This suggests that observers maintain some awareness of the summary features of items appearing outside the focus of attention, even when local\n1A supplementary appendix providing the details of all simulations reported in this article can be obtained directly from the first author or downloaded online at http://cvcl.mit.edu/george/Publications.htm.\n394 Volume 19\u2014Number 4\ninformation is represented inaccurately. However, because the targets and distractors were physically identical in Experiment 1, it is possible that participants could not completely filter out the distractor items, or that distractors were occasionally confused for targets, and therefore that distractors received enough attention to improve localization of the distractor centroid. Indeed, participants could localize distractors at better than chance levels, which suggests that some attention \u2018\u2018spilled over\u2019\u2019 to the distractors. Experiments 2 and 3 tested how improving selective processing of targets affects the localization of individuals and their centroid.\nEXPERIMENT 2: INCREASED TARGET SELECTION USING A SALIENT FEATURE DIFFERENCE\nPrevious work has demonstrated that what people see depends on how they tune their attention\u2014their attentional set\u2014such that irrelevant information is more likely to be noticed or processed if it matches the physical properties of attended items (Most, Scholl, Clifford, & Simons, 2005; Most et al., 2001). However, there appears to be little to no perception of information that falls outside the attentional set. For instance, the appearance of an irrelevant black item will go undetected when participants attend to white items, especially if the distractors are black (Most et al., 2001). In Experiment 2, we increased the degree to which targets could be selectively attended by making the targets white and the distractors black. Continuous tracking of the targets was still required, because the primary task was to count the number of times a target touched a red line in the display. Of principal interest was whether participants would still be capable of accurately judging the location of the distractor centroid, even when the distractors fall outside the attentional set."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "All aspects of the stimuli and procedure were the same as in Experiment 1, except that the targets were white instead of black."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Counting errors did not vary with the type of localization test (individual vs. centroid), F< 1, or with the type of item that was missing (target vs. distractor), F < 1. Error in the guessing phase averaged 9.41 (SEM 5 0.11) for individual tests and 5.31 (SEM 5 0.11) for centroid tests (see the dashed lines in Fig. 3).\nAs in Experiment 1, localization accuracy showed different patterns in the individual-test and centroid-test conditions. As Figure 3a illustrates, error in reporting the location of a single missing item was significantly lower for targets than for distractors, t(7) 5 4.44, p 5 .003, r2 5 .74. Error was below the empirical chance estimate for targets, t(7) 5 5.18, p 5 .001, r2 5 .79, but, as expected, was not better than chance for distractors, t(7) 5 1.00, p 5 .350, r2 5 .13. This indicates that the salient\nfeature difference was effective in enhancing selective target processing.\nAs Figure 3b illustrates, in the centroid condition, there was a significant difference in localization error for targets and distractors, t(7) 5 3.37, p 5 .012, r2 5 .62, but most important, performance was better than chance for both targets, t(7) 5 8.32, p < .001, r2 5 .91, and distractors, t(7) 5 7.47, p < .001, r2 5 .89. Thus, even though the individual position of any single distractor was so poorly represented that performance was at chance for individual judgments, participants could determine the location of the distractor centroid well above chance level.\nSimulation results again suggested that participants would have had to pool signals from all the distractors to achieve the level of accuracy we observed. Thus, it appears that an accurate representation of the distractor centroid can be attained by pooling noisy local signals, even when target selection is facilitated by a salient feature difference between targets and distractors.\nPrevious work suggests that attention is focally allocated to targets in a multiple-object-tracking task and does not spread over the space between targets (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Sears & Pylyshyn, 2000), as if there were multiple, independent foci of attention (Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005). Nevertheless, the targets in Experiments 1 and 2 were often distributed across the display such that the \u2018\u2018virtual polygon,\u2019\u2019 or convex hull, formed by the targets encompassed several of the distractors. It is possible that distractors frequently received diffuse attention in these displays, and that this attention was insufficient for the local computations necessary to accurately judge the individual distractor locations, but sufficient for accurate judgments about the centroid of the distractors (Chong & Treisman, 2005a). In Experiment 3, we investigated this possibility.\nEXPERIMENT 3: WITHDRAWING ATTENTION FROM THE DISTRACTOR REGION\nIn Experiment 3, we attempted to withdraw participants\u2019 attention from the region of space containing distractors by con-\nVolume 19\u2014Number 4 395\nstraining the targets and distractors to move in opposite halves of the display. Targets were randomly constrained to move within the top, bottom, left, or right half of the screen, and distractors were constrained to move within the opposite half of the screen. As in the previous experiments, continuous tracking of the targets was required, because the primary task was to count the number of times targets touched a red line in the display. However, the spatial separation between the targets and distractors ensured that distractors never fell within the convex hull formed by the targets. Of principal interest was whether this manipulation would eliminate participants\u2019 ability to make accurate judgments about the distractor centroid."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "All aspects of the stimuli and procedure were the same as in Experiment 1, except that targets remained spatially separate from the distractors for the entirety of each trial."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Counting errors did not vary systematically with the type of localization test (individual vs. centroid), F(1, 7) 5 2.53, p 5 .156, Zp 2 \u00bc :27, or with the type of item that was missing (target vs. distractor), F< 1. Error in the guessing phase was on average 7.91 (SEM 5 0.51) for individual tests and 4.51 (SEM 5 0.31) for centroid tests (see the dashed lines in Fig. 4).\nAs Figure 4a illustrates, error in reporting the location of a single missing item was significantly lower for targets than for distractors, t(7) 5 3.28, p 5 .013, r2 5 .61. Error was below the empirical chance estimate for targets, t(7) 5 4.26, p 5 .004, r2 5 .72, but not for distractors, t < 1. As Figure 4b illustrates, localization error in the centroid condition was significantly lower for targets than for distractors, t(7) 5 3.17, p 5 .016, r2 5 .59, but centroid localization was better than chance for both targets, t(7) 5 8.32, p < .001, r2 5 .88, and distractors, t(7) 5 2.76, p 5 .028, r2 5 .52.

Nevertheless, the results again showed that participants could accurately judge the location of the centroid of distractors with high accuracy, with performance again well better than chance. Simulations suggested that this level of accuracy could have been attained only if (a) noisy individual estimates from all the distractors were pooled together, and (b) the noisy individual estimates were centered around the actual positions of the distractors, and were not truly random guesses. Thus, the distractor centroid can be represented accurately even when targets and distractors are spatially separated, such that target selection is facilitated and distractors are kept far from the focus of attention."}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "Visual information can be represented at multiple levels of abstraction, from local details to abstract features that summarize the local details. We used object location as a test case to explore the representation of local versus summary visual features outside the focus of attention. The location of an individual object is a local detail, whereas the centroid of a collection of objects is a simple summary feature that represents the objects as a group. In an adapted multiple-object-tracking task, participants were required to attentively track a set of moving targets while ignoring a set of moving distractors. During the tracking task, all of the items disappeared briefly (200 ms), and then all but one or four randomly chosen items reappeared; the secondary task was to localize the missing items. The results suggested that although participants knew very little about the local details of individual distractors, they could accurately report the centroid of the distractors.\nThese findings are related to previous findings concerning inattentional blindness and change blindness. Inattentionalblindness studies have shown that without attention, there is little or no consciously accessible representation of a scene (Mack & Rock, 1998; Neisser & Becklen, 1975). These studies typically aim for participants to completely withdraw attention from the tested items, and sometimes even actively inhibit information outside of the attentional set (Most et al., 2001). In contrast, observers in our task were attempting to monitor all information, but the primary task required them to focus attention on a particular subset of that information. Thus, we assume that our observers were aware of, and paying some attention to, all information in the display. For this reason, our study is more related to change-blindness studies, in which displays consist of two alternating scenes that differ in one aspect (e.g., a single item changes color). In such studies, ob-\n396 Volume 19\u2014Number 4\nservers often fail to notice substantial differences between the scenes, and this finding has been interpreted as reflecting a failure to represent information outside the focus of attention (Rensink, O\u2019Regan, & Clark, 1997). However, these studies have typically manipulated local features, such as the color or orientation of an individual object. Less is known about how well summary visual features are represented outside the focus of attention in the change-detection paradigm. The current results suggest that changes to local feature information outside the focus of attention are unlikely to be noticed, unless the changes alter the summary statistics of the scene.\nPrevious work suggests that processing of summary statistics is improved when observers spread their attention diffusely (Chong & Treisman, 2005a), and Treisman (2006) has argued that summary statistics are computed automatically when attention is spread diffusely. The current results suggest that even when attention is focally allocated to a subset of items, summary features can be computed outside the focus of attention. Most important, the representation of these summary features is more robust to the withdrawal of attention than is the representation of local visual features. Surprisingly, our experiments show that even when local features are so poorly represented that they are identified at chance levels, it is possible to pool estimates of those local details and attain an accurate representation of the group outside the focus of attention. However, whether the centroid position of distractors is computed only when required by the task demands, or whether it is computed automatically, remains an open question to be addressed by future research.\nAlthough object location was particularly well suited for an initial investigation into the representation of summary features outside the focus of attention, it is important to recognize that there are many other types of summary features. In general, other researchers have referred to these features as global features (Navon, 1977; Oliva & Torralba, 2001), holistic features (Kimchi, 1992), or sets (Ariely, 2001; Chong & Treisman, 2003, 2005b). We refer to these types of features under the umbrella term ensemble visual features. We use the term ensemble because other terms carry certain connotations that do not accurately represent our view of what counts as a summary statistic. Specifically, the terms global and holistic are often used interchangeably with low spatial frequency, and the term set is often used to refer to collections of discrete objects. But ensemble refers to any summary statistic that collapses across individual image details, whether or not those details are contained within a specific spatial-frequency band, and whether those details are attached to discrete objects, parts, or a location in space. Moreover, an ensemble can include relatively simple features, such as the mean size or the centroid of a collection of objects, or more complex features, such as particular combinations of local orientation and spatial-frequency information (Parkes, Lund, Angelucci, Solomon, & Morgan, 2001; Torralba, Oliva, Castelhano, & Henderson, 2006)."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This study shows that information outside the focus of attention remains consciously accessible in the form of an ensemble representation that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the visual scene. Future work will be necessary to determine which classes of ensemble features are represented robustly outside the focus of attention. Of particular interest are ensemble features that capture the statistics of the natural world and are likely to play a vital role in everyday perception.\nAcknowledgments\u2014For helpful conversation and comments\non earlier drafts, we thank Tim Brady, Talia Konkle, Ruth Rosen-\nholtz, Antonio Torralba, and two anonymous reviewers.

According to system-justification theory, when faced with such threats, people are motivated to restore their faith in the status quo by engaging in psychological processes that bolster its apparent legitimacy (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004). How might such processes of system justification manifest themselves in everyday interpersonal functioning?\nOne way that system justification is revealed in social psychological functioning has been well-documented\u2014through the endorsement and cognitive activation of stereotypes whose specific content justifies social inequality (e.g., Kay et al., 2007). Stereotypes of men and women, in particular, can serve as psychological tools that justify and maintain social inequality. For example, Jackman (1994) has suggested that ascribing favorable and flattering, but clearly stereotypical, traits to women reduces resistance to gender-based role divisions (also see Hoffman & Hurst, 1990) by subtly implying that women are well suited to the roles they have traditionally occupied, and that stereotypically feminine traits are valued by society (also see Jost & Kay, 2005).\nElaborating on this idea, Glick and Fiske (1996) developed a measure of such stereotypes and demonstrated, across 19 countries, that the tendency to engage in this form of \u2018\u2018benevolent sexism\u2019\u2019 (i.e., viewing women as \u2018\u2018pure creatures who ought to be protected, supported, and adored and whose love is necessary to make a man complete\u2019\u2019; Glick & Fiske, 2001, p. 109) was (a) highest in countries with the greatest level of gender inequality, but was also (b) positively correlated with explicitly negative, hostile views of women (Glick et al., 2000). It has also been demonstrated that exposure to benevolent sexist stereo-\ntypes leads to strengthened beliefs in the fairness of the status quo (Jost & Kay, 2005).\nDoes the psychological link between benevolent stereotyping and system justification influence how women are treated and judged?We argue that it does, and specifically that when people experience a threat to the legitimacy of the social system, one factor that affects their attraction to a potential romantic partner is whether that partner embodies system-justifying stereotypes, such as those that align with benevolent sexist ideals.\nWe hypothesized that male participants whose faith in the federal system was threatened would show greater romantic interest in women who embody benevolent sexist ideals than in women who do not embody these ideals. We also hypothesized that they would show greater interest in women who embody benevolent sexist ideals than would male participants whose faith in the system was not threatened."}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": "Told they were participating in a memory task, 36 single male Canadian undergraduates read an excerpt from a British newspaper.

In the no-system-threat condition, the excerpt described the social, economic, and political climate in Canada as relatively stable and positive (see Kay, Jost, & Young, 2005).\nParticipants then rated their romantic interest in each of eight profiled women. Each profile included a picture and self-description, ostensibly taken from a dating Web site.

The profiles were presented randomly, with the only constraint being that two stereotypical or two nonstereotypical profiles could not be presented sequentially.\nAfter viewing each profile, participants used 7-point scales to answer eight questions gauging their romantic interest. They reported the extent to which they found the woman attractive, were interested in chatting with her on-line, would like to get to know her better, would like to meet her personally, would likely invite her to a party, would be pleased to have a date with her, were interested in starting a relationship with her, and viewed her as the ideal romantic partner.We then calculated an index of romantic interest in the benevolent-stereotypic women (a5 .97) and non-benevolent-stereotypic women (a 5 .97).

These results have important theoretical and practical implications. They are the first to connect processes of system justification with those of interpersonal attraction, by suggesting that the motive to see the sociopolitical system as just and fair can lead men to prefer women who embody traits that reinforce gender inequality. Such preferences can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, encouraging women to accept subordinate roles (Vescio, Gervais, Snyder, & Hoover, 2005).

In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved inprocessing realmotion.\nHumans quickly and efficiently extract motion information from a wide range of stimuli in the environment. Even visual stimuli that do not contain motion but only imply it, such as frozenmotion photographs, lead to the rapid and automatic extrapolation of motion paths (Freyd, 1983). For example, in the top photograph in Figure 1a, it is easy to see a sprinter running to the left. The sense of motion must be inferred from prior knowledge; there is, of course, no physical motion in the photograph. Such stimuli would appear to have little in common with the drifting dots and gratings commonly used to study neural mechanisms of motion processing, other than the fact that the observer knows that both types of stimuli depict motion in some sense. In the study reported here, we investigated how the sense of motion from static photographs is represented in the visual system.\nThe primate brain contains a number of visual areas involved in the analysis of moving objects and patterns (Maunsell & Newsome, 1987; Tootell et al., 1995). Such areas contain neurons that respond to moving images in a direction-selective\nmanner (Dubner & Zeki, 1971; Heeger, Boynton, Demb, Seidemann, & Newsome, 1999; Huk, Ress, & Heeger, 2001). The direction of motion, however, may be inferred not just from the analysis of visual motion, but also from low-level visual form cues, such as motion streaks (Burr &Ross, 2002; Geisler, 1999), or from higher-level cues, such as the posture of a person in motion (as in the photo of the sprinter in Fig. 1a). Is the sense of motion derived from such static cues instantiated by the same neural and psychological mechanisms that subserve the perception of physical motion? In particular, we sought to test whether viewing implied-motion images recruits the same direction-selective neural circuitry used for the perception of real visual motion. For example, does viewing the still photograph of the sprinter in Figure 1a elicit responses from the same leftwardselective neurons that would respond during the perception of real leftward motion? Neuroimaging studies have shown that brain areas used to analyze physical motion are also activated by viewing impliedmotion stimuli (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000; Lorteije et al., 2006; Peuskens, Vanrie, Verfaillie, & Orban, 2005; Senior et al., 2000). In these studies, visual motion areas, such as the human middle temporal/medial superior temporal complex (MT1), responded more strongly when subjects viewed photographs or silhouettes of animals, people, objects, or natural scenes containing implied motion than when they viewed similar images that did not imply motion (e.g., a cup falling off a table compared with a cup resting on a table, or a running athlete compared with an athlete at rest). These studies demonstrate that implied motion can activate brain areas also known to be engaged by real image motion. However, one cannot infer from such studies whether viewing stimuli with implied motion elicits directional motion signals in the brain, nor whether the same subsets of neurons, with similar tunings, are activated for implied and physical visual motion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures net activity, and does not currently have the resolution to routinely resolve individual columns. Moreover, although area MT1 has been shown to carry direction-selective signals in response to visual motion (Huk & Heeger, 2002; Huk et al., 2001), it can also be Address correspondence to Jonathan Winawer, Stanford University, Psychology Department, Jordan Hall, Bldg. 420, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, e-mail: winawer@stanford.edu.\n276 Volume 19\u2014Number 3Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nactivated by other factors, like attention and arousal (Beauchamp, Cox, & DeYoe, 1997; Corbetta, Miezin, Dobmeyer, Shulman, & Petersen, 1991; O\u2019Craven, Rosen, Kwong, Treisman, & Savoy, 1997; Saenz, Buracas, & Boynton, 2002), that may not be directionally selective (Huk et al., 2001). Thus, a net increase in MT1 activation need not imply the existence of a direction-selective signal, nor do multiple instances of MT1 activation confirm that the same direction-selective neurons have been activated repeatedly (Grill-Spector & Malach, 2001; Huk & Heeger, 2002).\nIn order to infer whether the same neural circuits are employed by inference and perception in the domain of visual motion, we made use of a motion aftereffect (MAE) paradigm. The MAE is a well-studied psychophysical phenomenon (Mather, Verstraten, & Anstis, 1998; Wohlgemuth, 1911) used to infer and assess the properties of direction-selective neural mechanisms. Prolonged viewing of motion in one direction makes subsequently viewed stationary (or directionally ambiguous) patterns appear to move in the opposite direction. This illusion is believed to result from the adaptation-induced decrease in activity of directionally selective neurons that respond to the adapted-to direction of motion (Barlow & Hill, 1963; Mather et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1961). This direction-selective adaptation in turn causes an imbalance in the population activity of neurons that represent different directions of motion.\nBecause of this postadaptation imbalance, the neural population code will indicate a net direction of motion opposite the adapted-to direction when probed with stationary or directionally ambiguous stimuli. Thus, the presence of an MAE can be used as a psychophysical test for the involvement of directionselective neural mechanisms.\nWe predicted that if viewing photographs of implied motion relies on the same direction-selective neurons that are involved in perception of physical motion, then viewing a series of such photos depicting motion in the same direction would adapt direction-selective neurons and produce an MAE. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments in which we measured whether viewing implied motion in one direction altered the perceived direction of subsequently presented real motion. In two experiments, the motion implied from the photographs was either leftward or rightward (Fig. 1a), and in the third experiment, the implied motion was inward or outward (Fig. 1b).\nMETHOD\nEach experiment began with a baseline motion-sensitivity task using moving-dot test stimuli. Following the baseline task, subjects viewed a series of implied-motion photographs interleaved with test trials of moving-dot probes. The dot probes were used to assess whether or not an MAE resulted from viewing the\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 277\nat NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nimplied-motion photos. In the first experiment, subjects viewed pictures with implied motion to the left or to the right and were tested with dot displays containing leftward or rightward real motion, making two-alternative forced-choice judgments on the direction of dot motion (left or right). The second experiment was similar, except that after 50% of the picture sequences, selected at random, there was a 3-s delay between the offset of the last picture and the onset of the moving-dot test trial. This delay was introduced to test whether an MAE from implied motion, like MAEs from physical motion (Keck & Pentz, 1977), would decay during a brief period following adaptation.

We manipulated the proportion of dots moving coherently in a particular direction (motion coherence) from trial to trial, and subjects were instructed to indicate the direction of global motion using a key press (left or right). On each frame, a subset of the dots, equal to the percentage of dots moving coherently for that trial, was selected to move either left or right.

After viewing implied motion in one direction, subjects were more likely to see the moving-dot test stimulus moving in the opposite direction. The population means, plotted in units of dot coherence normalized to each subject\u2019s motion sensitivity (see Method), showed that the direction of adaptation shifted the motion response function. This can be seen in Figures 3a through 3c by comparing for each pair of adapting conditions the point of perceived null motion, that is, the amount of motion coherence for which subjects were equally likely to respond \u2018\u2018left\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018right\u2019\u2019 (the first two experiments) or \u2018\u2018inward\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018outward\u2019\u2019 (the third experiment). For example, in Figure 3a, the point of perceived null motion contains more actual leftward motion coherence in the test stimulus following adaptation to leftward implied motion than following adaptation to rightward implied motion, a pattern consistent with an MAE in the direction opposite to the direction of implied-motion adaptation.\nIn Figures 3a through 3c, the size of the horizontal offset between paired functions reflects the amount of real motion needed tomake a test stimulus presented following one direction of adaptation perceptually equivalent to a test stimulus presented following the opposite direction of adaptation. To quantify the MAEs across subjects, we fit separate motion response functions to each subject\u2019s data using logistic regression, and calculated the mean difference between the points of perceived null motion in paired adaptation conditions (see Fig. 3d).\nIn the first experiment, the point of perceived null motion differed by 0.22 0.06 units of normalized motion coherence, t(18) 5 3.82, p 5 .001, prep 5 .99 (unless otherwise noted, the significance of effects was assessed with two-tailed paired t tests comparing the location of the point of perceived null motion within pairs of adapting conditions). In terms of the actual (nonnormalized) test coherence, the shift in the null point was 8.7 2.5%, t(18) 5 3.48, p 5 .003, prep 5 .97. If viewing implied motion did not lead to adaptation, the motion response functions would have overlapped, and hence there would have been no difference between the points of perceived null motion for rightward and leftward implied motion.\nThe results of the no-delay condition in the second experiment closely replicated the result of the first experiment: The null point shifted by 0.27 0.09 units of normalized coherence, t(17) 5 6.47, p5 .000, prep5 .99, or 8.9 1.9% of actual test coherence, t(17) 5 4.74, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99. However, with a 3-s delay between adaptation and test stimuli, the effect of adaptation was smaller: 0.10 0.06 units of normalized coherence and 2.3 1.9% of actual coherence. The difference between the no-delay and delay conditions was significant, t(17) 5 2.75, p 5 .013, prep5 .94, and t(17)5 2.24, p5 .038, prep5 .90, for normalized and nonnormalized test coherence, respectively.\nSubjects in the third experiment showed significant adaptation to inward and outward implied motion. The point of perceived null motion shifted by 0.17 0.04 units of normalized coherence, t(28)5 4.98, p5 .000, prep 5 .99, or 5.7 1.0% of actual coherence, t(28) 5 5.48, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99."}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In each of these three experiments, the viewing of photographs depicting movement led to systematic shifts in the responses to subsequent real-motion test probes. The test probes were more likely to be judged as moving in the direction opposite the direction depicted in the previous adapting photographs than to be moving in the same direction. The transfer of adaptation from implied motion to real motion provides evidence that still images depicting movement recruit direction-selective neurons, and demonstrates that processing implied motion can affect the subsequent perception of real motion.\nOur results cannot be explained by low-level motion-energy biases in the image sequences, or by apparent motion between successive frames. The sequence of images was generated randomly on each adaptation trial. There was an equal likelihood that any particular pair of images would be seen in one order or the opposite order, and this rules out explanations based on spurious biases inmotion energy or apparent motion. Further, it is unlikely that our results can be explained by systematic eye movements (e.g., Chaudhuri, 1991). Our use of inward and outward stimuli in the third experiment preclude explanations based on optokinetic nystagmus, and the fact that the pattern of results was the same as in the previous two experiments is evidence against explanations based on directional biases in eye movements during adaptation.\nIt also appears unlikely that the results obtained in these experiments were due to a strategic or cognitive bias, rather than a shift in the perception of the test stimuli. First, had the pattern of responses in the first experiment been driven by a nonperceptual bias, we would not have predicted the decline in the MAE after a brief delay, as observed in the second experiment. Second, a debriefing following the third experiment revealed that prior knowledge of the MAE did not explain the results: Of the 24 subjects who responded to a question asking whether or not they had heard of the MAE (5 subjects did not respond), 20\n280 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nsaid they had never heard of it.

There is evidence that mental imagery of motion can activate motion-sensitive brain areas (Goebel, Khorram-Sefat, Muckli, Hacker, & Singer, 1998; Grossman & Blake, 2001), and our own unpublished results suggest that imagery of motion can elicit anMAE.

Such processes are compatible with Helmholtz\u2019s (1886/ 1924) notion of \u2018\u2018unconscious inferences,\u2019\u2019 which have been postulated to explain a wide range of perceptual phenomena (e.g., Barlow, 2001). In this view, pictorial cues to motion are learned from statistical regularities in the environment, such that static images containing familiar objects in motion can trigger motion responses via pattern-completion processes. Recently, by using explicit associative-learning paradigms, it has been shown that a previously meaningless static cue can, after training, bias the percept of an ambiguous-motion display (Qi, Saunders, Stone, & Backus, 2006) and can elicit directional signals in single neurons in macaque MT (Schlack & Albright, 2007). Moreover, when a moving stimulus repeatedly follows a predictable trajectory, direction-selective neurons in macaque parietal cortex signal the direction of that stimulus\u2019s motion when it is occluded (Assad & Maunsell, 1995).\nOur results join a growing number of findings in the human and monkey literature showing interactions between form and motion processing (reviewed by Kourtzi, 2004). One important observation has been that a very simple type of form information, orientation, can strongly affect motion perception: Two types of stimuli that do not contain directional motion but do contain spatial orientation information, motion streaks (Burr & Ross, 2002; Geisler, 1999) and Glass patterns (Krekelberg, Dannenberg, Hoffmann, Bremmer, & Ross, 2003; Ross, Badcock, & Hayes, 2000), have been shown to influence perceptual and neural visual motion processing. Because of sluggish temporal integration in the visual system, moving stimuli tend to create blur along the direction of motion, and the visual system may exploit this regularity to infer motion trajectories from orientation, including the orientation information in motion streaks and Glass patterns. We note, however, that the inference of motion from simple orientation cues and the inference of motion from high-level object and scene-related cues likely occur at different stages in the processing pathway. Motion streaks may be extracted quite early in processing (e.g., perhaps in primary visual cortex; Geisler, 1999). In contrast, inferring the direction of motion depicted in photographs likely occurs in higher-level object areas in visual cortex, as evidenced by electroencephalographic (EEG) studies showing a delayed response to impliedmotion photographs (Lorteije et al., 2006), as well as by the sensitivity to the depiction of action in neurons in anterior regions of the temporal lobe in monkeys (Jellema & Perrett, 2003).\nIn summary, we found that direction-selective motion adaptation can result from viewing static images with impliedmotion. The direction-selective adaptation we report had an effect on subjects\u2019 perception of a real-motion stimulus immediately fol-\nlowing adaptation. These findings demonstrate that inferring motion from purely form-based cues involves direction-selective motion mechanisms. Further, these mechanisms must rely on some of the same neurons used for motion perception because the adaptation transferred from implied motion to perception of real motion. That is, at least some neurons that are directionally selective for the perception of actual motion are also activated while observers view implied motion in that same direction. A very recent study has independently arrived at a related conclusion\u2014that viewing real motion can affect the neural response to subsequent implied-motion photographs\u2014using a physiological measure (EEG) instead of a perceptual measure (Lorteije et al., 2007). An exciting extension of the work reported here would be to directly investigate the neural signals involved in the perception of motion implied in static images."}]}, {"paper_id": 129, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02052.x", "O_within_CI_R": 0.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 0.0, "pvalue_label": 0.0, "Fold_Id": 5.0, "filename": "richeson2008.pdf", "title": "The threat of appearing prejudiced and race-based attentional biases.", "content": [{"text": "motivation to respond without prejudice toward Blacks is associated with biased patterns of selective attention that reflect a threat response to Black individuals. In a dotprobe attentional bias paradigm, White participants with low and high external motivation to respond without prejudice toward Blacks (i.e., low-EM and high-EM individuals, respectively) were presented with pairs ofWhite and Black male faces that bore either neutral or happy facial expressions; on each trial, the faces were displayed for either 30 ms or 450 ms. The findings were consistent with those of previous research on threat and attention: High-EM participants revealed an attentional bias toward neutral Black faces presented for 30ms, but an attentional bias away from neutral Black faces presented for 450 ms. These attentional biases were eliminated, however, when the faces displayed happy expressions. These findings suggest that high levels of external motivation to avoid prejudice result in anxious arousal in response to Black individuals, and that this response affects even basic attentional processes.\nMany people feel anxious and uncomfortable during interracial interactions. Recent work suggests, however, that some individuals are particularly prone to have stressful interracial encounters. For instance, White individuals who are highly motivated to respond in nonprejudiced ways toward Black people for external, rather than internal, reasons (e.g., because of norms regarding political correctness) have been found to avoid interracial interactions when possible, and experience\nheightened anxiety in anticipation of, as well as during, those interracial interactions that they are unable to avoid (Plant, 2004; Plant & Devine, 1998). Research by Amodio has found, furthermore, that such high-EM individuals automatically evaluate Black targets more negatively than White targets, as revealed by potentiated startle eye-blink amplitudes (Amodio, Harmon-Jones, & Devine, 2003), unlike people who are internally motivated to respond in nonprejudiced ways toward Blacks. Taken together, this work suggests that exposure to Blacks automatically triggers negative affective reactions, including heightened anxiety, in high-EM individuals.\nAlthough Amodio\u2019s work has begun to explore some of the component processes that underlie differences between high- and low-EM individuals\u2019 affective and stereotypical evaluations of Blacks (see alsoAmodio,Devine,&Harmon-Jones, in press), what has not been examined is the extent to which individuals\u2019 affective reactions shape basic cognitive processes beyond stereotyping. To that end, the present study considered potential implications of external motivation to respond without prejudice for visual attention. Specifically, we examined whether high-EM individuals\u2019 anxious arousal in response to Blacks results in biased patterns of selective attention similar to those found among individuals with anxiety disorders (e.g., MacLeod, Mathews, & Tata, 1986)."}, {"heading": "ANXIETYAND ATTENTION", "text": "A plethora of research attests to the role that emotional stimuli play in shaping attention (e.g., Bradley et al., 1997; O\u0308hman, Flykt, & Esteves, 2001).

In this paradigm, the participant\u2019s task is to detect the location of a probe, such as a small dot, that is initially hidden from view behind one of two stimuli simultaneously presented on a computer screen, but subsequently revealed when the two stimuli disappear. A short response latency to detect the probe suggests that participants\u2019 attention had been oriented, albeit sometimes unconsciously, to the stimulus that previously obscured it. By contrast, a long response latency suggests that participants\u2019 attention had been oriented to the stimulus that had not obscured the probe.\nBoyer et al. (2006) recently used a dot-probe task to study the attentional biases of children with chronic pain. The critical trials involved the presentation of pain-relevant, and thus threatening, words (e.g., injure) paired with neutral words (e.g., washer). Furthermore, for half the trials, the words were presented subliminally (20 ms), whereas for the other half, they were presented for 1,250 ms\u2014ample time for attention to be controlled. Results revealed that the children showed attentional engagement of pain-related words that were presented subliminally; they detected the dot faster when a pain-related word, rather than a neutral word, had obscured it. By contrast, they revealed attentional avoidance of pain-related words that were presented supraliminally."}, {"heading": "THE PRESENT STUDY", "text": "This study by Boyer et al. (2006) suggests that although threatening cues seem to capture attention, individuals selectively avoid them when possible (see also Cooper & Langton, 2006; MacLeod & Rutherford, 1992).

Given the findings of Boyer et al., we expected that Black faces would capture high-EM individuals\u2019 attention at early processing stages, but would be selectively avoided at later processing stages.\nTo bolster our investigation of the role of perceived threat in the hypothesized attentional biases, we considered the extent to which reducing the threat signal communicated by the faces would attenuate the biases. Specifically, Black faces that communicate positive affect (i.e., smiling faces) should undermine high-EM individuals\u2019 anxious reactions and, thus, their attentional biases as well. Indeed, research suggests that several brain regions, most notably the amygdala, quickly process affective stimuli, including facial expressions of emotion, even when presented subliminally (Whalen et al., 1998; see also\nCunningham et al., 2004). Hence, smiling Black faces should readily be appraised as less threatening than neutral Black faces, and, therefore, high-EM individuals should be less likely to reveal biased patterns of selective attention to the former.\nThus, we employed the dot-probe paradigm to examine the attentional biases of high-EM White individuals in response to facial photographs of Black and White males. The faces bore either a neutral or a happy facial expression and were presented for either a relatively brief (30 ms) or a long (450 ms) duration before the dot was revealed behind one of them. We predicted that high-EM individuals would reveal attentional engagement of neutral Black faces presented briefly, but attentional avoidance of neutral Black faces presented for the longer duration.

As predicted, high-EM participants tended to orient to Black neutral faces that were presented for the short duration ( prep 5 .89), but to White neutral faces that were presented for the longer duration ( prep 5 .94; see Fig. 1a). Our results are thus similar to those of Boyer et al. (2006); high-EM participants revealed a pattern of attentional bias that is consistent with a tendency to orient toward a relevant threat initially (i.e., attentional engagement), but to orient away from the threat when possible (i.e., attentional avoidance). As predicted, this pattern was not revealed for the happy faces.

Specifically, Black faces initially captured the attention of high-EM participants, but were avoided by these participants when possible (i.e., when the presentation duration was longer). These patterns of attentional bias were eliminated when the faces were smiling. Presumably, the happy expressions reduced the Black male targets\u2019 threat signal, thereby attenuating the need for highEM individuals to attend to them initially or to avoid them subsequently.\nThis study contributes to a growing body of work examining basic processes underlying individual differences in the regulation and control of racial bias. As alluded to previously, Amodio and his colleagues (Amodio et al., 2003, in press) have found compelling differences between White individuals with high external motivation to avoid appearing prejudiced toward Blacks and White individuals with high internal motivation to avoid appearing prejudiced toward Blacks. Specifically, externally motivated and internally motivated individuals have been found to differ in both their automatic negative affective reactions to Blacks and their patterns of neural activity associated with the inhibition of racial stereotypes. Building on this work, the present study moved beyond the realm of mechanisms that give rise to stereotyping and prejudice, considering instead the implications of external motivation to respond without prejudice for race-related differences in another basic cognitive process, namely, selective attention. In so doing, this work revealed the moderating role of positive facial affect in race-based selective attention, suggesting an important, yet heretofore largely unexplored, avenue for future research on racial bias (but see Chiu, Ambady, & Deldin, 2004; Hugenberg, 2005; Hugenberg & Bodenhausen, 2003).\nThe present findings are also consistent with recent work by Ito and Urland (2005). They found that compared with White targets, Black targets evoked a larger positive-going eventrelated potential (ERP) component approximately 200 ms poststimulus (P200) in White perceivers; this component is thought to reflect early attention. About 250 ms poststimulus, however, these White perceivers exhibited a larger negativegoing ERP component (N200) in response to White, compared with Black, targets. Hence, White perceivers seemed to orient toward Black faces initially, but to switch their attention toward White faces subsequently.3 Considered in tandem with the present work, these findings suggest that although Blacks may\n3Ito and Urland did not measure external-prejudice concerns, but it is likely that engaging in a race-related task while neural activity was recorded heightened them.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 2 101\ncapture the attention of Whites, especially among high-EM, White individuals, they are likely to be either avoided or simply disregarded later (Eberhardt et al., 2004; Rodin, 1987)."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Establishing and enforcing standards and norms regarding the expression of bias are of paramount importance to the creation of a more harmonious, yet diverse, society.

This proposal was supported by experiments in which participants showed superior memory when words were rated for survival relevance, at least relative to when words received other forms of deep processing. The current experiments tested the mettle of survival memory by pitting survival processing against conditions that are universally accepted as producing excellent retention, including conditions in which participants rated words for imagery, pleasantness, and self-reference; participants also generated words, studied words with the intention of learning them, or rated words for relevance to a contextually rich (but non-survival-related) scenario. Survival processing yielded the best retention, which suggests that it may be one of the best encoding procedures yet discovered in the memory field.\nMemory serves a variety of adaptive functions, but psychologists rarely address these functions directly. It is well known that forming a visual image or engaging in deep semantic processing significantly improves retention relative to various control conditions (e.g., Hyde & Jenkins, 1973; Paivio, 1971). However, the ultimate reasons for these sensitivities remain largely unexplored. What advantages are gained by having a memory system that shows sensitivity to imagery or semantic processing? Psychologists offer a tool kit of proximate mechanisms to explain observablemnemonic phenomena\u2014multiple codes, greater elaboration, enhanced encoding-retrievalmatch\u2014but generally leave such functional questions unanswered (Klein, Cosmides, Tooby, & Chance, 2002; Nairne, 2005; Paivio, 2007).\nEschewing a functional analysis becomes especially problematic if, in fact, humanmemory systems have been \u2018\u2018designed\u2019\u2019\nby nature to achieve specific ends. From an evolutionary perspective, a system\u2019s structural properties are assumed to reflect their functionality. Nature \u2018\u2018selects\u2019\u2019 one physical design over another because that design has fitness value\u2014it helps the organism solve an adaptive problem, and, in turn, the chances of genetic transmission are increased. Structure (or form) follows function, and, as a consequence, one cannot hope to understand the characteristics of a memory system, or at least one will likely find this task difficult, without first understanding the specific problems that the system has evolved to solve (Klein et al., 2002; Tooby & Cosmides, 1992).\nOne could concoct functional explanations for the plethora of mnemonic phenomena currently in vogue, but such post hoc accounts\u2014\u2018\u2018just-so stories\u2019\u2019\u2014are the scourge of evolutionary analysis (Gould & Lewontin, 1979). Our laboratory has recently taken a more proactive approach. We have attempted to identify adaptive problems that may have shaped the evolution of memory and then to generate a priori empirical predictions. For example, we (Nairne, Thompson, & Pandeirada, 2007) proposed that human memory systems may be \u2018\u2018tuned\u2019\u2019 to remember information that is processed for survival. From a fitness perspective, it seems unlikely that memory evolved to be domaingeneral (i.e., insensitive to content) because certain information, particularly information found in a survival context (e.g., foodstuffs, predators), is likely to be especially important to fitness. In four incidental-learning experiments, we (Nairne et al., 2007) found that participants who were asked to rate the relevance of unrelated words to a survival scenario subsequently remembered those words better than participants who processed those same words in several deep-processing control conditions (instructions to rate pleasantness, relevance to moving to a foreign land, or ease of generating an autobiographical memory).\nThe purpose of the present research was to test the true mettle of survival-based processing by pitting the survival scenario against a set of encoding procedures that are universally accepted as producing excellent retention. Memory theorists generally dismiss the notion that one kind of encoding task is inherently better than another, because the nature of the retrieval environment needs to be taken into account.

In our first experiment, which used a between-subjects design, participants were asked to rate unrelated words for relevance to a survival scenario, pleasantness, ease of generating a visual image, or ease of generating an autobiographical memory; in another condition, they had to generate words from scrambled letters before rating the words for pleasantness. We also included an intentional-learning condition in which participants were asked to remember the words for a later test. At issue was how retention after the survival rating task would compare with retention after these time-honored encoding procedures.\nEXPERIMENT 1"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Apparatus", "text": "Three hundred Purdue undergraduates took part in this experiment in exchange for partial credit in an introductory psychology course.

Over the next few months, you\u2019ll need to find steady supplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.

Some of the words may be relevant and others may not\u2014it\u2019s up to you to decide.\u2019\u2019 The rating scale ranged from 1 (totally irrelevant) to 5 (extremely relevant). Pleasantness. \u2018\u2018In this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we would like you to rate the pleasantness of each word. Some of the words may be pleasant and others may not\u2014it\u2019s up to you to decide.\u2019\u2019 The rating scale ranged from 1 (totally unpleasant) to 5 (extremely pleasant). Imagery. \u2018\u2018In this experiment, we would like you to rate a list of words as to the ease or difficulty with which they arouse mental images. Nouns differ in their capacity to arousemental images of things or events. Some words arouse a sensory experience, such as a mental picture or sound, very quickly and easily, whereas others may do so only with difficulty (i.e., after a long delay) or not at all. Any word which, in your estimation, arouses a mental image (i.e., a mental picture, or sound, or other sensory experience) very quickly and easily should be given a high imagery rating; a word that arouses a mental image with difficulty or not at all should be given a low imagery rating.\u2019\u2019 Rating values ranged from 1 (low imagery) to 5 (high imagery). Self-reference. \u2018\u2018In this task, we would like you to think of personal experiences you have had in your life. We will present you with a series of words, and for each word we would like you to rate how easily the word brings to mind an important personal experience.\u2019\u2019 The rating scale ranged from 1 (very difficult) to 5 (extremely easy). Generation. \u2018\u2018In this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we would like you to rate the pleasantness of each word. Some of the words may be pleasant and others may not\u2014it\u2019s up to you to decide. You will notice that the first two letters of each word are switched; before you make each rating, you will need to mentally switch the letters back to their original positions in order to know which word you are rating. For example, if you are presented with \u2018\u2018iktten,\u2019\u2019 you will need to switch the first two letters in your head to get the word \u2018\u2018kitten\u2019\u2019 and then you canmake your pleasantness rating for that word.\u2019\u2019 Again, the rating scale ranged from 1 (totally unpleasant) to 5 (extremely pleasant).

Each word appeared for 5 s along with the corresponding rating scale (presented just below the word). On each trial, the participant indicated his or her rating by clicking on the number that corresponded to his or her choice. Participants were advised tomake their decisions quickly, given the 5-s presentation rate, and to try to use the entire rating scale (i.e., all the values from 1 to 5). A short practice period, during which\nVolume 19\u2014Number 2 177\nparticipants rated 5 practice words, preceded the presentation of the 30 experimental stimuli.\nImmediately following the rating task, participants were asked to recall digit strings for 2 min. In each trial of this task, seven single digits (ranging from 1 to 9) were presented one at a time, at a rate of one digit per second, and then participants were instructed to recall the digits in order by typing responses directly on the keyboard. The digit recall task was followed immediately by the recall test for the experimental words.

An overall analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant effect of condition, F(5, 294) 5 4.41, MSE 5 0.019, Zp 2 5 .07. One condition, survival processing, was notably discrepant. Post hoc analyses confirmed that the survival-processing group outperformed each of the other encoding groups (individual prep values comparing survival processing with each of the other conditions were greater than .97); no significant differences were found among any of the non-survival-processing conditions. The same pattern of significance was found in an item analysis, that is, when words were used as the unit, F(5, 145) 5 4.37, MSE 5 0.012, Zp 2 5 .13.\nTable 1 presents the mean ratings and response times for the five incidental-learning conditions. These data are of interest because they enable us to rule out some rather simpleminded interpretations of the survival-processing benefit. An ANOVA on the rating data revealed a significant effect of condition, F(4, 245) 5 16.50, MSE 5 0.213, Zp 2 5 .21; again, the sole discrepant condition was survival processing, which yielded a lower average rating than the other conditions (individual prep values comparing survival processing with each of the other conditions were greater than .99). The fact that the stimulus materials were considered least relevant to the rating dimension in the survival scenario is important because retention usually\nincreases with cue-target congruence; that is, the extent to which the rated word fits the orienting question or scenario determines the ease with which the orienting question can serve as an effective retrieval cue at test (Craik & Tulving, 1975; Schulman, 1974). The findings for the survival and pleasantness conditions replicate our previous findings (Nairne et al., 2007) that processing for pleasantness produces higher average ratings than survival processing, but that survival processing produces significantly better retention.\nAn ANOVA on the response time data also revealed a significant effect of condition, F(4, 245) 5 10.91, MSE 5 174,054.20, Zp 2 5 .15; post hoc analyses showed that decision times in the survival condition were significantly slower than those in the pleasantness and imagery conditions (prep values were greater than .99), but did not differ from response times in the self-reference (prep < .82) and generation (prep < .34) conditions. Given that survival processing produced better retention than each of the standard encoding conditions, and that retention did not vary among the latter conditions, response time cannot account for the observed memory differences. It is possible that survival decisions are more effortful than pleasantness or imagery decisions, and this fact might have contributed to some of the retention differences, but effort is generally thought to be a poor predictor of retention overall (Craik & Tulving, 1975). Moreover, in our previous study (Nairne et al., 2007), we found no significant difference in average response times between survival and pleasantness conditions, but still obtained the survival advantage in retention.\nClearly there was an unequivocal mnemonic benefit for survival processing in this experiment, but it might seem surprising that no differences emerged among the remaining encoding conditions. It is important to bear in mind, however, that each of the encoding procedures was designed to induce deep, or semantic, processing\u2014in fact, these encoding tasks were chosen specifically because they are known to induce excellent retention\u2014so comparable performance levels were not completely unexpected. More important, previous research comparing deep processing conditions has typically produced few consistent differences.

Challis, Velichkovsky, and Craik (1996) directly compared a self-reference task with a living/nonliving judgment and intentional learning and found a significant advantage for intentional learning in free recall. Somewhat surprising is our failure to find a generation effect, although we did not include a traditional \u2018\u2018read\u2019\u2019 control, in which the generated item is merely presented intact, in our experiment. Both the generation and the pleasantness conditions, which are most comparable, required a pleasantness judgment, which, by itself, is known to produce superior recall (Hyde & Jenkins, 1973; Packman & Battig, 1978). In addition, generation effects are often reduced or nonexistent when generation is manipulated in a between-subjects design, and this may help explain why we did not observe an advantage for generation (Nairne, Riegler, & Serra, 1991).\nEXPERIMENT 2\nOne might question whether it was the thematic content of the survival scenario, rather than its evolutionary significance, that produced the mnemonic advantage. The survival theme provided an overarching structure, or coherence, to the encoding task that the other conditions lacked. Our previous study (Nairne et al., 2007) provided evidence against this possibility. In several experiments, survival processing yielded better retention than a control condition in which participants were asked to rate the relevance of words to a thematic scenario involving moving to a foreign land. However, as a further test of this narrative-theme hypothesis, we conducted another withinsubjects experiment directly comparing survival processing with a contextually rich (but non-survival-relevant) encoding scenario."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants and Apparatus", "text": "Twenty-four participants either received partial credit in an introductory psychology course or were given a small monetary compensation.

Initially, participants received general instructions informing them that they would be required to rate words according to particular scenarios.

After the practice trials, participants were again presented with the scenario information, as a reminder.

Neither ratings nor response times differed significantly in the item analysis."}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "The overall data pattern provides compelling evidence for the power of survival processing. A condition requiring a simple decision about the relevance of random words to a survival scenario produced significantly enhanced retention relative to standard deep-processing controls and to a contextually rich, but non-survival-relevant control. The survival advantage remained robust despite the fact that the deep-processing control conditions represented the \u2018\u2018best of the best\u2019\u2019 of known encoding procedures. Although it is always possible to rig experimental conditions to increase or decrease retention performance\u2014for example, by manipulating the encoding-retrieval match\u2014all procedural details remained the same across conditions except for the critical encoding decisions. With these procedural constraints in mind, it is fair to conclude that survival processing is one of the best\u2014if not the best\u2014encoding procedures yet identified in human memory research, at least when free recall is used as the retention measure.\nIt is important to emphasize as well that the mnemonic superiority of survival processing follows nicely from a functionalevolutionary perspective. If one chooses to ask why human memory systems evolved, then it is important to identify the specific selection pressures that shaped their development. From such a perspective, processing systems that aided survival, or ultimately fitness, would likely have received a selection advantage. Consequently, it is not surprising that human memory systems seem tuned, or biased, to retain information that is processed for fitness.\nAs noted earlier, memory researchers rarely attempt to place mnemonic processing in such a functional context; at present, the memory field can provide little insight into why human memory systems respond well when a visual image is formed or meaning is accessed, although it can offer a variety of proximate mechanisms to explain obtained advantages (e.g., greater elaboration or distinctiveness). Given that memory is likely to be functionally designed, there is merit in seeking to identify the specific adaptive problems that it is designed to solve (see also Sherry & Schacter, 1987). The survival advantage demonstrated in the present study is grounded theoretically in such a functional perspective, and it seems likely that other novel results will follow if researchers keep a similar functional perspective in mind.\nAcknowledgments\u2014Thanks are due to David Ceo for helpful\ncomments during the course of this research.

In two studies, we tested Schachtel\u2019s maxim by asking participants whether or not they had and the extent to which they wanted each of 52 material items. To quantify how much people wanted what they had, we identified what they had and the extent to which they wanted those things. To quantify how much people had what they wanted, we identified how much they wanted and whether or not they had each item. Both variables accounted for unique variance in happiness.Moreover, the extent to which people wanted what they had partially mediated effects of gratitude and maximization on happiness, and the extent to which they had what they wanted partially mediated the effect of maximization. Results indicate that happiness is both wanting what you have and having what you want.\nHappiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.\n\u2014Rabbi Hyman Schachtel (1954, p. 37)\nDiscrepancy theories of well-being contend that happiness depends on the extent to which people have what they want (e.g., Michalos, 1985). For instance, most people presumably want money, and those who make more money tend to be slightly happier (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). Moreover, the effect of income on happiness is strongest among those who are particularly interested in acquiring wealth (Nickerson, Schwarz, Diener, & Kahneman, 2003). Such findings are consistent with the hypothesis that people who have what they want are happier\nthan others. From Schachtel\u2019s (1954) perspective, however, individuals who acquire the wealth they seek may be happy not because they have what they want, but because they want what they have.\nFor Schachtel\u2019s maxim to constitute a testable hypothesis, the extent to which people want what they have and the extent to which they have what they want must be both distinct and quantifiable. However wise the maxim sounds, it may not even be clear what it means for people to want what they have as opposed to have what they want. Fortunately, probability theory clarifies what it means for people to want what they have and have what they want, and it provides a framework for measuring these variables. Let us first quantify the extent to which people want what they have. LetHave represent the set of material items that an individual has (e.g., bed, stereo, car; see the shaded area in Fig. 1) and Want represent the material items that the individual wants (see the dotted area in Fig. 1). The extent to which the individual wants what he or she has is provided by the following conditional probability: p\u00f0WantjHave\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0Have \\Want\u00de=p\u00f0Have\u00de; where \\ refers to the intersection of Have and Want (as depicted by the area in Fig. 1 that is both shaded and dotted). Replacing p(Have) with p(Want) provides the extent to which the individual has what he or she wants:\np\u00f0HavejWant\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0Have \\Want\u00de=p\u00f0Want\u00de: In sum, the extent to which people want what they have and the extent to which they have what they want are quantifiable and distinct in that they represent conditional probabilities with common numerators but different denominators. As a result, Schachtel\u2019s maxim is testable. In this article, we report two studies investigating the relationships among wanting what one has, having what one wants, and happiness. Schachtel\u2019s either/or approach to the sources of happiness is remarkably parsimonious, but happiness is known to be multiply determined (Diener Address correspondence to Jeff T.

Other categories yielded little serviceable data, but interspersed among the material items were \u2018\u2018job,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018major,\u2019\u2019 and\n6 items dealing with relationships (e.g., \u2018\u2018boyfriend/girlfriend\u2019\u2019). These 8 items were also excluded from all analyses. In sum, the survey contained a total of 62 items, but analyses were based on data from only 52 of those items.\nSTUDY 1\nTo examine whether wanting what one has or having what one wants predicts happiness, we asked participants in Study 1 to indicate whether they had and wanted the items identified in the pilot study and to complete a measure of happiness. Wanting what you have and having what you want may also help explain why other variables predict happiness. One possibility is that grateful people tend to be happier than others (McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, 2002) because they want what they have more than less grateful people do.

Moreover, Fisher z tests revealed no effects of gender on the magnitude of any simple or partial correlations reported.\n3It is possible that simply wanting things is uncorrelated with happiness because the positive effect of wanting what one has is nullified by a negative effect of wanting what one does not have. To examine this possibility, we computed weighted conditional probability scores reflecting the extent to which participants wanted things they did not have. As expected, the extent to which people wanted what they did not have was negatively correlated with happiness, r5 .30, prep5 .99.

In other words, the results indicate that happiness is, in part, both wanting what you have and having what you want.\nThe distribution of scores on the Gratitude Questionnaire was J-shaped, so these data were submitted to an arcsine transformation.

The analysis, which comprised 5,000 bootstrap samples, revealed an indirect effect of the extent to which people want what they have on happiness, z5 2.37, prep 5 .93, as well as a direct effect of gratitude on happiness, t(123) 5 3.79, prep > .99. Additional regression analyses indicated that gratitude accounted for 18% of the variance in happiness before, but only 10% after, controlling for the extent to which people wanted what they had. These findings indicate that more grateful people tend to be happier in part because they want what they have more.\nSTUDY 2\nSchwartz et al. (2002) found that maximizers, people who accept nothing less than the best, tend to be less happy than satisficers, people who are content with suboptimal but acceptable outcomes. Perhaps maximizers are less happy because they are less satisfied with what they have. It is also possible that they are less happy because they do not have as much of what they want. To test these hypotheses, in Study 2 we included the maximization scale developed by Schwartz et al.\nSchachtel viewed wanting what you have as a virtue. An alternative view is that wanting what you have is a state of complacency that results in a type of empty happiness. If individuals who want what they have are complacent, they should be less likely than others to have a sense of purpose in life and to desire personal growth. To test these hypotheses, in Study 2 we examined the relationship between wanting what one has and scores on the Purpose in Life Subscale of Ryff \u2019s (1989) Multidimensional Measure of Psychological Well-Being.

Income has a stronger effect on happiness among the poor than among the wealthy (Diener & Suh, 1997). Thus, simply having things and having what one wants may emerge as more important predictors of happiness among the poor. Cultural variables may also moderate the effects of wanting what one has and having what one wants on well-being. In a book titled How to Want What You Have, Miller (1995), a psychotherapist, argued that all major religions admonish their followers to want what they have.

This tendency has been attributed to a hedonic treadmill (Brickman & Campbell, 1971), such that people tend to stop wanting the desirable possessions they have acquired. Kahneman (1999) suggested that people might also succumb to a satisfaction treadmill. By this account, even if individuals with newfound wealth continue to want their newly acquired possessions, they may adopt a higher aspiration level for hedonic experiences and, as a result, find new things that they want but do not have. Our results suggest that people may be able to avoid the hedonic treadmill by continuing to want what they have and to avoid the satisfaction treadmill by continuing to have what they want.6 Stronger tests of these hypotheses would require having individuals complete the Have/\nWant Survey on several occasions over time. Though most people may become happier as they accumulate the things they want, those who continue to want those things and avoid discovering new things to want may experience sustained increases in happiness. Implicit in this analysis is that people should want what they have. This was certainly the spirit of Schachtel\u2019s prescription for happiness, and it might make sense for most individuals in developed countries.

After learning about positive and negative behaviors performed by one individual from each of two different groups, participants were introduced briefly to new individuals from the groups. Implicit evaluations of the original individuals readily generalized to the new individuals; explicitly, participants resisted such generalization. Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation. We conclude that a simple association linking one individual to another can produce implicit attitude generalization immediately and explicit attitude generalization eventually.\nMoral intuition and legal theory indicate that it is unacceptable to judge a person on the basis of the actions of another. Ancient and modern jurisprudence reject the notion of guilt by association (see Banaji & Bhaskar, 2000). Individuals are not deliberately punished for the crimes of others who share the same group membership\u2014whether the group is defined by kinship,\nfriendship, or social category. Nevertheless, everyday thinking and judging provide occasions for evaluative generalization in which the actions of one individual are used in evaluating another.\nCrawford, Sherman, and Hamilton (2002) demonstrated that transferring the traits perceived about one individual to another group member depends on perceived group entitativity\u2014the extent to which a collection of individuals is perceived as being a unified entity (Campbell, 1958). Participants were given positive or negative information about an individual group member and were then given an opportunity to apply that information to other groupmembers (or not). The keymanipulation was whether the group to which the individuals belonged was described as having high entitativity (similar people with shared background, attitudes, and personalities) or low entitativity (diverse people with different backgrounds, attitudes, and personalities). When the group was perceived as being highly entitative, participants transferred traits from one groupmember to another. But when the social group was thought to be large and diverse, participants recognized that one individual is not representative of all group members and resisted generalizing their attitude from one person to another person in the same group.\nA nuanced understanding of group diversity overrides a more basic relation\u2014that individuals are associated by simply belonging to the same group. To avoid using evaluations of one person in judging another requires a deliberate judgment that group association is not a sufficient basis for generalization. Despite the conscious thought involved in resisting attitude generalization, the mental presence of a group association might be sufficient for observers to generalize even when they have no intention of doing so. In other words, even when attitude generalization is explicitly resisted, associations between group members may still exist and lead to generalization anyway.

Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2006) and other researchers (Sloman, 1996; Smith & DeCoster, 2000; Strack & Deutsch, 2004) have suggested that both associative and propositional processes contribute to evaluation. Associative evaluations are activated automatically when a person encounters a relevant stimulus. Propositional processes, in contrast, influence deliberate, reflective decisions that involve the manipulation of symbolically represented rules. Gawronski and Bodenhausen have further proposed that the most important distinction between associative and propositional reasoning is that associative relations can be activated regardless of whether a person believes those associations are accurate or inaccurate, whereas propositional processes allow for the deliberation involved in conscious declarations of truth or falsity.\nFor example, according to classical and modern conceptions of cognitive balance, if one learns that Oscar has many negative characteristics and then learns that Elmo belongs to the same group that Oscar belongs to, Elmo should become associated with negativity because of his association with Oscar (Greenwald et al., 2002; Heider, 1958). However, consciously applying propositional logic that Oscar\u2019s actions should not reflect on Elmo should inhibit associative transference. Deliberation allows for the rejection of the associative generalization and for Elmo to be judged on his own merits. Recent work showing the distinctiveness of implicit (associative) and explicit (deliberative) evaluations provides evidence that people can possess multiple evaluations of a single target\u2014even evaluations they would reject as false if given the opportunity to deliberate (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Nosek, 2007).\nIn the present study, participants read about behaviors performed by two individuals who belonged to distinct, heterogeneous groups. One individual performed mostly negative behaviors, and the other performed mostly positive behaviors. Immediately after reading about these two individuals, participants were introduced briefly to two new individuals from the same groups.We predicted that the induced evaluations of the original individuals would generalize to the new individuals associatively, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), but that participants would resist generalizing from the original to the new individuals when given the opportunity to deliberate via self-reported evaluations."}, {"heading": "RESOURCES PREVENTING GENERALIZATION FADE WITH TIME", "text": "The existing studies showing that people resist generalizing attitudes from one person to another have typically measured\nevaluations immediately after an attitude induction. Observers in these circumstances have ample resources with which to deliberate and prevent generalization. In particular, clear memory for who did what is necessary for observers to keep their evaluations straight and enables them to prevent the actions of one individual from influencing their judgments of another.\nWith time, however, the details that maintain clear distinctions between the behaviors of different individuals are forgotten (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993). Brainerd and Reyna\u2019s fuzzy-trace theory, for example, distinguishes between gist memory (memory for the general meaning of informational inputs) and verbatim memory (more exact representation of the specific content of informational inputs; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995). According to this theory, verbatim memory is forgotten and becomes inaccessible quickly, leaving people to rely on gist memory (Clark & Clark, 1977).\nThe quicker loss of verbatim memory relative to gist memory suggests that, over time, the specific information used to deliberately distinguish group members will fade. If the associations between group members still exist in memory without the conscious individuating information, then the passage of time should increase the difficulty of avoiding associative generalization from one person to another. To test this possibility, we reassessed implicit and explicit evaluations toward the novel individuals days after the induction. We expected that participants would be able to resist explicit (but not implicit) generalization when tested immediately, but that they would not be able to explicitly resist generalization following a delay. Thus, we predicted that after the delay, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals would generalize to the new individuals."}, {"heading": "STUDY OVERVIEW", "text": "The study took place in two sessions. In the first session, participants read about behaviors performed by two individuals, Reemolap and Vabbenif (adapted from Gregg, 2000), each of whom was described as belonging to a large and diverse social group (low in entitativity). One of the individuals performed primarily positive behaviors, and the other performed primarily negative behaviors. Next, participants read brief introductions to two new individuals, Bosaalap and Ibbonif, who belonged to the same social groups as the original individuals. The information about the new individuals was minimal, and pretesting showed it to be relatively neutral.We then used the IATand semantic differential ratings to measure participants\u2019 implicit and explicit attitudes, respectively, toward either the original individuals or the new individuals. We manipulated the individuals to be evaluated between participants so that the act of reporting attitudes toward one pair would not influence reports of attitudes toward the other. The IAT is widely used to measure conditioned associations (Baccus, Baldwin, & Packer, 2004; Gregg, Seibt, & Banaji, 2006; Olson & Fazio, 2001; Rydell, McConnell, Mackie, & Strain,\n250 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND on November 11, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\n2006), and, because of its demonstrated reliability and sensitivity, it was particularly useful for assessing associations in this study (for a review of the psychometric properties of the IAT, see Nosek, Greenwald, & Banaji, 2007).\nWe predicted that people would explicitly refrain from using the information about the original group members in making immediate judgments of the new group members; this finding would replicate demonstrations that people can recognize that one individual\u2019s behavior is not representative of all group members if their group is large and diverse (Crawford et al., 2002; McConnell, Sherman, & Hamilton, 1997). In contrast, we predicted that implicit attitudes toward the new individuals would be as strong as if the new individuals were the targets of the original induction. That is, we expected the induced evaluations of the original individuals to immediately transfer associatively to the new individuals as a consequence of their shared group membership.\nThree days after the first study session, we invited participants to return to complete the implicit and explicit attitude measures again.We hypothesized that days after the initial learning episode, participants would show not only the implicit attitude generalization predicted for the first session, but also full explicit attitude generalization.

Further, generalization occurs even explicitly when evaluations are measured days after the original induction. Despite participants\u2019 ability to consciously resist using group information as a basis of evaluation immediately, associations between group members still exist in memory and influence evaluation as time passes.\nBalance principles predict that if one person who is viewed negatively is associated with a second person by group membership, then the second person is likely to inherit the negative evaluation (Greenwald et al., 2002; Heider, 1958). We assume that resisting transferring attitudes from one person to another requires the ability to differentiate distinct knowledge about group members and the cognitive capacity to deliberately refrain from generalization. As information individuating two group members fades, resisting generalization becomes more difficult. As suggested by fuzzy-trace theory (Reyna & Brainerd, 1995), the details that distinguish knowledge about one group member from knowledge about another are forgotten, leaving conscious evaluation reliant only on the associations that are available in memory.\nLike the other studies that have used the IAT to measure conditioned associations, ours rests on the assumption that the IATmeasures associations (see also Greenwald, Nosek, Banaji, & Klauer, 2005). Rothermund and Wentura (2004) argued that the IATmay be influenced by salience asymmetries as well. However, it is unlikely that our conditioning paradigm induced salience asymmetries because we used novel groups and presented the same amount of information about each individual. The only difference between the individuals was that one was associated with positive behaviors and the other with negative behaviors.\nThe present results inspire a host of new questions concerning boundary conditions and variables that may moderate the influence of associative generalization on evaluation. For example, explicit generalization across individuals within a group should increase as a function of perceived similarity, but does implicit generalization occur even following trivial means of associating individuals? Also, this paradigm might be adapted to investigate when individuating or generalizing processes will dominate, and under what conditions automatic processes will lead to generalization despite conscious intentions otherwise.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 253\nat UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND on November 11, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nThe present work suggests that associative processes influence propositional processes in social evaluation and is a significant step in specifying the importance of associative relationships.\nEven if people believe that it is unacceptable to judge people on the basis of the actions of others, associative relations provide a subtle means of inducing guilt or accolade by association. This research demonstrated immediate and automatic evaluation of little-known social targets based on evaluations of associated individuals. An encounter with one member of a group can have lasting effects on evaluations of other members of the same group. In social judgment, generalizing evaluations from one person to others provides a simple heuristic for assessment. However, the potential cost is that individuating information that would enable more accurate assessment may be missed because of a propensity to generalize qualities that group members may not hold in common.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We would like to thank Tony Greenwald,\nLee Hendricks, Colin Tucker Smith, and the Implicit Cognition\nLab at the University of Virginia for their helpful comments.

Two experiments examined whether inducing participants to believe that human behavior is predetermined would encourage cheating. In Experiment 1, participants read either text that encouraged a belief in determinism (i.e., that portrayed behavior as the consequence of environmental and genetic factors) or neutral text. Exposure to the deterministic message increased cheating on a task in which participants could passively allow a flawed computer program to reveal answers to mathematical problems that they had been instructed to solve themselves. Moreover, increased cheating behavior was mediated by decreased belief in free will. In Experiment 2, participants who read deterministic statements cheated by overpaying themselves for performance on a cognitive task; participants who read statements endorsing free will did not. These findings suggest that the debate over free will has societal, as well as scientific and theoretical, implications.\nWe are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse. (Sartre, 1943/ 1956, pp. 78\u201379)\nThe belief that one determines one\u2019s own outcomes is strong and pervasive. In a massive survey of people in 36 countries, more than 70% agreed with the statement that their fate is in their own hands (International Social Survey Programme, 1998). Yet the view from the scientific community is that behavior is caused by genes underlying personality dispositions, brain mechanisms, or features of the environment (e.g., Bargh, in\npress; Crick, 1994; Pinker, 2002). There is reason to think that scientists\u2019 sentiment is spreading to nonscientists. For example, the news magazine The Economist recently ran the headline, \u2018\u2018Free to Choose? Modern Neuroscience Is Eroding the Idea of Free Will\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018Free to Choose?\u2019\u2019 2006). What would happen if people came to believe that their behavior is the inexorable product of a causal chain set into motion without their own volition?Would people carry on, selves and behavior unperturbed, or, as Sartre suggested, might the adoption of a deterministic worldview serve as an excuse for untoward behaviors?\nIt is well established that changing people\u2019s sense of responsibility can change their behavior. For example, invoking a sense of personal accountability causes people to modify their behavior to better align with their attitudes (Harmon-Jones & Mills, 1999). Believing that outcomes are based on an inborn trait, rather than effort, also influences behavior. For instance, Mueller and Dweck (1998) observed 10-year-old children who were told that they had been successful on an initial task either as the result of their intelligence or through their hard work. In a second round, all the children encountered a task that was well beyond their performance level (i.e., they failed at it). When the children were given yet a third task, those who thought their earlier success was due to their intelligence put forth less effort and reported lower enjoyment than those who thought their initial success was due to their own effort. The authors concluded that the former children\u2019s belief that their performance was linked to their intelligence indicated to them that achieving a high score on the difficult problems in the second round was beyond their ability. Hence, faring poorly (on an admittedly difficult task) indicated to children in the intelligence condition that they were simply not smart enough for the task, which in turn led them to stop trying to perform well and to like the task less.\nIf reducing people\u2019s sense of control also reduces the amount of effort they put toward improving their performance, then Address correspondence to Kathleen Vohs, Department of Marketing, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, 3-150,"}, {"heading": "321 19th Ave. South, Minneapolis, MN 55455, e-mail: vohsx005@ umn.edu.", "text": "Volume 19\u2014Number 1 49Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at UNIV OF VIRGINIA on October 12, 2012pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nadvocating a deterministic worldview that dismisses individual causation may similarly promote undesirable behavior.

In the two experiments reported here, we manipulated beliefs related to free will and measured their influence on morality as manifested in cheating behavior.

In the control condition, participants read a passage from a chapter on consciousness, which did not discuss free will. After reading their assigned material, participants completed the Free Will and Determinism scale (FWD; Paulhus & Margesson, 1994) and the Positive and Negative Affectivity Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), which we used to assess whether the reading manipulation affected their beliefs and mood.\nSubsequently, participants were given a computer-based mental-arithmetic task (von Hippel, Lakin, & Shakarchi, 2005) in which they were asked to calculate the answers to 20 problems (e.g., 11 81 18 121 19 71 17 21 8 45 ?), presented individually.

In actuality, the computer had been rigged not only to show the answers, but also to record the number of space-bar presses.

Recall that cheating behavior was measured by the number of instances in which participants allowed answers to math questions to appear when they were supposed to be calculating the answers mentally. Although this is a well-validated method of assessing cheating (von Hippel et al., 2005), note that simply doing nothing is coded as cheating.

We also included a condition intended to strengthen free-will beliefs so that we could systematically test our hypothesis about the relation between strength of free-will beliefs and moral behavior.

In the cheating-possible conditions (namely, the free-will, determinism, and neutral conditions), participants arrived at the laboratory in groups of 2 to 5, but were immediately shown to individual carrels, where they performed all tasks individually. This arrangement promoted a sense of anonymity, which was relevant for the cheating opportunity. In the two noncheating conditions, participants reported to the laboratory individually and were not given an opportunity to cheat.\nIn the cheating-possible conditions, participants first completed a task, similar to one used by Velten (1968), that involved reading and considering a series of statements meant to change beliefs or feelings. Participants were given a booklet of 15 statements (1 per page) and were asked to think about each statement for 1 min before turning the page. A tape-recorded voice indicated when to turn the page.\nBelief in free will was manipulated by varying the content of the statements. In the free-will condition, participants read statements such as, \u2018\u2018I am able to override the genetic and environmental factors that sometimes influence my behavior,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Avoiding temptation requires that I exert my free will.\u2019\u2019 In the determinism condition, participants read statements such as, \u2018\u2018A belief in free will contradicts the known fact that the universe is governed by lawful principles of science,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Ultimately, we are biological computers\u2014designed by evolution, built through genetics, and programmed by the environment.\u2019\u2019 In the neutral condition, participants read statements such as, \u2018\u2018Sugar cane and sugar beets are grown in 112 countries.\u2019\u2019 The neutral statements came from Velten\u2019s (1968) original method, whereas we created the free-will and determinism statements. After participants read and pondered all of the statements, they completed the FWD scale (Paulhus & Margesson, 1994) and the PANAS (Watson et al., 1988).\nWe then orchestrated an opportunity to cheat (e.g., Mazar et al., 2007). Participants were given a set of 15 readingcomprehension, mathematical, and logic and reasoning problems taken from the Graduate Record Examination practice tests. This type of task has been used previously to present subjects with a challenging but solvable set of problems (Schmeichel, Vohs, & Baumeister, 2003). Participants were told that the experimenter was investigating people\u2019s enjoyment of tasks when they receive feedback and rewards for performance, and hence that they would receive $1 for each problem they solved correctly.\nAt this point, the experimenter looked at her cellular telephone and announced that she had suddenly realized she had a meeting to attend. She indicated that participants should work for a maximum of 15min, and then score their own problems and pay themselves $1 for each correct answer. The experimenter motioned to several answer sheets and a manila envelope containing $1 coins. She told participants to use the mechanical shredder to shred their answer sheets because she did not have permission to keep the sheets. The experimenter left the room but waited outside to debrief participants as they exited. Although this procedure did not allow us to determine individual participants\u2019 scores on the task or the amount of money each participant paid him- or herself, we were able to calculate the average payment per participant, and this average served as a proxy for each participant\u2019s number of correct answers.\nTwo comparison conditions, labeled baseline experimenterscored and determinism experimenter-scored, enabled us to measure veridically the number of questions that participants answered\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 51\nat UNIV OF VIRGINIA on October 12, 2012pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\ncorrectly (i.e., when participants were not in the self-scoring, self-payment situation). In the baseline experimenter-scored condition, participants simply completed the cognitive problems, which the experimenter scored; participants then received $1 for each correct answer. We did not ask participants in this condition to complete the FWD scale so as not to activate the concept of free will. In the determinism experimenter-scored condition, we gave participants the determinism statements and then the logic problems. The experimenter scored the problems and paid participants $1 for each correct answer. This comparison condition allowed us to assess whether reading the scientific-sounding determinism statements had the incidental effect of aiding in solving the logic problems.\nThus, there were three comparison conditions we could use to examine the effects of the determinism and free-will manipulations on cheating: a neutral condition, in which participants were allowed to cheat but were not exposed to statements that might change their beliefs about free will; a baseline experimenter-scored condition, in which participants\u2019 true scores on the cognitive task were calculated without any manipulation; and a determinism experimenter-scored condition, in which participants read deterministic statements but were not allowed to cheat, so that their true scores on the problem set were known."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Scores on the FWD Scale", "text": "Participants in the free-will, determinism, and neutral conditions completed the FWD scale so that we could check whether the manipulations in the statement-reading task had been effective.

We measured cheating in Experiment 1 using a passive cheating opportunity. To avoid cheating, participants had to actively prevent the answer to an arithmetic problem from appearing on the computer screen. This scenario is perhaps akin to accidentally receiving toomuch change from a store clerk but not returning the extra money. In Experiment 2, we measured active cheating. We found that when participants were allowed to pay themselves for each correct answer on a difficult cognitive test, those who read statements promoting a deterministic worldview paid themselves more (in effect, claimed to have answered more items correctly) than did those who read other kinds of statements; moreover, participants who read deterministic statements and who paid themselves gave themselves more money than was earned by participants who were paid for their true performance.\nOne limitation of Experiment 2 is that we did not measure the amount of money that each individual took, but rather assessed the total amount of money taken by each group overall. However, this aspect of the procedure had the advantage of allowing participants in the cheating-possible conditions to not only score but also shred their own tests, which was crucial to establishing the anonymity necessary to measure active cheating in the lab. It is possible that only 1 or 2 participants in each group cheated, and that the remainder took their fair share of money (or less). With this procedure, we cannot be sure.\nWhat we do know is that the average take-home pay was far greater for participants in the determinism condition than for participants in any of the other four conditions, including two additional conditions in which participants scored and shredded their own tests. Note, too, that participants who read deterministic statements claimed to have solved more problems correctly than participants who read the same deterministic statements but whose true scores on the logic task were known.\nThe fact that brief exposure to amessage asserting that there is no such thing as free will can increase both passive and active cheating raises the concern that advocating a deterministic worldview could undermine moral behavior. The data from the experiments reported here are consistent with this hypothesis. Reading deterministic statements decreased people\u2019s selfreported belief in free will, and this change accounted for heightened cheating. Although people appear to have a tacit, default belief in free will (as evidenced both by participants\u2019 default responses on the Free Will subscale and by the lack of a difference in cheating behavior between the free-will and neutral conditions in Experiment 2), participants\u2019 views on this topic were in fact quite pliable. Indeed, brief exposure to mes-\nsages arguing against free will was sufficient to alter participants\u2019 views (and consequent actions).\nThe present findings raise the genuine concern that widespread encouragement of a deterministic worldview may have the inadvertent consequence of encouraging cheating behavior. Consistent with this view are recent trends suggesting both a decrease in beliefs in personal control and an increase in cheating. A recent meta-analysis that took into account cohort effects (Twenge, Zhange, & Im, 2004) revealed substantial changes in Locus of Control scores from the 1960s to the 1990s. The Locus of Control scale (Rotter, 1966) assesses lay beliefs about whether internal (personal) or external (situational) factors are responsible for one\u2019s outcomes in life (Rotter, 1966). People\u2019s belief that they do not control their own outcomes (external locus of control) jumped more than three quarters of a standard deviation over the decades Twenge et al. studied.\nWith respect to cheating, reports from the academic realm indicate that levels of cheating have increased recently. One scientist who has been tracking cheating across several decades has found that self-reports of cheating have increased (Schab, 1991). The percentage of students who admitted that they had used a \u2018\u2018cheat sheet\u2019\u2019 on an exam rose from 34% in 1969 to 68% in 1989. Other types of cheating have risen as well (e.g., allowing other students to copy work and lifting statements from printed material; Schab, 1991). There are numerous reasons why selfreported cheating might have increased in recent years. However, the concurrent decrease in belief in an internal locus of control, in combination with our findings, raises the ominous possibility that reduced belief in free will may contribute to an increase in cheating.\nAlthough the study reported here raises concerns about the possible impact of deterministic views on moral behavior, it is important not to overinterpret our findings. Our experiments measured only modest forms of ethical behavior, and whether or not free-will beliefs have the same effect on more significant moral and ethical infractions is unknown. In addition, a deterministic viewpoint may have a host of possible consequences, and only some of these may be unfavorable. For example, adopting the view that behavior is a consequence of environmental and genetic factors could encourage compassion for the mentally ill and discourage retribution in legal contexts (Greene & Cohen, 2004). A deterministic outlook may also enhance people\u2019s sensitivity to the subtle influences known to affect their goals and actions (Bargh, in press).\nIt is also crucial to emphasize that the findings reported here do not speak to the larger issue of whether free will actually exists. It is possible that free will is an illusion that nevertheless offers some functionality. It may be that a necessary cost of public awareness regarding the science of human behavior will be the dampening of certain beliefs about personal agency (Wegner, 2002). Conversely, it may prove possible to integrate a genuine sense of free will into scientific accounts of human behavior (see Baumeister, in press; Dennett, 2003; Kane, 1996;\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 53\nat UNIV OF VIRGINIA on October 12, 2012pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nShariff, Schooler, & Vohs, in press). Although the concept of free will remains scientifically in question, our results point to a significant value in believing that free will exists.\nIf exposure to deterministic messages increases the likelihood of unethical actions, then identifying approaches for insulating the public against this danger becomes imperative. Ultimately, in order to oppose the unfavorable consequences of deterministic sentiments, the field must first develop a deeper understanding of why dismissing free will leads to amoral behavior. Does the belief that forces outside the self determine behavior drain the motivation to resist the temptation to cheat, inducing a \u2018\u2018why bother?\u2019\u2019 mentality (cf. Baumeister & Vohs, 2007)? Much as thoughts of death and meaninglessness can induce existential angst that can lead to ignoble behaviors (e.g., Arndt, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1997; Heine, Proulx, & Vohs, 2006), doubting one\u2019s free will may undermine the sense of self as agent. Or, perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse to behave as one likes.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank Vanessa Ding, Alison Boyce,\nNicole Mead, and Azim Shariff for their assistance with this\nmanuscript.We are grateful for funding from theCanadaResearch\nChair program and the Social Science and Humanities Research\nCouncil of Canada (SSHCR; both authors), the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; J.W.S.),\nand the McKnight Land-Grant Professorship (K.D.V.)."}]}, {"paper_id": 145, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02100.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 1.0, "Fold_Id": 8.0, "filename": "halevy2008.pdf", "title": "\u201cIn-Group Love\u201d and \u201cOut-Group Hate\u201d as Motives for Individual Participation in Intergroup Conflict: A New Game Paradigm", "content": [{"text": "havior in intergroup conflicts? Is it the altruistic desire to help the in-group or the aggressive drive to hurt the outgroup? This article introduces a new game paradigm, the intergroup prisoner\u2019s dilemma\u2013maximizing difference (IPD-MD) game, designed specifically to distinguish between these two motives. The game involves two groups. Each group member is given a monetary endowment and can decide how much of it to contribute. Contribution can be made to either of two pools, one that benefits the ingroup at a personal cost and another that, in addition, harms the out-group. An experiment demonstrated that contributions in the IPD-MD game are made almost exclusively to the cooperative, within-group pool. Moreover, preplay intragroup communication increases intragroup cooperation, but not intergroup competition. These results are compared with those observed in the intergroup prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, in which group members\u2019 contributions are restricted to the competitive, between-group pool.\nHow can one explain the pervasive human willingness \u2018\u2018to fight and die for the ingroup . . . which makes lethal war possible\u2019\u2019 (Campbell, 1965, p. 293)? Narrow, self-interested rationality is clearly not a good explanation. Although it is often rational for\ngroups (e.g., nations, ethnic groups) to fight, it is hardly ever rational for individual group members to participate in largescale intergroup conflict. The effect one individual can possibly have on the conflict\u2019s outcome is negligible, whereas his or her cost (e.g., in forgone opportunities, physical exertion, and risk of injury or death) is rather high. Moreover, the benefits associated with winning the conflict (e.g., territory, political and economic power, group pride) are by and large public goods that are equally available to all the members of the winning group, regardless of whether they paid the cost of participation (Bornstein, 1992, 2003; Rapoport & Bornstein, 1987). This payoff structure creates a clear disincentive for individual group members to participate in intergroup conflict.\nThe explanation for individual participation in intergroup conflict must be rooted at the group level (Bowles, Choi, & Hopfensitz, 2003; Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003). Groups that fail to mobilize sufficient participation will not survive the aggression of other groups (or be able to exploit their weaknesses), and their members, conflict participants and nonparticipants alike, will have to forgo the benefits of victory or, worse yet, bear the costs of defeat. This is indeed why groups employ powerful solidarity mechanisms in time of conflict. Collective group goals and common group identity are highlighted, norms of groupbased altruism are strengthened, punishment and rejection of defectors are increased, and perceptions of the in-group and outgroup are manipulated (Brewer & Campbell, 1976; Campbell, 1965; Levine & Campbell, 1972; Sherif, 1966). Throughout human history, groups with more effective means of instilling self-sacrifice in their members have prevailed over groups with less effective solidarity mechanisms, thereby propagating their Address correspondence to Nir Halevy, School of Business Administration, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel, e-mail: nyh@mscc.huji.ac.il.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 4 405Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science\naltruistic (i.e., ethnocentric) norms and institutions (Bernhard, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2006; Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, & Richerson, 2003).\nMODELING INTERGROUP CONFLICT\nIntergroup conflicts cannot be understood without taking into consideration the internal tension between group welfare and individual welfare. Because the relative success of the two groups in overcoming this intragroup conflict determines the outcome of the intergroup competition, the intragroup and intergroup levels of conflict must be considered simultaneously. A basicmodel of this two-level structure is the intergroup prisoner\u2019s dilemma (IPD) game (Bornstein, 1992, 2003; Bornstein & BenYossef, 1994).\nIn this section, we illustrate the IPD game using a specific set of parameters (see Bornstein, 2003, for a general definition). The game is played by two groups, with 3 members in each group. Each player receives an endowment of 10 tokens and can contribute any number of these tokens to the group\u2019s pool. For each token contributed by a member of the in-group, each of its members, including the contributor, gains 1 money unit (MU) and each member of the out-group loses 1 MU. For each token kept, the player is paid 2MU. This simple game captures the key strategic properties of a large-scale intergroup conflict, as described in the introduction. Because the individual\u2019s return from contributing a token is 1 MU, but his or her cost is 2 MU, the dominant individual strategy\u2014the strategy that yields the highest personal payoffs regardless of what all the other in-group and out-group members do\u2014is to contribute nothing (i.e., defect). However, because contributing a token generates a total of 3 MU for the group while costing only 2MU, the dominant group strategy\u2014the strategy that yields the highest payoffs for each group regardless of what the other group does\u2014is for all group members to contribute all their tokens.\nThese two properties define the intragroup payoff structure in the IPD game as an n-person (3-person in our example) prisoner\u2019s dilemma (PD) game (Dawes, 1980). This internal dilemma, however, is embedded in a PD game between the two groups. If both groups execute their dominant strategies in this intergroup game, both end upwith relatively poor outcomes. From the collective point of view of both groups and all players, each token contributed is a net waste of 2 MU, because the 2 MU that could be earned by keeping the token is traded off for an ingroup gain that is exactly offset by the out-group\u2019s loss. The collectively optimal strategy\u2014the strategy that maximizes the payoff of all players in both groups\u2014is for all players to withhold contribution (i.e., defect).\nThe relations among individual, group, and collective interests in intergroup conflicts as modeled by the IPD game are clearly illustrated by Dawes\u2019s (1980) battle example. Dawes observed that\nsoldiers who fight in a large battle can reasonably conclude that no matter what their comrades do they personally are better off taking no chances; yet if no one takes chances, the result will be a rout and slaughter worse for all the soldiers than is taking chances. (p. 170)\nFrom the perspective of one side, the battle situation is a social dilemma with defection being rational for the individual but harmful to the group. However, from a broader perspective that includes all the soldiers on both sides, defection is both individually rational and collectively efficient. All soldiers in the battle will be better off if they all act selfishly and take no chances, as then no one will be hurt.\nThis additional level of superordinate or collective interest necessarily affects the motivational meaning of individual behavior. Whereas in a single-group dilemma, contributing is unmistakably altruistic and defection is plainly selfish, in intergroup conflicts as modeled by the IPD game, the motivation underlying individual behavior is inherently indistinct. Contributing can be motivated by an altruistic desire to help the ingroup, but it can also result from an aggressive motivation to hurt the out-group (or the competitive motivation to increase the ingroup\u2019s advantage over the out-group). The motivation underlying defection is also ambiguous. Refusing to take part in war can reflect a true altruistic concern for the collective welfare (of all players in both groups), but because defection is also consistent with the individual\u2019s self-interest, a pacifist is always suspected of being a free rider.\nTo disentangle these motivational ambiguities, we introduce a new paradigm, called the intergroup prisoner\u2019s dilemma\u2013maximizing difference (IPD-MD) game. Like the IPD game, the IPDMD game involves a competition between two 3-member groups. Each group member receives an endowment of 10 tokens, each worth 2 MU, and can decide how many of these tokens to contribute. Unlike in the IPD game, however, contributions can be made to two different pools. Contributing a token to the withingroup pool (pool W) increases the payoff for each in-group member, including the contributor, by 1 MU, without affecting the out-group. Contributing a token to the between-group pool (pool B) increases the payoff for each in-group member, including the contributor, by 1MU, and at the same time decreases the payoff for each out-group member by 1 MU.\nThe choice between pools Wand B is what reveals the specific motivation underlying each individual\u2019s behavior. Contributing to pool W clearly indicates a cooperative motivation to benefit the in-group without hurting the out-group. Contributing to pool B, in contrast, indicates an aggressive motivation to hurt the outgroup, or a competitive motivation to increase the in-group\u2019s advantage over the out-group.1 As in the IPD game, a narrowly\n1If players are concerned only with their in-group\u2019s welfare, and completely disregard that of the out-group, they should divide their contribution randomly between pools W and B. If, however, players intentionally restrict their contributions to pool W, they must be attaching some positive value to the outgroup\u2019s welfare, rather than being merely indifferent to it.\n406 Volume 19\u2014Number 4\nrational player should contribute nothing. However, withholding contribution (i.e., defection) in this new game is plainly selfish and can no longer be confused with an altruistic concern for the collective welfare.\nTable 1 illustrates the individual payoffs in the IPD-MD game. For simplicity, it specifies only the payoffs for the corner cells, in which all the members of a group contribute their entire endowment to pool W, contribute it all to pool B, or keep all 10 tokens. When the option of contributing to pool W is eliminated, the IPD-MD game is transformed into the IPD game (depicted by the four corner cells, in gray). When the option of contributing to pool B is removed, the game becomes two independent 3-person PD games played side by side (depicted by the four cells inside the thick outline box; Bornstein & Ben-Yossef, 1994). The IPDMD game, in which both these options are available, essentially allows group members to decide whether they wish to play the IPD or the PD game (or, more accurately, how they want to divide their efforts between the two games). If the players are compelled to contribute their entire endowment and they can decide only how to divide their 10 tokens between pools Wand B, the internal free-riding problem is eliminated, and the IPD-MD game is reduced to a maximizing difference (MD) or \u2018\u2018spite\u2019\u2019 game (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978) between the two groups (depicted by the four cells in the triple outline box).\nWe maintain that in addition to being useful for discerning between \u2018\u2018in-group love\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018out-group hate\u2019\u2019 as reasons for individual participation (and between selfishness and universalism as reasons for defection), the IPD-MD game is valuable as a simplified, abstract model of common real-world intergroup situations. Whereas the IPD game models two groups that are already fighting over absolute and relative outcomes, the IPD-\nMD game describes a more benign situation in which the members of each group can choose whether to cooperate in solving their internal dilemmas or compete with the other group for relative payoffs (Jervis, 1978; Snidal, 1986).

Communication increases cooperation by enhancing group identity and commitment (e.g., Kerr & KaufmanGilliland, 1994), eliciting relevant social norms (Bicchieri, 2002), and manipulating perceptions of the in-group and the out-group (Bornstein, 1992).

Each token that was contributed to either poolWor pool B paid 1 NIS (new Israeli shekel) to each in-group member, including the contributor. Each token that was contributed to pool B also subtracted 1 NIS from the payoff to each out-group member. For each token a player kept, he was paid 2 NIS. In addition, each player was paid a flat bonus of 30 NIS to ensure that payoffs would be positive. Thus, participants could earn between 10 NIS and 70 NIS (approximately $2.50 to $17.50), depending on the outcome of the game.\nParticipants in the no-communication condition made their decisions without communicating with the other in-group members. Participants in the communication condition met with the other members of their team for 5min of free discussion and then returned to their rooms to make their decisions in private. Participants were explicitly assured that their decisions would remain confidential.\nAfter submitting their decisions, but before learning the outcomes of the game, participants responded to a postexperimental questionnaire assessing their expectations regarding the behavior of in-group and out-group members (i.e., how many chips, on average, in-group and out-group members had contributed to each of the pools)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Following discussion, the decisions of group members were no longer independent. Therefore, all the analyses reported here (including, for the sake of comparison, those pertaining to the no-communication condition) were done at the group level (twenty 3-person groups in each of the four experimental conditions).\nThe type of game had a significant effect on the overall contribution rate\u2014the proportion of tokens that were contributed to either pool W or pool B. Across the two communication conditions, the participants contributed 63% of their endowment in the IPD-MD game, as compared with 51% in the IPD game, F(1, 76) 5 3.96, p 5 .050. The main effect of communication was also significant, F(1, 76) 5 21.47, p 5 .000. Across the two games, within-group communication increased the overall contribution rate from 44% to 70%. Game type and communication did not have an interactive effect on the overall contribution rate, F(1, 76) 5 1.41, p 5 .239. Figure 1 presents the mean contribution rates in the four conditions.\nThe most important finding concerns how contributions were divided between pools Wand B in the IPD-MD game. As Figure\n1 shows, contributions were made almost exclusively to the cooperative, within-group pool. In the no-communication condition, participants contributed an average of 47% of their endowment to pool W and less than 6% to pool B.3 Following within-group communication, contributions to pool W increased to 68%, t(29)5 2.756, p5 .010, whereas contributions to pool B remained low, at 4%.\nLooking more closely at the behavior of the individual participants revealed the following pattern. In the IPD game, about 7% of the participants in the no-communication condition contributed all 10 tokens to pool B, and 33% contributed nothing. Following group discussion, the distribution changed dramatically; 57% of the individuals contributed everything, and 18% contributed nothing. In the IPD-MD game, about 77% of participants in the no-communication condition contributed nothing to pool B, and this rate increased to 83% following discussion. About 30% of participants in the no-communication condition contributed everything to pool W, and this rate increased to 58% following group discussion.\nThe different patterns of behavior in the two games resulted in different levels of collective efficiency (i.e., the joint earnings of all the players in both groups as a percentage of the maximum possible earnings). In general, efficiency was higher in the IPDMD than in the IPD game,F(1, 36)5 51.410, p5 .000. As noted earlier, in both games, group communication enhanced individual contributions. However, in the IPD-MD game, communication increased contributions to the cooperative, withingroup pool, thus enhancing efficiency, whereas in the IPD game, communication raised contributions to the competitive, between-group pool, thereby diminishing collective efficiency. This interaction between game type and communication was statistically significant, F(1, 36) 5 18.791, p 5 .000. Specifically, in the IPD-MD game, the 6 players could have earned a total of 180 NIS if they all had contributed their entire endowment to pool W. They actually earned about 78% of this amount in the no-communication condition and almost 87% in the communication condition. In the IPD game, the 6 players could have earned a total of 120 NIS if they had all kept their entire endowment. The average efficiency rate was 65% in the nocommunication condition, and only 32% in the communication condition."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "A central issue in the psychological literature on intergroup relations is whether individual behavior in intergroup conflict is motivated by altruism toward the in-group, aggression toward the out-group, or a combination of both (De Figuerdo & Elkins, 2003). As pointed out by Brewer (1999), many researchers (e.g., Sherif, 1966; Tajfel & Turner, 1986) seem to accept that \u2018\u2018in-\n3The contribution rate to pool B in the IPD-MD game was significantly lower than the contribution rate to pool B (the only pool) in the IPD game, F(1, 76)5 109.74, p 5 .000.\n408 Volume 19\u2014Number 4\ngroup love and outgroup hate are reciprocally related\u2019\u2019 (p. 430). Other researchers, including Allport (1954) and Brewer (1999) herself, argue that in-group altruism does not necessarily imply out-group hostility.\nThis issue is equally pertinent to the literature on international relations, in which the group, rather than the individual group member, is the focus of investigation. The question in that field is whether groups (e.g., states, ethnic groups) strive to maximize absolute or relative gains (Jervis, 1978; Powell, 1991; Rousseau, 2002; Snidal, 1991). Whereas liberal institutionalists assume that groups focus on their absolute gains and have little interest in the gains of other groups, structural realists claim that groups are concernedmainly with their gains in comparison with those of other groups.\nTo distinguish between in-group love and out-group hate, or between the maximization of absolute and relative gains, as motives for individual and group behavior in intergroup conflict, we introduced and studied the IPD-MD game. In this game, players could make a costly contribution to either of two pools, one that benefited the in-group and another that, in addition, harmed the out-group. We found that contributions were made almost exclusively to the cooperative, within-group pool. Moreover, communication within the groups increased intragroup cooperation, but not intergroup competition. Clearly, participants in the IPDMD game preferred to maximize their group\u2019s absolute payoffs, rather than compete for relative payoffs, even though they could disadvantage the out-group at no additional cost.\nThis finding supports Campbell\u2019s (1965) impression that \u2018\u2018the altruistic willingness for self-sacrificial death in group causes\nmay be more significant than the covetous tendency for hostility toward outgroup members\u2019\u2019 (p. 293). It is also in line with minimal-group research, which has found that bias in favor of the ingroup is more pronounced in the positive domain (attributing positive traits, allocating rewards) than in the negative domain (attributing negative traits, allocating punishments; e.g., Amiot & Bouhris, 2003; Brewer, 1999; Buhl, 1999; Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002; Mummendey & Otten, 1998).4\nThe peaceful group coexistence observed in the IPD-MD game was utterly shattered in the IPD game, in which maximizing the in-group\u2019s gain was necessarily at the expense of the out-group (and the broader society). Under these circumstances, group members did not hesitate to compete. One obvious explanation for this behavior is that the in-group members placed more weight on the gains their contribution produced for the ingroup than on the losses it inflicted on the out-group. Another possibility is that in-group members made their contributions because they expected the out-group members to contribute and wanted to defend themselves against the possibility of falling behind. Research on intergroup interaction (e.g., Diehl, 1989) suggests that the fear of falling behind is more of a motivation\n4There is, however, an important methodological difference between the minimal-group research and the IPD-MD game paradigm. In the minimal-group paradigm, in-group favoritism and out-group derogation are investigated separately by manipulating the valence (positive/negative) of the evaluated traits and the behavioral mode (allocation/removal) of the allocated resources (Amiot & Bouhris, 2003; Mummendey & Otten, 1998). In the IPD-MD game, the relative strength of the two motives is assessed within subjects by having them make a single decision that affects their own welfare, the welfare of their ingroup, and, if they so choose, the welfare of the out-group.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 4 409\nthan the aspiration to get ahead. This explanation is consistent with the results of our postexperimental questionnaire, which indicated that participants in the IPD game expected the outgroup members to behave more competitively than did participants in the IPD-MD game, F(1, 76) 5 171.384, p 5 .000."}, {"heading": "IMPLICATIONS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION", "text": "Groups are generally considered competitive and aggressive\u2014 more so than individuals (Meier & Hinsz, 2004; Rabbie, 1998). This view of groups has been corroborated by a series of experiments comparing strategic interaction between two groups with interaction between two individuals (e.g., Schopler & Insko, 1992; Wildschut, Pinter, Vevea, Insko, & Schopler, 2003). The typical finding in these experiments was that groups interact more competitively than individuals, an effect that has been labeled the individual-group discontinuity effect.\nThe present study found that groups are not competitive or aggressive per se. In fact, when possible, group members prefer to cooperate so as to maximize their absolute group gains, rather than to compete against the out-group for relative gains (and they assume that out-group members have similar preferences). However, when maximizing in-group gain necessitates hurting the out-group, in-groupmembers do not hesitate to compete (and they assume that out-group members would be similarly competitive). Although these results may appear at odds with the discontinuity hypothesis, this is not necessarily the case. The discontinuity research investigated intergroup and interindividual interactions in the 2-person PD game. In this game, as in the IPD game we used, competition can be motivated by either absolute- or relative-gain considerations. Groups may very well appear more competitive than individuals simply because they are more rational players with better insight into the strategic structure of the game than individuals (Bornstein, 2003; Lodewijkx, Rabbie, & Visser, 2006; Rabbie, 1998).\nOur results have important implications for conflict resolution. Above all, the high level of intragroup cooperation and the low level of intergroup competition observed in the IPD-MD game suggest that intergroup conflicts can be resolved by channeling group members\u2019 altruism toward internal group causes.Whereas in the IPD game, \u2018\u2018peace\u2019\u2019 is achieved only if all members of both groups defect, in the IPD-MD game, groups can avoid war while maintaining their ability to mobilize collective action. In view of the difficulties that individual rationality poses for mobilization of collective action in the first place, losing this ability is highly problematic from a group\u2019s point of view (Campbell, 1972). Clearly, \u2018\u2018more cooperative groups are less subject to extinction because they are more effective in warfare, more successful in co-insuring, [and] more adept at managing commons resources\u2019\u2019 (Boyd et. al., 2003, p. 3531).\nSherif (1966) believed that the existence of superordinate goals is necessary to increase cooperation and reduce conflict between groups. As pointed out by Brewer (1999), however, a\ncommon challenge or threat is unlikely to increase cooperation between highly differentiated social groups. People cooperate if they expect others to cooperate as well (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003), and although they expect reciprocation from in-group members, they do not expect it frommembers of out-groups (e.g., Yamagishi & Kiyonari, 2000). Cooperative social norms are group-level phenomena that emerge through interactions within groups and apply to in-group members (Bernhard et al., 2006). Thus, the solution to intergroup conflict put forward by the IPDMD game may be more feasible than that suggested by Sherif. The collectively optimal solution, the one maximizing joint welfare in the IPD-MD game, calls for cooperation among the members of the same group and, at least in this respect, is \u2018\u2018essentially non-problematic\u2019\u2019 (Brewer, 1999, p. 436).\nThe present study examined the IPD-MD game played only once between small, randomly composed laboratory groups. So that our results will be more pertinent to real-world group conflicts, this preliminary investigation should eventually be expanded to include repeated interactions between larger groups with more meaningful group identities and boundaries.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We acknowledge the support of the Israel\nScience Foundation to Gary Bornstein (Grant 535/05), the Israel\nFoundation Trustees and the Minerva Center for Human Rights\nat the Hebrew University to Nir Halevy, and the Recanati\nFoundation of the Hebrew University School of Business Ad-\nministration to Lilach Sagiv."}]}, {"paper_id": 146, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02070.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 0.0, "Fold_Id": 4.0, "filename": "janssen2008 (1).pdf", "title": "A word-order constraint on phonological activation", "content": [{"heading": "Research Report", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A Word-Order Constraint on", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Phonological Activation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Niels Janssen,1,2 F.-Xavier Alario,1 and Alfonso Caramazza2,3", "text": "1CNRS and Universite\u0301 de Provence; 2Harvard University; and 3Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences, Trento University\nABSTRACT\u2014Word-order rules impose major constraints on linguistic behavior. For example, adjectives appear before nouns in English, and after nouns in French. This means that constraints on word order must be language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. Despite the importance of these rules, little is known about how they operate. We report an influence of word order on the activation of phonological representations. Participants were presented with colored objects and asked to name either the colors or the objects; the phonological similarity between the object and color names was manipulated. French speakers showed a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming. English participants yielded the opposite pattern: a phonological effect in object naming, but not in color naming. Differences in the typical order of nouns and adjectives in French and English provide a plausible account for this cross-linguistic contrast. More generally, these results provide direct evidence for the operation of word-order constraints during language production.\nMany languages impose constraints on the order in which words from various grammatical classes appear in a sentence. Compare, for example, English and French noun phrases, such as blue car versus voiture bleue. As these phrases illustrate, adjectives appear before nouns in English, but typically appear after nouns in French. This example suggests that constraints on word order are language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. Within the field of language production, relatively little research has been dedicated to understanding word-order constraints (some exceptions are Bates, Friederici, Wulfeck, & Juarez, 1988; Bock, 1987; Cleland & Pickering, 2003; Dell & Reich, 1981; Garrett, 1976; Hartsuiker & Wes-\ntenberg, 2000; Janssen, 2005). In this article, we report a study in which we investigated how word order influences the activation of phonological representations. The prevalent view in language-production models is that phonological representations are activated by means of a cascading flow of activation from the lexical level: As soon as a lexical representation is activated, its corresponding phonological representations are activated (see Goldrick, 2006, for a review; but see Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). The phonological congruency effect demonstrated by Morsella and Miozzo (2002) was interpreted as supporting this hypothesis. These authors observed that naming a target picture (e.g., dog) in the context of a distracting, not-named picture is faster if the distractor\u2019s name (e.g., doll) is phonologically congruent with the target\u2019s name than if it is incongruent (e.g., bell). These results follow from the assumption that the activation of the context picture\u2019s name cascades to its phonological representations. When the context and target phonological representations are congruent, those representations are activated and selected more quickly (Goldrick, 2006, and references therein; see also Meyer & Damian, 2007; Morgan & Meyer, 2005; but see Bloem & La Heij, 2003). This unregulated-cascading hypothesis states that any active word representation will activate its phonological representations. This simple view is problematic for multiword production, however, because many target words that will ultimately be produced are active concurrently. Under such circumstances, it is not obvious how a particular target word\u2019s phonological representations can be distinguished from the phonological representations activated by the other target words. One solution is to assume that activation of phonological representations is constrained by the linear relationships among lexical items. For example, if word order constrains phonological activation, then at any point in time, phonological representations of earlier words receive stronger activation than those of later words (e.g., Dell, 1986). Evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. Some results consistent with it were reported in studies using the picture-word interference paradigm to investigate the scope of phonological encoding during multiword production.

This was taken as evidence for graded phonological activation of the words composing the target utterance (see also Costa & Caramazza, 2002; Damian & Dumay, 2007; Dell, Burger, & Svec, 1997; Meyer, 1996). Consider in this context the two noun-phrase examples given earlier. If word order constrains phonological activation, then the canonical word order will initially lead to greater activation of adjective than noun phonology in English, and the opposite pattern in French.\nNavarrete and Costa (2006) extended the evidence in support of a cascading flow of activation to the situation in which an adjective and a noun are active concurrently. In their study, Spanish participants named the color of colored objects faster when the phonological onsets of the color and object names were congruent (e.g., vela verde, \u2018\u2018green candle\u2019\u2019) than when they were incongruent (e.g., vela azul, \u2018\u2018blue candle\u2019\u2019). In Spanish, nouns typically appear before adjectives. The hypothesis that word order modulates phonological activation explains this phonological congruency effect in adjective naming by assuming early activation of the noun. This hypothesis further predicts that naming of object nouns in languages with noun-adjective word order, such as Spanish, should not be influenced by the phonology of color adjectives. This is because the activation of noun phonology should precede the activation of adjective phonology.\nWe tested this prediction in Experiment 1, in which French speakers named either the color of an object or the object itself. In French, as in Spanish, object nouns typically appear before color adjectives. The word-order-modulation hypothesis predicts a phonological facilitation effect for adjectives, but not for nouns. Finding similar phonological effects for nouns and adjectives would be evidence against the hypothesis.\nEXPERIMENT 1: COLOR AND OBJECT NAMING IN FRENCH"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Thirty-two native speakers of French participated in this experiment.

For each color, we selected seven pictures (Alario & Ferrand, 1999) that shared at least the onset consonant with the color name. These color-object pairings were used for the congruent condition. The incongruent condition was created by re-pairing all pictures having a given onset with a particular color whose name had a different onset (e.g., all \u2018\u2018r\u2019\u2019 pictures were re-paired with the same nonred color), so that picture names and color names did\nnot overlap in phonology (see Table 1 for a list of the object names). Thus, there were 56 experimental items.

Participants in the color-naming task were then told the four color names that would be used in the subsequent two phases. After familiarization, participants were trained and then performed the experiment proper. These two phases had identical trial structures: a fixation cross (700 ms), followed by a blank screen (200 ms), followed by a picture of a colored object (1,500 ms).

These results are consistent with the assumption that word-order constraints modulate the activation of phonological representations. This assumption predicts a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming, in languages with a noun-adjective word order. However, an alternative, nonlinguistic interpretation is possible. The results could have been due to differences in the speed of processing objects and colors, which, in turn, could have led to differences in how fast the phonology of object and color names was activated. If the phonology of the object name was activated faster than the phonology of the color name, then the activation of the object name\u2019s phonology would have affected color naming; object naming would not have been affected by the color name\u2019s phonology, which would have been activated more slowly and therefore too late. Note, however, that although object-naming latencies were overall slower than color-naming latencies (Table 2), this does not necessarily exclude the possibility that phonological activation was faster for object names than for color names.\nIn Experiment 2, we put this alternative hypothesis to a test with native English speakers. In English, color adjectives appear before nouns\u2014the opposite of the order in French.

This rules out the possibility that the results of these experiments are due to nonlinguistic differences in the retrieval speed of object- and color-name phonology. If such were the case, the same pattern of phonological congruency effects should have been observed in the two experiments. The alternative word-order hypothesis provides a plausible account of the contrasting results in French and English, based on a clear contrastive property that differentiates these two languages.\nCould other language-specific properties be responsible for the results? Lexical properties are unlikely candidates. The ratios of adjective lexical frequency to noun lexical frequency for experimental items were similar in the two experiments (M 5 20 in French and 15 in English), t(134) < 1), as were the ratios of the number of letters in adjectives to the number of letters in nouns (M 5 0.9 in both French and English), t(134) < 1.\nAnother important difference between French and English noun phrases is that French noun phrases often require grammatical gender agreement, whereas English noun phrases never do (Corbett, 1991). Consider, then, the following scenario. If, in\ngeneral, color names are retrieved faster than object names, this would explain the English data. Differences in the speed of color- and object-name retrieval would be reduced in languages with grammatical gender, however, because the agreement processes impose dependencies on adjective and noun retrieval. In French, the phonological form of an adjective depends on the grammatical gender of the corresponding noun. The faster processing of adjective phonology would be delayed until the gender of the corresponding noun is available. Although suggestive, this explanation does not accurately account for the pattern of results observed in Experiment 1. If the dependency of gender agreement brings the speed of color-name processing on a par with the speed of object-name processing, one would expect a phonological congruency effect in both color and object naming. Given that an effect was observed only for color naming, this explanation is unlikely (as is any explanation that equates the two activation speeds to honor agreement constraints).1"}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "In two experiments, participants were presented with colored objects, and the phonological congruence between the color and object name was manipulated. In Experiment 1, with French participants, a phonological congruency effect was found for color naming (see Navarrete & Costa, 2006), but not for object naming. In Experiment 2, with English participants, the opposite pattern of results was obtained: a phonological congruency effect for object naming, but not for color naming.\nLanguage-independent processing speeds of colors and objects, or differences in the requirement for gender agreement in the noun phrase, cannot account for these results. Rather, we assume that language-specific word-order constraints modulate the phonological activation of color and object names when colored objects are presented. Specifically, given that nouns typically precede adjectives in French, the activation of noun phonology is initially favored over the activation of adjective phonology. Consequently, the activation of the object name\u2019s phonology primes color naming. Activation of the color name\u2019s phonology occurs later and therefore does not prime object naming. The opposite pattern of results was expected, and was observed, in English.\nIt is perhaps surprising that we demonstrated the phonological congruency effect even though participants were producing single words\u2014adjectives or nouns\u2014rather than complete noun phrases. This means that the word-order constraint we postulate is operational even for single-word utterances. This constraint could stem from the partial activation of a canonically ordered noun-phrase frame (e.g., Garrett, 1976), from word-order information present in the lexical representation of the items (e.g.,\n1To further tease apart the individual contributions of word order and gender to our pattern of results, one could investigate the phonological congruency effect in color and object naming in a language that shares relevant word-order constraints with English and gender agreement with French (e.g., Dutch).\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 219\nLevelt, 1989), or from statistically learned, biased mappings linking objects and colors to nouns and adjectives (e.g., Dell, Reed, Adams, & Meyer, 2000). For now, the results we report do not favor one of these possibilities over the others. They indicate that when multiple words are activated, the cascading activation of their phonological representations is modulated by languagespecific word-order properties. This phenomenon provides some insight into how word order is used during language production.\nAcknowledgments\u2014This research was supported by a Fyssen\nFoundation postdoctoral fellowship to N.J. and by National In-\nstitutes of Health Grant DC04542 to A.C."}]}, {"paper_id": 150, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02044.x", "O_within_CI_R": 0.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 0.0, "Fold_Id": 2.0, "filename": "forti2008.pdf", "title": "Sensitivity to object viewpoint and action instructions during search for targets in the lower visual field", "content": [{"text": "sented in prototypical views and targets presented in nonprototypical views, when targets were defined by their names andwhen theywere defined by the action thatwould normally be performed on them. The likelihood of the first fixation falling on the target was increased for prototypicalview targets falling in the lower visual field. When targets were defined by actions, the durations of fixations were reduced for targets in the lower field. The results are consistent with eye movements in search being affected by representations within the dorsal visual stream, where there is strong representation of the lower visual field. These representations are sensitive to the familiarity or the affordance offered by objects in prototypical views, and they are influenced by action-based templates for targets.\nIn visual search tasks, participants are typically asked to detect particular targets presented among varying numbers of distractors. How the target is defined appears to affect the nature of the search process.Humphreys andRiddoch (2001) reported data froma patient with unilateral visual neglect, who frequently failed to detect targets on the side of space contralateral to his lesion when targets were defined by their names. However, this neglect was strikingly reduced when the patient was asked to find targets that were defined by the action that would be performed on them (e.g., \u2018\u2018find the object to drink from\u2019\u2019 vs. \u2018\u2018find the cup\u2019\u2019). To account\nfor these findings, the authors suggested that the patient was able tomatch inputwith a template based on the action, but was unable to match input with a template derived from the name of the object. This was true even though the patient knew what each object was from its name, and even though he showed normal identification of single objects. The patient may have been able to maintain the action template better than any visual template derived from the object\u2019s name, so that an action template helped him sustain search on the affected side; alternatively, the patient may have been able to respond to affordances that were computed independently of an object\u2019s identity and that were detectable from objects on both the ipsi- and contralesional sides of space.\nA study by Bekkering and Neggers (2002) provides converging evidence from normal observers. In this study, participants either pointed to or grasped a target defined by a conjunction of its orientation and color. Saccades to distractors having the same orientation as the target were more likely when a grasping response was made than when a pointing response was made. This suggests that contrasting actions can differentially weight visual information, with orientation being weighted more strongly for selection when a grasping rather than a pointing response is required (see also Hannus, Cornelissen, Lindemann, & Bekkering, 2005). These data are consistent withmodels in which search can be guided in a top-down fashion by templates defined by the target or the action to be made with the target (cf. Duncan & Humphreys, 1989;Moores, Laiti, &Chelazzi, 2003;Wolfe, 1994). Apparently, holding a template for a particular action and holding a template based on a visual definition of an object can shape the search process differently.\nIn the study reported in this article, we sought to examine further the contrast between searching for a target defined by an Address correspondence to Glyn W.

We measured eye movements while normal participants searched for named-defined and action-defined targets. Performance was analyzed separately for trials with targets in the upper visual field and trials with targets in the lower visual field. The dorsal area of V1 represents the lower visual field and projects primarily to the dorsal visual pathway, whereas the ventral area of V1 represents the upper visual field and projects primarily to the ventral visual pathway (Horton & Hoyt, 1991; Previc, 1990). Thus, there are stronger projections from the lower visual field than from the upper visual field into posterior parietal cortex (e.g., area V6A; Galletti, Fattori, Gamberini, & Kutz, 1999). It is possible that searching by action and searching by name differentially recruit the dorsal and ventral visual pathways to support performance. Milner and Goodale (1993), for example, argued that the ventral pathway is functionally specialized for object recognition (the \u2018\u2018what\u2019\u2019 pathway) and the dorsal pathway is functionally specialized for the actions linked to objects (the \u2018\u2018how\u2019\u2019 pathway; see also Creem & Proffitt, 2001). It may follow that searching by action, recruiting the dorsal visual stream, favors information in the lower visual field. In addition, Previc (1990) argued that because the lower visual field represents near space, neural regions responding to this area are specialized for the analysis of features relevant to actions with objects in near space. In contrast, searching for an object defined by its namemay favor information in the upper visual field, whichmay bemore specialized for distal properties of objects tied to their identity (cf. Previc, 1990).\nIn addition to examining the effects of instruction, we evaluated search for targets in prototypical relative to nonprototypical views. Though the time needed to recognize objects and to derive action-related information about objects should be less for stimuli in prototypical views than for stimuli in nonprototypical views (e.g., Palmer, Rosch, & Chase, 1981), this effect may be most pronounced for action decisions and for neural regions responsive to action affordances from objects. For example, in Humphreys and Riddoch\u2019s (2001) study of neglect, the benefits for searching by action occurred when objects appeared in prototypical views for action. Similarly, Yoon and Humphreys (2007) reported that comparedwith semantic decisionsmade in response to objects, action decisions are more sensitive to viewpoint. Accordingly, dorsal regions, which are sensitive to action, might be particularly affected by viewpoint."}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The 14 participants (11 females and 3 males; ages 17\u201339 years, M 5 25.7) were all right-handed and had either normal or corrected-to-normal vision."}, {"heading": "Apparatus", "text": "The experiment was controlled by a 1.5-GHz Pentium IV computer.

Presentation of stimuli was self-paced, and subjects were allowed to take an unlimited number of breaks.\nThe stimuli were black-and-white photographs of real objects (see Fig. 1b). On any trial, all the stimuli were depicted in either a prototypical or a nonprototypical view (view was randomized across trials). When an object was depicted in a prototypical view, all its main features were visible, and the object was aligned for action. In the nonprototypical view, the object was rotated away from its usual view, and it was not oriented for a right-hand action; typically, the graspable part of the object was positioned toward the nondominant (left) hand (for our righthanded participants).\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 43\nat UNIV OF CONNECTICUT on April 12, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nEach photograph was inscribed into an area measuring 100 100 pixels (4.61 4.61 at a viewing distance of 60 cm), and the relative size of the objects was taken into account (e.g., a bicycle was bigger than a pen).

We discuss each effect in turn. Generally, we found an effect of orientation in four of the five eye movement parameters measured, with performance being facilitated for stimuli depicted in a prototypical view.\nThus, compared with nonprototypical-view targets, prototypical-view targets were more likely to receive first fixations, had shorter total fixation durations, and required fewer fixations before the detection response was initiated. These effects of viewpoint are consistent with the literature on object recognition and on action decisions in response to objects, which shows that the familiarity of view is a strong determiner of performance (Palmer et al., 1981; Yoon & Humphreys, 2007). Interestingly, though, viewpoint interacted with visual field when the probability of making a first fixation to a target and the duration of the first fixation to the target were measured. The increased probability of making a first fixation to a prototypical-view target was more pronounced when the target was in the lower visual field than when it was in the upper visual field.\nThe instruction manipulation influenced several other eye movement parameters. Specifically, the action instructions facilitated performance as measured by parameters reflecting eye movements after targets had been fixated (Fig. 3). These effects were confined to targets falling in the lower visual field. The duration of the first fixation made to the target, the number of fixations made to the target before the detection response was made, and the average total length of the fixations on the target were all selectively reduced for targets in the lower visual field in the action condition. When objects were cued by their names, these effects of field were absent (if anything, there was a tendency for the duration of the first fixations on targets to be reduced for targets in the upper visual field).\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 45\nat UNIV OF CONNECTICUT on April 12, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nTo understand these results, it is useful to differentiate between effects on the first saccade made in search and effects on subsequent fixation behavior. The probability of the first saccade being directed at a target was affected by the orientation of the stimuli and the visual field of the target, but not by the instructions. The first saccade was more likely to go to a prototypical-view than to a nonprototypical-view target, but only when that target fell in the lower visual field; indeed, only when a prototypical-view target fell in the lower visual field was the likelihood of the first fixation going to the target greater than chance. In many search tasks, search is biased to start in the upper visual field (Heywood & Churcher, 1980). However, there was no evidence for such a bias in the present study. We calculated the probability of the first saccade being directed toward the upper versus the lower visual field, irrespective of the target\u2019s location, and found no difference in the rate of downward\n46 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\nat UNIV OF CONNECTICUT on April 12, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nversus upward saccades, either as amain effect,F(1, 13)5 3.09, prep5 .81, or in combination with instructions or viewpoint (both Fs < 1.0). The data suggest that there was no systematic tendency, across participants, for search to start or end in set locations. The tendency for first fixations to go to a prototypicalview target in the lower field, then, does not reflect a general pattern in search, but rather reflects the capture of overt attention by the stimulus. This result is consistent with the prototypical-view target being detected by the dorsal visual stream prior to the eye movement being programmed\u2014so that the effect emerged only when the target was in the lower visual field. The data suggest that the dorsal stream is sensitive to either the familiarity of the viewpoint or the affordance when the object is in the appropriate orientation for action.\nViewpoint had an early effect on search, influencing where the first saccade was made. However, the task instructions did affect fixation behavior after the first saccade. Fixation durations were reduced, and fewer fixations weremade, when targets were in the lower visual field and the action instructions were given. In the name condition, first-fixation durations tended to be reduced for targets in the upper visual field. These results suggest that the different task instructions affected a stage of processing in which fixated information was matched to a template defining the target. There appears to be a better match of stimulus information to an action-based template for a target falling in the lower, rather than the upper, visual field, whereas, if anything, there is a better match to a template derived from the object\u2019s name when the target is in the upper, rather than the lower, visual field. This fit to the template in the action task is also better for objects depicted in prototypical views, given that the duration of the first fixation in this condition was shorter for targets in prototypical views than for targets in nonprototypical views. These results are consistent with action-based templates being represented in the dorsal visual stream.2\nAlthough action instructions reduced the duration of the first fixation to targets in the lower visual field, first fixations were much longer under action than name instructions when targets fell in the upper visual field. This is not surprising. There is inherently more ambiguity about targets defined by action than about targets defined by their name (\u2018\u2018Is there an object that cuts paper present?\u2019\u2019 vs. \u2018\u2018Are scissors present?\u2019\u2019), and one can thus expect that it would take more time to verify that a target matches a verbal instruction under action than under name instructions. The striking result is that this advantage for the name condition was reversed for targets in the lower field, which suggests that an action template was matched directly to the stimulus in this case.\nIt should be noted that once an observer makes a first saccade to an item in the upper or lower visual field, that item is no longer\nin the same retinotopic location, though the object remains in the same position with respect to the observer\u2019s body. Also, after the first saccade, objects originally in the lower visual field may tend still to be represented in near space, and objects originally in the upper visual field to be represented in far space (cf. Previc, 1990). If processing biases in the dorsal stream are sensitive to the position of objects with respect to the observer\u2019s body, or if the dorsal stream is more sensitive to object locations in near space than to object locations in far space, then the emergence of the lower-field advantage in searching by action can be explained. In addition, it is possible that the advantage of the lower visual field reflects the superior extraction of information from the retinotopic lower field, which then facilitates matching to the action template. The opposite tendency, for an upper-field advantage in searching for objects defined by their names, also arose for fixation behavior subsequent to the first saccade, which suggests that this tendency, too, reflects a process involving matching to memory, rather than directing attention in the first place.\nIn conclusion, the data indicate that action instructions and viewpoint-dependent familiarity or affordance have specific effects on search for objects appearing in the lower visual field. The results fit with the idea that the dorsal visual stream, where there is strong representation of the lower visual field, can both direct overt attention (the first saccade) and modulate the time required to match a stimulus to a template of the target.\nAcknowledgments\u2014This work was supported by grants from\nthe Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and Med-\nical Research Council (UK)."}]}, {"paper_id": 151, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02227.x", "O_within_CI_R": 0.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 0.0, "pvalue_label": 0.0, "Fold_Id": 3.0, "filename": "schnall2008.pdf", "title": "With a clean conscience: Cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments.", "content": [{"text": "sized reasoning and conscious thought while downplaying the role of intuitive and contextual influences. However, recent research has demonstrated that incidental feelings of disgust can influence moral judgments and make themmore severe. This study involved two experiments demonstrating that the reverse effect can occur when the notion of physical purity is made salient, thus making moral judgments less severe. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The findings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes, rather than deliberate reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection tomoral purity.\nMany cultures equate physical cleanliness with moral and spiritual purity. For example, many religious practices require that one first engage in physical cleansing, such as washing parts of one\u2019s body. Haidt and colleagues (e.g., Haidt & Joseph, 2008) have proposed that the notion of purity constitutes a basic moral intuition that developed from the need to safeguard oneself from potentially harmful substances. According to this approach, disgust evolved as an emotion to protect the body from germs, parasites, and spoilt food, but it was then extended to social and moral domains (Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000). As a consequence, people often report finding immoral acts disgusting. Indeed, similar neural structures appear to be involved in the experience of physical and moral disgust (Moll et al., 2005).\nRecent studies have demonstrated that experimentally induced feelings of disgust can attach themselves to moral judgments, leading the person to conclude that a particular moral action is quite wrong (Schnall, Haidt, Clore, & Jordan, 2008; see\nalso Wheatley & Haidt, 2005). Physical disgust was induced by exposure to a bad smell, working in a disgusting room, recalling a physically disgusting experience, or a video induction. In each case, the results showed that disgust can increase the severity of moral judgments in comparison with those made in control conditions, and this effect applied irrespective of whether the action to be judged was itself physically disgusting or not. In contrast to disgust, induced sadness did not influence moral judgments. These studies showed that moral judgments can be based on intuitive emotional feelings rather than on rational reasoning processes (Haidt, 2001; Prinz, 2006), even when the feeling of disgust was irrelevant to the moral action under consideration.\nOn the flip side of disgust, the association between physical and moral purity in Western cultures was recently demonstrated by Zhong and Liljenquist (2006). After recalling a moral transgression from their own lives, participants weremore likely to think of cleansing-related words, and they showed a desire to engage in cleansing behavior. The two experiments reported in this article investigated the reverse relationship: If cleansing behavior can \u2018\u2018wash away one\u2019s sins,\u2019\u2019 as Zhong and Liljenquist (2006) demonstrated, then the feeling of cleanliness should reduce the perceived seriousness of moral transgressions and also \u2018\u2018wash away other people\u2019s sins.\u2019\u2019 Following research showing that concepts of cleanliness can be primed in subtle ways (Holland, Hendriks, & Aarts, 2005), the first experiment activated concepts of cleanliness and asked participants to rate how wrong certain moral actions were. Because the sense of purity from the priming should be misattributed to the moral judgments, it was expected that priming with cleanliness words would reduce the severity of moral judgments more so than would priming with neutral control words.\nEXPERIMENT 1"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Forty University of Plymouth undergraduate students (30 female, 10 male; mean age 5 20.00 years, SD 5 1.85 years) participated as part of a course requirement.

For the cleanliness condition, half of the sets contained words related to the theme of cleanliness and purity (e.g., pure, washed, clean, immaculate, pristine), and the other sets contained only neutral words.\nImmediately after the priming task, participants rated six moral dilemmas (as used by Schnall et al., 2008): \u2018\u2018Dog\u2019\u2019 (eating one\u2019s dead dog), \u2018\u2018Trolley\u2019\u2019 (switching the tracks of a trolley to kill one workman instead of five), \u2018\u2018Wallet\u2019\u2019 (keeping money inside a found wallet), \u2018\u2018Plane Crash\u2019\u2019 (killing a terminally ill plane crash survivor to avoid starvation), \u2018\u2018Re\u0301sume\u0301\u2019\u2019 (putting false information on a re\u0301sume\u0301), and \u2018\u2018Kitten\u2019\u2019 (using a kitten for sexual arousal).

This finding indicates the connection between cognitive and moral purity and shows that intuitive concepts can have an influence on moral judgments independently of deliberate reasoning processes (Haidt, 2001).\nEXPERIMENT 2\nThe first experiment showed that surreptitiously activated cognitive concepts related to purity can influence moral decisions. However, in addition to cognitive components, a central component of purity is the physical behavior of cleansing one\u2019s body from experienced contaminants (Rozin et al., 2000). Indeed, disgust, the feeling indicating the absence of physical purity, might be an especially embodied emotion because of its strong connection to nausea and the physical process of expelling contaminants (Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, & Imada, 1997; Schnall et al., 2008). Thus, if there is a strong connection between physical cleansing and moral purity, then cleansing behavior might eliminate the effect of an already-present feeling of disgust on moral judgments. As noted earlier, several studies demonstrated that feelings of disgust can make moral judgments more severe (Schnall et al., 2008;Wheatley &Haidt, 2005). The aim of the second study was to test whether this effect could be reduced when participants were given an opportunity to physically cleanse themselves after experiencing disgust. All participants watched a physically disgusting scene from a film, and half of the participants were asked to wash their hands with soap and water before completing the moral vignettes.

Participants in the hand-washing condition were additionally told that the second room was a staff room and that they would be required to wash their hands when going into it, because the room needed to be kept as clean and tidy as possible. The staff room was equipped with a sink, antibacterial soap in a pump dispenser, and paper towels. To make the cover story about the room plausible, the table was covered with a tablecloth, and a vase with artificial flowers was placed on it to create the sense of its being a tidy staff room.

Because of the danger of making the cleansing manipulation salient, we did not obtain additional disgust ratings after the hand-washing procedure.

Participants who had cognitive concepts of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or who had physically cleansed themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2) made less severe moral judgments relative to participants who were not exposed to cleanliness manipulations. In both experiments, the effect of the rather subtle manipulations was substantial, with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen, 1988).\nOur findings support the notion that purity can serve as a basic intuition when judging the moral quality of an action: People appear to have intuitions about moral transgressions that go beyond principles of harm or fairness. Thus, our findings support Haidt\u2019s (2001) social intuitionist model that proposes that people use intuitions when making judgments about right and wrong, even when these intuitions are incidental and irrelevant to the object or situation being judged. Whereas Zhong and Liljenquist\u2019s (2006) studies indicated that activating cleansingrelated concepts alleviated concerns about one\u2019s own morality, the cleanliness manipulations in the two studies reported in this article influenced how morally wrong participants considered hypothetical actions that were not immediately pertinent to themselves.\nAlthough discussion of Haidt\u2019s (2001) model has predominantly focused on emotional processes (Pizarro & Bloom, 2003), strictly speaking, it does not pit emotional against rational processes; rather, it emphasizes the quick and automatic nature of both affective and cognitive processes that take place largely outside of conscious awareness. In fact, we agree with Monin, Pizarro, and Beer\u2019s (2007) observation that the polarizing debate of the roles of reason and/or emotion in making moral judgments might artificially limit the study of moral psychology. Intuitive processes might not always need to involve emotional processes (cf. Hauser, 2006). Indeed, in our two studies, we found that intuitive processes and contextual factors unrelated to specific emotions influenced moral judgments. Intuitions were provided by activating concepts relating to purity (Experiment 1) and by having participants engage in cleansing behaviors that reestablished physical purity after experiencing physical disgust (Experiment 2).\nIn conclusion, the current studies provide evidence that, in the context of morality, purity is not just a metaphor. Presumably because human beings aim to distinguish themselves from other animals, they attempt to place themselves close to higher spiritual beings by being physically andmorally pure (Haidt, Koller,\n&Dias, 1993; Rozin et al., 2000). Because of its potential to lead people to regard moral actions as pure and good, cleanliness might indeed feel as if it were next to godliness.\nAcknowledgments\u2014This research was supported by National\nScience Foundation Grant BCS 0518835 and by Economic and\nSocial Research Council First Grant RES-061-25-0119."}]}, {"paper_id": 153, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02049.x", "O_within_CI_R": 0.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 0.0, "Fold_Id": 5.0, "filename": "palmer2008.pdf", "title": "Extremal edge: a powerful cue to depth perception and figure-ground organization", "content": [{"text": "point-specific horizons of self-occlusion on smooth convex surfaces. An ecological analysis of viewpoint constraints suggests that an EE surface is likely to be closer to the observer than the non-EE surface on the other side of the edge. In two experiments, one using shading gradients and the other using texture gradients, we demonstrated that EEs operate as strong cues to relative depth perception and figure-ground organization. Image regionswith anEE along the shared border were overwhelmingly perceived as closer than either flat or equally convex surfaces without an EE along that border. A further demonstration suggests that EEs are more powerful than classical figureground cues, including even the joint effects of small size, convexity, and surroundedness.\nObservers often view natural scenes in which one opaque object partly occludes another so that their retinal projections share an image contour. Such situations raise a critical question for vision science: Which region attached to the shared edge is perceived as the closer, occluding \u2018\u2018figure,\u2019\u2019 and which region is perceived as the farther, partly occluded \u2018\u2018ground\u2019\u2019? The observer\u2019s choice of figure and ground determines not only perceived depth relations, but also the perceived shape of the closer surface, objectidentification processes, and other shape-based processing.\nRubin (1921/1958) is well known for demonstrating several factors that bias perception toward seeing a given area as closer and figural. These factors include surroundedness, small size, higher contrast, and horizontal or vertical orientation. Since Rubin, researchers have identified many additional factors, including symmetry (Bahnsen, 1928), convexity (Kanizsa & Gerbino, 1976; Metzger, 1936/2006), familiarity (Peterson & Gibson, 1991, 1994), location in a lower region (Vecera, Vogel,\n& Woodman, 2002), wider base (Hulleman & Humphreys, 2004), and edge-region grouping (Palmer & Brooks, in press). The present article discusses another potent factor in figureground perception: extremal edges (EEs).1\nAn EE is the projection of a viewpoint-specific horizon of selfocclusion on a smooth convex surface. An EE for a given object from a specified viewpoint is defined as the projection of the subset of surface points whose sight lines from the viewpoint are tangent to the surface (e.g., Barrow & Tennenbaum, 1978; Malik, 1987).2 Consider a person looking toward the side of a cylinder, as in the plan view shown in Figure 1a. Figures 1b and 1c illustrate the EE images that result if the cylinder\u2019s surface is homogeneous gray and black-and-white checkered, respectively. Figures 1d through 1f show plan views of the three qualitatively different depth relations that might hold between the EE and non-EE surfaces. Consistent withHelmholtz\u2019s (1867/ 1925) likelihood principle, an ecological analysis of viewpoint constraints suggests that the EE side is likely to be closer than the non-EE side because that possibility is consistent with a wider range of viewpoint locations (see also Huggins & Zucker, 2001a, 2001b). Situations in which the non-EE side is closer or touching the EE are highly accidental. Therefore, if the visual\nAddress correspondence to Stephen E.

Shepard (1990, p. 72) used shading EEs in an ambiguous figureground drawing titled \u2018\u2018Beckoning Balusters,\u2019\u2019 and Diane Beck used them to bias the figural side of figure-ground displays in an unpublished study in our laboratory. Also, von der Heydt and Pierson (2006) discussed border ownership in asymmetrical luminance profiles in the watercolor illusion (Pinna, Brelstaff, & Spillmann, 2001) but did not explicitly discuss EEs.\n2Zucker and his colleagues (Huggins, Chen, Belhumeur, & Zucker, 2001; Huggins & Zucker, 2001a, 2001b) have called EEs \u2018\u2018folds,\u2019\u2019 following the nomenclature developed in topology. This label seems to apply more naturally to situations in which gradient patterns define a depth edge between different regions of the same surface, such as folds of cloth in curtains or a full skirt. We prefer the EE terminology employed by Barrow and Tennenbaum (1978) in discussing figure-ground issues because it applies to cases in which the edge in question marks the bounding contour of the object on one side. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that what we mean by EEs is the same as what Zucker means by folds, and that EEs do not always correspond to object boundaries.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 77Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science\nsystem can distinguish EEs from non-EEs, it should tend to perceive the EE side as closer and figural.3\nThere is an important confound in Figures 1a and 1b, however. Because image regions bounded by an EE are, by definition, projections of convex 3-D surfaces, a preference to see them as\ncloser might simply reflect a bias toward perceiving convex surfaces as closer. A bias toward seeing regions bounded by convex 2-D edges as closer and figural is well-known (Kanizsa & Gerbino, 1976; Metzger, 1936/2006), and a corresponding bias toward seeing convex 3-D surfaces as closer might be expected. Most environmental surfaces are at least locally convex, and in the absence of ecological statistics, the apparent flatness of canonical grounds (e.g., sky, ground planes, walls, and floors) lends intuitive weight to this argument.\nThe confound between depth convexity and the presence of EEs along shared contours can be eliminated, however, by studying cases in which the surfaces on the two sides of the critical edge are identical except for a 901 rotation that changes the placement of the EEs (see Fig. 2, upper left image). If the EE side is seen as closer, even when it is adjacent to an equally convex non-EE region, then mere convexity cannot explain the result.\n3For clarity, we note that this is a different claim than is made in classical shape-from-shading or shape-from-texture analyses (e.g., Horn, 1975; Malik & Rosenholtz, 1994), which specify the relative distance to different points on a single surface on the basis of the optical structure of projected images independently of general viewpoint considerations. We also note, however, that the same considerations that apply to depth at EEs also apply to depth in a single complex-curved surface in which smooth self-occlusion occurs, such as in a fold of cloth. Zucker and his colleagues (e.g., Huggins et al., 2001; Huggins & Zucker, 2001a, 2001b) have investigated the image-based determinants of EEs in this latter context, referring to them as \u2018\u2018folds\u2019\u2019 (on the EE side) and \u2018\u2018cuts\u2019\u2019 (on the non-EE side). Finally, we note that other researchers have previously employed generic viewpoint arguments to explain other aspects of visual perception, such as stereoscopic depth (e.g., Koenderink & van Doorn, 1976), pictorial depth (e.g., Nakayama & Shimojo, 1992), shape from shading (e.g., Freeman, 1996), and figure-ground assignment (e.g., Palmer, 1999).\n78 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\nThe two experiments we report here tested the influence of EEs on the perception of relative depth and figure-ground organization across a straight edge. Experiment 1 examined the perceptual effects of a simple luminance gradient (the positive half of a sinusoid) that produces the perception of a matte cylinder (see Fig. 1b). Experiment 2 examined perceptual effects using checkered texture gradients (see Fig. 1c). The results of both experiments strongly support the ecological predictions based on viewpoint constraints: EEs are a powerful factor in the perception of relative depth and figure-ground organization across a shared contour.\nEXPERIMENT 1: EXTREMAL EDGES FROM SHADING GRADIENTS\nExperiment 1 examined depth and figural perception for simple bipartite displays that consisted of a central, straight contour separating two equal-sized, square regions that were aligned vertically or horizontally. In the conditions of primary interest, one side contained an EE along the shared contour, and the other side did not. The EE side always consisted of a luminance gradient that was perpendicular to the central contour (i.e., a gradient whose equiluminance contours were parallel to the edge) and formed the positive half of a sinusoid (see Fig. 2, left regions in the top row).4 We used three different kinds of lumi-\nnance patterns as non-EE regions to control for possible confounds: homogeneous regions that controlled for differences in mean luminance, textured regions that controlled for 2-D contrast structure, and convex non-EE regions that controlled for 3- D convexity (see Fig. 2).\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Nine students at the University of California, Berkeley, volunteered to participate in exchange for partial course credit in an undergraduate psychology course.

Participants were instructed to press the appropriate key on a computer keyboard to indicate the side in each display that appeared closer. The response mappings were the natural ones: the left or right arrow key for horizontal displays and the up or down arrow key for vertical displays. Participants were given 10 practice trials followed by four blocks of experimental trials and were allowed to take a break after any trial.\nEach trial began with the presentation of a 10-cm 16-cm random-dot field containing a large fixation cross centered on a 50%-gray screen. The participant pressed a key to view the target display, which was then presented for 2 s. The target display was replaced by a random-dot field containing a large question mark, which prompted the participant to indicate which region appeared closer and figural. The question mark disappeared when the observer responded and was replaced by the random-dot field containing the large fixation cross, which indicated the start of the next trial.\nResults and Discussion We computed the percentage of trials on which participants chose the side with a given luminance pattern, for each other pattern with which it was combined. These data were averaged over the four replications and analyzed for positional effects. There was no bias toward left or right in the horizontal displays, t(8)5 1.21, p> .20, but the lower region was chosen more often than the upper region in the vertical displays (60% vs. 40%), t(8) 5 2.79, p< .05, a finding consistent with the results of Vecera et al. (2002).We averaged these data to eliminate positional effects in subsequent analyses.\nThere were no significant differences between the results for the two kinds of textured regions (random strips and random dots) or among the results for the three uniform gray regions. We therefore averaged the data within each of these two categories. The major findings are easily summarized: EEs produced a very powerful bias toward seeing the EE side as closer and figural, ts(8) 5 8.00, 5.82, and 8.01 for pairings with convex, textured, and uniform regions, respectively, ps < .001. There also appeared to be a weak effect of 3-D convexity on depth perception: Convex regions were seen as closer more often than were textured or uniform regions, but these effects barely approached significance, ts(8) 5 1.37 and 1.73, .05 < p < .10, one-tailed. Texture also appeared to influence perceived depth, but the advantage for textured regions over uniform regions was only marginally reliable, t(8) 5 2.06, p < .05, one-tailed.\nThe fact that EE regions were reliably seen as closer than the convexity-matched non-EE regions seems to indicate that EE effects are not attributable to convexity alone. One possible objection to this conclusion is that the shading gradient in the non-EE convex region appears to be occluded because of a gradient cut in which the central edge intersects the equiluminance contours of the gradient on the non-EE side. No gradient cut is present on the EE side of the central edge because the edge is parallel to the equiluminance contours of the EE gradient. The gradient cut on the non-EE side may therefore provide a depth cue indicating that the opposite (EE) side is closer and figural for reasons unrelated to the presence of an EE along the shared border.\nIn rebuttal, one could argue that the edges of the uniform and textured regions also produced gradient cuts when these regions were paired with convex regions. Thus, by the logic of the objection just mentioned, the uniform and textured regions should have been perceived as reliably closer than the convex regions. They were not. However, this rebuttal is open to the objection that the observed bias toward perceiving uniform and textured regions as farther could have been due to the effect of a gradient cut being countered by a bias toward seeing the convex side as closer because its convexity makes it appear to bulge toward the observer. To address the issue of whether gradient cuts in the non-EE regions could account for the pattern of results, we performed a stepwise regression analysis that predicted the data shown in Figure 3 from the difference between the left and right sides in a given display in terms of presence (vs. absence) of EEs, depth convexity, gradient cuts, and 2-D texture on the two sides. The order in which the variables were entered, additional percentage of variance accounted for, and corresponding F ratios were as follows\u2014EE: 81%, F(1, 10) 5 41.62, p < .001; depth convexity: 11%, F(1, 9) 5 11.82, p < .01; and texture: 5%,F(1, 8)5 11.24, p< .01; no significant further variance was attributable to gradient cuts. This analysis yielded amultiple r of .98, accounting for 97% of the variance. Unfortunately, this result is not definitive because the presence versus absence of an EE along the shared edge is fully predictable from the\n80 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\ncombination of depth convexity and gradient cuts in this set of displays. We therefore revisited the issue of gradient cuts in Experiment 2, in which additional constraints were present.\nAnother argument against concluding that the EE along the central contour caused the large bias toward seeing the EE side as closer is that the EE side always contained a second EE along its far border. It is logically possible, although highly unlikely, that this second EE was somehow crucial in producing the bias toward seeing the EE side as closer in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 also addressed this issue.\nEXPERIMENT 2: EXTREMAL EDGES FROM TEXTURE GRADIENTS\nThe ecological analysis of depth from EEs provided in Figure 1 concerns the relative distance of two surfaces that project to a shared depth edge, one side of which arises from a self-occluding convex surface and the other side of which does not. Because the general-viewpoint argument concerns only scene geometry and not the optical information that specifies the presence of EEs, the bias toward perceiving EE surfaces as closer should hold regardless of what visual property specifies the EEs. Therefore, in Experiment 2, we explored depth and figural perception when EEs were rendered by texture gradients. Our primary motivation was to determine whether texture also produces a strong bias toward perceiving EE regions as closer.\nUsing POVRAY software (freeware available at www.povray. org), we constructed ray-traced images of surfaces defined by checkered textures. The five surface types are illustrated in Figure 4 along with a single example of a display formed when\ntwo such regions are joined along the shared edge. To ensure that size cues did not favor the EE region, wemade the square checks on the flat regions the same size as the largest checks on the EE and convex regions, and thus substantially larger than the smaller checks along the EEs. Tominimize any occlusion cues to depth, we aligned the texture elements along the central contour so that the edges of the individual texture elements of the nonEE region fell along the straight line of the contour and there was no partial occlusion of texture elements. We included quartercylinder regions that contained a single EE (i.e., along the shared contour) so that we could examine possible effects of the second EE in the half-cylinder conditions of Experiment 1. The experimental question was whether, as predicted by the ecological analysis, the EE regions in both the quarter-cylinder and the half-cylinder textured displays used in Experiment 2 would be reliably seen as figural and closer than the corresponding non-EE convex regions, as well as the flat regions.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Eight students at the University of California, Berkeley, participated in exchange for partial course credit in an undergraduate psychology course.

In these bipartite displays, redblack and green-black regions were paired, as were white-black and white-gray regions.

The bias toward seeing the EE regions as closer than the flat regions was overwhelming, with the half-cylinder and quarter-\ncylinder EE regions (EE2 and EE1, respectively) being seen as closer on 96% and 90% of the trials, respectively, ts(7)5 16.15 and 5.56, ps < .001. The bias toward perceiving the half-cylinder EE regions (EE2) as closer than the non-EE convex regions was equally powerful, with the former regions being seen as closer on 95% of trials when the non-EE region was a halfcylinder (Convex2) and 96% of trials when the non-EE region was a quarter-cylinder (Convex1), ts(8)5 15.94 and 14.55, ps< .001, respectively. The quarter-cylinder EE regions (EE1) were also seen as closer than the rotated convex versions on 85% of the trials with half-cylinder non-EE regions (Convex2) and 90% of the trials with quarter-cylinder non-EE regions (Convex1), ts(7) 5 4.45 and 6.13, ps < .001, respectively. There was a reliable bias toward seeing the half-cylinder EE regions (EE2) as closer than the quarter-cylinder EE regions (EE1), t(7) 5 8.52, p < .001. Because both sides contained an EE along the shared contour in this condition, this bias may reflect either the presence of the second EE in the half-cylinder EE regions or the fact that the surface curvature was greater in the half-cylinder than in the quarter-cylinder EE region. Further research is needed to determine the cause of this bias.\nAs in Experiment 1, there was a small bias toward seeing the half-cylinder non-EE regions (Convex2) as closer than the flat regions (57%), but the effect was not statistically reliable, t(7)5 0.69, p > .50. The quarter-cylinder non-EE regions (Convex1) produced a trend that was, if anything, in the opposite direction (42%), but also was not significant, t(7) 5 0.83, p > .40. Thus, we found no clear evidence that curvature, by itself, is a cue to depth and figural status in textured displays. We note, however, that texture size actually opposed curvature in this experiment because the size gradient along the shared edgemade the texture elements on the EE side a good deal smaller than those on the flat side.\nWe performed a stepwise multiple regression analysis to predict the data shown in Figure 5 from presence versus absence of (a) an EE on the closer, shared edge (EE-close); (b) an EE on the far edge (EE-far); (c) an EE orthogonal to the edge (EE-ortho); (d) depth convexity; and (e) a gradient cut. EE-close was entered first and accounted for 92% of the variance, F(1, 23)5 263.40, p< .001. EE-far was entered next and accounted for 4% of additional variance, F(1, 22) 5 22.98, p < .001. With just these two variables, the model had a multiple r of .98 and accounted for 96% of the variance. The other variables did not reach the criterion for entry into the regression equation (p < .05), and when we forced the gradient-cut variable into the equation with EE-close and EE-far, the multiple regression program removed it. Thus, gradient cuts do not appear to be an important factor in the results of this experiment; all of the predictable variance was associated with the presence versus absence of an EE along the shared contour (EE-close) or on the far side (EE-far). These results leave little doubt that the primary bias toward perceiving the EE side as closer and figural was, in fact, due to the presence of EEs along the central shared contour.\n82 Volume 19\u2014Number 1"}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Aviewpoint-based ecological analysis of the depth implications of EEs implies that when there is an EE on one side of the shared contour, the EE region is more likely than the non-EE region to be closer to the observer.

Accordingly,we predicted that in spatial attention paradigms, such individuals would systematically favor the vertical dimension of space more than individuals low in dominance. This prediction was supported by two studies (total N 5 96), which provided three tests involving two different spatial attention paradigms. In all cases, analyses controlling for speed of response to horizontal spatial probes revealed that more dominant individuals were faster than less dominant individuals to respond to probes along the vertical dimension of space. Such data support the metaphor-representation perspective, according to which people think in metaphoric terms, even in on-line processing tasks. These results have implications for understanding dominance and also indicate that conceptual metaphor is relevant to understanding the cognitive-processing basis of personality.\nThere is a striking tendency to represent dominance in vertical terms. This tendency is apparent in linguistic metaphor (Tolaas, 1991), anthropological data (Fiske, 1992), sociological data (Schwartz, 1981), and scientific theories of personality dominance (e.g., Wiggins, 1996). The ubiquity of such mappings is consistent with the central postulate of the metaphor-representation perspective, according to which people must draw from the perceptual domain, as reflected in common metaphors,\nwhen attempting to represent abstract concepts such as dominance or power (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999).\nThe frequent pairing of dominance and verticality could be a feature of the English language that is independent of deeper concept-to-percept mappings (see Gibbs, 1994, for a review of this position). Alternatively, this frequent pairing could be more fundamental (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999). According to the latter view, people think in perceptual terms, particularly when they are thinking about relatively abstract concepts, such as dominance or status (Tolaas, 1991). A recent set of studies by Schubert (2005) supports the fundamental, nonlinguistic view of the pairing of dominance and verticality. Specifically, he showed that incidental manipulations of verticality biased the speed with which participants could classify dominant stimuli (i.e., dominant stimuli were categorized faster when presented higher in visual space).\nOther than Schubert\u2019s (2005) study, however, few studies have examined the extent to which dominance and verticality are systematically linked in on-line processing. One of the purposes of the studies reported here was to conduct such an examination. In addition, we wanted to investigate whether the link between dominance and verticality extends to the domain of individual differences in dominance. Testing this possibility is useful for two reasons. First, researchers have often expressed uncertainty as to whether the metaphor-representation perspective can provide insight concerning individual differences within a culture (Ko\u0308vecses, 2000). If it cannot, this would constitute a significant limitation of this framework (Lakoff, 1986). Second, support for the metaphor-representation perspective has routinely come from studies in which the conceptual features of stimuli\u2014 whether affect-related features (e.g., Meier, Robinson, Crawford, &Ahlvers, 2007) or dominance-related features (Schubert, 2005)\u2014have been manipulated.

By examining individuals who differ in their interpersonal dominance, one can examine links between dominance and verticality without manipulating stimulus dominance, and perhaps find additional support for the \u2018\u2018unconditional\u2019\u2019 (Bargh, 1997) nature of such associations."}, {"heading": "DOMINANCE AND VERTICALITY", "text": "An important theory of social interaction (Haslam, 1997) posits fourmodels of human relations: authority ranking, equalitymatching, market pricing, and communal sharing. What is unique about authority ranking, relative to the other three relational models, is its focus on vertical asymmetries in power. There are also theories in communication (Burgoon, Johnson, & Koch, 1998), anthropology (Fiske, 1992), and sociology (Schwartz, 1981) that refer to, and depict, interpersonal dominance in explicitly vertical terms. What is common to all of these theories, then, is the fact that they conceptualize dominance and power in terms of a vertical dimension of physical space.\nIf a vertical mode of conception is chronically accessible to dominant individuals, then they should be prone to perception along this vertical dimension as well. The present studies are novel in examining this intriguing potential relationship. Because relatively dominant individuals have a tendency to conceptualize social relations in terms of verticality (Fiske, 1992; Schwartz, 1981), they should exhibit a perceptual favoritism for objects varying vertically in relation to a fixation point. By contrast, because less dominant individuals are prone to conceptualizing social relations in terms other than verticality (Fiske, 1992; Schwartz, 1981), they should exhibit less perceptual favoritism for objects with a vertical relation to the fixation point. In sum, if we are correct that more dominant individuals more frequently invoke vertical metaphors to think about themselves, other people, and their interactions with the world, then it should also be the case that such individuals are biased toward perceptual verticality, even in basic spatial attention tasks in which dominance is not systematically primed."}, {"heading": "THE PRESENT RESEARCH", "text": "We predicted that dominant individuals would exhibit biased attention along the vertical dimension of physical space. To test this theory-driven prediction, we administered two spatial attention tasks. In the first, participants were unable to predict the location of upcoming spatial probes. We presented these probes in randomly selected locations\u2014left, right, up, or down. Thus, an association between dominance and facilitation of perception along the vertical dimension on this task would be due to relatively automatic perceptual processes. The inclusion of the horizontal trials was not theoretically motivated, but rather allowed\nus to systematically control for individual differences in speed, which are quite pronounced on nearly any choice reaction time task (Jensen, 1998; Robinson & Oishi, 2006).\nIn our second study, we also administered a spatial attention task in which the location of the spatial probes was perfectly predictable because they alternated between an upper position and a lower position (in vertical blocks) or between a position on the left and a position on the right (in horizontal blocks). Because the probes\u2019 locations were perfectly predictable, any significant performance differences between individuals could not be due to variations in probe-location expectancies. Thus, if individuals high in dominance were more skilled than individuals low in dominance at recognizing probes along the vertical dimension in the second task, we could conclude that this pattern was independent of possible individual differences in expectancies.\nSTUDY 1\nStudy 1 was an initial test of our hypothesis that more dominant individuals would be faster to respond to spatial targets along the vertical dimension of space. We ensured that attention was centered, both vertically and horizontally, at the start of each trial by presenting a centering prime that the participant was required to categorize. Immediately after this categorization response, a spatial probe appeared in one of four randomly determined positions on the screen\u2014up, down, left, or right.

Correct responses were followed by a 200-ms blank interval, whereas incorrect responses were followed by the message \u2018\u2018Incorrect!\u2019\u2019 which was presented for 1,500 ms in order to encourage a high degree of accuracy. To center fixation prior to the appearance of the spatial probes, and thereby ensure that every trial involved the same centered attentional focus, we included an initial task in which participants had to categorize a centrally presented stimulus as either a letter (A, B, or C) or a number (1, 2, or 3).

First, we wanted to directly replicate Study 1, using the same paradigm. Second, we sought to conceptually replicate the observed relation between dominance and attention to the vertical dimension in a spatial attention task using spatial probes that were perfectly predictable. Such a replication would indicate that the link between higher levels of personality dominance and facility with the vertical dimension of visual space is independent of expectancies for the location of randomly presented spatial stimuli.

The low-dominance items were reverse-scored. The scale proved to be highly reliable (a5 .72; M 5 3.36, SD 5 0.29). A pilot test indicated that the dominance measures used in Studies 1 and 2 are positively correlated to a high degree, though not so highly as to suggest isomorphism of the measures, r5 .66, p< .01. Thus, conceptual replication with the new dominance measure seemed useful.\nAs in Study 1, personality dominance was assessed last, after participants performed the spatial attention tasks. We deemed it best to administer the random-location task from Study 1 before the new predictable-location task in order to preclude priming of location expectancies."}, {"heading": "Spatial Attention Tasks", "text": "The first spatial attention task was identical to the one used in Study 1. In the second task, the location of the spatial probe varied predictably. As in the first task, participants were instructed to be both quick and accurate, the spatial probes were the letters q and p, the probes appeared half an inch inside the relevant border of the prominently displayed box (either left, right, up, or down), and there were 200 trials (100 with vertical probes and 100 with horizontal probes). The method for scoring\nspeed of response to spatial probes was similar to that used in Study 1 (mean accuracy 5 .95 and .96 in the random- and predictable-location tasks, respectively).\nThe second task differed from the first, however, in that probe locations were blocked, such that all probes within a block were located along the same dimension, either vertical or horizontal. Each of the 10 blocks contained 20 trials, and block order was randomly determined for each participant. Furthermore, the probe locations alternated between up and down in vertical blocks and between left and right in horizontal blocks. And as in Study 1, the vertical probes were horizontally centered on the screen, and the horizontal probes were vertically centered on the screen. Thus, the location of probes in the second task was perfectly predictable, which equated location expectancies across participants. Because the location of the probes was entirely predictable, we viewed the second task as assessing individual differences in the ability to attend to and shift attention along the vertical dimension (relative to the horizontal dimension)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In neither task was there a correlation between dominance and performance on trials with horizontal probes, r5 .08, p5 .60, for the random-location task and r5 .07, p5 .64, for the predictablelocation task.

Accordingly, for each task, we performed a simple regression in which performance on trials with horizontal probes (Ms5 861ms and623ms for the random- and predictablelocation tasks, respectively) was entered as a predictor of performance on trials with vertical probes (Ms5 893 ms and 637ms for the random- and predictable-location tasks, respectively). The results of the simple regressions were used to create two residual vertical-attention scores, one for each task, that were uncorrelated with speed in responding to horizontal spatial probes.\nWe then correlated interpersonal dominance with the residual verticality scores for each task considered separately. Both correlations were significant, r5 .28, p< .05, for the randomlocation task and r5 .31, p< .05, for the predictable-location task. As in Study 1, the direction of these correlations indicates that higher levels of dominance were associated with lower residual scores (i.e., faster performance). Figure 2 presents scatter plots showing the relations between personality dominance and residual vertical-attention scores on the two tasks. As the figure shows, individuals 2 standard deviations below the mean for dominance were slower than one would expect given their performance on trials with horizontal probes (by approximately 30 ms in the random-location task and by approximately 15ms in the predictable-location task). By contrast, individuals 2 standard deviations above themean for dominance were faster than one would expect given their speed in responding to horizontal probes.

Study 2 also extended the results of Study 1 by showing that dominance predicts speed of responding to vertical spatial probes even when the location of the probes is perfectly predictable. The latter result suggests that individuals high in dominance not only favor vertical locations more than other individuals, but also are more capable of shifting attention vertically when expectancies for probe location are held constant across individuals. Finally, Study2 replicated the relation between personality dominance and attention to the vertical dimension of space using a second measure of personality dominance, one that follows from a longer research tradition than our first measure and is related to circumplex models of individual differences in interpersonal functioning (Wiggins, 1979)."}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "Both embodied theories of social cognition (for a review, see Niedenthal, Barsalou, Winkielman, Krauth-Gruber, & Ric, 2005) and the metaphor-representation perspective (Gibbs, 1994; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999) have generally focused on normative effects, rather than those related to personality variables. However, we have suggested that the latter perspective can offer important process-oriented insights into personality functioning (Meier & Robinson, 2005). The present results provide novel evidence along these lines.\nSimply stated, more dominant individuals think in dominance-related terms to a greater extent than do less dominant individuals (e.g., Moskowitz & Zuroff, 2005; Wiggins, 1996). That is, their thoughts more often involve power, powerlessness, and relative dominance (Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003). Because there is an intimate link between dominance-related representational processes and vertical perceptual metaphor (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999; Schwartz, 1981; Tolaas, 1991), we predicted a general bias in which high dominance would be associated with facilitated processing along the vertical dimension of space relative to the horizontal dimension of space. This prediction was systematically confirmed in two studies, using two spatial attention tasks and two measures of personality dominance."}, {"heading": "Implications and Future Research", "text": "Our results are important in a number of ways. First, it appears that personality-related dominance, in addition to stimulusrelated dominance (e.g., Schubert, 2005), can be usefully understood in terms of vertical metaphoric processes. The importance of this process-oriented framework is highlighted by the fact that the literature on personality-related dominance has primarily focused on measuring this trait, rather than understanding how it functions in interactions with the world (for a review, seeWiggins, 1996). Thus, it has been stated that researchers\u2019 social-cognitive understanding of the correlates of personality dominance is perhaps underspecified and that more research of the type we have reported here is important to understanding the cognitive processes associated with individual differences in trait dominance (Moskowitz, 2004; Moskowitz & Zuroff, 2005).\nSecond, our results are important because they are among the first to link personality differences to metaphor-consistent representational biases. Such findings suggest that embodiment frameworks in general, and metaphor-representation frameworks in particular, can be profitably extended to understanding the processing basis of personality traits, hitherto a largely underresearched area in the literature on embodied cognition (Lakoff, 1986; Meier & Robinson, 2005).\nThird, our findings are important because they suggest that metaphoric biases need not involve stimulus factors suggestive of metaphor, such as stimulus affect (Meier & Robinson, 2004) or stimulus dominance (Schubert, 2005). Rather, our results\nVolume 19\u2014Number 4 359\nsuggest that more general metaphoric biases may be observed, even in tasks in which the stimuli convey no social meaning. In connection with this point, we emphasize the benefits of an individual differences approach, which can uncover metaphoric biases in the absence of manipulations of conceptual information. Findings such as these will be useful to social-personality perspectives emphasizing the unconditional nature of automatic processing (Bargh, 1997).\nExtending this general personality-related perspective to additional metaphoric biases will also be quite useful. For example, negative evaluations bias perceptions of font color in a \u2018\u2018darker\u2019\u2019 direction (Meier et al., 2007). From these findings, it seems likely to us that a personal tendency toward negative affect, too, might bias perceptual processes in a dark direction, but such results have not been reported to date. The individual differences approach constitutes uncharted territory in theories of metaphor and comprehension (Lakoff, 1986), and we believe that this approach might also reveal important new insights concerning the processing basis of personality (Meier & Robinson, 2005).\nA considerable body of research links high levels of trait anxiety to spatial attention biases favoring threatening stimuli (for a review, see MacLeod, 1999). These findings have been interpreted to suggest that anxious individuals, at some level, want to attend to threatening stimuli because they are viewed as goal relevant (Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001; Matthews & Wells, 2000). Our data support this top-down perspective on spatial attention (Pashler, 1998) and suggest the need for greater consideration of personality-linked effects on top-down spatial attention processes."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Ametaphor-related theory led us to predict that individuals high in dominance would favor vertical locations in visual space. Two studies involving three replications support this prediction. Our findings significantly extend the metaphor-representation framework to personality variables and to cognitive tasks that seem, on the surface, to possess few implications for representational meaning. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the metaphorrepresentation perspective may offer important insights concerning personality traits, even in the case of very mundane cognitive tasks."}]}, {"paper_id": 158, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02042.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 1.0, "Fold_Id": 8.0, "filename": "goschke2008.pdf", "title": "Conflict-triggered goal shielding: Response conflicts attenuate background monitoring for prospective memory cues.", "content": [{"text": "quires that one shield current goals from distracting information (goal shielding) and at the same timemonitor the environment for potentially significant stimuli that may afford a goal switch (background monitoring). Response conflicts modulate the balance between goal shielding and background monitoring, as indicated by reduced susceptibility to interference after response conflicts. Such conflict-adaptation effects have been attributed to enhanced recruitment of cognitive control on trials following conflicts. Here we show that conflict triggers increased goal shielding on the conflict trial itself. Subjects performed a spatial compatibility task during which they had to notice rare prospective memory cues. Such cues were overlooked more often on conflict trials than on nonconflict trials, a result indicating that shielding of the current goal and inhibition of distractors were increased on the current trial when it involved a response conflict. Thus, evidence for enhanced recruitment of control following conflict may partly reflect aftereffects of goal shielding on the conflict trial itself.\nGoal-directed behavior in a changing environment requires a context-sensitive balance between two antagonistic challenges: On the one hand, goals must be shielded from interference, and distracting information should be inhibited (goal shielding); on the other hand, the environment must be monitored for potentially significant information that may afford a goal switch, as when, for instance, one notices the smell of fire while preparing a talk (background monitoring). Goal shielding and background monitoring incur complementary benefits and costs: Whereas goal shielding prevents interference, it increases the risk of\noverlooking significant information. Conversely, whereas background monitoring facilitates noticing task-irrelevant but potentially significant stimuli, it increases susceptibility to interference (Dreisbach, 2006; Dreisbach & Goschke, 2004). This shielding-monitoring dilemma raises the central question of how organisms regulate the trade-off between these antagonistic constraints in a context-sensitive manner (Goschke, 1996, 2000, 2003; cf. Altmann & Trafton, 2002; Aston-John & Cohen, 2005; Mayr & Keele, 2000).\nAccording to an influential hypothesis, response conflicts play a central role in context-sensitive adjustments of cognitive control processes. In particular, conflicts are assumed to trigger enhanced mobilization of cognitive control to prevent interference on subsequent trials in a task (Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001; Botvinick, Cohen, & Carter, 2004; see also Ach, 1935; Kuhl, 1985). Studies consistent with this hypothesis have shown that interference from distractors in speeded choice reaction tasks is reduced on trials following response-incompatible (high-conflict) trials, compared with trials following response-compatible (low-conflict) trials (Botvinick, Nystrom, Fissell, Carter, & Cohen, 1999; Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1992). Such conflict-adaptation effects suggest that response conflicts induce enhanced target processing, distractor suppression, or both on the following trial (but see Mayr, Awh, & Laurey, 2003). According to the conflict-monitoring theory proposed by Botvinick et al. (2001), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the medial frontal lobe monitors response conflicts and signals the demand for increased control to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is thought to support active maintenance of goal representations and top-down modulation of lower-level processing modules (Miller & Cohen, 2001; Ridderinkhof, Ullsperger, Crone, & Nieuwenhuis, 2004). In a study consistent with this theory, conflict-related brain activity in the ACC during a Stroop color-naming task predicted greater activity in lateral PFC, as well as behavioral adjustments on the next trial (Kerns et al., 2004).

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that response conflict triggers increased activation of the currently active goal and enhanced inhibition of concurrent distractors on the very trial on which the conflict arises. This conflict-triggered goal-shielding hypothesis predicts that conflicts in an ongoing task increase the risk of overlooking significant stimuli that are not relevant for the ongoing task, but afford a switch to an alternative goal.\nTo test this prediction, we examined how response conflicts in an ongoing task affect the detection of concurrent prospective memory (PM) cues. PM denotes memory for future intentions that must be executed at some later time or in response to a specific cue (e.g., buying bread when one passes the bakery on one\u2019s way home; for reviews, see Ellis, 1996; Marsh, Cook, & Hicks, 2006; McDaniel & Einstein, 2000). In a typical PM experiment, subjects perform an ongoing task during which they have to notice rarely occurring PM cues requiring a response different from that required by the ongoing task. In our experiment, the ongoing task was a spatial compatibility task, in which subjects had to respond either to the direction or to the location of an arrow that pointed in one of four directions and appeared at one of four locations. In addition, subjects were instructed to press the space bar whenever they noticed the PM cue. In different blocks, the PM cue was defined either as any arrow appearing at a particular location (i.e., below the fixation point), regardless of the direction of the arrow, or as any arrow pointing in a particular direction (i.e., downward), regardless of its location. Critically, the PM cues were either spatially incompatible stimuli (e.g., a downward-pointing arrow at an upper location), which induced a response conflict with respect to the response rules of the ongoing task, or spatially compatible stimuli, which induced no response conflict.\nWe predicted that PM cues would be overlooked (i.e., not acted upon) more often on high- than on low-conflict trials because on high-conflict trials the current goal (i.e., to perform the ongoing task) is automatically shielded from distracting information. We assumed that this effect would not merely reflect generally increased task difficulty on incompatible trials, but would be due to conflict-triggered inhibition of distracting stimulus dimensions. We therefore predicted that the detrimental effect of conflicts on the detection of PM cues would be significantly larger for PMcues defined by the task-irrelevant stimulus dimension than for PM cues defined by the task-relevant dimension of the ongoing task.\nMETHOD"}, {"heading": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects were 40 undergraduates from Dresden University of Technology, Germany. They received course credit or were paidh5."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Subjects were informed that we were investigating retrieval of intentions during an ongoing task. Each trial of the ongoing task started with a fixation cross (400 ms), followed by a blank screen (400 ms). Next, an arrow pointing leftward, rightward, upward, or downward appeared at one of four locations (to the left, to the right, above, or below a central fixation point; see Fig. 1). The combination of locations and arrows yielded 16 stimuli (4 spatially compatible and 12 incompatible, as explained later in this section). Half of the subjects were instructed to indicate the direction of the arrows by pressing one of four response keys with their index finger; the location of the arrows was irrelevant to the responses of these subjects. The remaining 20 subjects indicated the location of the arrows by pressing one of the four response keys; for these subjects, the direction of the arrows was irrelevant to their responses (response keys were arranged to be spatially compatible to the arrows\u2019 locations and directions). We term these tasks the arrow task and the location task, respectively.\nIn addition, subjects were instructed that on some trials, a PM cue would appear, and that this cue required a different response (pressing the space bar). There were two different types of PM cues. In half of the blocks, the PM cue was any arrow appearing at a particular location (i.e., below the fixation point), regardless of the direction in which the arrow pointed. In the remaining blocks, the PM cue was any arrow pointing in a particular direction (downward), regardless of its location. We term these location PM cues and arrowPM cues, respectively. Each subject in each of the two ongoing-task groups (i.e., those performing the arrow task and those performing the location task) received a total of six blocks, three with arrow PM cues and three with location PM cues (order of blocks was counterbalanced across subjects). Thus, in half of the blocks, the PM cue was defined by the response-relevant stimulus dimension of the ongoing task (i.e., subjects had to notice location PM cues while performing the location task or they had to notice arrow PM cues during the arrow task), and in the other half of the blocks, the PM cue was defined by the response-irrelevant dimension of the ongoing task (i.e., subjects had to notice arrow PM cues during the location task or location PM cues during the arrow task). We term this variable PM-cue dimension. Note that when PM cues were defined by the task-relevant stimulus dimension, the ongoing task involved three response alternatives, whereas when the PM cues were defined by the task-irrelevant dimension, the ongoing task involved four response alternatives.\nEach block contained a total of 204 trials. Of these, 192 were regular trials, on which the arrow\u2019s direction and location were selected at random, with the constraint that the stimulus was not a PM cue. Twenty-five percent of the regular trials were spatially compatible trials (e.g., a left-pointing arrow appearing at the left location), and 75% were spatially incompatible trials (e.g., a left-pointing arrow appearing at the right location).\n26 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\nEach block also contained 6 PM trials, trials on which a PM cue appeared. PM trials were inserted at random positions with the constraint that these trials were separated by a minimum of 11 and a maximum of 66 intervening regular trials. Critically, 3 of the PM cues were instantiated by compatible stimuli (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow appearing below the fixation point), whereas the other 3 PM cues were instantiated by incompatible stimuli eliciting a response conflict (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow appearing at some location other than below the fixation point or an arrow appearing below the fixation point, but pointing in some direction other than downward).\nIn addition, 6 trials with deviant stimuli (e.g., a cross instead of an arrow) appeared in each block. These trials were originally included to explore effects of rare deviants on reaction time (RT), but they are not related to the topic of this article and are not discussed further.\nNote that the stimulus on approximately 25% of the incompatible regular trials was semantically related to the PM cue (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow at the top, right, or left location was semantically related to the PM cue when the PM cue was an\narrow in the bottom location, and a leftward-, rightward-, or upward-pointing arrow at the bottom location was semantically related to the PM cue when the PM cue was a downward-pointing arrow). We term these trials PM-related trials. Although this was not our main focus, we investigated whether PM-related trials, because of their semantic relatedness to the actual PM cues, automatically captured attention and therefore incurred a performance cost in the ongoing task.\nTo summarize, our task included compatible and incompatible regular trials (including incompatible PM-related trials) and compatible and incompatible PM trials (see Fig. 1)."}, {"heading": "Design", "text": "The independent variables were (a) ongoing task (arrow direction vs. arrow location), (b) compatibility (compatible vs. incompatible), (c) trial type (regular vs. PM), and (d) PM cue dimension (response-relevant vs. response-irrelevant stimulus dimension for the ongoing task).

In particular, as the ongoing task comprised four responses when PM cues were defined by the task-irrelevant dimension but only three response alternatives when PM cues were defined by the task-relevant dimension, the ongoing task was presumably slightly more demanding in the former case, which might generally impair the detection of PM cues defined by the task-irrelevant dimension.

Results were consistent with our goal-shielding hypothesis. Response conflicts induced by spatially incompatible stimuli in an ongoing task impaired detection of concurrent PM cues: PM cues were overlooked significantly more often when they appeared on incompatible rather than on compatible trials, and this effect was much larger when the PM cues were defined by the task-irrelevant (and thus potentially distracting) rather than the task-relevant stimulus dimension of the ongoing task.\nThe interaction between compatibility and PM cue dimension rules out an alternative interpretation according to which PM cues were missed more often on incompatible trials not because of increased goal shielding, but rather because their memory representation received less informational input. According to this interpretation, the representation of the PM cue on compatible trials (e.g., the PM cue of a downward-pointing arrow appearing at the bottom location) received input activation from both the location and the direction of the arrow. By contrast, the representation of the PM cue on incompatible trials (e.g., the PM cue of the downward-pointing arrow appearing at the top, left, or right location) was activated only by the direction of the arrow, and not by its location. However, according to this coactivation hypothesis, PM cue representations should have received less activation on incompatible than on compatible trials irrespec-\ntive of whether the PM cue referred to the task-relevant or the task-irrelevant dimension. Contrary to this prediction, but fully consistent with our goal-shielding hypothesis, the detrimental effect of incompatibility on PM detection was reliably larger for PM cues referring to the task-irrelevant dimension.\nThis finding also rules out a second alternative interpretation according to which incompatible trials were simply more difficult than compatible trials, so that processing resources remaining for the PM task were reduced. Although there is in fact evidence that increased processing demands in an ongoing task impair PM performance (Marsh, Hancock, & Hicks, 2002), a general increase in task difficulty should have impaired PM performance irrespective of whether the PM cues referred to the task-relevant or task-irrelevant dimension. Thus, this interpretation cannot explain why incompatibility had a much stronger effect on the detection of PM cues referring to the task-irrelevant dimension (unless one assumes that increased difficulty triggered increased activation of the current goal or inhibition of task-irrelevant information, which amounts to a reformulation of the goal-shielding hypothesis).\nIn conclusion, our findings provide strong support for conflicttriggered goal shielding and indicate that conflicts triggered increased shielding of the currently active goal and attenuated background monitoring for task-irrelevant, but potentially significant, stimuli. There are two possible mechanisms that may have underlain the effect of goal shielding on PM performance. On the one hand, goal shielding may have directly attenuated active monitoring for PM cues. This possibility fits with theories assuming that detecting PM cues requires controlled monitoring that taxes attentional resources (Burgess & Shallice, 1997; Guynn, 2003; Smith, 2003). Alternatively, inhibition of the PM task set and thememory representation of the PM cue could have reduced the likelihood that PM cues would automatically trigger retrieval of the associated intention. This account fits with theories assuming that PM cues trigger retrieval of the associated intention by way of reflexive-associative memory processes (Guynn, McDaniel, & Einstein, 2001; McDaniel & Einstein, 2000;McDaniel, Guynn, Einstein, &Breneiser, 2004). Note that these explanations are not mutually exclusive, and there is evidence that both activemonitoring and automatic retrieval play a role in PM (Einstein et al., 2005).\nEffects of the PMTask onPerformance in theOngoing Task Although this was not our main focus, our design allowed us to examine effects of the PM task on the ongoing task. As predicted, RT increased on PM-related trials, indicating that stimuli that were semantically related to the PM cue captured attention and occasionally triggered retrieval of the intention associated with the PM cue, which presumably resulted in a time-consuming rechecking of whether or not the stimulus was actually the PM cue. This finding fits with previous evidence that semantic representations of uncompleted intentions persist in a\n30 Volume 19\u2014Number 1\nstate of heightened activation and automatically draw attention to intention-related cues (Goschke & Kuhl, 1993, 1996; Marsh, Hicks, & Bink, 1998).\nWe also found generally increased RT in the ongoing task when the PM cue to be noticed referred to the task-irrelevant, rather than the task-relevant, stimulus dimension. This finding suggests that monitoring for PM cues incurred a cost in the ongoing task. Although this interpretation fits with studies showing that a PM task may slow responses in an ongoing task when attention must be divided between the two tasks (Marsh et al., 2002; Marsh, Hicks, & Cook, 2005; Smith, 2003), the RT increase could also reflect the fact that the ongoing task involved four responses when PM cues referred to the task-irrelevant dimension, compared with three responses when PM cues referred to the task-relevant dimension."}, {"heading": "Implications for Theories of Conflict Monitoring and Cognitive Control", "text": "In important ways, our findings extend current theories of conflict monitoring and cognitive control. Whereas to date virtually all studies have focused on effects of response conflicts on the mobilization of cognitive control on the next trial of a task (e.g., Botvinick et al., 1999; Gratton et al., 1992; Kerns et al., 2004), our results show that conflicts also induce increased goal shielding and distractor inhibition on the current trial. A distinct advantage of our paradigm is that it circumvents some of the ambiguities of studies in which conflict-adaptation effects were inferred from sequential compatibility effects, which are open to alternative interpretations in terms of episodic priming (Mayr et al., 2003). Although the exact mechanisms underlying conflict-triggered goal shielding remain to be elucidated, our findings are consistent with models assuming that goal shielding and distractor inhibition are by-products of conflict monitoring during response selection (cf. Botvinick et al., 2001; Schuch & Koch, 2003). For instance, the connectionist model of Botvinick et al. (2001) contains a conflict-monitoring unit that computes a measure (termed \u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019) indicating the degree to which incompatible responses are activated simultaneously. As this measure is continuously updated during response selection, it may well serve to adjust on-line the activation of the current goal representation in working memory. As a consequence, task-specific processing pathways would receive stronger top-down bias signals from the current goal representation, whereas task-irrelevant representations might be suppressed as a by-product of local competition and lateral inhibition, so that background monitoring would be attenuated (cf. Miller & Cohen, 2001).\nTo conclude, our results provide strong evidence that response conflicts play an important role in the context-sensitive modulation of the balance between goal shielding and background monitoring. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a response conflict not only induces\nenhanced recruitment of cognitive control on the following trial, but may also trigger enhanced shielding of the active goal on the current trial. An important implication of this finding is that some of the findings that have previously been interpreted as evidence for enhanced recruitment of control on trials following a conflict may instead reflect aftereffects of increased goal shielding on the current conflict trial.\nAcknowledgments\u2014This research was supported by the Ger-\nman Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft;\nGrant Go 720/3-3).

In visual detection tasks, adults detect their presence more rapidly than the presence of other kinds of visual stimuli. We report evidence that very young children share this attentional bias. In three experiments, preschool children and adults were asked to find a single target picture among an array of eight distractors. Both the children and the adults detected snakes more rapidly than three types of nonthreatening stimuli (flowers, frogs, and caterpillars). These results provide the first evidence of enhanced visual detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli in young children.\nMany people\u2014perhaps most\u2014have had the experience of suddenly feeling frightened by the presence of a snake basking in the sun on the path ahead or nearly hidden in the grass alongside. Such fearful reactions occur relatively frequently, as most people have a negative orientation to snakes, and snakes constitute one of the most common objects of intense fears and phobias (Fredrikson, Annas, Rischer, & Wik, 1996; King, 1997). Fearful reactions to snakes have also been observed in a variety of nonhuman primates (e.g., Cook & Mineka, 1989; Yerkes, 1943).\nThe prevalence of snake fear has led some theorists (e.g., O\u0308hman &Mineka, 2001; Seligman, 1970) to consider it to be an example of prepared learning, the idea being that humans have an evolved predisposition to associate snakes with fear. According to this view, poisonous snakes (and spiders) constituted a recurrent threat to survival throughout most of mammalian evolution, so animals that quickly learned to avoid them were more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes. Consequently, a tendency to readily learn to fear snakes evolved in humans and other mammals.\nEmpirical support for prepared learning of snake fear in humans has come from research with adults showing superior conditioning of fear-relevant responses (e.g., heart rate acceleration) to snake stimuli (see O\u0308hman & Mineka, 2001, for a review). Evidence for prepared learning in nonhuman primates has come from research by Mineka and her colleagues (Cook & Mineka, 1989; O\u0308hman & Mineka, 2001) showing that monkeys very rapidly learn to fear snakes simply from seeing another monkey react fearfully to the presence of a snake.\nIn a related vein, O\u0308hman (1993; O\u0308hman & Mineka, 2001) proposed the existence of an evolved fear module\u2014a neural system that is selectively sensitive to evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli. The evolutionary claim is that individuals who more rapidly detected the stimulus attributes signifying the presence of a poisonous snake or a spider would have been more likely to escape the danger and hence to survive and reproduce. As a consequence, a mechanism supporting the rapid detection of this type of dangerous stimulus evolved.\nThe claim for the existence of a bias toward the rapid detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli has received empirical support from visual search studies showing faster detection of fear-relevant than fear-irrelevant stimuli. O\u0308hman, Flykt, and Esteves (2001) presented participants with matrices consisting of pictures of snakes (fear relevant) and flowers (fear irrelevant). One of the two types of stimuli was designated the target, and each matrix included either a single target or no target. Participants had to decide as quickly as possible whether or not the target was present in each trial. They reliably detected the presence of a snake target among flowers more quickly than a flower target among snakes. The same pattern of results was obtained for spiders versus mushrooms. Moreover, participants who reported being afraid of snakes found snake targets even faster than nonfearful individuals did.\nThe basic finding reported by O\u0308hman et al. (2001)\u2014more rapid detection of snakes and spiders than of non-threat-relevant stimuli\u2014has been replicated by several other investigators (e.g., Lipp, Derakshan, Waters, & Logies, 2004; Tipples, Young,"}, {"heading": "Address correspondence to Vanessa LoBue, University of Virginia,", "text": ""}, {"heading": "PO Box 400400, Charlottesville, VA 22904, e-mail: vl8m@virginia. edu.", "text": "284 Volume 19\u2014Number 3Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at St Petersburg State University on January 29, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nQuinlan, Broks, & Ellis, 2002). However, some of the results of these studies are inconsistent with the conclusions reached by O\u0308hman et al. In some cases, superior detection was also found for non-threat-relevant animals (e.g., bears, dogs, and kittens; Tipples et al., 2002). In addition, there are reports of superior detection of modern threatening stimuli (e.g., syringes, guns, and knives; Blanchette, 2006; Brosch & Sharma, 2005). Furthermore, in some of these studies, results varied with the number of distractors, contrary to the analysis offered by O\u0308hman et al.\nAll of these visual search results and claims are based on adult participants, who presumably have extensive knowledge about snakes and various kinds and degrees of experience with them (Rachman, 2002). However, if humans have an evolved ability to detect threat-relevant stimuli exceptionally quickly, as proposed by O\u0308hman (O\u0308hman et al., 2001; O\u0308hman & Mineka, 2001), the tendencymight be observable in individuals with relatively little or no experience with such stimuli. Thus, the primary goal of the research reported herewas to take a developmental approach to the topic of threat detection, examining the visual detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli\u2014snakes\u2014by very young children.\nA second goal was to expand the range of comparison stimuli used to examine the detection of snakes. All of the previous research compared detection of snakes with detection of one or two nonthreat stimuli (typically flowers or plants). In contrast, we compared the detection of snakes with the detection of a variety of other types of stimuli, including, most notably, other animals. These comparisons provide particularly strong tests of the hypothesized advantage for the detection of threat-relevant stimuli."}, {"heading": "GENERAL METHOD", "text": "For all the experiments reported here, we presented both preschool children and adults with 3 3 matrices of color photographs of threat-relevant and threat-irrelevant stimuli.

Two changes to the standard visual search task were instituted to make the procedure appropriate for young children. First, so that we could obtain reliable reaction time data from 3- to 5-yearolds, we presented the stimuli on a touch-screen monitor, asking each participant to touch the target on the screen as quickly as possible (see Fig. 1). Second, only target-present matrices were presented, because the touch-screen procedure precluded the inclusion of no-target matrices.

The snakes were all depicted coiled on the ground or in trees (to maximize the size of the snake images). None of the snakes or other animals were depicted in a threatening pose. The photographs were scanned from nature books and adjusted to an image size of 325 245 pixels. A coder blind to the purpose of the research rated the brightness of all pictures on a scale from 1 (very bright) to 5 (very dull).

The experimenter stood alongside to monitor and instruct the child throughout the procedure.\nFirst, a set of seven practice trials was given to teach the child how to use the touch screen. On the first two trials, a single picture appeared on the screen, and the child was asked to touch it. The first picture was from the target category, and the second from the distractor category. (All pictures used in the practice trials were chosen randomly from the original sets of 24.) On the next two trials, the display consisted of 1 target and 1 distractor picture, and the child was asked to touch only the target picture. On each of the final three practice trials, a different 9-picture matrix was displayed. The child was told that the task was to find the \u2018\u2018X\u2019\u2019 (target) among \u2018\u2018Ys\u2019\u2019 (distractors) as quickly as possible, touch it on the screen, and then return his or her hands to the handprints. All the children readily learned the procedure.\nA series of 24 test trials followed. A different picture matrix containing one target and eight distractors was presented on each trial. Between trials, a large smiley face appeared on the screen. The experimenter pressed the face when she judged that the child was looking at it, causing the next matrix to appear. In this way, we ensured that the child\u2019s full attention was on the screen before each matrix appeared. Latency was automatically recorded from the onset of the matrix to when the child touched one of the pictures on the screen.\nAfter the child had completed all 24 trials, his or her parent was tested in exactly the same manner.

This result constitutes the first evidence of which we are aware that young (preschool-age) children detect threatrelevant stimuli more quickly than non-threat-relevant ones. These developmental data are highly relevant to the claim that humans have a special sensitivity to certain categories of evolutionarily significant threatening stimuli (Marks, 1987; O\u0308hman & Mineka, 2001; Seligman, 1970).\nFurthermore, these results suggest that experiencewith snakes may not play amajor role in human sensitivity to them.Compared with the adults, the 3- to 5-year-old participants in this experiment had relatively little exposure to representations of snakes or to facts or cultural lore about snakes. In addition, the children\u2019s reported extent of exposure to live snakes was unrelated to how quickly they located the snake and nonsnake targets.\nEXPERIMENT 2\nIn Experiment 1, both adults and young children detected snakes more rapidly than flowers. Thus, this experiment replicates and extends the results previously reported by O\u0308hman et al. (2001). However, if humans are biased for the rapid detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli, that bias should be apparent with a wide range of nonthreat comparison stimuli. Flowers, the only nonthreat stimulus category used by O\u0308hman et al. (2001), differ from snakes on many dimensions, including the highly salient perceptual feature of shape. In addition, snakes are animate, but flowers are not.\nA much stronger test of a bias for the detection of threat-relevant stimuli would pit snakes against other animals of similar\nphysical appearance. Accordingly, in Experiment 2, we compared the detection of snakes versus frogs. Frogs were chosen for their resemblance to snakes in texture, color, and animacy.

These developmental findings are consistent with O\u0308hman\u2019s (1993; O\u0308hman & Mineka, 2001) proposed fear module\u2014a neural system that is selectively sensitive to evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli.\nAs a further check on the pattern of results in Experiments 1 through 3, we ran a control experiment in which we compared detection of two categories of non-threat-relevant stimuli\u2014frogs versus flowers. The claim of priority for processing threat-relevant stimuli has no implications for the relative speed of detecting different fear-irrelevant stimuli. Hence, there is no theory-based reason to predict a bias for one category over the other, even for stimuli of such distinctly different perceptual appearance. The results revealed no difference for either children or adults in the detection of a single frog among flowers versus a single flower among frogs.4\nThis predicted null result is informative in the context of the tests of our theory-based predictions. Five of the six predictions were supported by the participants\u2019 behavior. In all three studies, the children detected the threat-relevant stimuli significantly faster than the nonthreat stimuli. The adults detected the threat-relevant stimuli significantly faster than the nonthreat stimuli in two of the three studies, and the difference was in the expected direction in the third. Thus, overall, both the adults and the children responded quite differently to the threat-relevant versus the non-threat-relevant stimuli. When there was no theory-based reason to expect a difference in speed of detection, however, none was found.\nA particular strength of the experiments reported here is the exceptionally stringent controls used in Experiments 2 and 3. In most previous visual search studies, the threat and nonthreat stimuli have differed on multiple dimensions (e.g., snakes vs. flowers, spiders vs. mushrooms, various animals vs. plants, guns and knives vs. clocks and toasters). Our comparison of the detection of threat-relevant and non-threat-relevant stimuli that were extremely similar in multiple ways (e.g., snakes vs. frogs, snakes vs. caterpillars) provides a particularly strong test for a bias in the detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli.\nThe results reported here are consistent with preliminary results of a series of studies examining young children\u2019s detection of a very different type of threat-relevant stimulus\u2014angry facial expressions. It is well established that adults detect threatening facial expressions more quickly than nonthreatening ones (e.g., Hansen & Hansen, 1988; O\u0308hman, Lundqvist, & Esteves, 2001). Using the same procedure as in the research reported here, we found that preschool children and their parents detected angry and fearful facial expressions more quickly than happy expressions (LoBue, 2007).\nAn important question raised by this research is, what is it about snakes that attracts the visual attention of humans from the first years of life to adulthood? There are three physical attributes of snakes that we consider good candidate characteristics.\nOne is slithering\u2014snakes\u2019 idiosyncratic movement pattern. This attribute is not relevant to the present studies, in which\n4In addition, pilot studies revealed no differences in detecting a frog among caterpillars versus a caterpillar among frogs, or in detecting a caterpillar among flowers versus a flower among caterpillars.\n288 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat St Petersburg State University on January 29, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nstatic images were used. However, in other research, we have obtained evidence suggesting the importance of movement in human infants\u2019 response to snakes (DeLoache & LoBue, 2007). Infants between 8 and 18 months of age were presented with pairs of animal films\u2014one of a snake and the other of a different kind of exotic animal\u2014showing the animals moving slowly across a screen. The infants oriented preferentially (more rapidly and more often) to the snakes.\nTwo other attributes that distinguish snakes from other animals are their elongated, limbless bodies and their consequent ability to coil themselves. Both of these features were present in the snake photographs used in the research presented here. (Some of the caterpillar stimuli did not have limbs, but many of them did.) It may very well have been these features that were responsible for the more rapid detection of snakes that was observed.\nA question of substantial theoretical importance is the nature of the mechanism that underlies humans\u2019 rapid detection of snakes. Do humans have an evolved tendency to rapidly detect some or all of the physical features possessed by snakes, as proposed by Seligman (1970), O\u0308hman andMineka (2001, 2003), and other investigators? An even stronger version of this general view was recently published by Isbell (2006). In her comprehensive analysis of the origin of the human visual system, she argued that some of its basic properties evolved precisely because they facilitated the detection of snakes.\nAlternatively, does the rapid response to snakes stem from some more general properties of the human visual system? Various asymmetries in visual search are well established; for example, a curved target among rectilinear stimuli visually \u2018\u2018pops out\u2019\u2019 more than a rectilinear target among curves (Treisman & Gormican, 1988). Perhaps some very low-level biases of this sort contribute to the rapid visual detection of snakes.\nIn conclusion, young children share the propensity of adults for particularly rapid visual detection of snakes. The existence of this tendency in such young children lends important support to theories positing the existence in humans of an evolved bias for the detection of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli. Specifying the precise stimulus attributes that underlie this bias is a topic for further research.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We gratefully thank Themba Carr, Chris-\ntina Danko, Joseph Romano, and Catherine Thrasher for valuable\nassistance conducting this research; Dennis Proffitt for help with\nequipment; and Evan Rappoport for programming."}]}, {"paper_id": 167, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02051.x", "O_within_CI_R": 1.0, "Meta_analysis_significant": 1.0, "pvalue_label": 0.0, "Fold_Id": 3.0, "filename": "estes2008.pdf", "title": "Head up, foot down: Object words orient attention to the objects' typical location.", "content": [{"text": "locations, and object words encode these spatial associations. We tested whether such object words (e.g., head, foot) orient attention toward the location where the denoted object typically occurs (i.e., up, down). Because object words elicit perceptual simulations of the denoted objects (i.e., the representations acquired during actual perception are reactivated), we predicted that an object word would interfere with identification of an unrelated visual target subsequently presented in the object\u2019s typical location. Consistent with this prediction, three experiments demonstrated that words denoting objects that typically occur high in the visual field hindered identification of targets appearing at the top of the display, whereas words denoting low objects hindered target identification at the bottom of the display. Thus, object words oriented attention to and activated perceptual simulations in the objects\u2019 typical locations. These results shed new light on how language affects perception.\nAttention is often guided by environmental cues (see Berger, Henik, & Rafal, 2005). Here we focus on cues that orient attention away from themselves. For example, when preceded by an arrow pointing leftward (Posner, Snyder, & Davidson, 1980), the word left (Hommel, Pratt, Colzato, & Godijn, 2001), a head facing leftward (Langton, Watt, & Bruce, 2000), or eyes gazing leftward (Kingstone, Smilek, Ristic, Friesen, & Eastwood, 2003), visual targets are identified faster on the left than on the right. These directional cues orient attention even when the target is no more likely to occur at the cued location than at an uncued location. Thus, social and symbolic cues can reflexively orient attention to an implied location.\nDo object words such as head and foot similarly direct attention to specific locations? Words that denote objects are, after all, both symbolic and social. They are verbal symbols for interpersonal communication. Some objects, such as apples and books, occur in diverse locations and hence have no particular spatial connotation. Other objects, however, typically occur in particular locations. For instance, branches and clouds are typically overhead, whereas roots and puddles are typically underfoot. Indeed, object words are judged faster when presented on a computer screen in the objects\u2019 canonical locations (Zwaan & Yaxley, 2003). For instance, eagle is judged faster when presented at the top rather than the bottom of a display, whereas snake is judged faster at the bottom (S\u030cetic\u0301 & Domijan, 2007). Given that many object words encode spatial associations, we hypothesized that an object word directs attention toward the location where its referent typically occurs.\nWhereas directional cues such as left simply point to a location, object words such as bird also evoke a perceptual simulation of the denoted object. Perceptual simulation is the activation of perceptual representations that were acquired during the actual perception of a stimulus. More specifically, it is the reactivation of neural pathways that have become associated with perceiving a particular stimulus (see Barsalou, 1999, in press; Martin, 2007). For example, the word bird and an image of a bird activate highly overlapping cortical networks (Vandenberghe, Price, Wise, Josephs, & Frackowiak, 1996; see Pulvermu\u0308ller, 2001). Such perceptual simulations emerge automatically during language comprehension, often without conscious awareness. They may also be intentionally generated and consciously inspected, as in the case of mental imagery.\nPerceptual simulation of word meaning may have significant implications for attention and perception. If the word bird activates the neural mechanisms involved in the perception of a bird, then perception of another visual stimulus that requires these same mechanisms should be delayed. Indeed, this may explain why mental imagery hinders visual perception (CraverLemley & Reeves, 1992), particularly when the mental image Address correspondence to Zachary Estes, Department of Psychology, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom, e-mail: z.estes@warwick.ac.uk.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 2 93Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science\nand the physical stimulus overlap spatially (Craver-Lemley & Arterberry, 2001). Generalizing to more implicit forms of perceptual simulation, we hypothesized that object words might also hinder visual perception. More specifically, if an object word activates a perceptual simulation in the object\u2019s typical location, then that word should hinder perception of a visual target in that location. Essentially, because the perceptual mechanisms required for target identification are engaged in the simulation of the denoted object at its typical location, identification of a target at that location should be delayed. In contrast, when the visual target and the perceptual simulation do not overlap spatially, interference should not occur (cf. CraverLemley & Arterberry, 2001). The experiments reported here assessed this hypothesis.\nEXPERIMENT 1\nIn this experiment, object words associated with an upper or lower location served as cues. To ensure that the object words unambiguously denoted an upper or lower location, we presented a context word before each object word. Thus, on each trial, a context word (e.g., cowboy) was followed by an upperlocation (e.g., hat) or lower-location (e.g., boot) cue. Context and cue words were both presented centrally. A target letter (X or O) then appeared at the top or bottom of the display, and participants identified the target as quickly as possible. The target was equally likely to appear at the top or bottom location, regardless of the cue object\u2019s typical location. Thus, the cue did not predict the target\u2019s location. If an object word activates a perceptual simulation of the denoted object in its typical location, then target identification should be hindered at that location."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The experimental stimuli were 30 context words, each paired with one upper-location and one lower-location cue word (i.e., 60 spatial cues). We also included 60 filler stimuli consisting of 30 context words, each paired with 2 nonspatial cue words (e.g., chocolate powder, chocolate shavings). Participants initiated each trial by pressing the space bar, which triggered a central fixation cross that appeared for 250 ms. The context word then appeared centrally for 500 ms, replaced immediately by the cue word for 250 ms. After a 50-ms delay, a target letter subtending approximately 11 of visual angle appeared at the top or bottom of the screen. The \u2018\u2018top\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018bottom\u2019\u2019 locations were centered horizontally approximately 81 vertically from the center of the display. Participants were instructed to identify each target letter as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing the appropriate key. Location cue (upper, lower), target location (top, bottom), and target letter (X, O) were fully crossed and balanced, such that each target letter was equiprobable at each target location, and each target location was equiprobable within each cue condition.

The typical condition included upper-location cues followed by top targets and lower-location cues followed by bottom targets, whereas the atypical condition included upper-location cues followed by bottom targets and lower-location cues followed by top targets. Response times on incorrect trials were removed from all analyses. Response times greater than 1,000 ms were also removed, resulting in the exclusion of 1% to 4% of trials (across experiments). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) across participants (F1) and items (F2).\nTargets were identified more slowly and less accurately when they appeared in the typical location of the object denoted by the preceding word than when they appeared in the opposite location (see Fig. 1, left-most graphs). In the response time data, this effect was significant, F1(1, 17) 5 40.19, prep 1.00, and F2(1, 58) 5 41.54, prep 1.00, and was robust (37 ms, Z2 5 .70).

As predicted, the cue word evoked a perceptual simulation in the object\u2019s typical location, thus hindering perception of a target letter at that location.\nEXPERIMENT 2\nIf the interference observed in Experiment 1 was due to perceptual simulation, then disrupting that simulation should attenuate the effect. In Experiment 2, we tested this prediction by replicating the procedure of Experiment 1, but including a condition in which both target locations were visually masked prior to presentation of the target. Another possibility is that the observed effect reflected inhibition of return (IOR), whereby the perception of a stimulus at a recently attended location is temporarily inhibited (Posner & Cohen, 1984). The spatial cue may have elicited an attentional shift to the implied location, thereby triggering IOR and inhibiting target identification in that location. Indeed, in Experiment 1, the target appeared 300 ms after the spatial cue, a delay that is well within the typical onset of IOR around 225 ms poststimulus (see Klein, 2000). To test this explanation, we reduced the cue-target asynchrony to 150 ms in Experiment 2.

Although the same qualitative pattern was observed in the two conditions, the significant interactive effect of target location and mask on response times indicates that these patterns differed quantitatively. Furthermore, error rates showed the interference effect in the unmasked condition, but not in the masked condition. Given the brief cue-target asynchrony (150 ms), perceptual interference cannot be explained as IOR, which occurs only at longer delays (Klein, 2000). Thus, an object word appears to elicit a perceptual simulation in the object\u2019s typical location, and this perceptual simulation interferes with perceiving a target in that location. A visual mask in that location, however, disrupts the simulation and hence attenuates its interfering effect.\nEXPERIMENT 3\nIn the preceding experiments, the location cue (e.g., hat) was preceded by a context word (e.g., cowboy).

Thus, an object word orients attention to and evokes a perceptual simulation in the denoted object\u2019s typical location, thereby hindering perception in that location."}, {"heading": "GENERAL DISCUSSION", "text": "Words denoting objects that typically occur in high places (e.g., hat, cloud) hindered identification of targets appearing at the top of the display, whereas words denoting objects that typically occur in low places (e.g., boot, puddle) hindered identification of targets at the bottom. This perceptual interference is attribut-\nable to attentional orienting and perceptual simulation. First, an object word orients attention toward the object\u2019s typical location. For example, because birds typically are seen in high places, they become associated with the upper visual field (cf. Richardson & Spivey, 2000), and the word bird elicits an upward shift of attention. Second, the object word activates a perceptual simulation of the denoted object (Barsalou, in press; Martin, 2007). That is, the neural systems associated with the actual perception of the denoted object are activated. In the experiments reported here, object words were followed by a visual target at either the top or the bottom of a display, such that the target appeared in either the denoted object\u2019s typical location or the opposite location. Because the simulated object (e.g., a bird) and the perceptual target (e.g., X) shared few features, perception of the target required inhibition of the neural circuits activated during object simulation, thereby slowing target identification at the denoted object\u2019s typical location. At the opposite (atypical) location, the perceptual mechanisms were not engaged in object simulation, and hence target identification proceeded without interference.\nAttentional orienting and perceptual simulation together explain why some linguistic cues hinder perception of a physical object whereas others facilitate perception of the object. When the linguistic cue activates a perceptual representation that shares few features with the physical stimulus, as in the present experiments, perception is delayed. Richardson, Spivey, Barsalou, and McRae (2003) presented sentences describing either a vertically oriented event (e.g., X respected Y) or a horizontally oriented event (e.g., X argued with Y), followed by an unrelated visual target (i.e., a square or circle) at the top, bottom, left, or right of the display. Targets on the axis associated with the preceding sentence (e.g., a vertical event followed by a top or bottom target) were identified more slowly than targets associated with the other axis (e.g., a vertical event followed by a left or right target). Kaschak et al. (2005) reported an analogous pattern of interference between visual depictions of motion and unrelated sentential descriptions of motion. The present results suggest that participants in all these studies attended to the location, axis, or direction implied by the linguistic cue and simulated the described object or activity. Interference occurred because the simulation and the visual stimulus activated different perceptual representations.\nIn contrast, when the linguistic cue activates many perceptual features of the physical stimulus, perception is facilitated. Stanfield and Zwaan (2001) presented prime sentences that described an object in one orientation or another (e.g., \u2018\u2018He hammered the nail into the wall/floor\u2019\u2019), and each sentence was followed by an image of the target object in one of these orientations (e.g., a nail oriented horizontally or vertically). Judgments of the target object were faster when it matched the orientation implied by the sentence. Similarly, Zwaan, Madden, Yaxley, and Aveyard (2004) found that a ball in motion was processed faster when preceded by a sentence describing a ball\n96 Volume 19\u2014Number 2\nmoving in the same direction rather than the opposite direction. In both cases, facilitation occurred because the simulation and the visual stimulus activated similar perceptual representations.\nThese results have implications not only for perception, but also for attention. When a central cue orients attention to a peripheral location, despite being nonpredictive of the actual location of the target, that orienting is said to be reflexive, or automatic. For example, symbolic cues such as arrows, head orientation, and eye-gaze direction elicit reflexive orienting (Hommel et al., 2001; Kingstone et al., 2003; Langton et al., 2000; Posner et al., 1980). Notably, because the object words in the present experiments did not predict the location of the target, our results indicate that orienting from object words is reflexive. And given the ubiquity of object words, these results indicate that reflexive orienting from symbolic cues is more general than previously known."}]}]
