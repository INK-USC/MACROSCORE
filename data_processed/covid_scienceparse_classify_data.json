During that same month, the number of confirmed cases and the death rate grew exponentially in the United States, creating a serious public-health emergency. Unfortunately, many Americans dismissed the pandemic as a hoax and failed to properly engage in helpful behaviors like social-distancing and increased hand-washing. Here, we examine a disposition\u2014 willingness to engage in analytic-thinking\u2014that might predict beliefs that the pandemic is a hoax and failures to change behavior in positive ways. Our results indicate that individuals less willing to engage effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes were more likely to believe the pandemic was a hoax, and less likely to have recently engaged in social-distancing and handwashing. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding and addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKeywords: COVID-19, cognitive reflection test, analytic, prosocial, misinformation\nConfirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the United States increased exponentially,\nquickly leading to a pandemic in 2020, which created a serious public-health emergency. During the period in which the COVID-19 began to rapidly spread throughout the United States, there was a pressing need for Americans to take the pandemic seriously and to engage in both selfpreserving and prosocial changes to behavior. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) consistently and adamantly encouraged people to socially distance themselves from others and to frequently and thoroughly wash their hands. These concrete steps should have been taken to mitigate the spread of the virus in American communities, minimizing possible harms to individuals and society at-large while preventing the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.\nUnfortunately, many Americans dismissed the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGiven the grave consequences of failing to change behavior, it is imperative that policymakers understand why many constituents resist compliance. These insights have the potential to inform the development of mandates and communications strategies to encourage consistent implementation of expert recommendations.\nTo understand why many people have not changed their behavior, examining the veracity\nand quality of information in the public sphere seems critical. From the earliest days of the outbreak, misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 circulated widely across social media, radio talk shows, and national news media (Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang, & Rand, under review). In a nationally representative poll conducted by The Economist/YouGov from March 8th to 10th, 13% of Americans reported that COVID-19 was probably or definitely a hoax, and only 62% of Americans expressed certainty that COVID-19 was not a hoax. Those\npandemic in a way that minimizes harms to themselves and society at-large.\nIn an effort to understand who is failing to change behavior, we investigate whether\nindividual differences in analytic cognitive style predict beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic being a hoax and engagement in helpful behaviors like social-distancing and increased handwashing. The foundation for this proposed psychological explanation rests on dual-process theoretical accounts of human cognition. Theorists have made a distinction between more automatic, intuitive processing (System 1) and more deliberative, reflective, and analytic processing (System 2; Evans & Stanovich, 2013; De Neys, 2012; Kahneman, 2011; Pennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015). This distinction is illustrated by the following problem from the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005):\nIf it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would\nit take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\nThis problem elicits a fast, intuitive response (100 minutes), but upon reflection, 100 minutes cannot be the right answer. By overriding the fast, intuitive response of 100 minutes and engaging in more reflective, effortful thinking, an individual might arrive at the correct answer of 5 minutes.\nPerformance on these kinds of problems is thought to reflect people\u2019s willingness or\npropensity to think reflectively and analytically (Pennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015; Thompson & Oppenheimer, 2016; Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2011). Humans often avoid using more effortful, resource-demanding cognitive processes to make judgments and decisions, especially when more automatic, effortless, and intuitive processes are good enough (Kahneman, 2011; Stanovich & West, 2000). However, a failure to engage more effortful, deliberative, and\ndecision-making tasks. For example, higher CRT scores predict resistance to conjunction fallacies (Oechssler, Roider, & Schmitz, 2009) and reduced susceptibility to framing effects (Frederick, 2005; Cokely & Kelley, 2009).\nMore recently, researchers have linked performance on the CRT to skepticism about\nepistemically-suspect beliefs (Pennycook, et al., 2015). People who perform better on the CRT are less likely to hold paranormal beliefs (Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2012), less likely to believe that conspiracy theories are veridical (Swami, Voracek, Stieger, Tran, & Furnham, 2014), better at differentiating real and fake news reports (Bronstein, Pennycook, Bear, Rand, & Cannon, 2019; Pennycook & Rand, 2019), and less likely to find pseudo-profound bullshit compelling (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2015). If individuals who are less willing to engage effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes tend to be more willing to hold epistemically-suspect beliefs, then those same individuals might be more likely to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax. In turn, those same individuals might be less likely to engage in helpful behaviors like social-distancing and hand-washing, precisely because they believe that the pandemic is a hoax. 1.1 Overview of Study\nAll data in this pre-registered brief report were collected on Saturday, March 21, 2020,\naround the time that the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases began to skyrocket in the United States. We administered the CRT, and participants reported their beliefs about whether the pandemic is a hoax as well as their engagement in helpful behaviors (i.e., social-distancing and hand-washing) to help combat the pandemic over the previous week. We hypothesized that those individuals who perform worse on the CRT (i.e., individuals less willing to engage effortful,\na hoax and less likely to have engaged in helpful behaviors over the prior week. We also hypothesized that CRT performance would be indirectly related to engagement in helpful behaviors via beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic being a hoax. Participants who perform worse on the CRT should have been less likely to engage in helpful behaviors, precisely because they believe it is a hoax.\nThis study was formally pre-registered:\nhttps://osf.io/f9evs/?view_only=62554e74a03a4a0192e8361f9caf0c1e. We report all exclusion criteria, all conditions included, and all independent and dependent measures. 2. Materials and Method 2.1 Participants\nThree-hundred American residents with at least 500 completed HITs and an approval\nrating above 95% voluntarily participated in this study on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (AMT) for monetary compensation (US $1.50) on March 21, 2020. Twenty-two participants were excluded for failing the attention check (see pre-registration for details); so, data were analyzed with the remaining 278 individuals (Mage = 42 years old, SD = 13, age range = [20-78], 134 males, 143 females, 1 no response). A power analysis indicated that, to detect small-to-moderate correlations (r = .20) with power of .90 and alpha set to .05, 258 participants were needed. Three-hundred participants completed the task with the expectation of having at least 258 participants after exclusions. Data were analyzed only after the required sample size target was met, and the sample size was determined prior to data collection (see pre-registration). We recruited participants through AMT to obtain a more representative sample of the United States population than traditional convenience samples obtained through undergraduate participant\nstudy. 2.2. Materials 2.2.1 Cognitive reflection test (CRT)\nWe used a seven-item CRT: The original three-item CRT (Frederick, 2005) was included\nalong with the four items from the non-numeric version of the CRT developed by Thomson and Oppenheimer (2016). This same seven-item CRT has been implemented in recent work (Pennycook & Rand, 2019). The two versions of the CRT were strongly correlated (r(276) = .60, p < .001), and the full seven-item CRT had acceptable reliability (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .81). Importantly, prior exposure to the CRT does not seem to adversely affect the predictive validity of the CRT, and people continue to incorrectly respond to the same items in subsequent exposures (Bialek & Pennycook, 2017; Meyer, Zhao, & Frederick, 2018; Stagnaro, Pennycook, & Rand, 2018). The CRT was scored by computing the proportion correct for each participant. 2.2.2 COVID-19 questions\nParticipants were asked the extent to which they believe the COVID-19 pandemic is a\nhoax (1 = definitely not a hoax, 6 = definitely a hoax). We intentionally used the \u201choax\u201d language from the The Economist/YouGov poll to more directly relate our findings to their survey results. Participants were also asked to report the extent to which they had been practicing social-distancing in the past week in response to the COVID-19 epidemic (1 = not at all, 6 = a lot) and the extent to which they had been washing their hands with soap and water in the past week in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (1 = not at all, 6 = a lot). Participants were also asked to list possible solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic and to list the specific ways in which\nof solutions and helping behaviors that participants could list was six. 2.2.3 Demographics and political questions\nParticipants were asked to report their age, gender, and level of education (1 = did not\ncomplete high school, 2 = high school degree or equivalent, 3 = Associate\u2019s degree, 4 = Bachelor\u2019s degree, 5 = Graduate or Professional degree), after which they responded to questions about their politics. Specifically, participants were asked to indicate how liberal or conservative they are on social issues (1 = very liberal, 7 = very conservative) and on economic issues (1 = very liberal, 7 = very conservative). 2.3 Procedure\nAfter providing informed consent, participants first completed the seven-item CRT, with\nthe order of seven questions randomized across participants. Then, for the COVID-19 questions, participants first listed possible solutions to the pandemic and helping behaviors that they had engaged in over the prior week. Using sliding scales, participants then responded to the hoax item, and after that, the social-distancing and hand-washing questions (the order of these two questions were randomized across participants). After responding to all COVID-19 questions, participants completed the demographics and political questions, and they responded to the attention check question (see pre-registration for details). 3. Results\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients for the primary\nvariables of interest (Supplemental Information contains descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients for additional demographics and political variables). We hypothesized that those individuals who perform worse on the CRT (i.e., individuals less willing to engage effortful,\npandemic is a hoax and less likely to have engaged in helpful behaviors over the prior week. To address these hypotheses, we computed bivariate correlations between average CRT performance, beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic being a hoax, and measures of helping behaviors (social-distancing, hand-washing, and the reported quantity of helping behaviors in the past week).\nindeed more likely to believe that the pandemic is a hoax (r(276) = -.46, p < .001); participants who performed worse on the CRT were also less likely to have engaged in social-distancing (r(276) = .14, p = .02) and hand-washing with soap and water (r(276) = .14, p = .02) over the previous week.1 However, there was no significant relationship between CRT performance and participants\u2019 reported quantity of helping behaviors (r(276) = -.06, p = .28). So, while CRT performance did not predict the quantity of helpful behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it did predict the extent to which participants have engaged in those helpful behaviors. See Supplemental Information for partial correlations."}, {"heading": "1 Non-parametric correlations (Spearman\u2019s rank-order) showed the same pattern of results: Participants who performed worse on the CRT were more likely to believe that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax", "text": "(r(276) = -.45, p < .001); participants who performed worse on the CRT were also less likely to have engaged in social-distancing (r(276) = .15, p = .01) and hand-washing with soap and water (r(276) = .16, p = .007) in the previous week\nengagement in helping behaviors via beliefs about the COVID-19 being a hoax. To address this hypothesis, we used the PROCESS macro in SPSS from Hayes (2012) with 5,000 bootstrap resamples. The results from these analyses corroborate our hypothesis: There were significant indirect effects of CRT performance on social-distancing (b = .27, boot SE = .07, 95% CI [.13,.42]) and hand-washing (b = .37, boot SE = .10, 95% CI [.20,.57]) through beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic being a hoax. The direct effects of CRT performance on social-distancing (b = .09, SE = .17, t = .52, p = .60, 95% CI [-.25,.43]) and hand-washing (b = .03, SE = .18, t = .17, p = .86, 95% CI [-.33,.40]) behaviors were non-significant in the models.\nWe also sought to ensure that these indirect effects persist after statistically controlling\nfor several demographics (age, education level) and political (social and economic conservatism) variables. Our results indicate that, even after statistically accounting for age, education level, social conservatism, and economic conservatism, there remained significant indirect effects of CRT performance on social-distancing (b = .18, boot SE = .06, 95% CI [.07,.31]) and handwashing (b = .29, boot SE = .08, 95% CI [.15,.46]) behaviors through beliefs about the COVID19 pandemic being a hoax. The direct effects of CRT performance on social-distancing (b = .03, SE = .18, t = .18, p = .86, 95% CI [-.31,.38]) and hand-washing (b = .03, SE = .19, t = .18, p = .86, 95% CI [-.34,.41]) behaviors continued to be non-significant in the models. 4. General Discussion\nWe conducted this study when the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases began to skyrocket\nin the United States, and we found evidence that individuals less willing to engage effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes were more likely to believe that the pandemic was a hoax and less likely to have recently engaged in social-distancing and hand-washing\nto engage these effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes were less likely to engage in helpful behaviors, precisely because they believed the pandemic to be a hoax. These findings contribute to a growing literature on insights from social and behavioral sciences critical for understanding human responses to the pandemic, and hopefully, optimizing the response to the pandemic (Van Bavel et al., under review).\nWhile the current investigation yielded novel, theoretically-important findings that are\ngenerally consistent with prior findings on the relations between dispositional analytic-thinking, epistemically-suspect beliefs, and conspiracist ideation (Pennycook et al., 2015), our findings might also inform efforts to craft communications and implement interventions to inspire behavioral change for the sake of public safety. For one, given the relatively high prevalence of respondents willing to entertain the possibility that COVID-19 is a hoax\u2014both within our sample and other polls (e.g. The Economist/YouGov poll)\u2014and given that this hoax beliefs strongly predict prosocial behavior, efforts to inspire behavior change might attempt to directly combat hoax beliefs head-on (going forward, it would also be valuable to better understand the details of these hoax beliefs). Researchers recently identified several effective ways of correcting misinformation that could be implemented on a national scale (for details, see Lewandowsky, Ecker, Seifert, Schwarz, & Cook, 2012).\nIt remains unclear, however, whether effective public messaging and other interventions\naimed at eliminating hoax beliefs will work or meaningfully shift behavior. In looking to copious evidence from the field of behavioral economics, it is difficult to create interventions that establish consistent and prolonged behavior change. Simon (1997) argued that humans are boundedly rational, limited by both time and mental energy, often leading us to make sub-\nindividual differences in analytic-thinking style in predicting epistemic beliefs (Pennycook et al., 2015), with the rationality of some bounded more than others, it stands to reason that those individuals low in analyticity might be less responsive to information-based appeals that require reasoned shifts to behavioral change. Other kinds of persuasive techniques might be better-suited to changing the beliefs and behaviors of those who are dispositionally less willing to engage in effortful, deliberative, and reflecting thinking. This is particularly important given that Pennycook and colleagues (under review) recently found that people who score lower on analytic-thinking tend to be less discerning in their sharing of COVID-19 news.\nAt the same time, however, it might not be the case that we can simply aim System 2\ninformation-rich messaging at one audience, and System 1 messaging at another. System 1 strategies might be ineffective (or even backfire) with those individuals who approach the CRT with fast but flawed reasoning. Th rejection of the COVID-19 information presented by public health experts could potentially be countered with deeper causal explanations of the mechanisms of the pandemic accessible to the layperson. For example, some people might be persuaded by genetics research showing the lineage of the COVID-19 pathogen and, in turn, benefit from more comprehensive biological explanations of our lack of resistance to it. As with climate change, sometimes denial is the result of feeling overwhelmed by the problem (Haltinner & Sarathchandra, 2018). A nuanced, multi-faceted approach to gaining consensus on the challenge is likely required to get alignment on the solutions. In the same way that Ignaz Semmelweis\u2019s contemporaries rejected his theory that they caused patients\u2019 deaths and that hand-washing was the solution, many people might not currently have the mental models to understand, accept, and react appropriately to the science of infectious disease epidemiology.\nBialek, M., & Pennycook, G.

A salient recent example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has bred a multitude of falsehoods even as truth has increasingly become a matter of life-and-death. Here we investigate why people believe and spread false (and true) news content about COVID-19, and test an intervention intended to increase the truthfulness of the content people share on social media. Across two studies with over 1,600 participants (quota-matched to the American public on age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region), we find support for the idea that people share false claims about COVID-19 in part because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, participants who engaged in more analytic thinking and had greater science knowledge were more discerning in their belief and sharing. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study \u2013 i.e., asking people to judge the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline \u2013 more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants\u2019 sharing intentions. In the control, participants were equally like to say they would share false versus true headlines at COVID-19 whereas, in the treatment, sharing of true headlines was significantly higher than false headlines. Our results \u2013 which mirror those found previously for political fake news \u2013 suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media. Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThis working paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.\nDate: March 17th, 2020\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a substantial challenge to the maintenance of global human wellbeing. Not unlike other global challenges, such as anthropogenic global warming, much depends on the actions of individual citizens and, therefore, the quality of the information to which people are exposed. Unfortunately, however, misinformation about COVID-19 has proliferated on social media (Frenkel, Alba, & Zhong, 2020; Russonello, 2020). In the case of COVID-19, this misinformation comes in many forms - from conspiracy theories about the virus being created as a biological weapon in China to claims that coconut oil kills the virus. At its worst, misinformation of this sort may cause people to turn to ineffective (and potentially directly harmful) remedies, as well as to either overreact (e.g., by hoarding goods) or, more dangerously, underreact (e.g., by deliberately engaging in risky behavior and inadvertently spreading the virus). As a consequence, it is important to better understand why people both believe and share false (and true) information related to COVID-19 \u2013 and to develop interventions to reduce the spread of misinformation.\nHere we apply a cognitive science lens to this problem. In particular, we test whether previous findings from the domain of political \u201cfake news\u201d (fabricated political news stories presented as if from legitimate sources, Lazer et al., 2018) extend to misinformation related to COVID-19. One vein of prior research suggests that engaging in reasoning helps people to identify political misinformation (Pennycook & Rand, 2019a) \u2013 in contrast to theories that focus more on partisanship (Van Bavel & Pereira, 2018) or argue that reasoning is often hijacked by partisan bias (Kahan, 2017; Kahan, Peters, Dawson, & Slovic, 2017). Survey experiments show, for example, that people who believe and consider sharing more political false (Pennycook, Cannon, & Rand, 2018; Pennycook & Rand, 2019a, 2019b) and misleading hyperpartisan (Ross, Rand, & Pennycook, 2019) news headlines score lower on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005) \u2013 a test of one\u2019s willingness and ability to engage in analytic or reflective thinking (as opposed to relying on one\u2019s intuitions; (Pennycook, Cheyne, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2016; Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2011). Belief in fake news is also associated with lower scores on the Actively Open-minded Thinking about Evidence scale (Bronstein, Pennycook, Bear, Rand, & Cannon, 2019), a self-report measure of the extent to which people believe that beliefs ought to change according to evidence (Pennycook, Cheyne, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2019). Similarly, analysis of sharing behavior on Twitter shows that people who score lower on the CRT share news from sources deemed to be less trustworthy by professional fact-checkers (Mosleh, Pennycook, Arechar, & Rand, 2020). Finally, experimentally increasing reliance on emotion (Martel, Pennycook, & Rand, 2019) and decreasing reflective thinking (Bago, Rand, & Pennycook, 2019) leads to an increase in belief in false (but not true) news content.\nIn Study 1 of the present paper, we presented participants with a set of true and false news headlines about COVID-19 to test the prediction that their level of discernment between false and true headlines will be positively related to their tendency to engage in analytic thinking (indexed by the CRT); and, relatedly, to their level of scientific knowledge. We also examined (in exploratory analyses) the relationship between discernment and various other measures, including\npartisanship (Russonello, 2020), geographic proximity to COVID-19 diagnoses, and the tendency to over- versus under-use medical services (the medical maximizer-minimizer scale; Scherer et al., 2016). We also examine how these constructs relate to participants\u2019 level of concern regarding COVID-19 and their attention to news regarding COVID-19.\nIn addition, we gain insight into the spread of COVID-19 misinformation by drawing on recent research that focuses specifically on the sharing of fake and misleading news (again in the political realm; Pennycook et al., 2020). This work introduced an attention-based account of misinformation sharing on social media. By this account, most people are reasonably good at telling truth from falsehood and generally want to avoid spreading misinformation \u2013 that is, the primary problem in the United States is neither media/digital literacy (Cooke, 2018; Lee, 2018) nor a \u201cpost-truth\u201d lack of concern for the truth (Davies, 2016; Lewandowsky, 2020). Instead, the problem is that the social media context focuses their attention on factors other than accuracy (e.g., amount of positive social feedback they will receive). As a result, users get distracted from even considering accuracy when deciding whether to share \u2013 leading them to not implement their preference for accuracy and instead share misleading content. In support of this argument, Pennycook et al. (2020) found that most participants were surprisingly good at discerning between true and false political news when asked to assess the headlines\u2019 accuracy \u2013 yet headline veracity had very little impact on the choices of participants who were asked if they would consider sharing the headlines on social media. Crucially, subtle nudges that helped make the concept of accuracy top-of-mind decreased subsequent sharing of false content. For example, rating the accuracy of a single headline at the beginning of a study (ostensibly as a part of an unrelated pretest) more than doubled participants\u2019 level of sharing discernment between true and false headlines in survey experiments; and a similar message improved the quality of news shared by Twitter users in a digital field experiment.\nHere, we ask if the same is true of misinformation related to COVID-19. In Study 1, we compare participants\u2019 level of discernment (i.e., differentiation between true from false headlines) when judging headlines\u2019 accuracy versus when considering what to share online. Our prediction is that discernment will be high for accuracy judgments, but much lower for sharing intentions. In Study 2, we then test the prediction that subtly inducing people to consider the concept of accuracy reduces their likelihood to consider sharing false headlines related to COVID-19.\nWe report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures in the study. Our data, materials, and preregistration are available online (https://osf.io/7d3xh/). At the end of both surveys, participants were told which of the headlines were accurate (by representing the true headlines).\nStudy 1"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We recruited 1000 participants using Lucid, an online recruiting source that aggregates survey respondents from many respondent providers (Coppock & McClellan, 2019).

This study was run on March 12th, 2020."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "News evaluation/sharing task. Through a partnership with Harvard Global Health Institute, we derived a list of 15 false and 15 true news headlines relating to COVID-19 (available online: https://osf.io/7d3xh/). The false headlines were deemed to be false by authoritative sources such as fact-checking sites like snopes.com and factcheck.org, health experts such as mayoclinic.com, and credible science websites such as www.livescience.com. The true headlines came from reliable mainstream media sources. Headlines were presented in the format of Facebook posts: a picture accompanied by a headline and lede sentence. Participants were randomized into two conditions. In the Accuracy Condition, they were asked: \u201cTo the best of your knowledge, is the claim in the above headline accurate\u201d (yes, no). In the Sharing Condition, they were asked: \u201cWould you consider sharing this story online (for example, through Facebook or Twitter)\u201d (yes, no); some evidence in support of the validity of this self-report sharing measure comes from the observation that news headlines which MTurkers report a higher likelihood of sharing do indeed receive more shares on Twitter (Mosleh, Pennycook, & Rand, 2020). We also counterbalanced the order of the yes/no options (No/Yes v. Yes/No) across participants. Headlines were presented in a random order.\nCOVID-19 questions. Prior to the news evaluation task, participants were asked two questions specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. First, they were asked \u201cHow concerned are you about COVID-19 (the new coronavirus)\u201d, which they answered using a sliding scale from 0 (not concerned at all) to 100 (extremely concerned). Second, they were asked \u201cHow often do you proactively check the news regarding COVID-19 (the new coronavirus)\u201d, which they answered on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very often).\nAdditional correlates. We gave participants a 6-item Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005) that consisted of a reworded version of the original 3-item test (Shenhav, Rand, & Greene, 2012) and 3 items from a non-numeric version (we excluded the \u201chole\u201d item; Thomson & Oppenheimer, 2016). The CRT had acceptable reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .69). Participants also completed a general science knowledge quiz that consisted of 17 questions about basic science facts (e.g., \u201cAntibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria\u201d, \u201cLasers work by focusing sound waves\u201d) (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2020; Miller, 1998). The scale had acceptable reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .77). We also administered the Medical Maximizing-Minimizing Scale (Scherer et al., 2016), which indexes the extent to which people are either \"medical maximizers\" who tend to seek health care even if for minor issues or, rather, \"medical minimizers\" who tend to avoid health care unless absolutely necessary. The MMS scale also had acceptable reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .86). Finally, in addition to various demographic questions, we indexed political ideology on both social and fiscal issues, in addition to Democrat v. Republican party alignment.\nAttention checks. Following the recommendations of Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances (2014) we added three screener questions that put a subtle instruction in the middle of a block of text. For example, in a block of text ostensibly about which news sources people prefer, we asked participants to select two specific options (\u201cFoxNews.com and NBC.com\u201d) if they were reading the text. Full text for the screener questions is available online (along with the full materials for the study; https://osf.io/7d3xh/). Screeners were placed just prior to the news evaluation/sharing task, after the CRT, and after the science knowledge and MMS scales. Although we did not preregister any exclusions based on inattentiveness, performance on the screener questions was substantially worse than we expected: 44.7% of participants failed the majority of the screener questions. Thus, we deviate from our preregistration and restrict our main analyses to participants who answered the majority of screener questions. The results are qualitatively equivalent when following the preregistered plan of analyzing all participants (see Supplementary Information)."}, {"heading": "Analysis", "text": "All analyses of headline ratings are conducted at the level of the rating, using linear regression with robust standard errors clustered on participants and headline (note that our preregistration erroneously indicated that we would cluster standard errors only on participant; doing so does not qualitatively change the results).

However, qualitatively equivalent results are obtained using logistic regression."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "We begin by comparing discernment \u2013 the difference between responses to true versus false headlines \u2013 across conditions. As predicted, we observed a significant interaction between headline veracity and condition, F(1,14156)=46.28, p<0.0001, such that veracity had a much bigger impact on accuracy judgments than sharing intentions (Figure 1; equivalent results are obtained when zscoring ratings within condition). In particular, for false headlines, 50% more people considered sharing the headlines than rated them as accurate. Thus, we observe a similar pattern when using false headlines about COVID-19 as what has been observed previously using false political headlines (Pennycook et al., 2020). In Study 2, we build on this observation to test the impact of experimentally inducing participants to think about accuracy when making sharing decisions.\nBefore turning to Study 2, we examine how various individual difference measures correlate with truth discernment and sharing discernment (i.e., how the individual differences interact with headline veracity). We also note that all relationships reported below are robust to including controls for age, gender, education (college degree or higher), and ethnicity (white versus nonwhite) and all interactions between controls, veracity, and condition.\nWe begin with cognitive reflection. We found an overall positive relationship between CRT and discernment (F(1,14152)=11.37, p<.001), which did not significantly differ for accuracy versus sharing (3-way interaction between CRT, veracity, and condition; F(1,14152)=2.44, p=.12). In particular, CRT was negatively correlated with belief in false headlines and uncorrelated with\nbelief in true headlines; whereas CRT was negatively correlated with sharing of both types of headlines (albeit more negatively with sharing of false headlines compared to true; see Table 1). The pattern of CRT correlations we see here for COVID-19 misinformation therefore replicates what has been seen previously with political headlines (e.g., Pennycook & Rand, 2019a).\nCondition: Accuracy Sharing\nNext we consider science knowledge. Like CRT, we found an overall positive relationship between science knowledge and discernment (F(1,14152)=26.81, p<.0001) that did not significantly differ for accuracy versus sharing (3-way interaction between science knowledge, veracity, and condition; F(1,14152)=2.26, p=.13). Science knowledge was positively correlated with belief in true headlines and uncorrelated with belief in false headlines, but negatively correlated with sharing of false headlines and uncorrelated with sharing of true headlines (see Table 1).\nWe now turn to the relationship between discernment and our exploratory measures (see Table 1). Distance from the nearest COVID-19 epicenter (defined as a county with at least 10 confirmed coronavirus cases; log-transformed because of right-skew) was not significantly related to any of the belief or sharing measures. The medical maximizer-minimizer scale was negatively correlated with discernment for accuracy (F(1,14152)=12.02, p=.0005), such that medical maximizers show\ngreater belief in false but not true headlines; but, in contrast, there is no such correlation with discernment for sharing (F(1,14152)=0.98, p=.32) such that medical maximizers were more likely to consider sharing both true and false headlines to the same degree (the 3-way interaction between maximizer-minimizer, veracity, and condition was significant; F(1,14152)=10.97, p<.001). Preference for the Republican party over the Democratic party (partisanship) was not significantly related belief in false or true headlines or to sharing of false headlines, but was significantly negative correlated with sharing of true headlines. However, the 3-way interaction between partisanship, veracity, and condition was not significant, F(1,14092)=0.02, p=.88; instead, there was a significant overall relationship between partisanship and discernment (F(1,14092)=5.03, p=.025) such that Democrats were better at discerning between true and false content.\nFinally, in Table 2 we report how all of the above variables relate to concern about COVID-19 and how often people proactively check COVID-19 related news (self-reported). Both measures were negatively correlated with CRT and preference for the Republican party over the Democratic Party; uncorrelated with science knowledge and distance from closest disease epicenter; and positively correlated with being a medical maximizer. The results are qualitatively equivalent when using a regression model where all of the individual difference measures were included simultaneously, along with age, gender, ethnicity (white vs non-white) and education (less than college degree vs college degree or more). The only exception is that CRT is no longer a significant predictor of checking COVID-19 related news.\nStudy 2"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We recruited 1000 participants using Lucid.

In the Control Condition they began the news sharing task, as in Study 1. In the Treatment Condition they rated the accuracy of a single headline (that did not relate to COVID-19) at the beginning of the survey (this was framed as being for a pretest, as in Pennycook et al., 2020). An advantage of this design is that the manipulation is subtle and not explicitly linked to the main task. Thus, although social desirability bias may lead people to underreport their likelihood of sharing misinformation overall, it is unlikely that any between-condition difference is driven by participants believing that the accuracy question at the beginning of the treatment condition was designed to make them take accuracy into account when making sharing decisions during the main experiment. It is therefore relatively unlikely that any treatment effect would be due demand characteristics or social desirability.\nNews sharing task. Participants were presented the same headlines as for Study 1 and (as in the sharing condition of Study 1) were asked about their willingness to share the headlines on social media. In this case, however, we asked: \u201cIf you were to see the above on social media, how likely would you be to share it\u201d, which they answered on a 6-point scale from 1 (extremely unlikely) to 6 (extremely likely). As described above, some evidence in support of the validity of this selfreport sharing intentions measure comes from (Mosleh, Pennycook, & Rand, 2020). Further support for the specific paradigm used in this experiment \u2013 where participants are asked to rate the accuracy of a headline and then go on to indicate sharing intentions \u2013 comes from Pennycook et al. (2020), who find similar results using this paradigm on MTurk and in a field experiment on Twitter measuring actual (rather than hypothetical) sharing.\nOther measures. All of the additional measures that were included in Study 1 were also included for Study 2.\nAttention checks. The same screeners included in Study 1 were also included in Study 2.

Quantitatively, sharing discernment was 2.5 times higher in the treatment compared to the control. Furthermore, the treatment effect on sharing discernment was not significantly moderated by CRT score, science knowledge, distance to nearest infection epicenter, or the medical maximizer-minimizer scale (p>0.10 for all 3-way interactions between headline veracity, treatment, and individual difference); and although there was a significant negative 3-way interactions between headline veracity, treatment, and partisanship, F(1,14864)=8.16, p=0.004, the treatment still significantly increased discernment for both Democrats, F(1,14864)=15.77, p=0.0001, and Republicans, F(1,14864)=6.14, p=0.013.\nOur interpretation of the mechanism underlying the treatment effect is that the treatment makes participants more likely to consider accuracy when deciding whether to share. Based on this mechanism, the extent to which the treatment increases or decreases sharing of a given headline should reflect the underlying perceptions of the headline\u2019s accuracy. To provide evidence for such a relationship, we perform an item-level analysis. For each headline, we examine how the effect of the treatment on sharing (i.e. average sharing intention in treatment minus average sharing intention in the control) varies based on the average accuracy rating given to that headline by participants in the Accuracy condition of Study 1. Because participants in Study 2 did not rate the accuracy of the COIVD-19 related headlines, we use average Study 1 ratings as a proxy for how accurate individual participants in Study 2 would likely deem the headlines to be."}, {"heading": "As shown in Figure 3, there is indeed a strong positive correlation between a headline\u2019s", "text": "perceived accuracy and the impact of the treatment, r(28)=0.77, p<.0001.\nFigure 3.

In Study 1, participants were willing to share fake news about COVID-19 that they would have apparently been able to identify as being untrue if they were asked directly about accuracy. Put differently, participants were far less discerning if they were asked about whether they would share it on social media than if they were asked about its accuracy. Furthermore, individuals who are less likely to rely on their intuitions and who are lower in basic scientific knowledge were worse at discerning between true and false content (in terms of both accuracy and sharing decisions). In Study 2, we demonstrated the promise of a behavioral intervention informed by this attention-based account. Prior to deciding which headlines they would share on social media, participants were subtly primed to think about accuracy by being asked to rate the accuracy of a single news headline. This minimal, contentneutral intervention was sufficient to more than double participants\u2019 level of discernment between sharing true versus false headlines.\nThis research has implications for both public policy and theory. Misinformation is a particularly significant problem in uncertain news environments (e.g., immediately following a major news event; Starbird, 2019; Starbird, Maddock, Orand, Achterman, & Mason, 2014). In cases where high quality information may literally be life-and-death (for some) \u2013 such as for COVID-19 \u2013 the impetus to develop interventions to fight misinformation become even more dire. Consistent with recent work on political misinformation (Pennycook et al., 2020), here we find that simple and subtle reminders about the concept of accuracy may be sufficient to improve people\u2019s sharing decisions regarding information about COVID-19, and therefore reduce the amount of\n-0.06\n-0.04\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nT re\na tm\ne n\nt E\nff e\nc t in\nS tu\nd y 2\nPerceived Accuracy in Study 1\nTrue\nFalse\nmisinformation of COVID-19 seen on social media. Although our treatment was far from eliminating all intentions to share misinformation, the intervention may nonetheless have important downstream effects on the overall quality of information shared online (e.g. due to network effects; for an extended discussion, see Pennycook et al., 2020). Furthermore, when misinformation is particularly high risk \u2013 as is the case for COVID-19 \u2013 even modest improvements can have meaningful consequences.\nIn terms of theoretical impact, our findings relate to recent debates in the social science of misinformation. A lot has been made of the potential role of political ideology and partisan identity in the context of fake news (Beck, 2017; Kahan, 2017; Taub, 2017; Van Bavel & Pereira, 2018). Although there has certainly been some political polarization in the context of COVID-19 (Bruce, Nguyen, Ballad, & Sanders, 2020) \u2013 which we find evidence for here as well; Republicans tended to be less concerned about COVID-19 and less likely to share true COVID-19 news content than Democrats \u2013 believing and spreading health misinformation seems (based on our data) more similar to the type of poor intuitive or emotional thinking that is typically linked with conspiratorial (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2015; Swami, Voracek, Stieger, Tran, & Furnham, 2014; Vitriol & Marsh, 2018) and superstitious (Elk, 2013; Lindeman & Svedholm, 2012; Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2012; Risen, 2015) belief. Furthermore, recent work has shown that, even in the context of politically polarized false (Pennycook & Rand, 2019a) and misleading (Ross et al., 2019) news, the actual truth or falsity of the content plays a larger role than political valence. Relatedly, in an investigation of a American opinions about a wide range of scientific topics, McPhetres and Pennycook (2020) found that political ideology was a weak and inconsistent predictor relative to cognitive sophistication (i.e., basic science knowledge, analytic thinking, etc.). Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of reflecting on incorrect intuitions and avoiding the traps of cognitive miserliness for a variety of psychological outcomes (Pennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015; Stanovich, 2005).\nOur research is not without several important implications. Perhaps most importantly, our evidence is restricted to the United States and therefore needs to be tested elsewhere in the world. Although our sample was quota-matched to the U.S. population on age, gender, ethnicity, and region, it was also not obtained via probability sampling and therefore should not be considered nationally representative. We also used a particular set of true and false headlines about COVID-19. It is important for future work to test the generalizability of our findings to other headlines, and to (mis)information about COVID-19 that comes in forms other than headlines (e.g. emails/text posts/memes about supposed disease cures). Finally, our sharing intentions were hypothetical and our experimental accuracy induction was performed in a \u201clab\u201d context. Thus, one may be concerned about whether our results will extend to naturalistic social media contexts. We see two reasons to expect that our results will in fact generalize to real sharing. First, our manipulation was quite subtle and thus we believe it is unlikely that differences in sharing intentions between the treatment and control (as opposed to overall sharing levels) are driven by demand effects or social\ndesirability bias. Second, Pennycook et al. (2020) targeted the same accuracy reminder intervention at political misinformation and found that the results from the survey experiments replicated when they delivered the intervention via direct message on Twitter, significantly improving the quality of subsequent tweets from individuals who are prone to sharing misleading political news content.\nIn sum, our results shed light on why people believe and share misinformation related to COVID19 and points to a suite of interventions based on accuracy nudges that social media platforms could easily implement. Such interventions are easily scalable, avoid issues related to implied truth that can arise with warning flags (Pennycook, Bear, Collins, & Rand, 2019), and do not require platforms to make decision about what content to censor. We hope that social media platforms will consider this approach in their efforts to combat the spread of health misinformation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Stefanie Friedhoff, Michael N.

In particular, for false headlines, \u2153 more people considered sharing the headlines than rated them as accurate.

In particular, science knowledge is negatively correlated with belief in false headlines and positively with belief in true headlines; whereas science knowledge is negatively correlated with sharing of false headlines and uncorrelated with sharing of true headlines (see Table S1).\nWe now turn to the relationship between discernment and our exploratory measures (see Table S1). Distance from the nearest COVID-19 epicenter (defined as a county with at least 10 confirmed coronavirus cases; log-transformed because of right-skew) is not significantly related to belief in either true or false headlines, but negatively correlated with sharing intentions for both true and false headlines (no significant interactions with veracity, p>0.2; interaction between distance and condition was marginal, F(1, 25522)=3.07, p=0.080). The medical maximizer-minimizer scale is negatively correlated with discernment for accuracy (F(1,25582)=11.26, p=.0008), such that medical maximizers show greater belief in both true and false headlines (this pattern is more strongly positive for belief in false headlines); but, in contrast, there is no such correlation with discernment for sharing (F(1,25582)=0.03, p=.87). Thus, medical maximizers are more likely to consider sharing both true and false headlines to the same degree (the 3-way interaction between\nmaximizer-minimizer, veracity, and condition was significant; F(1,25582)=7.58, p=.006). Preference for the Republican party over the Democratic party (partisanship) was not significantly related to discernment for accuracy (F(1,25402)=0.45, p=.50) but was significantly negatively related to discernment for sharing (F(1,25402)=8.28, p=.004), such that stronger Republicans were less likely to share both true and false headlines, but were particularly less likely (relative to Democrats) to share true headlines (however, the 3-way interaction between partisanship, veracity, and condition was not significant, F(1,25402)=1.62, p=.20).\nFinally, in Table S2 we report how all of the above variables relate to concern about COVID-19 and how often people proactively check COVID-19 related news (self-reported). Both measures are negatively correlated with CRT score and preference for the Republican party over the Democratic Party; uncorrelated with science knowledge; and positively correlated with being a medical maximizer. Distance to the nearest county with at least 50 COVID-19 diagnoses was uncorrelated with concern but negatively correlated with news-checking. The results are qualitatively equivalent when using a regression model where all of the individual difference measures were included simultaneously, along with age, gender, ethnicity (white vs non-white) and education (less than college degree vs college degree or more) - except that in the regression models, a significant positive relationship emerges between science knowledge and both COVID19 measures (p<0.01 for both); and the negative relationship between distance to epicenter and news seeking is no longer significant.\nCOVID-19 Concern COVID-19 News-\nChecking\nCRT Science\nKnowledge\nPartisanship (Republican) Distance to epicenter\nMedical Maximizing\nCOVID-19 Concern -\nCOVID-19 NewsChecking\n.64*** -\nCognitive Reflection Test (CRT)\n-.22*** -.10** -\nScience Knowledge -.001 .06\u2020 .40*** -\nPartisanship (Republican) -.27*** -.21*** .09** -.08* -\nDistance to epicenter -.05 -.07* .01 -.03 .10* -\nMedical Maximizing .41*** .36*** -.23*** -.16*** -.15*** -.05 -\nTable S2.

Quantitatively, sharing discernment was 2.8 times higher in the treatment compared to the control. Furthermore, the treatment effect on sharing discernment was not significantly moderated by CRT score, science knowledge, partisanship, distance to nearest infection epicenter, or the medical maximizer-minimizer scale (p>0.10 for all 3-way interactions between headline veracity, treatment, and individual difference).\nFigure S2. Percentage of headlines participants said they would be likely to share by headline veracity (true vs false) and condition. For this visualization, we discretize sharing intentions using the scale midpoint (i.e. 1-3=0, 4-6=1) in give a more easily interpretable measurement; all analyses are conducted using the full (non-discretized) scale, and plotting the average (nondiscretized) sharing intentions looks qualitatively similar. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.\nOur interpretation of the treatment effect is that it makes participants more likely to take accuracy into account when deciding what to share. Thus, the extent to which the treatment increases or decreases sharing of a given headline should depend on how accurate they perceive the headline to be. To provide evidence for such a relationship, we perform an item-level analysis. For each headline, we examine how the effect of the treatment on sharing (i.e. average sharing intention in treatment minus average sharing intention in the control) varies based on the average accuracy rating given to that headline by participants in the Accuracy condition of Study\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nControl Treatment\nL ik\ne ly\nt o S\nh a re\nCondition\nTrue\nFalse\n1.

Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to control the COVID-19, including the understanding of the public\u2019s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., knowledge, perceived severity and perceived controllability of the COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17\u201390 years, Mage=23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in an online survey. The results showed that the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding the COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables. Theoretically, the findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the public\u2019s emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern. Practically, the findings facilitate the government and practitioners to design and deliver targeted intervention programs to the public affected by the COVID-19.\nKeywords: COVID-19; cognitive appraisal; psychological health; social\nparticipation; precautionary behaviour.\nChinese public\u2019s knowledge, perceived severity, and perceived controllability of the COVID-19 and their associations with emotional and behavioural reactions,\nsocial participation, and precautionary behaviour: A national survey In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were\nreported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in central China. The pneumonia is later diagnosed to be caused by a novel coronavirus and named the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (Wu et al., 2020). Since then, the COVID-19 has outbroken from Hubei Province, particularly from Wuhan city, and spread across mainland China rapidly. Later, the COVID-19 has spread outside China as well, posing risks to countries beyond its origin. At the end of January 2020, The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 in China a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Scientific American, 2020). At the beginning of February 2020 right before the current survey commenced, the COVID-19 has caused thousands of diagnosed cases and hundreds of deaths. The Chinese government has been actively adopting a variety of measures to control the COVID-19, including implementing effective medical treatment, monitoring the progress of the COVID-19, issuing the facts and the precautionary measures of the COVID-19, and even controlling the mobility of the population within the city and between cities. However, citizens receive the information about the COVID-19 from various channels and may have different knowledge about the COVID-19. In addition, the numbers of suspicious and diagnosed cases and mortality are still increasing in most provinces, which may affect the public\u2019s estimation about the severity and controllability of the\nCOVID-19. All of these information could associate with the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural reactions towards the COVID-19 differentially.\nA timely understanding of the public\u2019s knowledge, perception of the COVID-19\nand their influence on individuals\u2019 emotion and behaviour is still lacking. Public\u2019s knowledge, perception, precautionary behaviour and active social participation have been found to be important in the control of epidemics, as learned regarding SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 (Bell, 2004; Dorfan & & Woody, 2011; Yang & Chu, 2018). Nevertheless, every public health concern issue occurs at different periods in different places and each country/region possesses different magnitudes of resources to reduce the detriment it brings. In this sense, there could be both commonalities and variations in the emotional and behavioural reactions caused by different events of public health concern. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural outcomes and their antecedents in the encounter of the COVID-19. Hopefully, the findings may deepen the understanding of the public\u2019s appraisal processes in the encounter of emergent public health concern and provide early evidence to relevant stakeholders, policy-makers, and practitioners to better develop and deliver tailor-made psychological aids to the public affected by the COVID-19. In sum, drawing upon the proposition that cognitive appraisal as a process of coping stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984a, 1984b), the present research aims to examine the public\u2019s knowledge, perceived severity, and perceived controllability of the COVID-19 and their associations with emotional and behavioural reactions.\nCognitive appraisal and emotion and behaviour\nStudies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have indicated that the\noutbreak of an unprecedented virus can cause immense stress to the public of different age, professionals, and regions (Chua et al., 2004; Lung, Lu, Chang, & Shu, 2009; Maunder, 2003; Yu, Ho, So, & Lo, 2005). Encounter of environmental stress may induce individuals to use different methods to cope with the stress and maintain their health and well-being. Cognitive appraisal, as a core process in coping stress, is supposed to closely associate with the immediate and long-term outcomes (Folkman, Lazarus, Dunkel-Schetter, DeLongis, & Gruen, 1986).\nCognitive appraisal is a process through which the person evaluates whether a\nparticular encounter with the environment is relevant to his or her well-being, and if so, in what ways (Folkman et al., 1986, p.992). It consists of two stages. Primary appraisal refers to a person\u2019s estimate of whether he or she has anything at stake in the encounter (Folkman et al., 1986). Encounters can be evaluated as irrelevant, benign-positive (beneficial) or stressful (Peacock & Wong, 1990). For instance, is the encounter potentially harmful or beneficial to a person\u2019s well-being or health? Assessment of a person\u2019s evaluation of what is at stake in the outcome of the encounter is a critical indicator of the primary appraisal, such as assessing how disturbing, threatening or challenging of the encounter is (Peacock & Wong, 1990; Tomaka & Blascovich, 1994). Secondary appraisal refers to a person\u2019s evaluation of what can be done to overcome or prevent harm or to increase the benefit and this process involves a complex assessment of a person\u2019s coping options (Folkman et al., 1986). Assessment of the extent to which the situation requiring more information and how controllable the situation is have been regarded as crucial indicators of the secondary appraisal (Peacock & Wong, 1990).\nPrior research has associated indicators of primary and secondary appraisals and\na wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes. For example, Peacock and Wong (1990) found that when individuals perceive an encounter to be more threatening, uncontrollable and stressful, they reported higher levels of psychological symptoms and dysphoric mood. Oliver and Brough (2002) revealed that perceived controllability were predictive of individuals\u2019 well-being. In another research, Gomes, Faria, and Lopes (2016) found that perceptions of threat, control, and challenge of stressful encounters were significantly related to mental health problems. Besides, cognitive appraisal has also been applied to the study of the public\u2019s emotion and behaviour during the outbreak of emergent public health concerns. For instance, in Dorfan and Woody\u2019s (2011) study, they measured individuals\u2019 appraisal of danger, germ spread and responsibility and associated them with a number of emotion and behaviour towards the outbreak and transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), including avoidance, disgust, anxiety, urge to wash, washing duration, and wipes taken. Their findings disclosed that appraisal of danger of SARS was significantly related to emotional and behavioural responses. Another research found that knowledge and perception of SARS were related to precautionary behaviour (Vartti et al., 2009). In addition, Yang and Chu (2018) found that perceived risk of virus was related to higher levels of negative emotion (i.e., fear, anxiety, disgust, and anger) about the outbreak of Ebola in the US public.\nThe current study\nDrawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study aims to understand the\npublic\u2019s perceived severity, knowledge and perceived controllability of the COVID-19\nand their associations with emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour. In this study, we consider the public\u2019s perceived severity as the primary appraisal, as it relates to an individual\u2019s evaluation of how likely their health and well-being is at stake in the encounter of the COVID-19, and we consider the public\u2019s knowledge and perceived controllability of the COVID-19 as secondary appraisal, as they reflect as the intellectual and mental resources to cope with the stress and disturbance caused by the COVID-19. In light of the findings reviewed above, these cognitive appraisals are supposed to be related to a number of emotional and behavioural responses. Since the numbers of diagnosed cases and the rate of mortality of the COVID-19 differ greatly among different regions in China, the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural responses, social participation, and precautionary behaviour could vary as well. To take this into account, we utilized multilevel modelling to control for the potential influence of the hierarchical structure of the data. We took into account a number of demographic variables as well to control for their potential effect on the outcomes.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants and procedure", "text": "A hierarchical random sampling was used to recruit participants from different\nregions in China. A total of 4826 Chinese visited the online survey between Feb-2 and Feb-9, 2020. We removed a number of participants because they met one or more of the following exclusion criteria: (1) participants were not willing to participate in the study; (2) participants indicated that they were under 16 years old, a cutting age that parent consent is optional; and (3) participants were inclined to respond to the items in a\nsimilar pattern (e.g., chose the same answer across multiple consecutive items or within the whole questionnaire). Finally, 4607 participants were included in the analyses. Participants\u2019 age ranged from 17 to 90 years old (Mean age = 23.71 years old, SD = 7.29). They were from 31 provinces / centrally-governed cities / autonomous regions / special administrative regions, with the sample size ranging from 16 (0.3% of the total sample, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) to 1386 (30.1% of the total sample, Guangdong Province). The sample covered a wide range of demographics. Detailed demographics are summarized in Table 1.\n[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]\nThe study was reviewed and approved by the XXX University. The whole study\nwas conducted online in compliance with the ethical standards for research outlined in the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (American Psychological Association, 2010). Over 200 investigators who majored in psychology voluntarily distrubited the online survey link on various internet platforms, including WeChat (the most popular APP for instant message in mainland China), Weibo, QQ, etc. By clicking the hyperlink, participants were directed to an online survey website. An information sheet stating the goal and the procedure of the study was presented to participants on the first page of the survey. If participants checked the \u201cI understood the study and am willing to participate\u201d box at the bottom of the information sheet, they entered the survey and answer the questionnaires. If participants were not willing to participate, they could check the \u201cI understood the study but am not willing to participate\u201d box and then the survey ended. Participation was voluntary and no incentive reward was given.\nAnonymity was emphasized and no identifiable information was collected. It took participants about 20 minutes to complete the survey. Measures\nEmotional and behavioural reactions. Participants\u2019 emotional and behavioural\nreactions were measured with 18 items. These items cover a number of dimensions, including negative emotion (6 items, anxiety, worry, depressive, panic, lonely, and nervous), positive emotion (3 items, happy, joy, and excited), sleep problems (4 items, insomnia, shallow sleep, have nightmares, and insufficient sleep), aggression (2 items, argue with others and physical fight with others), substance use (2 items, smoking and drinking), and mobile phone use (1 item). Participants were asked to compare the frequencies of the said aspects after the outbreak of the COVID-19 with the ones before the outbreak on a five-point scale (from \u201c1 = much less compared to the days before the outbreak\u201d to \u201c5 = much more compared to the days before the outbreak\u201d). To align with other dimensions, the items for positive emotion were reversely scored. A higher score indicates the COVID-19 causes more negative emotion, sleep problems, aggression, substance use, mobile phone use, and less positive emotion.\nSocial participation. The Social Participation Scale used in prior research\n(Kasser & Ryan, 1993) was adapted to measure participants\u2019 social participation regarding the COVID-19. Participants were asked to indicate how often they participated in different social events related to the COVID-19 since the outbreak of the COVID-19 on a five-point scale (from \u201c0 = never\u201d to \u201c4 = very often). A higher score indicates that participants more actively participated in the social events about the\nCOVID-19. A sample item is \u201cHow often do you help improve others\u2019 life quality since the outbreak of the COVID-19?\u201d\nPrecautionary behaviour. Participants\u2019 precautionary behaviour was measured\nwith 19 items written by authors following the precautionary guideline issued by the Chinese government. Participants were asked to indicate how often they show various precautionary behaviour since the outbreak of the COVID-19 on a five-point scale (from \u201c0 = never\u201d to \u201c4 = very often). A higher score indicates that participants display more precautionary behaviour. Sample items include avoiding travelling to regions affected by the COVID-19, wearing a facemask, regularly changing a facemask, and washing hands.\nKnowledge about the COVID-19. Participants\u2019 perceived knowing of various\naspects of the COVID-19 (e.g., cause, ways of transmission, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, etc.) was measured with 11 items. Participants indicated how much they know each item on a five-point scale (from \u201c1 = totally not know\u201d to \u201c5 = totally know\u201d). A higher score indicates participants perceived they know more about the COVID-19.\nPerceived severity. Participants\u2019 perceived severity about the COVID-19 was\nmeasured with 5 items. Participants indicated their perception of how severe is the infection rate, morbidity, mortality, the negative influence on social order and the negative influence on the economics on a five-point scale (from \u201c1 = not severe at all\u201d to \u201c5 = very much severe\u201d). A higher score indicates participants perceived the COVID19 more severe.\nPerceived controllability. Participants\u2019 estimation of how much can the various\naspects of the COVID-19 be controlled was measured with 9 items on a five-point scale\n(from \u201c1 = totally uncontrollable\u201d to \u201c5 = totally controllable\u201d). A higher score indicates participants estimated that the COVID-19 was more controllable. A sample item is \u201cHow controllable do you think the cause of the COVID-19 is?\u201d\nDemographic variables. We also collected a number of demographic variables\nof participants, including their biological sex (0 = male, 1 = female), age, education (1 = junior middle school or below, 2 = high school or equivalent, 3 = college, 4 = bachelor degree, 5 = master degree, 6 = doctoral degree), current residential location (referred to province and city/district), their relationship with the COVID-19 (1 = healthy, 2 = other, including suspicious case, diagnosed case, relatives or friends of suspicious/diagnosed case, etc.), the history of chronic physical diseases and psychiatric/psychological disorder (1 = yes, 2 = no), and their current physical health condition (from \u201c1 = very poor\u201d to \u201c5 = very good\u201d). Data analysis\nWe analysed the data in SPSS and Mplus 7.0 in several steps, with .05 as the\nsignificant level across all analyses. First, we performed the descriptive statistics to capture the centrality and the Cronbach\u2019s alpha of the variables. Second, we conducted correlation analysis to capture the association between participants\u2019 knowledge about the COVID-19, perceived severity, and perceived controllability and emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour. For the correlation analysis, we applied Cohen\u2019s (1992) standard to determine whether the correlation coefficients were substantial, with r = .01, .03, and .05 representing small, medium, and large effect size. Last, we carried out multi-level regression analysis to examine the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables,\ncontrolling for a number of demographic variables. We applied the multi-level model (MLM) to examine the path model because individual data (level-1) were nested in different provinces (level-2). A maximum likelihood (ML) approach was used as estimator. Since our main interest was to examine the association between the predictors and the outcome variables on level 1, we centred the predictors and the covariates using a centring within cluster approach (Enders & Tofighi, 2007). The values of RMSEA (< .08), CFI and TLI (> .90) indicate the model fit is acceptable (Bentler, 1990; Marsh, Hau, & Wen, 2004).\nResults"}, {"heading": "Descriptive statistics", "text": "As shown in Table 2, participants indicated that they had medium level of\nknowledge about the COVID-19 (3.56 out of 5). Moreover, participants perceived the COVID-19 to be highly severe (4.09 out of 5) and modestly controllable (3.25 out of 5). Regarding their emotional and behavioural reactions, the results showed that the COVID-19 did not change much of the frequency of participants\u2019 positive and negative feelings and a range of behaviour, with the mean score ranging from 2.61 to 3.77. In fact, participants indicated that the frequencies of sleep problem, aggression, and substance use after the outbreak were slightly lower compared to the ones before the outbreak of the COVID-19. As for social participation, participants appeared to not very actively participate in the social events regarding the COVID-19 (1.75 out of 4). However, participants reported that they displayed intensive precautionary behaviour to prevent the COVID-19 (3.33 out of 4).\n[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]\nAssociations between the variables of interest\nThe bivariate correlation coefficients of the association between the variables of\ninterest are summarized in Table 3. The results showed that participants\u2019 knowledge about the COVID-19 was positively related to social participation and precautionary behaviour. Participants\u2019 perceived severity was positively related to the increase in negative emotion and mobile phone use, decrease in positive emotion, and more precautionary behaviour. Although the associations between perceived severity and the changes in sleep problems and social participation were also significant, the effect sizes were too trivial to explain (i.e., r < .10). Finally, perceived controllability was negatively related to the increase in negative emotion and more social participation and precautionary behaviour. Although the associations between perceived controllability and the changes in positive emotion, sleep problems, and mobile phone use were also significant, the effect sizes were too small to explain (i.e., r < .10).\n[INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]\nThe associations of knowledge, perceived severity, and perceived controllability with emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour\nMultilevel regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations\nbetween the variables of interest. The model fit was good, \u03c72(28) = 275.04, RMSEA = .044, CFI = .976, TLI = .886. The values of intraclass correlation (ICC) ranged from .008 (sleep problem) to .032 (negative emotion). This suggests that little proportion of variance in the outcome variables is explained by the hierarchical structure in the model. Although the ICCs are not large, it is still necessary to take into\naccount the hierarchical structure of the data, as the individuals are nested in the provinces and hierarchical random sampling was utilized in the sampling procedure. The results of the unstandardized regression coefficients and standard errors are presented in Table 4.\nThe model explained 8.5% variance of the changes in negative emotion, with\n0.7% variance (p = .047) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that being female, having higher education, and perceiving the virus to be more severe and risky were positively related to the increase in negative emotion. In contrast, having better physical health condition and perceiving the virus to be controllable were negatively related to the increase in negative emotion.\nThe model explained 2.9% variance of the changes in positive emotion, with\n0.5% variance (p = .086) being explained by the between-level.. The results showed that being female, being older and perceiving the virus to be severe were positively related to the decrease in positive emotion. In contrast, having higher education and perceiving the virus to be controllable were negatively related to the decrease in positive emotion.\nThe model explained 3.0% variance of the changes in sleep problems, with 0.1%\nvariance (p = .164) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that having higher education and perceiving the virus to be more severe were positively related to the increase in sleep problems. In contrast, being without history of psychiatric/psychological disorder and having good physical health condition were negatively related to the increase in sleep problems.\nThe model explained 2.8% variance of the changes in aggression with 0%\nvariance (p = .711) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that\nhaving higher education was positively related to the increase in aggression. In contrast, being older and having good physical health condition were negatively related to the increase in aggression.\nThe model explained 1.7% variance of the changes in substance use with 0.1%\nvariance (p = .519) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that having higher education was positively related to the increase in substance use. In contrast, being female and having good physical health condition were negatively related to the increase in substance use.\nThe model explained 5.0% variance of the changes in mobile phone use with\n0.7% variance (p = .017) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that being female, having higher education and perceiving the virus to be more severe were positively related to the increase in mobile phone use. In contrast, being younger and having better physical health condition were negatively related to the increase in mobile phone use.\nThe model explained 7.5% variance of social participation with 1.1% variance\n(p = .033) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that being older, having better physical health condition, having higher education, perceiving the virus to be more severe, and having more knowledge about the virus were positively related to more social participation.\nThe model explained 19.3% variance of precautionary behaviour, with 1.2%\nvariance (p = .001) being explained by the between-level. The results showed that being female, having better physical health condition, having higher education, perceiving the virus to be more severe and controllable, and having more knowledge about the virus\nwere positively related to more precautionary behaviour. In contrast, being younger and being with history of chronic physical diseases were negatively related to precautionary behaviour.\n[INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]\nDiscussion\nThe public\u2019s emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour during the outbreak of the COVID-19\nA central goal of this research is to provide early evidence to the understanding\nof public\u2019s emotional and behavioural outcomes during the outbreak of the COVID-19. In this study, we examined three related outcomes, including the changes in the frequencies of the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural reactions towards the COVID-19, the public\u2019s participation in social events regarding the COVID-19, and the public\u2019s engagement in precautionary behaviour. Regarding the changes in the frequencies of the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural reactions, participants reported very slight changes in the frequencies of experiencing negative emotion, positive emotion and using mobile phone before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19, as the mean score of these dimensions were higher than 3 (coded as more or less the same before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19) but less than 4 (coded higher compared to the days before the outbreak). Interestingly, compared to the days before the outbreak of the COVID-19, the public reported slightly fewer sleep problem, aggression or substance use after the outbreak. These finding suggest that the outbreak of the COVID-19 does not necessarily bring intensive negative emotional or behavioural responses among the public; on the contrary, it may also bring slight benefit, such as less aggression, drinking and smoking,\nand sleeping problems. In addition, the low levels of social participation and the high levels of precautionary behaviour suggest that the public did not show too much interest in participating in social events about the COVID-19 but that they developed a good habit of behaviour that prevent the virus.\nThese reactions could be due to several reasons. First, they may be related to the\nmeasures the Chinese government has adopted since the outbreak in controlling the transmission of the COVID-19, including urging the public to maximally stay at home and reduce mobility, suspending most public facilities and venues that could be crowded (e.g., bars, cinema, restaurants, etc.), strengthening the monitoring of physical health whenever the citizen entering the public venue (e.g., supermarkets, ones\u2019 residential building), issuing precautionary guidance to maintain good mental and physical health, and strongly urging the public to keep personal hygiene. Such strong measures and the transparency of the media may increase the public\u2019s mental resource to maintain their mental and physical health, which thus restrains the increase of negative emotional and behavioural responses and increases healthy habits. However, staying at home for a long time could also increase the frequency of using mobile phone to maintain social connection, work from home, and reduce boredom. Second, the low levels of social participation could be because the government did not strongly require the public to do so and thus most participants just lived their lives and limited the extent to which they engaged in social events. Another reason might be because most of the participants in this study were students and they had limited capacity to actually contribute to the control of the COVID-19. Third, the timing when the COVID-19 outbroke might also matter. Actually, the outbreak of the COVID-19 was reported just\nright before the Chinese New Year holiday, a time for most citizens to get back home and gather around with family. This allows most citizens to stay with family and support each other; and strong social support is crucial resource to alleviate stress caused by natural disaster or induced by experimental manipulation and maintain physical and mental health (Guilaran, Terte, Kaniasty, & Stephens, 2018; Thorsteinsson & James, 1999). The role of cognitive appraisal in the emotional and behavioural reactions towards the outbreak of the COVID-19\nThree cognitive appraisals were examined. The results suggested that the public\nhad differential evaluation of these appraisals. These findings align with prior researches that reveal the differences in the levels of various cognitive appraisals in mental health and well-being domains (Dorfan & Woody, 2011; Folkman et al., 1986; Peacock & Wong, 1990; Vartti et al., 2009). Besides the differences in the mean levels, these appraisals were associated with the outcomes differentially. Among the three appraisals, perceived severity was the risk factor that most widely associated with emotional and behavioural problems while perceived controllability was the protective factor against the increase in emotional problems. However, knowledge about the COVID-19 was not related to any emotional and behavioural changes before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19. This may be because evaluation of severity is more closely about whether and how much an individual\u2019s health and well-being is at stake compared to the other two types of appraisals. This suggests that different cognitive appraisals are differentially related to emotional and behavioural outcomes, as found in\nprevious studies (e.g., Blanchard-Fields, Chen, & Norris, 1997; Harvey, Nathens, Bandiera, & LeBlanc, 2010; Peacock & Wong, 1990).\nMoreover, all the three appraisals were positively related to more social\nparticipation (except for perceived controllability) and precautionary behaviour. These findings are consistent with previous studies that cognitive appraisal (e.g., having more knowledge and perceived risk, threat and danger) were related to more precautionary behaviour during the outbreak of SARS (Brug, et al., 2004; Dorfan & Woody, 2011; Vartti et al., 2009). In addition, these findings suggest that although perceived severity of the COVID-19 is related to more emotional and behavioural problems, it paradoxically increases the public\u2019s social participation and precautionary behaviour --- --- actions that help control the epidemics (Bell, 2004). In this sense, perceived severity can be regarded as a double-edge sword, being both risk and asset, in the encounter of medical catastrophe. Implications\nThis study has several theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, the\nfindings deepen our understanding of the important role of cognitive appraisal in the emotional and behavioural outcomes during the outbreak of the COVID-19. Specifically, the findings contribute to the literature that some cognitive appraisals (e.g., know more information and perceived controllability of the event) may serve as protective factors for some emotional and behavioural outcomes. Moreover, some commonly believed risk factor such as perceived severity may actually entail beneficial effect to some extent, such as associating with more behaviour (e.g., social participation and precautionary behaviour) that help control the epidemic. Taken together, these findings\nhighlight the utility of cognitive appraisal in the explanation of the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural responses towards emergent public health concern.\nPractically, the findings bear several implications for policy-makers and\nfrontline practitioners. First, we identified some groups that are generally vulnerable to various emotional and behavioural problems, such as being female, having physical health problems concurrently, and having higher education level. Therefore, these groups may be in higher need of mental care. Second, the public\u2019s cognitive appraisals are related to different outcomes. This suggests that practitioners may address different emotional and behavioural problems by intervening with relevant cognitive appraisals. Third, policy-makers and governments should publicize scientific information about the virus to the public as thorough as possible, since this could enhance the public\u2019s motivation engaging in social events (i.e., social participation) and developing healthy behaviour (i.e., precautionary behaviour). Limitations\nThis study has several limitations we must acknowledge. First, this study relied\non self-report data and cross-sectional design, and thus common method bias could not be excluded. However, this is not without precedent when examining the public\u2019s emotion and behaviour during the outbreak of virus/disease (e.g., Dorfan & Woody, 2011; Vartti et al., 2009; Yang & Chu, 2018). As a preliminary study, the findings provide early understanding of the public\u2019s cognitive appraisals of the COVID-19 and their association with a number of emotional and behavioural outcomes. Nevertheless, future study may utilize more sophisticated design and multiple-informant to achieve even more robust results. Second, although hierarchical sampling method was used, the\nsample size varied greatly across different provinces. The unbalanced sample size may cause bias in the results, especially the estimation of the variance in the outcome variables at the between-level. It is desirable for future research to balance the sample size across clusters if condition permits. Third, females, participants with high education, and participants residing in Guangdong Province were over-representative in the sample, which makes the findings not entirely generalizable to other populations. Finally, it should be noted that the model explained only small amount of variance in many outcome variables, suggesting that relying on cognitive appraisal to understand the public\u2019s emotional and behavioural outcomes are not enough and future research should investigate other relevant predictors as well. Conclusions\nChina now is working with enormous efforts to control the COVID-19. To this\nend, intellectual input from multiple disciplines is required, including the understanding of the public\u2019s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. This study provides early evidence to this issue. Our results reveal that the public\u2019 emotional and behavioural problems before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 do not change too much. The public have limited participation in social events regarding the COVID-19 but they actively engage in precautionary behaviour. Moreover, the public\u2019s appraisals (i.e., knowledge, perceived severity and perceived controllability) of the COVID-19 are differentially related to their emotional and behavioural outcomes. We believe that these findings bear important theoretical and practical implications in understanding the public\u2019s emotion and behaviour during the encounter of emergent public health concerns.\nReference\nAmerican Psychological Association (2010).

Results show that older people estimate the risk of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. People especially worry about being infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and shops or restaurants. Coping strategies are highly problem-focused and most respondents listen to experts\u2019 advice and try to behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that measures to tackle COVID-19 will take time to be effective. Bulk buying and storing of food is mainly justified by a combination of convenience and a perceived need to be prepared for potential quarantine.\n1. Research question With regard to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, this study aims to understand how the German population are perceiving and coping with the situation. The main research questions are:\n1. How do people in Germany perceive the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARSCoV-2)? 2. How do people cope with the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) and the pandemic as such? 3. Are people changing their behavior with regard to the coronavirus disease \u2013 for example, are they storing food?\nThe survey therefore comprises three main sections as well as an investigation of the sociodemographic aspects of people\u2019s responses to the crisis:\na. Risk perception and fear b. Coping c. Emergency food preparedness\na) Risk perception\nThis section addresses two aspects of risk perception. Firstly, participants were asked about their perception of COVID-19 with regard to a cognitive and an affective dimension. While the first aspect asks respondents to give a personal rating of the likelihood of being affected by COVID-19, the second focuses on fear and general concerns. Secondly, based on the psychometric paradigm (Slovic 1987, Slovic, Fischhoff & Lichtenstein 2000) questions were asked that focus on the qualitative dimensions of the perception of COVID-19 such as perceived voluntariness, controllability, severity, and personal impact.\nIn detail, the questionnaire includes three questions asking respondents to rate the perceived likelihood of becoming infected by COVID-19 in future, seven questions designed to elicit information about their personal feelings of fear and insecurity, and 30 questions addressing several qualitative dimensions that can help to describe COVID-19 from a subjective point of view.\nb) Coping\nThis section is theoretically based on the revised, German-language version of the Ways of Coping Scale (Folkman & Lazarus 1988, Ferring & Filipp 1989), drawing attention to the question of how people cope with COVID-19 from a psychological perspective. The German version differs especially in its distinction between problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. In addition, concrete behaviors are part of the survey,1 with particular focus on tangible instances of behavior like washing and disinfecting hands.\nIn the questionnaire, 28 questions with regard to problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies for coping with the COVID-19 crisis are included as well as seven items concerning concrete behavior. Additionally four questions are focusing on trust in politics, authorities from the medical field and companies.\nc) Emergency food preparedness\nSeveral political and administrative strategies for dealing with COVID-19 in Germany focus on asking that people stay at home. As a consequence more and more people in Germany have started to buy greater quantities of certain foodstuffs. Although public authorities have repeatedly stressed that food supply chains are robust, people are continuing to hoard as the situation develops.\nIn the questionnaire, ten questions ask, for instance, about the number of days for which people have been storing food and their reasons for doing so.\n2. Method and sample A quantitative online survey was conducted using an online access panel. The data were collected from the 19th to the 23rd of March 20202 with support from an ISO-certified panel provider. The panel provider was responsible for the programming and the recruitment of respondents. All questions were mandatory. The survey was completed by 1300 adults (18 years or older) who, so far as they are aware, are not infected by COVID-19. The results are online-representative regarding gender, age and federal states distribution (see attachment). After data cleansing3, 1242 respondents remain in the data set. 49% are female, 51% are male; the age range of the sample is 18 to 74,4 and the average age is 46 years (SD=15 years). Every federal state (\u201cBundesland\u201d) is represented.5 38% of the respondents live in urban areas with more than 100,000 inhabitants, and 20% in rural areas with fewer than 5000 inhabitants. All others live in cities with 5000 to 100,000 people.\n1 These items come from a survey carried out by the Faculty of Medicine at the Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen (Teufel 2020).

Significant differences between women and men are shown in figure 2.\nWith regard to the age of the respondents, elderly people are significantly more worried than younger people. At the same time there are no significant age differences with respect to fear of being infected. In detail, only 8.5% of the 60 to 74 year old respondents are afraid of being infected by COVID-19 (answering either with \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d on the 5-point Likert Scale), while 67.4% of the same age group are worried about COVID-19 in general. This is surprising because, according to experts in epidemiology, the \u201cprobability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses\u201d (RKI 2020).\nAs fear often relates to specific places and times, we also asked how safe people feel in different places. Data (from respondents answering either with \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d on the 5-point Likert Scale) show that:\n- 94.6% of the respondents feel safe in their own homes, - 54.3% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes outdoors, - 38.4% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes in the private homes of others, - 8.3% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes in shops or restaurants, - 7.3% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes in public spaces or public transport.\nWith regard to the federal states of Germany it can be found that people in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania are more worried than those in other states, while people in Bayern, Hamburg, Berlin and SchleswigHolstein feel less frightened than those in other states. This is a surprising result for the first three, because these have the highest rates of infection per inhabitant across Germany (RKI 2020).\nb) Ways of coping\nStress theories that focus on coping with stressful life events have shown that many strategies can essentially be reduced to a problem-focused dimension and an emotion-focused dimension. Results from items of both dimensions are displayed in tables 3 and 4."}, {"heading": "Emotion-focused ways of coping M SD", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Problem-focused ways of coping M SD", "text": "In sum, problem-focused strategies in coping with COVID-19 are more widespread in the German population. Germans will follow experts\u2019 advice, think carefully about what to do, stick to it and try not do anything rash. The emotion-focused items draw attention to the timespan that is perceived to relate to the corona pandemic. Germans also tend to say that there is nothing to do but wait and will turn to work or other activities to distract themselves.\nAll 28 items were transferred onto the previously cited problem-focused coping scale (13 items, e.g. \u201cI refuse to believe what is happening\u201d, where the internal consistency is good: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1= .80) and emotion-focused coping scale (14 items, e.g. \u201cI listen to the experts and follow their advice\u201d, where the internal consistency is again good: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1= .79). With regard to these scales, problem-focused coping strategies were rated higher (M=3.1, SD=.57, N=1242) than emotion-focused strategies (M=2.6, SD=.63, N=1242) with regard to their relevance in dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. For emotionfocused coping a significant difference between women and men can be found (p < .001). Women (M=2.69, SD=.61, n=630) agree more often with emotion-focused strategies than men (M=2.52, SD=.65, n=612). The same applies for problem-focused strategies. Women (M=3.18, SD=.56, n=612) agree more often with problem-focused strategies than men (M=3.04, SD=.58, n=612). Regarding the age of respondents it was found that the older the respondents, the less likely are they to use emotion-focused coping strategies (r=.14, p < .01). No significant correlations could be found for problem-focused strategies and age."}, {"heading": "Behavioral dimension of coping", "text": "Alongside the items from the Ways of Coping Scale, questions addressing individual behavior by adults who have not been tested positive for COVID-19 were also included in the survey.6\nIn detail, from all respondents (who answered either with \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d on a 5-point Likert Scale, N=1242):\n- 87.2% wash or disinfect their hands more often than usual. - 87.2% avoid public places/events. - 85.2% are avoiding public transport (subway, tram, bus, train). - 78.0% avoid contact with risk groups (old people, people with previous illnesses). - 15.9% have bought larger quantities of hand disinfectant/soap, or intend to buy more in the near\nfuture. - 14.0% have bought larger amounts of staple foods (flour, sugar, pasta, rice, canned food) due to\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2), or will buy more in the near future. - 6.8% have bought large quantities of toilet paper and other hygiene items, or will buy more in the\nnear future.\nTrust in politics, authorities and companies\nCoping with macrosocial stressors often requires trust in politics and those who have to deal with COVID19 at the forefront. From all respondents who have not been tested positive for COVID-19 respondents (who answered either with \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d on a 5-point Likert Scale, N=1242), - 76.2% trust hospitals, emergency services and other aid organizations to do the right thing to protect\nthem. - 71.0% trust authorities and medical experts (e.g. Robert Koch Institute) to do the right thing to protect\nthem. - 64.8% trust companies e.g. in the field of food supply to do the right thing to protect them. - 54.5% trust politics (federal government, state parliaments) to do the right thing to protect them."}, {"heading": "6 Note: these were developed in a survey carried out by the Faculty of Medicine at the Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen", "text": "(Teufel 2020) and will be used for comparison with one another in further data analysis.\nWith regard to the responses elicited, it could be said that Germans are highly problem-focused in their ways of coping with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. They are strictly following experts\u2019 advice like washing hands and avoiding contact with risk groups, think before they act and try not to behave rashly. Trust is highest in experts from the medical field.\nc) Emergency food preparedness\nWith regard to their emergency food preparedness, respondents were asked to assess the number of days for which they have been storing food. Figure 5 shows that at least 50% of the German population stored food to last for 10 to 11 days. 10 days is the period recommended by the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance in Germany (BBK 2018), whereas 88% stored food for 2 to 3 days, which can be viewed as in line with the international standard length of time (Gerhold, Cortez Garcia & Guerrero Lara 2019). Previous studies have suggested that a mere third of the population typically store food for 10 to 11 days (Gerhold, Wahl & Dombrowsky 2019).\nRespondents were also asked whether they were buying more food supplies than usual due to COVID-19, to which 41.9% either partially, rather or strongly agreed.\nThese 41.9% of respondents (N=520) were asked to explain why they had bought more food supplies than usual (table 6). In detail, from all respondents who replied either with \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d on a 5- point Likert Scale:\n- 83.6% don\u2019t want to go shopping every day. - 63.1% would like to be taken care of if I have to be quarantined. - 48.5% always want to have a certain selection available. - 33.5% buy large quantities of special offers. - 24.5% deliberately stockpile in order to be prepared for this and other crises. - 19.8% are worried that soon nothing will be available. - 14.6% want to be flexible when they have visitors.\nIn sum, the results show that respondents\u2019 concerns about being in quarantine are a major justification for storing food. And the fact that more than 80% answered that they do not want to go shopping for food every day can also be interpreted in the light of the current crisis.\n3. Summary Older people estimate the risk of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. This can lead to political countermeasures such as social distancing being met with little acceptance and thus being less likely to be followed. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. People especially worry about being infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and shops or restaurants. Coping strategies are highly problem-focused and most of the respondents listen to experts\u2019 advice and try to behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that COVID-19 will take time to tackle. Storing food is mainly justified by recourse to a combination of convenience and a perception of the need to be prepared for possible quarantine.\nLiterature\nGerhold, L., Cortez Garcia, K. & Guerrero Lara, A.

An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politicallyrelevant variables. We discuss these data in relation to the potentially functional nature of fear in global health crises.\nKeywords: COVID-19; pandemic response; health anxiety; social distancing; hand hygiene;\npublic health\nIntroduction\nOriginating in December 2019 in the Hubei province of China, the coronavirus disease-\n2019 (COVID-19) has spread to most countries in the world. At the time of writing (March 28, 2020), estimates of the fatality rate differ across countries, and range from 0.3% in Singapore to 11% in Wuhan, China (Chen et al., 2020). However, a more recent analysis of the mortality rate in locations with early quarantine procedures (e.g., the Diamond Princess cruise ship) suggests that the true rate to be no more than 1% (Rajgor, Lee, Archuleta, Bagdasarian, & Quek, 2020). While the symptoms of COVID-19 mimic the conditions caused by other coronaviruses (e.g., coughing, fever, and fatigue; Wang et al., 2020), many infected individuals can appear asymptomatic (Holshue et al., 2020), and thus can unwittingly transmit the virus to others in their vicinity. This claim was supported through a comparison of confirmed case rates between South Korea (who adopted widespread public testing for COVID-19 in February 2020) and Italy (who tested only those with symptoms), with Backhaus (2020) reporting how, in South Korea, substantially higher rates of younger people (below the age of 30) tested positive for the virus in the absence of noticeable symptoms.\nAs demonstrated by the differences in testing practices mentioned above, countries\nacross the globe have taken different steps to contain and delay the spread of the virus within their borders, with differing degrees of success. China, for example, appeared to have halted the exponential increase of confirmed cases of the virus by limiting the freedom of citizens to move around their cities, provinces, and the country as a whole (Graham-Harrison & Kuo, 2020). The Italian government has implemented a similar strategy, placing much of the country into lockdown and preventing groups of people from congregating in public spaces. Other countries have been slower to respond with such drastic action. The United States, for example, waited more than two weeks after the first confirmed case within its borders to enact localized testing procedures (Baird, 2020). Elsewhere, the British government followed the instructions of its scientific advisors to delay the cancellation of mass gatherings and the closure of schools, instead favoring a policy that looked akin to pursuing herd immunity (whereby vulnerable groups are isolated, and healthier individuals are exposed to the virus to gain immunity at the population level; Fine, Eames, & Heymann, 2011).\nThe one common piece of advice across different countries is that those who display\nsymptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate from others for a period of 7-14 days, while\ndistancing\u2019 (World Health Organization, 2020). This means that everybody should be limiting non-essential social interactions, not travel unless absolutely necessary, and work from home wherever possible to slow the interpersonal transmission of the virus. However, this is being practiced inconsistently in the absence of government enforcement. In this paper, we explore some of the potential psychological triggers for this inconsistency in social distancing behavior.\nIn spite of us, at the time of writing, still only being in the early stage of the COVID-19\npandemic, a rapidly growing body of research into social responses to the virus, including how to encourage prosocial and virus-mitigating responses (e.g., social distancing, or the non-hoarding of food and household supplies, and good hand hygiene). For example, Everett, Colombatto, Chituc, Brady, and Crockett (2020) reported how communicating advice using deontological moral advice (i.e., in ways that invoke a sense of civic duty) has a modest effect on increasing a propensity to engage in behaviors that enhance a delay in the transmission of the virus (e.g., hand washing, avoiding large gatherings, and sharing government advice on preventing the spread of COVID-19). This sense of duty taps into themes of interpersonal empathy, with Oosterhoff and Palmer (2020) findings that American adolescents who demonstrated higher levels of subjective self-interest were more likely to hoard supplies and less likely to refrain from non-essential social interactions. Pfattheicher, Nickur, B\u00f6hm, Sassenrath, and Petersen (2020) reported how trait empathy for vulnerable members of the population encourages the reduction of physical social interactions, while inducing empathy maintains this behavior. Further, a rapid review of the evidence into compliance with quarantine advice during pandemics recently reported that appealing to altruistic motivations to comply with distancing instructions appears to maintain motivation to maintain social distance from others over an extended period of time (Brooks et al., 2020)\nWhile this raft of empirical work appears to be focused around persuading the\ncommunity to follow social distancing advice, there may also be intrinsic or individual difference reasons for following such isolating practices. Moral foundations theory (for a review, see Haidt & Joseph, 2004) asserts that individuals make social and political judgments based on their endorsement of propositions rooted in a finite set of intuitive moral domains. In the main, political liberals value making decisions on the basis of care/harm (i.e., protection of the vulnerable) and fairness/reciprocity (i.e., proportionality) principles, while political conservatives also value authority/respect, ingroup/loyalty, and purity/sanctity. There is a case to be made that these moral foundations may play a role in decisions to\nvulnerability among certain demographic groups (e.g., the elderly, pregnant, and chronically ill) has the potential to trigger the care/harm foundation. Further, the advice coming from governmental or scientifically authoritative sources may trigger instincts related to the authority foundation, while the infectious nature of the virus, by definition, is likely to trigger a behavioral response associated with pathogen avoidance via the disgust foundation. For these reasons, it is unlikely that \u2018political orientation\u2019 as a composite or self-identified variable would predict behavioral responses to COVID-19. However, specific moral foundations that are associated with positions across the ideological spectrum may differentially predict actions that mitigate the risk of the virus being spread.\nAccording to Ahorsu et al. (2020), one unique feature of pandemic viral infections is\nthe fear that they can instill across large swathes of the population. Fear is a negative emotion symptomized by extreme levels of emotive avoidance in relation to specific stimuli (Perin et al., 2015). It is associated with clinical phobias and social anxiety disorder (Krueger et al., 2018), and as such the potential for widespread public fear caused by pandemic viral infections could lead to significant levels of mental distress at the population level. This was implicated in a tweet published by Dr. David Murphy (president of the British Psychological Society) that highlighted fear and anxiety (operationalized as managing health anxiety and coping with worry about relatives) as targets for psychological input within the COVID-19 pandemic (Murphy, 2020). In spite of the documented negative well-being implications of fear and anxiety, these negative emotions do also motivate a range of behaviors that reduce the engagement in risky behaviors. For example, early levels of anxiety in children are associated with lower levels of alcohol use (Kaplow, Curran, Angold, & Costello, 2001) and cigarette and marijuana use (Colder et al., 2013). Further, pathological low levels of fear are widely associated with psychopathic personality traits (see Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009; Patrick & Drislane, 2015), and this has been related to various risk-taking for social and recreational purposes (Satchell, Bacon, Firth, & Corr, 2018). This is also consistent with emerging evidence that higher levels of so-called \u2018dark\u2019 personality traits (e.g., psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) are associated with a lack of engagement with health promoting behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic (Blagov, 2020). As such, the potential utility of a fear or anxiety response in the current context should be explored.\nSpecifically in relation to COVID-19, while perceiving the virus to be severe has been\nlinked with worse mental health outcomes (Li, Yang, Dou, & Cheung, 2020), feeling personally at risk of infection predicted a greater propensity to engage in hand washing and\nHagan, & Mobbs, 2020). Even among the aforementioned Li et al. (2020) research, subjectively-judged self-control attenuated the link between perceived COVID-19 severity and poorer mental health, suggesting that combining a sensible level of fear about the illness with messages related to personal agency could encourage safety-promoting behavior in the form of hand hygiene and social distancing. This claim is supported by Zettler, Schild, Lilleholt, & B\u00f6hm (2020), who reported that the HEXACO personality domain of emotionality (characterized by exaggerated levels of anxiety, fear, and emotional reactivity) was associated with a greater level of acceptance of government-mandated personal restrictions. Further, Kuper-Smith, Doppelhofer, Oganian, Rosenblau, and Korn (2020) found that community members in the USA, UK, and Germany consistently underestimated their likelihood of both becoming infected and transmitting COVID-19 in comparison to estimates about the \u2018average\u2019 member of the public (see also Raude et al., 2020). They also reported negative correlations between self-perceived likelihood of infecting others and engaging in hygiene-related behaviors (e.g., hand washing and social distancing), suggesting that increasing fears about contracting the virus might lead to less risky social behaviors.\nIn this study, we explored multiple predictors of engaging in virus-mitigating behaviors\nwithin the context of COVID-19. Specifically, we were interested in measuring concrete behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as they occur, and predicting these using established psychological constructs. Secondary to this, we explored whether fear of COVID19 and self-perceived likelihood of contracting the virus were associated with risk-mitigating behaviors. This is in response to an apparent mismatch between established psychopathological research into the potential utility and fear and anxiety in reducing risky behaviors, and the suggestion by Ahorsu et al. (2020) that fear might be considered a unidirectional precursor to psychopathological responses within the current context. Finally, we investigated the role of political ideology in changing behaviors in response to COVID19. In doing so, we acknowledged the partisan nature of some social attitudes toward the virus itself (Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang, & Rand, 2020) and governmental responses to the pandemic (see Pepinsky, 2020) while contemplating the potential for intuitive moral foundations to overcome these identity-based political differences."}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "To determine our target sample size, we conducted an a priori power analysis using\nG*Power (version 3.1.9.2).

For example, Funder and Ozer (2019) reviewed various summative analyses of the psychology and reported r = .20 as the typical effect size. Thus, we set a conservative type I and II error rate both to .05, and aimed to detect r = .20, concluding a target sample size of N \u2265 320.\nA total of 344 individuals clicked on the study link.

However, we used the same behaviors as on the initial YGBC measure: hand washing, changed travel, working from home, stockpiling food, stockpiling medicine, child and elder care, and social distancing.

We\nused two of the PROMIS-SF measures to examine recent (past seven days) emotional wellbeing. One measure used 8-items to quantify Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th edition; DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) depression symptoms (e.g., \u201cI felt worthless\u201d), and the other used 7-items to measure DSM anxiety symptoms (e.g., \u201cI felt worried\u201d). Participants rated each item on a five-point scale from \u201c1 - Never\u201d to \u201c5 - Always\u201d with higher scores indicative of higher levels of negative affect, and a greater autonomic arousal and experience of threat, respectively.\nMoral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-20; Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2008). The\nMFQ-20 consisted of 22 statements spanning five moral foundations (care/harm, fairness/reciprocity, authority/respect, ingroup/loyalty, purity/sanctity; four items per foundation) using two different response formats. The first section asked participants to rate the relevance of a particular domain when they make a moral decision (11 items; e.g., \u201cWhether or not someone acted unfairly\u201d; fairness foundation). The second section asked participants to rate their endorsement of a range of moral propositions (11 items; e.g., \u201cI am proud of my country\u2019s history\u201d; loyalty foundation). Two items on the MFQ-20 were fillers: \u201cWhether or not someone was good at math\u201d (section one) and \u201cIt is better to do good than to do bad\u201d (section two). These are designed to catch careless responding, and were not included in calculating foundation scores. Each statement was rated on a six-point scale (scored functionally from 0-5). In section one, anchor labels are \u20180 - Not at all relevant\u2019 to \u20185\nagree\u2019. Responses are averaged for each moral foundation, with higher scores being indicative of greater endorsement of each respective moral domain.\nWorld Health Organization: Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF; World\nHealth Organization, 2004). The WHOQOL-BREF measures how one feels about their quality of life and health through 26 items (e.g., \u201cHow satisfied are you with your ability to perform your daily living activities?\u201d). Participants are asked to rate their agreement with each statement on a five-point scale from \u201c1 - Very dissatisfied\u201d to \u201c5 - Very satisfied\u201d.

Critically, these relationships were generally positive, in that those participants who were more concerned about COVID-19 (as measured by the FCV-19S) were those who engaged more with public health compliant behaviors (e.g., regular hand washing, and social distancing). It is of interest that the measures of fear and anxiety symptoms were stronger predictors than moral and political orientation, all of which explained small to no variance, potentially suggesting more emotional (rather than sociopolitical) influences on compliant behavior. There was also no notable decline in quality of life in relation to behavior change. However, fear of COVID-19 was related to decreased physical and environmental wellbeing. Overall, these results suggest that \u2018fear\u2019 and anxiety at the current time has a functional role, and is related to increased compliance for improving public wellbeing."}, {"heading": "Implications of Results", "text": "The data that we have presented above lead to a number of important implications, not\nonly for the ways in which we understand behavioral responses to pandemics, but also for how we conceptualize the utility of negative emotions, which may not necessarily always be reflective of psychopathology, and the political context within which such behaviors take place. We now consider these two broad implications in turn.\nFunctional \u2018fear\u2019. In the development of the FCV-19S the authors rightly state that\n\u201c[w]ith high levels of fear, individuals may not think clearly and rationally when reacting to COVID-19\" (Ahorsu et al., 2020, p. 2). This is true for the pure emotion of fear, which represents the reactive removal of oneself from a position of immediate risk. However, many of the items in the FCV-19S scale are pertinent to anxiety, a preparatory reaction to ambiguous or distant stimuli. Beyond the conceptual similarity in the wording of items, our analysis revealed a strong relationship between the FCV-19S and DSM-based measures of anxiety. This is important as fear and anxiety are behaviorally and neuroendocrinologically distinct responses (McNaughton & Corr, 2008), with anxiety potentially having a functional preparative role to encounter future negative stimuli consistent with the data we have presented here. Indeed, as has been described in detail previously (for a review, see Perkins & Corr, 2014), negative emotions, broadly, may have evolved to serve more adaptive and protective functions and may, in certain contexts, help to keep us safe. In the current context, this appears to be the case with negative emotions being protective (i.e., encouraging of\nthe current study suggest that negative emotions in response to the current pandemic predict adaptive public health compliant behavior change (e.g., hand washing, social distancing).\nThese findings, situated within the aforementioned larger literature pertaining to the\noftentimes adaptive nature of the experience of negative emotions, raise serious concerns with efforts to identify \u2018mental health issues\u2019 associated with strong emotional responses, which, for the majority of individuals, are both normative and protective. That is, for most individuals, the anxious responses being assessed by the FCV-19 may represent a normal and adaptive response to a real and present danger, that one cannot fight or flee from, within the environment (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). Those working in the mental health field should be sensitive to the context in which behaviors emerge, especially when these behaviors exist in a culture of preparedness for coping with the new cultural and governmental demands that may be critical for personal and family survival.\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important for mental health professionals to be\nattentive to the needs of individuals for whom highly emotional responses to the current pandemic, coupled with pre-existing risk factors (e.g., those with a history of mental illness), may result in pathological levels of negative emotions and related behaviors. Indeed, increased and prolonged exposure to a community crisis, like the pandemic we are currently experiencing, has been found to result in increased maladaptive levels of anxiety leading to unnecessary behaviors associated with increased levels of impairments within individuals as well as overburdening of community resources (Garfin et al., 2020). Overall, we believe that mental health professionals have an important role to play in supporting the wellbeing of the public in this current time. However, it is not clear how this work is supported by the classification of rational concerns about a pandemic and the labelling of functional \u2018fear\u2019 as a psychological issue.\nPolitically-driven responses to the pandemic. In spite of recent reviews of the\npolitical psychological literature advocating for the presence of behavioral asymmetries between ideological groups (see e.g., Jost, 2017), we found no such evidence in our data. This is perhaps surprising given recent coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reports about how attitudinal and behavioral responses to the virus were inherently partisan in nature (Pepinsky, 2020).\nIn this previously-reported work, US-based Democrats were more likely than\nRepublicans to engage in health-promoting behaviors (e.g., regular hand-washing, social\nresponses to the pandemic (e.g., that inadequate testing was available, or that more money should be made available to tackle the virus). An obvious difference in our data is the political context - slightly less than 80% of our sample were British, rather than American. However, it could be that this work reflects the stage of the pandemic in which the partisan data were collected. At the time of writing, the US is in an earlier phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a manner consistent with a social-intuitionist account of political and moral decision-making (Haidt, 2001), it is therefore plausible that initial (and perhaps intuitive) judgments of the pandemic in the US context were guided by President Trump\u2019s initial rejection of COVID-19 as a serious and unique public health concern (Trump, 2020). These initial intuitions then led to asymmetrical responses between partisans in Pepinsky\u2019s (2020) work: ambivalence and inaction among Republicans, and concern and derision of the response among Democrats. However, in the UK (where the majority of our participants were based) the pandemic is at a slightly more advanced stage, meaning that the seriousness of the situation is clearer. We argue that the lack of any significant political orientation or moral foundations effects on behavior change is a positive point from a social perspective, and suggests that, in times of (inter)national crisis, people can forgo their ideological commitments and behave consistently with governmental advice in pursuit of a common public health good."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "The results of this study are not without limitation. First, the data presented here are\nentirely self-reported and so may be subject to response biases. Specifically, virus-mitigating behavior changes such as increased hand washing, working from home, and social distancing are all targets of governmental strategy to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 and reduce the spread of the virus (e.g., Public Health England, 2020). As such, it may be expected that this constellation of behavioral changes will be reported to a greater degree as a function of a reluctance to deviate from this normative social shift. The collection of \u2018other-reported\u2019 data on the participants would help to mitigate this limitation. Second, while our regression models have utility for informing how public health behavioral compliance can be predicted from an individual differences perspective, it lacks the identification and understanding of any potential barriers to bringing about said change. It is here where experimental studies emerging about the response to COVID-19 (e.g., Everett et al., 2020) can be supplemented by correlational data such as ours in order to bring about a more comprehensive view of public\nthat data has been collected at a single time point within an unprecedented period of time. Therefore, not only do results of this investigating warrant replication, but future investigations should consider any potential variation in governmental guidance, policy, or social perception pertaining to COVID-19 in their discussion and interpretation of results."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper has presented cross-sectional data demonstrating, in real time, predictors of\nbehavior change in response to a global viral pandemic. We have shown how \u2018fear\u2019 may be a normal and, crucially, functional response within this context. That is, scores on the recently developed FCV-19S (Ahorsu et al., 2020), which specifically measures \u2018fear\u2019 toward the new virus, consistently predicted engaging in culturally and governmentally recommended public health behaviors (e.g., improved hand hygiene and social distancing). In light of this, we argue that researchers and mental health professionals would be mindful to consider the context within which negative emotional states are experienced before considering whether such emotional states are necessarily pathological.\nFurther, and in spite of the increasingly polarized nature of our political landscape, we\nfound that politically relevant outcomes (i.e., self-identified orientation, and the endorsement of moral foundations; Graham et al., 2008) were unrelated to behavior change. These nonsignificant effects highlight how universal polarization in social responses between political groups is not inevitable, and that there are some issues that unite us, rather than divide. Just as other (inter)national crises have previously brought people together (e.g., Willer, 2004), it seems that the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to do the same, and bring people of opposing political positions together in a sense of common humanity.\nAhorsu, D.

At the time of writing this paper (March 30, 2020), COVID-19 has infected over 740,235 people and claimed 35,035 lives world-wide (1) and\ncontinues to threaten the health and well-being of humanity. It has also created a global 5\neconomic crisis, which will likely culminate in a global recession. On an individual economic level, people are losing their jobs, losing their savings (if any were had to begin with), and thus finding it increasingly difficult to pay their bills. Meanwhile, public health officials are imploring people to engage in social distancing to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d (i.e., reduce the rate of COVID 19\ncases over time), resulting in the physical separation of people who could otherwise provide 10\nsocial support whilst they try to contend with the fallout from this highly contagious virus\u2014one that can be spread quickly by those who are visibly ill, but also by people who are asymptomatic. With a vaccine many months if not a year and a half away, and the outbreak growing exponentially, it is natural for many people to feel they are under existential threat. They are not\nwrong to feel this way. The greatest death toll humanity has experienced stems from infectious 15\ndiseases; the Black Death was responsible for the loss of approximately 25% of the European population (2).\nThinking about existential threat creates anxiety (3-6). This anxiety can take several\ndifferent forms. For instance, people may experience acute symptoms of anxiety. Among other\nsymptoms, people experience difficulty breathing, heart racing, and lightheadedness. They may 20\nalso experience concern about their own survival and corresponding feelings of nervousness and fear (e.g., fear of dying). Moreover, they may come to feel concerned about the possible demise of a cherished group to which they belong (e.g., a fitness studio club), the future vitality of their\n8), can activate similar neural processes that underlie anxious states (9). Although anxiety (about COVID-19) may take different forms, we contend that they reflect a common underlying process of anxious arousal.\nOf public health import, anxious arousal motivates people to engage in action they deem 5\ncapable of eliminating the existential threat and the anxiety it induces (3, 4). This may manifest in pro-social protective behaviors (e.g., motivation to self-isolate), but may also manifest in prejudicial attitudes toward a perceived source of the existential threat (7, 8, 10). In the case of COVID-19, this is particularly relevant given President Trump\u2019s framing of the virus as the\n\u201cChinese virus\u201d\u2014a situation which may heighten blatant prejudice toward Chinese people. 10\nThus, in the current research, we tested the hypothesis that perceiving COVID-19 as an\nexistential threat promotes blatant prejudice towards Chinese people via greater anxious arousal, as reflected by self-reported levels of acute anxiety symptoms, feelings of state anxiety, and collective angst. We tested this hypothesis in a community sample of Americans on February 27,\n2020, prior to the COVID-19 outbreak being declared a national emergency in the United States 15\nand when the epicenters of the COVID-19 outbreak were in China and Europe (i.e., only a few presumptive cases were reported in the United States).\nTo determine whether people\u2019s perception of COVID-19 as an existential threat plays a\ncausal role in elevating anxious arousal and blatant prejudice, we randomly assigned 474\nAmericans (250 men and 224 women) to read one of two news articles about the threat of 20\nCOVID-19 to the United States. In the high threat condition (see Fig. S1A) they read that Chinese travel to the United States will increase and bring the coronavirus with them, which would severely harm the health and well-being of Americans. Additionally, they read that the\nIn the low threat condition (see Fig. S1B) participants read that Chinese travel to the United States is declining, which will slow the spread of the coronavirus to Americans. They also read that the United States can contain the coronavirus, and thus will cause little or no damage to the\nhealth and well-being of Americans. 5\nParticipants in the threat condition (n=241) reported a higher likelihood that the\nprevalence of COVID-19 will increase in the near future (M=7.88, SD=2.49) than those in the control condition (n=231; M=6.95, SD=2.94), t(470 )=3.70, p<.001, d=.34. Those in the threat condition also reported greater harm to the US from COVID-19 (M=6.78, SD=2.52) than those in\nthe control condition (M=6.19, SD=2.83), t(469)=2.42, p=.02, d=.22. However, participants in 10\nthe threat (M = 6.96, SD = 2.55) and control (M=7.30, SD=2.62) conditions did not differ in terms of their confidence in the ability of the US to control the spread of COVID-19 in the US, t(470)=1.43, p=.15. Thus, the threat manipulation was successful in terms of increasing the perceived likelihood of COVID-19 in the US and that the presence of COVID-19 would severely\nharm the US population. 15\nFollowing the threat manipulation, all participants completed questionnaires that\nmeasured acute anxiety symptoms (11; e.g., \u201cnumbness or tingling,\u201d \u201cHeart pounding/racing,\u201d and \u201cfear of dying\u201d), feelings of state anxiety (12; e.g., worried, tense), and collective angst for America\u2019s future (7, 13; e.g., \u201cI feel anxious about the future of the United States\u201d). Participants\ncompleted these questionnaires in reference to the news article they read. Participants responses 20\nto these measures were standardized (i.e., z-scored) and averaged to produce a composite measure of anxious arousal. They then completed a measure of blatant prejudice towards\nwell off as Americans\u201d).\nDescriptive statistics and correlations are reported in Table S1. Americans who read\nabout COVID-19 being an existential threat reported greater anxious arousal than did those who\nread about COVID-19 not becoming a domestic issue, b = .33, p < .001. This greater anxious 5\narousal, in turn, predicted more blatant prejudice toward Chinese people, b = .93, p <.001. Moreover, the indirect effect of the threat manipulation on blatant prejudice towards Chinese people via greater anxious arousal was statistically significant, indirect effect = .31, 95% confidence interval [.18, .46] (see Fig. 1). Thus, in line with our hypothesis, Americans who\nperceived COVID-19 as an existential threat reported more blatant prejudice towards Chinese 10\npeople through increased anxious arousal.\nResults reported herein are consistent with prior research that found perceived threat of a\nviral illness pandemic to be positively associated with worry and feelings of anxiety (e.g., 16- 18). However, the extant research has been correlational in nature, thus undermining any causal\ninferences. In the current research, we showed that framing COVID-19 as an existential threat 15\nelicited anxious arousal expressed through acute anxiety symptoms, feelings of state anxiety, and collective angst. Thus, when COVID-19 is perceived as an existential threat it can place people at risk for developing distress and possibly anxiety disorders. The reason is that one of the three pathways to fear and anxiety disorders involves the transmission of information about threats to\nsurvival (19). These findings are in line with research showing that greater exposure to media 20\ncontent about terrorist threat (20) or a virus outbreak (21) is associated with greater distress and elevated symptoms of acute anxiety. Of note, some symptoms of acute anxiety mimic many of the symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., difficulty breathing).\nare deemed capable of reducing or eliminating the existential threat (see 3, 4, 8). In the current research, we showed one outcome of COVID-19 related anxious arousal is blatant prejudice against Chinese people. This may have both short- and long-term negative consequences for\nsocial capital (i.e., the networks of relationships among people who live and work in a particular 5\nsociety; 22), which can further degrade people\u2019s health and well-being (23). One way to help mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 based prejudice is to disseminate information to the general public about how and why people should feel less personally vulnerable to infection should they come into contact with Chinese people or their compatriots of Asian\ndescent (8). 10\nAt the time the research was conducted (February 27 2020), the epicenters of the\nCOVID-19 outbreak were in China and Europe and so there were few government initiatives to promote hygiene practices, social distancing, and testing to help \u201cflatten the curve\u201d in the US. At the time of submission to Science, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak has shifted to the US\nand the US has been slow to implement strategies to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d (e.g., closing schools and 15\nnon-essential businesses). We only tested a negative outcome of anxious arousal (i.e., prejudice). Anxious arousal stemming from COVID-19 threat may also motivate people to engage in constructive action that helps \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. People may start washing their hands with soap and water, engage in social distancing, and aid community members at the greatest risk (e.g., the\nelderly, people with immunodeficiencies). Likewise, anxious arousal stemming from perceiving 20\nCOVID-19 as an existential threat may help explain panic purchasing and stockpiling of products (e.g., toilet paper, medicine) that may result in shortages for those in need of those products. It may also result in unnecessary strain on the medical system as these individuals\nto go to medical facilities for the test. To be clear, we are not implying that people who feel existential threat due to the COVID-19 threat are negative for the virus (i.e., their symptoms are merely a manifestation of the anxiety they are experiencing). Instead, the results of the current\nresearch suggest that a possible explanation for why many people are getting tested 5\nunnecessarily (24). We call on researchers to examine how to best help people experiencing anxiety and distress due to the COVID-19 threat to help ease the burden on the world\u2019s health care systems.\nTo help mitigate the risk of distress and anxiety disorders among the general public (who\nare for the most part in lockdown during the COVID-19 crisis), it would behoove governments 10\nand broadcasters (e.g., mass media) to share information on ways to help people cope more effectively with the distress stemming from the threat of COVID-19. This information can include how to structure daily activities so that people can better meet their health needs (e.g., planned exercise sessions and adequate sleep), the needs of their family (e.g., schooling children,\ncaring for elderly family members), and work-related needs. Other information can include 15\naccess to freely available virtual or telephone resources that support mental health, such as online counseling and call centers to help with distress.\n1.

They responded to a recruitment notice for a survey titled \u201cAmerican\u2019s Opinion about China\u201d and received US $0.75 for their time. Data from 218 participants were excluded because they did not complete any of the questionnaires (n = 78),\nfailed a comprehension check (n = 66), did not complete one or more of the post-manipulation 10\nquestionnaires (n = 37), were of Asian background (n = 31), had excessive missing data (n = 4), or did not consent to the use of their data (n = 2). Thus, the final sample consisted of 474 participants (250 men and 224 women) who ranged in age from 19 to 76 (M = 37.32, SD = 11.33).\nProcedure and materials 15\nUpon granting consent, participants completed demographic items (i.e., age and sex) and\nsome questionnaires not examined in the current research (a measure of social identification with Americans and a measure of the tendency to ruminate on the threat posed by COVID-19 to the United States). Participants were then randomly assigned to read one of two news articles about\nthe threat of COVID-19 to the United States. In the high threat condition (see Fig. 1A), 20\nparticipants read that Chinese travel to the United States will increase and bring the coronavirus with them, which would severely harm the American people and cause great damage to the health and well-being of Americans. Lastly, the news article indicated that the United States has\ncondition (see Fig. 1B), participants read that Chinese travel to the United States is on the decline and the reduced influx of Chinese visitors will curtail the coronavirus from spreading in America. They also read that the United States can quickly contain the coronavirus and thus will\ncause little or no damage to the health and well-being of Americans. Lastly, the news article 5\nindicated that the United States has been successful at stopping the coronavirus from becoming a domestic issue.\nAfter reading the news article, participants completed a comprehension check item (\u201cin a\nfew words, please tell us what the article you just read was about\u201d) followed by three\nmanipulation check items that assessed harm probability (\u201chow likely you think that the 10\nprevalence of the Coronavirus in the US will increase in the near future\u201d), harm severity (\u201chow harmful you think that the Coronavirus will be for the United States\u201d), and collective efficacy (\u201chow confident you are in the ability of the United States to control the Coronavirus in the United States\u201d). Participants responded to these items using a 10-point scale with endpoints 0\n(not at all) and 9 (highly likely). They then completed several questionnaires of which the 15\nfollowing were examined in the current research:\nAcute anxiety symptoms. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck, Epstein, Brown, &\nSteer, 1988) was used to assess symptoms of acute anxiety. The BAI assesses the extent to which people experience 21 symptoms of acute anxiety in the past month (e.g., \u201cnumbness or tingling,\u201d\n\u201cHeart pounding/racing,\u201d and \u201cfear of dying\u201d). We modified the instructions of the BAI so that 20\nparticipants responses reflected anxiety symptoms they are currently experiencing as a result of reading the content of the article. We also modified the response scale participants used such that\naverage score was calculated based on responses to the 21 items (\u03b1 = .99).\nState anxiety. Participants completed the short-form of the State Scale from the\nSpielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Marteau & Bekker, 1992). They were instructed to\nreport the extent to which they felt clam (reverse-coded), tense, upset, relaxed (reverse-coded), 5\ncontent (reverse-coded), and worried as a result of reading the content of the article. Participants responded using a 7-point scale anchored at 1 (not at all) and 7 (extremely). Items were averaged such that higher scores indicated greater state anxiety (\u03b1 = .65).\nCollective angst. Participants completed a five-item scale that measured their level of\ncollective angst for America (adapted from Wohl, & Branscombe, 2009). These items were: \u201cI 10\nfeel anxious about the future of the United States\u201d, \u201cI feel confident that the United States will survive\u201d (reverse coded), \u201cI feel secure about the future of the United States\u201d (reverse coded), \u201cI feel that the United States will always thrive\u201d (reverse coded), and \u201cI feel concerned that the future vitality of the United States\u201d. Participants responded to each item using a response scale\nwith endpoints 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree). Responses were coded and averaged 15\nsuch that higher scores reflect greater collective angst (\u03b1 = .74).\nBlatant prejudice. Participants completed a 10-item measure of subtle (e.g., \u201cChinese\npeople differ from Americans in their beliefs and rituals\u201d) and blatant (e.g., \u201cChinese people are a less abled race, which is why they are not as well off as Americans\u201d) prejudice towards\nChinese people adapted from adapted from Pettigrew and Meertens (1995) and Ungaretti, 20\nEtchezahar, and Barreiro (2018). Responses were anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree). The blatant prejudice subscale was analyzed in the current research. Items were averaged such that higher scores reflect greater blatant prejudice (\u03b1 = .92).\nA mediation model was estimated in which condition (0=low threat, 1=high threat) was\nthe independent variable, anxious arousal was the mediator variable, and blatant prejudice was the dependent variable. The mediator was calculated as an average score of the standardized (z-\nscore) versions of BAI, state anxiety, and collective angst average scores. Mplus version 8.2 5\n(Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017) was used to conduct the analysis with maximum likelihood estimation. The statistical significance of the indirect effect was evaluated using the 95% biascorrected bootstrapped confidence interval based on 5000 resamples.\n10\nTable S1.

Findings: In this survey study of adolescents (N = 770), attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest were associated with news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting behaviors. Teens who reported greater severity of COVID-19, less social responsibility and social trust, and valuing their own self-interest over others also reported more hoarding. Meaning: Emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemicrelated behaviors may be important for teens in the United States.\nAbstract\nImportance: As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, it is critical to understand the psychological factors that influence pandemic-related behaviors (i.e., news monitoring, social distancing, hygiene/disinfecting, hoarding). This may be especially important to study among youth, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological correlates of adolescents\u2019 behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Self-report survey conducted between March 20th and March 22nd, 2020. Setting: This is an online survey study of youth from the United States. Participants: A population-based sample of adolescents were recruited via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Youth were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were between the ages of 13 and 18. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors over the 7 days after the US declared a national emergency. The correlates measured were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, values related to social responsibility, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, along with greater social responsibility and social trust, would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The final analytic sample included 770 adolescents (Mage = 16.34, 72% female). The majority of teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (70%), but were monitoring the news (75%) and engaging in at least one disinfecting behavior multiple times per day (88%). Some teens reported engaging in hoarding behavior (19%). Greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing, disinfecting, and news monitoring, but also more hoarding. Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting and news monitoring, and less hoarding. Participants who reported valuing their own self-interest over others reported less social distancing and more hoarding. Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding. Conclusions and Relevance: Emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following recommended preventative health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.\nPsychological Correlates of News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding\nBehaviors among US Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe novel corona virus (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 20201 and a\nUS national emergency on March 13, 2020. As of March 22nd, there were over 290,000 confirmed cases worldwide2, and over 15,000 confirmed cases in the United States3. Current\nglobal efforts are largely focused on slowing the spread and social impact of the virus, which\nrelies on the compliance of individuals with social distancing and proper hygiene recommendations4. Similarly, engagement in antisocial behaviors such as hoarding may result in\nbroader social and medical impacts of the pandemic by limiting the availability of personal\nprotective equipment for medical providers and by contributing to shortages of food and other\nnecessities within communities. As COVID-19 continues to spread and overload the medical\nsystems in the United States and in countries around the world, it is critical to understand the\npsychological factors that influence pandemic-related preventative behaviors (i.e., monitoring the\nnews for updates, social distancing, and hygiene/disinfecting), along with antisocial behaviors\n(i.e., hoarding supplies).\nWe examined psychological correlates of news monitoring, social distancing,\ndisinfecting, and hoarding behaviors among a large sample of US adolescents. Adolescence is a\ndevelopmental period characterized by expanding autonomy and greater salience of peer relationships5, which may contribute to prioritization of peer social interactions over the current\nsocial distancing recommendations. Further, pediatric patients appear to experience less severe symptoms or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 compared to adults6; thus, adolescents may be\nmore likely to engage in behaviors that contribute to the spread of the infection (lack of\ndistancing and hygiene behaviors) and may be less likely to monitor emerging news stories about\nthe virus.\nSeveral psychological factors likely contribute to variation in the way youth are\nresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, attitudes about the severity of COVID-19,\nincluding beliefs that COVID-19 is similar to influenza, likely vary and may further predict\npreventative behaviors (or lack thereof). Others have recognized the importance of community\nattachments\u2014including greater social responsibility values, social trust, and prioritizing others over the self\u2014for engagement in prosocial behavior and avoidance of antisocial behavior7,8. As\nCOVID-19 symptoms appear less severe among pediatric patients, efforts to contain the virus\nmay motivated by community\u2014rather than person\u2014motives. Thus, we propose that attitudes\ntowards the severity of COVID-19 and community attachment values will be especially relevant\nfor adolescents\u2019 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors given\nthat COVID-19 poses a lower personal threat to teenagers and larger threat to others.\nMethods"}, {"heading": "Participants and Procedures", "text": "The initial survey was completed by 789 adolescents residing in the United States and\nbetween the ages of 13-18 years (M = 16.34, SD = 1.15). The sample was primarily 10th\n(19.8%), 11th (30.7%), or 12th (31.4%) graders with fewer 9th (13.6%) graders and college\nstudents (3.9%). The sample was composed of slightly more females (72.0%) than males\n(22.2%) with 4.9% identifying as non-binary. The sample was primarily White/Caucasian\n(72.5%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (15.2%), African American/Black (5.6%), Asian\nAmerican/Pacific Islander (10.1%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (3.2%), or other (3.0%). As\na proxy for family financial strain (Galinsky, 1999), youth were asked whether their families\nhad: enough money to buy almost anything they wanted (7.0%), no problem buying the things\nthey need and can also sometimes buy special things (53.3%), just enough money for the things\nthey need (31.8%), or a hard time buying the things they need (7.9%). A small number of\nparticipants indicated that they were unaware of COVID-19 (n = 10) or that their school had not\nyet closed and thus strict social distancing was not possible (n = 9). These participants were\nremoved from analyses, resulting in the final analytic sample of 770.\nData was collected from 8:00AM on March 20th through 5:00PM on March 22nd of 2020.\nThis study was advertised on various social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,\nReddit) and participants self-selected into the study and completed a 10-minute survey. This\nstudy involved no more than minimal risk and thus, passive parental permission was used.

Social distancing was measured using 5-items (\u03b1 = .70) developed\nfor the purpose of this study. Youth indicated the frequency at which they spent time in person\nwith friends, extended family, teachers and neighbors, and any other person who does not live\nwith them in the past 7 days on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very often). Items were\nreverse coded, and mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating greater social\ndistancing.\nDisinfecting Behaviors. Disinfecting behaviors were measured with 4-items (\u03b1 = .64)\ndeveloped for the purpose of this study. Youth indicated the frequency at which they used hand\nsanitizer, washed their hands, cleaned their phones, and used disinfecting wipes in the past 7\ndays on a 6-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 6 (multiple times a day). Mean scores were\ncalculated with higher values indicating greater disinfecting behavior.\nHoarding Behaviors. Hoarding behaviors were assessed with a single item that asked\nyouth how often they have hoarded supplies from a grocery store or department store in the past\n7 days. Responses were given on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very often), with higher\nvalues indicating more hoarding behaviors.\nCOVID-19 News Monitoring. News monitoring was measured with a single item in\nwhich youth rated the extent to which they have followed news coverage of COVID-19 on a 5-\npoint scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). Higher values indicate greater COVID-19 news\nmonitoring.\nAttitudes about COVID-19 Severity. Attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 were\nmeasured with 4-items (\u03b1 = .80) in which youth rated their agreement with statements de-\nemphasizing the severity of the virus (e.g., \u201cThe Coronavirus is just \u2018the flu\u2019\u201d). Responses were\ngiven on a 7-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Response were reverse-\ncoded and mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating beliefs that COVID-19 is\nsevere.\nSocial Responsibility Values. Social responsibility values were measured with 3-items\n(\u03b1 = .83) in which youth rated how important it is to consider the needs of other people, make\nsure that all people are treated fairly, and think about how their actions affect people in the\nfuture9. Responses ranged from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important). Mean values\nwere calculated so that higher values indicated more social responsibility.\nSocial Trust. Social trust was measured with 3-items (\u03b1 = .82) taken from past research9\n(e.g., \u201cMost people can be trusted.\u201d). Responses were given on a 7-point scale from 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating higher\nsocial trust.\nSelf-Interest Values. Self-interest values were measured with 2-items (r = .30) in which\nyouth rated how important it is to put their own needs before the needs of others, and to do what you want, regardless of what other people might want9. Responses ranged from 1 (not at all\nimportant) to 5 (extremely important). Mean scores were calculated so that higher values\nindicated more self-interest.\nDemographic Covariates. Adolescents reported their age, gender, race/ethnicity,\nparents\u2019 education, and family financial strain. Parents\u2019 education was recoded on a 3-point scale\nwith 1 (neither parent completed high school), 2 (at least one parent complete high school), and\n3 (at least one parent completed college). Participants also reported on their political ideology on\na 5-point scale from 1 (very conservative) to 5 (very liberal) with an option to indicate \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d.\nResults\nMeans, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among study variables as well as\nfrequencies of news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors over the\nlast 7 days are presented in the Supplemental File. Overall, only 30.5% of youth engaged in pure\nsocial distancing (no in-person contact with those outside their household) during this period.\nYouth frequently engaged in various disinfecting behavior, with 88% reported engaging in at\nleast one type of disinfecting behavior multiple times per day. Additionally, a small subset of\nyouth engaged in hoarding behaviors (19.7%) at least a little during this time period. A subset of\nyouth (25.8%) indicated that do not follow COVID-19 related news at all, with the remaining\n74.2% following COVID-19 news at least a little.\nTable 1 presents estimates from four multivariate regression models predicting\nadolescents\u2019 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors. Primary\nindependent variables included attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, social responsibility\nvalues, social trust, and self-interest. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity,\nparents\u2019 education, family financial strain, ideology) were included as covariates. All models\nwere estimated using R. Low levels of missing data (< 5%) were estimated using multiple\nimputation.\n[Table 1 about here]\nWhen predicting social distancing and after accounting for demographic characteristics,\nyouth who endorsed greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 engaged in greater social\ndistancing. Additionally, greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing.\nWhen predicting disinfecting behavior, youth who endorsed attitudes about the severity of\nCOVID-19 and greater social responsibility values also engaged in greater disinfecting behavior.\nAttitudes about the severity of COVID-19 and social responsibility values were also associated\nwith more frequent news monitoring. When predicting hoarding behavior, youth who endorsed\ngreater beliefs about the severity of COVID-19 and those who endorsed greater self-interest\nvalues engaged in greater hoarding behavior, whereas those who endorsed greater social trust\nand social responsibility values engaged in less hoarding behavior. Significant results are\ndisplayed in Figures 1 and 2.\n[Figure 1 about here]\n[Figure 2 about here]\nDiscussion\nCOVID-19 is an imminent public health concern. To manage the spread and social\nimpact of this pandemic, it is imperative that US citizens engage in preventative behaviors such\nas social distancing and personal hygiene, stay up to date on virus-related news, and limit their\nengagement in hoarding behaviors that can result in a shortage of resources for communities and\nmedical professionals. Understanding individual differences in these behaviors is especially\nimportant among teenagers, who may be less likely to present with symptoms even when carrying the virus6 and who may experience greater social pressure to avoid limiting social\ncontact with peers. Findings from this study indicate that adolescents\u2019 beliefs about the severity\nof the virus, the extent to which they value social responsibility, their social trust, and their\nprioritization of their own self-interest over others are independently associated with their news\nmonitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behavior in the days following the US\ndeclaring COVID-19 a national emergency.\nResults from this study have important implications for the social response in the United\nStates to the COVID-19 pandemic. US adolescents may be more likely to engage in prosocial\nand less likely to engage in antisocial COVID-19 related-behavior if we emphasize the social\nvalue of distancing, disinfecting, and monitoring the COVID-19 progression, along with the\nsocial impact of hoarding supplies. While some of these values (e.g., social responsibility, self-\ninterest) may demonstrate considerable stability and may be slow to change, targeting these\npsychological beliefs directly may be an effective medium to promote positive health behaviors.\nEmphasizing the severity of COVID-19, along with using social responsibility and the needs of\nothers to frame messages related to the importance of preventative behaviors during the\npandemic may improve adolescents\u2019 compliance with health official and government\nrecommendations. Additionally, framing messages to emphasize social responsibility and the\ninterests of others, along with building social trust within communities, may serve to limit\nhoarding behaviors. These efforts may be aided by informing youth about potential asynchronies\nbetween the effects of COVID-19 on youth versus adults.

Prior research suggests that individuals\u2019 perceived severity of the COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioural reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this possibility. Participants were 4,607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage=23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for demographic variables, perceived severity of the COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the \u201cperceived severity of the COVID-19 \u2013 mental health problems\u201d association, with the said link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nKey words: risk factor; resilience; cognitive appraisal; self-control; COVID-19; public\nhealth concerns.\nSelf-control moderates the association between perceived severity of the coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) and mental health problems among the Chinese public\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not only led to thousands\nof death in China, but it also caused tremendous psychological stress to the Chinese public. In order to medically and mentally combat the COVID-19, professional input from various disciplines is needed, including the perspectives from psychological science. A recent study conducted among 4,607 Chinese reveals that individuals\u2019 cognitive appraisals, perceived severity of the COVID-19 in particular, are related to a number of undesirable emotional (e.g., increase in negative emotion) and behavioural (e.g., increase in sleep problems) reactions (Authors, 2020)1. However, little is known about what factors can buffer the negative influence of perceived severity on individuals\u2019 mental health. Studying this issue is important and necessary, as the findings will shed light on at specific factors for intervention programs to target. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model (Masten, 2001), we proposes that self-control ------ one\u2019s ability to override or change inner responses and to interrupt undesired behavioural tendencies (Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone, 2004) ------ could be a candidate that buffers the negative influence of perceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems among the Chinese public. The aim of this study is to examine this idea.\nThe risk-resilience model proposes that risk and adversity increase the propensity of\nundesirable outcomes; individuals who have sufficient assets to offset the negative influence of the risk could overturn undesirable outcomes, thus showing resilience (Masten, 2001). In this model, risk can be defined in diverse ways, including both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as\n1 Names are omitted for blind review purpose but will be released once the paper is accepted.\nadverse living condition, the negative life events that have occurred in recent months, massive community trauma, and cumulative risk calculations that combine different kinds of risk factors. The main effect model suggests that risk factors are associated with undesirable outcomes such as maladjustment. Nevertheless, the compensatory effect (or moderation effect) assumes that enough positive internal and/or external assets could mitigate the burden of an individuals\u2019 life due to risk influences, and thus these individuals would have better outcomes than those who have the same levels of risk but do not possess enough assets.\nA recent study reveals that individuals\u2019 perceived severity of the COVID-19 outbreak is\nrelated to more undesirable emotional and behavioural outcomes in the Chinese public (Authors, 2020), suggesting that perceived severity of the COVID-19 may impose a negative main effect on mental health outcomes. This is in line with past studies which found that individuals\u2019 negative appraisals about the incident (e.g., perceived risk, perceived threat, etc.) were related to more mental health problems during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Ebola (Cheng et al., 2006; Dorfan & Woody, 2011; Vartti et al., 2009; Yang & Chu, 2018). These literatures mainly adopt the main effect model to examine the risk and protective factors of outcomes during the encounter of emergent public health concerns. Beyond this, the risk-resilience model suggests the necessity and importance to take into account how assets may buffer the negative main effect on health outcomes. This motivated us to examine the potential moderation effect of self-control.\nAs an asset, self-control ability may serve to regulate the undesirable mental health\nconsequences brought by the COVID-19. Previous research suggested that individuals with high self-control have better inhibition and initiatory ability (de Ridder, de Boer, Lugtig, Bakker, & van Hooft, 2011), use more positive coping strategies and fewer negative coping strategies (Li,\nDelvecchio, Lis, Nie, & Di Riso, 2016), and persist more in important life domains (Duckworth & Seligman, 2005; Moffitt et al., 2011). In addition, self-control supports the retrieval of restrain standards and deliberative evaluations (Hofmann, Friese, & Strack, 2009). Therefore, good selfcontrol is robustly related to a wide range of life outcomes, including better mental health (for a review, see de Ridder, Lensvelt-Mulders, Finkenauer, Stok, & Baumeister, 2012). Besides, several aspects of good self-control are particularly relevant to the moderation in the association between risk factors and health outcomes. For instance, planning and forethought could help individuals anticipate and prepare for difficult situations; emotional self-regulation could provide better emotional control in problem situations; the ability to restrain and initiate action is important to deal with the difficulties in problem situations (Wills, Ainette, Stoolmiller, Gibbons, & Shinar, 2008). Prior studies have found that good self-control buffers the influence of negative environment (e.g., peer deviance, negative life events) on undesirable outcomes such as substance use (Dishion & Connell, 2006; Wills et al., 2008). This suggests that self-control is not only directly related to mental health but may also moderate the negative effect of risk factors, such as perceived severity.\nThe current study\nAccording to the literature reviewed above and the logic of the risk-resilience model, we\nhypothesized that perceived severity of the COVID-19 and self-control would be related to mental health problems in positive and negative directions, respectively. Moreover, we assumed that the negative association between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems would be less pronounced among those with high self-control compared to their lowself-control counterparts. To examine these hypotheses, we used data from a recent national survey (Author, 2020) which examines the Chinese public\u2019s emotional and behavioural\noutcomes and its antecedents in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Given that the individual data were nested in regions in this dataset, we employed a hierarchical regression analysis to control for the potential influence of the cluster, with a number of demographic variables included in the model as covariates to rule out their influence on the outcome.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants and procedure", "text": "Between February 2 and 9, 2020, 4826 Chinese individuals visited our online survey\nwebsite. A total of 219 participants were excluded because they met one of the following criteria: (1) they did not show interest to participate in the study after reading the information sheet; (2) they were not old enough to provide consent form (i.e., \u2266 16 years); or (3) they showed an\nobvious responding pattern across multiple consecutive items (e.g., select \u201c3\u201d for all items). Thus, 4607 participants comprised the final sample, 1265 males (27.5%) and 3342 females (72.5%) with age ranging from 17 to 90 years (Mage = 23.71 years, SD = 7.29). These participants came from 31 regions in China, with the sample size ranging from 16 (0.3% of the total sample, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) to 1386 (30.1% of the total sample, Guangdong Province). Most participants (73.2%) held a bachelor degree or above. Regarding physical and mental health condition, 77.3% of participants reported that their current physical health was good or very good; 94.6% and 99.2% of participants reported that they did not have any history of chronic physical diseases or history of psychiatric / psychological disorders, respectively. In addition, 97.7% of participants reported they had not been diagnosed with the COVID-19; 2.3% of participants reported they were suspected / diagnosed with the COVID-19 or had relatives / friends who were suspected / diagnosed cases.\nThe ethical committee of the Guangzhou University reviewed and approved this study\nbefore data collection. This study was part of the large survey study which aimed to examine Chinese public\u2019s emotional and behavioural outcomes and its risk and protective factors towards the COVID-19 outbreak (Authors, 2020). Over 200 volunteers who majored in psychology helped distribute the survey link on various internet platforms, including WeChat, Weibo, QQ, Facebook, etc. after receiving a three-hour training. Informed consent was sought prior to participation. Voluntary participation was emphasized and no incentive reward was given. We also stressed anonymity and did not collect any identifiable personal particulars. Measures\nMental health problems. The Chinese version of the 12-item General Health\nQuestionnaire (GHQ-12, Zhang & Wang, 2014) was used to measure participants\u2019 overall mental health problems over the past ten days. The scale contains 12 items either in negative or positive wordings. Participants were asked to indicate their situation on these items over the past 10 days compared to their general situation. All items were rated on a 4-point scale. The first two options of each question indicate that participants feel better than, or as much as, usual. Thus, these two options were coded 0. The third and the fourth option indicate participants feel/experience a little and much poorer than usual, respectively, and thus they were coded 1, and 2, respectively. Therefore, a higher total score reflects more mental health problems. Sample items are \u201cfeeling unhappy and depressed\u201d (negative wording) and \u201cbeen able to face up to your problems\u201d (positive wording). The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.86 in this study.\nPerceived severity. Participants\u2019 perceived severity about the COVID-19 was measured\nwith 5 items. Participants indicated their evaluation of how severe they think of the COVID-19 is in various aspects on a five-point scale (from 1=not severe at all to 5=very much severe). A\nhigher score indicates participants perceived the COVID-19 to be more severe. Sample items are \u201chow severe you think of the infectious rate of the COVID-19 is?\u201d and \u201chow severe you think of the morbidity of the COVID-19 is?\u201d The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.84 in this study.\nSelf-control. The Chinese version of the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS) was used to\nmeasure participants\u2019 self-control ability (Li, Vazsonyi, & Dou, 2018). The scale consists of 13 items rated on a five-point scale (from 1=not like me at all to 5=like me very much). A higher mean score indicates better self-control ability. Sample items are \u201cI am good at resisting temptation\u201d and \u201cI have a hard time breaking bad habits\u201d. The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.84 in this study. Data analysis\nWe analysed the data in SPSS and Mplus 7.0. First, we carried out descriptive statistics to\ncapture the centrality of the variables. Second, we performed correlation analysis to examine the association between perceived severity, self-control and mental health problems. Last, given that the individual data were nested in different provinces/regions, we carried out hierarchical regression models to examine the moderation effect of self-control in the association between perceived severity and mental health problems, controlling for demographic variables. To this end, we first calculated the intraclass correlation and the variance at the within- and betweenlevel. Then, we centred the covariates, independent variable and the moderator using the \u201cgroupmean\u201d function (Enders & Tofighi, 2007). Subsequently, we calculated the product term between the centred independent variable and the centred moderator as the interaction term. Based on this, we fit a full model, with the independent variable, the moderator, the interaction term, and the covariates as level-1 variables. The intercept of the dependent variable was also estimated at level-2 to control for the variance of the dependent variable accounted for by the\ncluster. Finally, we conducted simple slope tests with 1SD below and above the centred mean of the moderator and examined the differences in the magnitude of the slopes. Since Mplus 7.0 does not accommodate bootstrapping with multi-level models, we used R to calculate the 95% bootstrapping (N=20,000) confidence interval of the simple slopes and their differences.\nResults\nMean levels of and the bivariate correlations between mental health problems, perceived severity, and self-control\nAs shown in Table 1, participants reported only a few mental health problems (0.19 out\nof 2) over the past 10 days, relatively high levels of perceived severity of the COVID-19 (4.09 out of 5) and medium levels of self-control (3.03 out of 5). The results of correlation analyses found that perceived severity of the COVID-19 and self-control was negatively and positively related to mental health problems, respectively.\n[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]\nThe moderation of self-control in the association between perceived severity and mental health problems\nWe conducted hierarchical regression models to examine the association between\nperceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems as well as the moderation of self-control. Results of the null model revealed that the intraclass correlation (ICC) of mental health problems was 0.04. The within-level and the between-level model explained 7.1% and 0.3% variance of mental health problems, respectively.\nThe results of the full model are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that after\ncontrolling for a number of demographic variables, the main effect of perceived severity on mental health problems was significant (B=0.07, SE=0.01, p<0.001), suggesting that participants who perceived the COVID-19 to be more severe reported more mental health problems. The main effect of self-control was also significant (B=\u22120.08, SE=0.01, p<0.001), suggesting that participants with high self-control reported fewer mental health problems. More importantly, the interaction effect between perceived severity and self-control was significant as well, B=0.05, SE=0.01, p<0.001.\n[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]\nGiven the significance of the interaction term, we further conducted simple slope tests\nand the results are displayed in Table 3 and Figure 1. The results showed that as individuals\u2019 self-control ability increased, the association between perceived severity and mental health problems decreased. Furthermore, we compared the differences in the magnitude of the simple slopes, finding that the slope of perceived severity at the low levels of self-control was significantly larger than the ones at the medium and high levels of self-control and that the slope at the medium levels of self-control was also significantly larger than the one at the high levels of self-control.\n[INSERT TABLE 3 AND FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 has been declared as an emergent public health concern (American,\n2020). Prior research found that perceived severity of the COVID-19 was associated with more undesirable emotional and behavioural outcomes (Author, 2020). Deepening this issue, the current study sought to examine self-control as a candidate to moderate the association between perceived severity and mental health problems among the Chinese public. The findings fully supported our hypotheses, even after controlling for a range of demographic variables.\nThis study bears both theoretical and clinical implications. Theoretically, the significant\ninteraction suggests that besides the main effect model, the interaction effect model is also important in studying mental health in the context of emergent public health concerns. This is because the effect of a risk factor on health outcomes could be masked or averaged without examining its interaction with other risks and assets, and thereby the likelihood of detecting such an effect is reduced. Clinically, high levels of self-control buffers the association between perceived severity and mental health problems, suggesting that individuals with low levels of self-control are more vulnerable. This implies that those with low levels of self-control would be more in need of psychological aids, which echoes the call by the Chinese government \u201cto provide mental aid to those who need it\u201d. In addition, since self-control is a crucial asset, enhancing individuals\u2019 self-control ability may help buffer the influence of negative appraisal and improve the public\u2019s mental health.\nWe must acknowledge that the current study has several limitations. First, the self-report\ndata increases the common method bias and the cross-sectional nature prevents us from inferring causality. Second, samples from different provinces/regions vary greatly, which may affect the estimation of the between-level variance. Third, some populations were over-representative, such\nas females and students. A more sophisticated design and more representative sample would be desirable to achieve even robust findings. Nevertheless, the current findings provide important early evidence about the mental health problems in the Chinese public and how these problems are jointly explained by both risk (i.e., perceived severity) and asset (i.e., self-control) during the COVID-19 outbreak. As the virus currently is spreading worldwide, the current findings could be of potential use for further research around the globe. In conclusion, perceived severity of the COVID-19 relates to more mental health problems and high levels of self-control buffer this association. We believe that these findings bear important implications in understanding and improving the public\u2019s mental health during the encounter of emergent public health concerns.\nReference\nAuthors [omitted for blind review].

Spain is 3rd in the world and 2nd in\nEurope with largest number of diagnosed cases. Spanish citizens\u2019 attitudes are important in controlling the pandemic. This research assessed key attitudes of the Spanish people toward COVID-19. One study (n =64) was conducted in a shopping centre in Madrid and another (n= 640) online. The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a \u2018more responsible\u2019 attitude toward the COVID-19 than men. Young adults (18-25 years) appear to perceive less threatening the epidemic than older adults. Spanish people\u2019s personal concern about COVID-19 is less than their perceived social alarm about it. Compliance is the strongest predictor of the approval to stay at home, which is the highest rated preventive measure by the Spanish people. These results might help policy makers in targeting public attitudes which could play an important role in the exponentially rising cases of COVID-19.\nKey words: Adults, Coronavirus, Epidemic, Morbidity, Virus\nIntroduction\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11, 2020 was described as a pandemic by the World Health Organization\u2019s Director General [1]. Spain is the fourth most affected nation in the world, but it is the second after Italy in Europe with 39,673 confirmed cases and 2,696 deaths on March 25, 2020 [2]. On March 14, the Spanish Government declared a nationwide lockdown ordering people to stay at home [3]. At the time of writing the number of confirmed cases COVID-19 keeps increasing in Spain (56,188 diagnosed and 4,089 deaths [4] and also in Europe with 232,470 confirmed cases and 13,692 deaths [5]. Nearly 25% of all the European cases were confirmed in Spain.\nGiven that currently there is no treatment for, or vaccine against, the new coronavirus,\nprevention is not only the best, but the sole alternative, in battling the pandemic [6]. Governments\u2019 actions in introducing regulations that limit the contact between people to prevent transmission could be the most realistic solution in halting the spread of the virus [7]. However, people\u2019s response to these regulations, reflected in their level of compliance and perception of the seriousness of the problem, is the determinant factor in health authorities\u2019 struggle in containing the pandemic. Regular washing of the hand and staying home are paramount preventive measures in fighting COVID-19 [8]. However, despites widely publicized information and knowledge, people do not maximize the available preventive measures as revealed in a large-scale survey during the malaria epidemic in Indonesia [9]. People\u2019s knowledge and attitude toward the existing preventive measures in battling COVID19 is crucial in Spain where the disease spreads at exponential rates, claiming several hundreds of lives daily, at this very moment.\nThe most effective means of fighting the pandemic is by limiting contact between the\npeople which among several others involves staying at home whenever possible [10]. The new discipline requires major and sudden change in the habitual lifestyle of most individuals in most nations [11]. Considering the Behavioral Immune System (BIS) theory [12] at the time of a pandemic people might generate negative feeling states or emotions such as tension, fear, anxiety as a result of the negative appraisal of the situation and self-protection [13]. On the other hand, people may use denial in an attempt to protect themselves from the sudden and major lifestyle changes required by the surfacing threat. The Risk Denial Theory (RDT) posits that cognition (as means of rationalization) is used for defending risky behaviours by justifying one\u2019s actions (risky behaviours) to convince the self, prior to anybody else [14]. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic had a relatively slow onset in Spain with less than 100 cases in early March which was followed by a continuous increase reaching exponential rates at the time of writing [15], it can be conjectured that the RDT might explain people\u2019s attitudes in the early phase of the pandemic with a progressive shift that will mirror the BIS theory.\nThe objective of the current work was twofold. First, we wanted to gauge the attitudes\nof people going to shopping centre in Madrid the day after the Spanish government declared a lockdown and asked its citizens to stay at home. This period can be considered as a transition into a higher level of threat posed by COVID-19. Among others, people\u2019 perception of social alarm, personal concern, and perceived need to stay at home (in line with the government\u2019s request) were measures of key interest. Second, we tried to assess the attitudes of a larger and more heterogenous sample across Spain in this crucial moment of the declaration of pandemic by the WHO. To obtain data rapidly, the first aim was achieved by conducting a face-to-face study and the second by using an online survey. We predicted that the lockdown of Spain and the declaration of the pandemic will mirror high concern and conforming attitudes.\nStudy 1"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Study 1 was performed in a large suburban shopping centre in Madrid, Spain. The first author collected the data in person by adopting systematic randomization, which consisted of asking every third person entering the main entrance of the shopping centre whether she or he would be willing to answer a few questions about the corona virus situation. Response rate was 64%. Participation in the study was anonymous and voluntary, and it was totally in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki for conducting research with human participants [16]. Only volunteers who could affirm that they were aged 18 years or over at the moment of the study were eligible for participation. The whole duration of data collection was about 4 hours.\nConsenting participants (n = 64) were asked about their age (M = 38.47, SD = 13.21,\nrange 18 to 72 years), gender (33 men, 31 women), education level (university graduate [n = 34], student [n = 27], and other/vocational training [n = 3]), whether they know: a) someone who is infected with the coronavirus (9 yes, 55 no), and b) someone at high risk (i.e., older person and/or individual with chronic disease; 50 yes, 14 no). Subsequently, the participant was requested to rate her/his 1) personal concern about the COVID-19, 2) perceived social alarm, 3) personal knowledge, 4) perceived control, 5) compliance with safety measures, and 6) perceived need to stay home (which was a measure requested by the Spanish government the day before the study), on a rating scale from 0 (lowest possible) to 10 (highest possible). We employed an 11-point scale because it was demonstrated that it has higher sensitivity and it is also nearer to interval level of scaling and normality than scales with other ranges [17]. The above listed six questions formed the dependent measures in Study 1. The face-to-face survey lasted from 3 to 5 minutes.\nThe obtained data were grouped on the bases of gender, age (18-25 [n = 15], 26-50 [n\n= 37], and 51-72[n = 12] years), level of education, and knowledge of 1) infected person, and 2) a person at high risk. Before the data analyses, the normal distribution of the six dependent measures was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks tests. All tests results were statistically significant, indicating that the assumption of normality was violated in the data (p < .005 for all tests). Consequently, nonparametric tests were used. Within-participants data (i.e., differences between the response categories) were tested with the related-samples Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test. Group differences in the six dependent measures were tested with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, which is recommended for smaller samples and might be less sensitive to sample size differences between the groups [18]. In case of three groups (i.e. age-groups), the Kruskal-Wallis H test, also known as the analysis of variance on ranks, was used."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "First, to obtain a general picture about the attitudes toward the COVID-19 of the people attending a shopping centre the day after the government requested the Spanish population to stay at home, we visually examined the mean responses in the six measures (Figure 1). These findings suggested that the perceived social alarm was greater than the personal concern about the virus, which was also justified by the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, which confirmed that the former was statistically significantly higher (Z = 6.359, p < .001, effect size [r] = .56) than the latter (Figures 2A and 2B). In fact the perception of social alarm was significantly higher than the ratings of the other dependent measures as well: perceived personal control (Z = 6.144, p < .001, r = .54), perceived knowledge about COVID-19 (Z = 6.208, p < .001, r = .55), compliance with safety measures (Z = 4.984, p < .001, r = .44), and the need of staying at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (Z = 3.905, p < .001, r = .35; refer to Figure 1.)\nInsert Figure 1 and Figures 2A and 2B about here\nNext, gender differences were examined. The Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that\nwomen reported statistically significantly (Z = 2.60, p = .009, effect size (Eta squared [\u03b72] = .11) greater perceived control (M = 7.58, SD = 1.36) than men (M = 3.42, SD = 1.68). No other gander differences emerged in the examined variables. Further, no differences were found in any of the measures in conjunction with the level of education and knowledge of an infected person. Individuals knowing someone being at high risk agreed more with staying at home during the pandemic (M = 8.26, SD = 1.72) than those who did not know such person (M = 6.57, SD = 2.59) and the difference was statistically significant (Z = 2.39, p = .017, \u03b72 = .09). Finally, differences in age groups emerged in two variables, namely in the compliance with safety measures (\u03c72 (2) = 7.90, p = 0.019), with a mean rank of 23.93 for young adults (18 - 25 years), 35.65 for adults (26 - 50 years) and 37.25 for ageing adults (50 - 72 years) and the perceived necessity to stay home (\u03c72 (2) = 7.08, p = 0.029), with a mean rank of 23.63 for young adults, 32.89 for adults, and 42.38 for ageing adults. In the former measure, the young adults differed from the two other groups who did not differ from each other, and in the latter measure young adults only differed form ageing adults. Descriptives of these variables, along with the results of the Mann-Whitney pairwise comparisons, are illustrated in Table 1.\nInsert Table 1 about here\nGiven that staying at home is a principal means of controlling the quick spread of the\npandemic, we examined the extent to which age, gender, knowing someone infected, knowing someone at high risk and all dependent measures could predict the attitude toward the need of staying home with a stepwise linear regression. We found that three variables explained a significant proportion of the variance in the perceived need of staying home (F(3, 60) = 10.51, p < .001, R2 = .587, R2 adjusted = .312). The results revealed that the level of compliance had\nthe largest contribution to the model (Beta [\u03b2]= .417, t(63) = 3.96, p < .001), next knowing someone at risk (\u03b2 = -.370, t(63) = 3.46, p = .001), and finally knowing someone infected also contributed significantly to the regression equation (\u03b2 = .280, t(63) = 2.61, p = .012).\nWhat did we learn from Study 1?\nStudy 1 was a pilot work providing tentative data that yielded a good starting point for a quick follow-up with a larger scale cross-sectional inquiry. What we learned from Study 1 is that individuals going out shopping, the day after the government asks them to remain at home, perceive social alarm higher than any other measures that may be related to the slowing down of the epidemic, including concern, control, compliance, knowledge and the need of staying at home. Thus, despite thousands of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of deaths have reported at the time of the study, participants thought (based on their answers) that social alarm is not in proportion with their level of concern. Indeed, the results of this pilot research show that the participants expressed a relatively low concern toward the pandemic (shortest horizontal bar on Figure 1). In this measure the respondents\u2019 mean score was under 7, not reaching the 2/3 of the possible maximum. As illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B, the area above the median (5) of the Likert scale, depicting the profile of individual responses, is at least twice as large in the perception of social alarm than the area reflecting personal concern.\nAt the time of the study young adults (18 - 25 years) appeared to be less concerned\nabout the compliance with preventive measures and towards the need of staying home than adults and older adults. Furthermore, women seemed to report greater perceived control than men, that might be a major issue considering that more men appear to be affected by COVID19 than women [21]. Finally, a relatively large proportion of the variance in the perceived need to stay at home was predicted by the compliance with safety measures, knowing someone at high risk, and knowing a person who is already infected by the virus. This\ninformation might be useful in developing measures to enhance compliance with staying home, which is the most effective method in delaying and/or decreasing the epidemic [6].\nStudy 2"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "This study was performed online using the Spanish Google Forms internet platform (https://www.google.es/intl/es/forms/about). The call for participation in the study was made on social networks including Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. Criteria for participation was that respondents be aged 18 years or over and reside in Spain at the time of the study. Those who completed the online survey by doing so provided passive consent for participation. The study did not collect any personal data through which an individual could be identified, and it was totally voluntary. Data collection lasted for 3 days. During this period 773 responses were obtained. After eliminating the responses from those who were aged under 18 years (n = 36) and those responding from other countries (n = 98), the final data set comprised 640 eligible responses.\nLike in Study 1, participants were asked about their age (M = 31.99, SD = 11.52, range\n18 to 75 years), gender (386 men, 284 women), level of education (university graduate [n = 331], student [n = 152], and other/vocational training [n = 157]), whether they know: a) someone who is infected with the corona virus (92 yes, 452 no, and 94 unsure), and b) someone at high risk (i.e., older person and/or individual with chronic disease; 484 yes, 95 no and 61 unsure). Subsequently, the respondents were asked to rate their 1) personal concern about the COVID-19, 2) perceived social alarm, 3) personal knowledge, 4) perceived control, 5) compliance with safety measures, 6) the perceived need to stay home 7) proper hand wash,\n8) keeping 1.5m from other people in public places, and 9) using a mask. The first six questions were identical to those in Study 1, while the last three were added as additional measures. Like in Study 1, all questions were rated on a 11-point rating scale from 0 to 10.\nThe data were grouped on the bases of gender, age (18-25 [n = 236], 26-50 [n = 356],\nand 51-75 [n = 49] years), level of education, and knowledge of a) infected person, and b) a person at high risk. While the assumption of normal distribution was not met, as based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks tests, violation of the assumption in large samples is usually considered to be tolerable especially because the employment of nonparametric tests in such samples is discouraged [18]. Therefore, the data obtained in Study 2 were analysed with multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA). Regression analysis was also performed."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Like in Study 1, to visualize the attitudes toward the COVID-19 of 640 people across Spain, we graphically illustrated the mean responses to nine (9) measures (Figure 3). Then we performed a within-subjects analysis of variance to examine the differences in the rating of the nine dependent measures. This test was statistically significant (F(8, 5112) = 805. 34, p < .001, effect size (partial Eta squared [\u03b72p ]) = .558). We were particularly interested in the difference between perceived social alarm and the other measures, which were statistically significant in Study 1. The Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons revealed that the rating of the perceived social alarm was greater than that of six other measures (p < .001; see Figure 3), while it did not differ from the perceived need of proper hand washing and it was statistically significantly lower than the perceived need to stay at home (M = 8.22, SD = 1.69 vs. M = 8.88, SD = 1.70). Unlike in Study 1, in the current online study (performed within 5 days after Study 1), the perceived need to stay at home to avoid the spread of the disease has received the highest rating that differed statistically significantly (p < .001) from the rating of\nall other questions. However, like in Study 1, the reported personal concern (M = 6.81, SD = 2.19) was still lower than the perceived social alarm (M = 8.22, SD = 1.69). the individual response profiles are illustrated in Figures 4A and 4B for comparison purposes with those seen in Study 1.\nInsert Figure 3 and Figures 4A and 4B about here\nWe used a multivariate analysis of variance to examine the gender differences in the\nnine dependent measures. Based on the Pillai-Bartlett trace multivariate statistic, which was suggested to be the least sensitive to unequal sample sizes and heterogeneity of covariances [19] (Tang & Algina, 1993), this first MANOVA resulted in a statistically significant multivariate effect for gender (Pillai\u2019s trace = .036, F[9, 629] = 2.59, p = .006, \u03b72p = .036). The univariate tests revealed that men and women differed statistically significantly in four out of nine measures: personal concern, compliance with safety measures, exercising proper care to wash hands, and in keeping at least 1.5 m distance from others in public places. These results are summarized in Table 2.\nInsert Table 2 about here\nAnother MANOVA, examining the differences between those who knew an infected\nperson and those who did not, was also statistically significant (Pillai\u2019s trace = .041, F[9, 536] = 2.52, p = .008, \u03b72p = .041). The univariate tests showed that the two groups differed in three out of nine dependent measures including: a) personal concern (F[1, 544] = 4.03, p = .045, \u03b72p = .007), with those people who knew an infected person (n = 92) scoring higher (M = 7.18, SD = 2.05) than those who did not know (n = 454) such an individual (M = 6.67, SD = 2.26)1, b) knowledge about COVID-19 (F[1, 544] = 4.56, p = .033, \u03b72p = .008), with those knowing\n1 The degree of freedom is lower because those who were \u201dunsure\u201d were not included in this analysis.\nan infected individual scoring higher (M = 7.32, SD = 1.51) than those not knowing such an individual (M = 6.91, SD = 1.67), and c) keeping the 1.5 m distance from others (F[1, 544] = 5.61, p = .018, \u03b72p = .010) with those who knew an infected person scoring higher again (M = 7.33, SD = 2.56) than those who did not know such a person (M = 6.65, SD = 2.49).\nWhile the MANOVAs comparing those knowing someone at high risk with those who\ndid not know such an individual and the one considering education level were statistically not significant, the MANOVA comparing the three age groups on the nine dependent measures resulted in a statistically significant multivariate effect (Pillai\u2019s trace = .081, F[18, 1260] = 2.97, p < .001, \u03b72p = .041). The univariate tests revealed that the three age groups differed in five out of the nine measures: personal concern, compliance with safety measures, exercising proper care to wash hands, in keeping at least 1.5 m distance from others in public places, and wearing a mask all the time. The univariate tests, along with the descriptive statistics, are summarized in Table 3.\nInsert Table 3 about here\nA stepwise regression analysis, replicating the one performed in Study 1 and testing\nthe predictors of the crucial measure of controlling the epidemic (i.e. staying at home), resulted in a statistically significant regression equation (F(4, 635) = 64.82, p < .001, R2 = .538, R2 adjusted = .285). Four measures contributed to the statistically significant model. Personal concern yielded the largest contribution (\u03b2 = .322, t(639) = 8.97, p < .001), next compliance with preventive measures (\u03b2 = .199, t(639) = 4.99, p < .001), further keeping 1.5 m distance from others (\u03b2 = .169, t(639) = 4.19, p < .001), and finally perceived social alarm contributed significantly but inversely to the model (\u03b2 = -.071, t(639) = -2.11, p = .035),\nFinally, because six questions were identical in Study 1 and Study 2, and since the two\nsamples differed in the means of responding, we compared their responses on the dependent\nmeasures examined in Study 1. The MANOVA2 resulted in a statistically significant group effect (Pillai\u2019s trace = .085, F[7, 696] = 9.18, p < .001, \u03b72p = .085). The univariates analyses revealed that the differences emerged in age (F[1, 702] = 17.91, p < .001, \u03b72p = .025), with the online respondents being younger (M = 31.99, SD = 11.52 years) than the shopping centre attendees (M = 38.47, SD = 13.21 years), in perceived social alarm (F[1, 702] = 19.59, p < .001, \u03b72p = .027), with the online respondents scoring lower (M = 8.22, SD = 1.69) than the shopping centre attendees (M = 9.17, SD = 1.03), and in the need to stay at home during the epidemic (F[1, 702] = 23.62, p < .001, \u03b72p = .033), with the online respondents scoring higher (M = 8.99, SD = 1.69) than the respondents from the shopping centre (M = 7.89, SD = 2.05).\nWhat did we learn from Study 2?\nThis larger scale cross-sectional study surveyed volunteer respondents across Spain in contrast to Study 1 which tested a lower number of participants attending a shopping centre in Madrid. Thus, the means of sampling, and very likely the venue of sampling (presuming that most online respondents participated from home), was different between the two surveys. Although there were only a few days difference between the data collection in the two studies, which nevertheless might have affected the answers, the two samples differed in their views on the need to stay at home and in their personal concern about COVID-19. The older sample going out shopping in Madrid on the day after the Spanish government requested people to stay at home perceived greater social alarm associated with the pandemic and lesser need to stay at home than the younger online respondents.\nStudy 2 as an expansion of Study 1 contained three additional dependent measures,\nand 10 times more respondents. Like in Study 1, we revealed again that young adults (18 \u2013 25\n2 Due the the large difference in the size of the two groups, we also performed Mann-Whitney U tests, which yielded idntical results.\nyears) might have the \u2018most relaxed\u2019 attitudes towards the pandemic, which is a finding that reflects the factual public information concerning the lowest health threat of COVID-19 to this age group [20]. Partially replicating the findings from Study 1, women differed from men in four out of nine measures including personal concern, compliance with safety measures, exercising proper care to wash hands, and in keeping at least 1.5 m distance from others in public places. In all instances, women scored higher than men (refer to Table 2), which might reflect a more responsible attitude of women toward the dangers associated with the pandemic in contrast to men. While speculative at this time, it cannot be totally ruled out that a greater concern may also be related to some extent to the lower cases of fatalities in women than in men [21]. Finally, a relatively large proportion (28.5%) of the variance in the perceived need to stay at home was predicted by four measures including concern about COVID-19, compliance with safety measures, keeping distance from others and in an inverse direction perceived social alarm. These findings expand those obtained in Study 1 during the course of the face-to-face survey and could be useful in developing and/or implementing measures to reinforce compliance with staying home, which, as noted earlier, is believed to be the most effective method in delaying and/or decreasing the epidemic [6].\nWe also found in Study 2 that knowing an infected person might be related to slightly\nhigher concern, in at least some of the measures, than not having an infected person in one\u2019s social entourage. People knowing an infected person scored higher on personal concern, knowledge about COVID-19, and in maintaining at least 1.5 m distance from others in public places. Like in Study 1, we found no differences in function of the education level in any of the measures. However unlike in Study 1, where people knowing a person at high risk agreed more to staying home than those who did not such an individual, in Study 2 the knowledge of a person at high risk did not make a difference in responses.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe two studies reported here were performed at the time of transition from lower to higher national threat of COVID-19 and the WHO\u2019s declaration of the pandemic. The results show that in this period Spanish people\u2019s personal concern about the threat was lower than their perceived social alarm. This finding has emerged from both, the local face-to-face study and the country-wide online survey. The discord between these two measures might suggest that at the crucial time in the etiology of the pandemic Spaniards still had a \u201cmake a mountain out of a molehill\u201d [22] attitude toward COVID-19. Such an attitude is consistent with the Risk Denial Theory [13], suggesting that at the time of these studies the fast shift in the course of development of the pandemic was not immediately followed by a shift in people\u2019s attitudes. Probably more time is needed for the realization and internalization of the significant threat and for the build-up of emotions like fear and anxiety [12], which eventually triggers high personal concern conforming to the prediction of the BIS theory [11].\nThere are several reports suggesting that men are at higher risk of COVID-19 than\nwomen [21]. This tendency is sadly reflected by the twice as many male mortalities, in contrast to female mortalities, in Spain [23]. However, there is no clear explanation provided for this phenomenon despite the conjecture that estrogen might have a protective effect in women and that men have a greater number of co-morbidities in COVID-19 cases than women [24]. Our results from Study 1 showed that women report greater perceived control than men. Further, findings from Study 2 reveal that women report greater concern about the pandemic, higher compliance with safety measures, greater care about washing hands, and stricter attitude towards keeping distance from others in public places in contrast to men. These differences in attitudes suggest that women appear to take the threat more seriously or with greater concern, as well as with greater adherence to preventive measures, than men which could be related to the lower incidence of COVID-19 in women compared to men [23].\nThe attitude hypothesis merits special consideration in light of the fact that cross cultural differences in number of cases vary from one culture to another. For example, while in Italy about 15% more cases were noted in men on March 26, 2020 [25] on the same day in South Korea about 22% more COVID-19 cases were registered in women [26]. Consequently, biological differences might not be the sole reason for the generally reported greater prevalence of COVID-19 in men than in women, The here observed differences in the attitudes of the two sexes might suggest that men could be more vulnerable to COVID-19 than women due to their lesser realization of the threat posed by the epidemic, in addition to any other biological or medical differences.\nAge group differences also emerged in both studies. Young adults (18-25 years)\nscored lower on compliance with safety measures and the need to stay at home than the older groups in Study 1. They also scored lower on personal concern, compliance with safety, hand wash, keeping distance and wearing mask from older adults. Briefly, this age group appeared to have the most \u2018relaxed\u2019 attitude, which could be expected based on statistics, repeatedly and consistently presented in the media, showing that the risk of complication if significantly lower in this age group than in older adults [27]. Despite the validity of the information, this attitude is dangerous to older adults who are likely to develop greater complications than youngsters [20]. Policy makers and the public media should educate and warn this age group about the dangers of their \u2018more relaxed\u2019 attitudes to others.\nIn Study 1 respondents who knew someone infected agreed more to the need of\nstaying at home than those who did now such a person, but these findings did not emerge in Study 2, The incongruence between the results of the two studies might be related to the different samples as well as to the fact that in Study 1 only nine people knew somebody affected by the virus. Indeed, the two samples differed in age, perceived social alarm and perceived need to stay at home. The people in Study 1, attending a shopping centre, were\nolder and perceived greater social alarm around COVID-19 than the online respondents. Their attitude, along with lower rating of the need to stay at home, might reflect the justification of their behaviour at the moment of participation manifested by the fact that they went shopping despite the government\u2019s request to stay home.\nStaying at home is the best means of avoiding contact with others [6]. In Study 1 the\nof staying home was rated lower than the perceived social alarm, but this was in the opposite direction in Study 2. Again, the difference between an online and a real-life shopping sample might explain the observed difference. However, the predictors of this measures were also different in the two studies. In Study 1, a higher rating was associated with knowing someone at risk, someone affected by COVID-19 and the level of compliance, which all together explained 31.2% of the variance. The strongest predictor was compliance, which emerged as a significant predictor in Study 2 as well. However, in Study 2 personal concern, keeping 1.5 m distance from other and social alarm (inversely) explained somewhat less variance (28.5%) in the need to stay at home. Taken together these results, it appears that the perceived level of compliance may be strongly related to the approval of the need to stay at home. Therefore, compliance-enhancing strategies may lead to less violation- and better acceptance of the government regulation currently in effect to keep people staying at home. Nonetheless, as seen in these studies, compliance is lower in younger adults and men, which shows that interventions must target these segments of the population as soon as possible."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "The here reported studies provide a general picture about the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, which is the 3rd most affected nation in the world at the time of writing. These studies are not without limitation. For example, the sample size in Study 1 was small since out of the nearly 100 people approached only 64 agreed to take part in the study. The respondents could\nrepresent those taking a necessary risk to go shopping at time of lockdown. Their responses in the real-life environment, in which Study 1 was conducted, might contain \u2018excuses\u2019 to justify their unconformity with the government\u2019s demand, which is traceable to the Hawthorne effect [28]. The six measures in Study 1 complemented by three others in Study 2 were selected on the basis of most frequently raised media issues rather than a theory. While the novelty of the situation could justify these choices, probably there are several other issues that might have merited attention in the assessment of the public attitudes in Spain at the time of the work. Further, like in ther studies with humans, volunteerism is another limitation that could affect the findings. We are not sure how \u201cnon-volunteers\u201d would have responded to our questions. Finally, our delimitation to collect data for 3 days only could also be perceived as a limitation; our findings are the momentary reflection of Spaniards\u2019 attitudes at the time of transition from group infection to mass infection.\nMain Conclusions\n1. Women in Spain appear to project a more responsible attitude toward the COVID-19\npandemic than men.\n2. Young adults (aged 18 - 25) perceive the least threatening the epidemic in Spain. 3. Personal concern about COVID-19 is lower than the perceived social alarm. 4. Compliance is the best predictor of the approval of staying at home during the threat. 5. Among several preventive measures staying at home is the most- while wearing a mask is\nthe least-approved.\nReferences\n1. World Health Organization.

Here we show that institutional and cultural factors combine to explain these cross-cultural differences. Nations with efficient governments and tight cultures have been most\neffective at limiting COVID-19\u2019s infection rate and mortality likelihood. An evolutionary game 20\ntheory model suggests that these trends may be partly driven by variation in adherence to cooperative norms across nations. We summarize basic and policy implications of these findings.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a global health crisis. The virus has quickly spread\nfrom its epicenter in Wuhan, China, across the planet. As of March 2020, COVID-19 has infected over 650,000 people and killed over 30,000 people worldwide. There have been over 130,000 cases and close to 2,500 deaths in the United States alone, and both figures have\nsurpassed Chinese rates and are growing exponentially by the day. Yet certain countries have 5\nhad far more success in slowing the number of COVID-19 cases and the likelihood that infected individuals will die from the virus. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have each been able to effectively contain the virus, and despite controversy around its early handling of the virus, China has recently been able to vastly reduce new infections. By contrast, Italy, Spain,\nand the U.S., have experienced more pronounced growth in prevalence and death rates than other 10\ncountries. Scientists, policy makers, journalists and lay people alike are all urgently trying to understand the mechanisms that have produced such national variation in order to learn how to curtail the spread of COVID-19.\nHere we present data on how societal institutions and culture could critically contain\nCOVID-19. Our analyses are based on the premise that the COVID-19 pandemic is a global 15\nthreat that requires effective and rapid cooperation and coordination to solve. Based on this premise, we propose that nations with efficient governments that are able to quickly allocate revenue and coordinate with private sector industries may be able to slow the trajectory of the virus and reduce its morality rate compared with nations with less efficient governments.\nAdditionally, tighter cultures that have strong norms and little tolerance for deviance (1, 2) may 20\nbe better able to adopt new norms (e.g. social distancing, effective handwashing) that contain the virus compared to looser cultures. Our predictions are consistent with models of cultural evolution which show that, in the face of acute ecological threat, human groups require strict\nnorms to maintain high levels of cooperation and coordination (3). When nations combine efficient government with tight cultures, they should be able to rapidly introduce and regulate these cooperative norms, increasing their ability to slow the spread and impact of an ecological threat such as COVID-19.\nBuilding on this theoretical foundation, we predict that cultural tightness and government 5\nefficiency should combine to predict the infection rate and mortality likelihood associated with COVID-19, such that the nations that fare the best may have both culturally tight norms and efficient governments and the nations that fare the worst may have culturally loose norms and inefficient governments. Here we test this prediction using data on 528,019 confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 (including 23,672 deaths) across 141 world nations to examine how governmental 10\nefficiency and cultural tightness together can radically impact the spread and death rates of COVID-19 above and beyond economic and demographic differences between countries. All data and code associated with these analyses are available from OSF at https://osf.io/pc4ef/ for reproduction and examination. We retrieved and updated these data between March 21st and\nMarch 30th, 2020. 15\nWe retrieved data on COVID-19 around the world from the European Center for Disease\nControl, which provides daily updates of the number of COVID-19 documented cases and the number of documented deaths due to COVID-19.

In order to avoid confounding these COVID-19 data with nations\u2019 population sizes, we\ndownloaded data on cases per million citizens, and indexed death rate through the number of 20\nmortalities divided by the number of total cases.\nWe measured government efficiency using the World Bank\u2019s Government Efficiency\nIndex, which assesses the public sector\u2019s performance in managing/regulating the political\neconomy. According to this metric, efficient governments score highly on 5 dimensions: they are efficient in spending public revenue, they do not place strong compliance burdens on the private sector, they are able to efficiently settle legal and judicial disputes in the private sector, they are receptive to challenges from the private sector, and they offer transparent information about\nchanges in government policies and regulations affecting private sector activities. The 2017 5\nmeasure captures the government efficiency of 126 nations. We measured cultural tightness using the index from Gelfand and colleagues (1), who measured tightness through 6 items, including \u201cThere are many social norms that people are supposed to abide by in this country,\u201d and \u201cIn this country, if someone acts in an inappropriate way, others will strongly disapprove.\u201d\nThis measure was originally gathered by Gelfand (1) across 33 nations, and then expanded to 57 10\nnations by Eriksson and colleagues (4). The measure captures the strength of norms in a nation and the tolerance for people who violate norms.\nThe rate of COVID-19 over time showed an exponential growth curve, which is typical\nfor the early stages of pandemic and epidemic outbreaks (5). We focused on the rate of cases\nafter the number of cases exceeded 1 per million people, a CDC metric intended to track growth 15\nrates as the disease posed a risk to increasing numbers of people. We predicted that cultural tightness and government efficiency would predict slower growth rates of COVID-19 and lower mortality likelihoods, and that nations with high cultural tightness and high government efficiency would show especially slow growth rate and mortality likelihood. We captured\ninfection rate by fitting regression equations for each nation, log-transforming the outcome 20\nvariable (cases per million people) and the predictor variable (days) to account for the exponential growth rate of the virus. Log-transformation converts exponential growth rates into\nlinear growth rates, which can be predicted in a general linear model. These linear growth rates for each nation are displayed in Figure 1.\nWe next conducted a second set of regressions using the estimates from our initial\ngeneral linear models to predict cross-cultural variation in the infection rate of COVID-19. We 10\nnote that general linear models do not account for the error inherent in estimating growth curves. To address this limitation, we weighted cases in our second set of regressions by number of observations across nations, so that nations with high numbers of observations (and more reliable estimates) would be weighted over and above nations with low numbers of observations (and\nless reliable estimates). We also predicted mortality likelihood, which we measured through the 15\nnumber of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the number of COVID-19 cases in a nation. While\nthese models did not estimate change over time, they still captured a critical variable, since it is important to minimize the likelihood that people will die from COVID-19 once they have contracted the illness.\nTo make our models more robust, we controlled for factors that may be strongly related\nto the spread of COVID-19, such as economic development, inequality, and median age. We 5\nincluded these variables in all of our regressions, and our Supplemental Materials explore other factors such as population density. Economic development was indexed through GDP per capita, which we retrieved from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s 2019 release. Inequality was indexed through the nations\u2019 Gini coefficients, which we retrieved from the most recent World Bank\nestimate for each nation. We retrieved data on nations\u2019 median ages from the 2018 CIA World 10\nFactbook, the most recent release where we could locate this information. These covariates were standardized prior to model estimation. Finally, we also examined the distribution of rate of cases and mortality likelihood prior to fitting our models. These distributions revealed that the growth rate of cases was normally distributed, but the mortality likelihood was highly skewed\n(see Supplemental Materials). Therefore, we used an ordinary least squares regression with 15\ngaussian distribution to predict rate of cases but a logistic function with exponential distribution to predict mortality likelihood.\nOur models examining infection rate revealed that cultural tightness and government\nefficiency were each related to the rate of new cases across nations. Culturally tight nations and\nnations with higher levels of government efficiency each had significantly slower COVID-19 20\ninfection rates. Figure 2 illustrates these relationships, and Table 1 lists the model coefficients.\nanalysis, with larger nodes indicating more days. 5\nWe next tested the interaction of cultural tightness and government efficiency on growth\nrates of COVID-19. This model found a significant interaction between tightness and efficiency, b = -.17, SE = .07, t(41) = -2.23, p = .031, such that cultural tightness significantly predicted slower rates of COVID-19 cases amongst governments with relatively high (1 SD above the\nmean) efficiency, b = -.19, SE = .08, t(41) = -2.28, p = .028, but not with governments with 5\nrelatively low (1 SD below the mean) efficiency, b = .08, SE = .12, t(41) = .68, p = .499. Conversely, government efficiency predicted a slower rate of COVID-19 cases for nations that had relatively high (1 SD above the mean) cultural tightness, b = -.36, SE = .16, t(41) = -2.35, p = .024, but not nations with relatively low (1 SD below the mean) cultural tightness, b = -.03, SE\n= .12, t(41) = .23, p = .818. 10\nTo put this interaction into context, our models predicted that nations with mean levels of\ncultural tightness and government efficiency would have a log-transformed rate of 1.41 new cases per million people per day. Nations with low cultural tightness and low government efficiency would have a similar log-transformed rate of 1.45 new cases per million. However,\nnations with high cultural tightness and high government efficiency would have a much lower 15\nlog-transformed rate of 1.06 new cases per million. Re-converting these log-transformed values through exponentiation suggests that, in the month (30 days) following the first COVID-19 case per million people, a tight nation with high government efficiency would have 103.21 fewer cases per million people than a loose nation with low government efficiency. For a nation the\nsize of the United States (327.2 million), this would translate to approximately 33,770 fewer 20\ncases. These estimated trajectories are displayed in Figure 3.\nefficiency x tightness regression coefficients, through exponentiating the coefficients from these 5\ncoefficients to account for the initial log transformation.\nWe next replicated these analyses for estimates of mortality likelihood. Because mortality\nlikelihood followed an exponential distribution, we performed logistic regression with an\nexponential distribution, with the number of days since the first confirmed case as a weight 10\nvariable as with our infection rate analysis. Culturally tight nations and nations with higher levels of government efficiency each had significantly lower death rates of COVID-19, suggesting that both national institutions and national culture play an important role in the infection rate and death toll of the COVID-19. Nations with more efficient governments may be better able to\ncontain the spread of the virus, and to reduce the probability that virus victims die. Likewise, culturally tighter nations appear to be better equipped to slow the rate of COVID-19 and prevent large-scale mortality from the virus. Table 2 lists the coefficients from these main effect models.\nmodel found a significant interaction between tightness and efficiency, b = -0.30, SE = .03, t(50) = 66.30, p < .001. This interaction was similar to the interaction we observed on infection rates, such that the mortality likelihood was similar for nations with low cultural tightness and\ngovernment efficiency (2.91%, 95% CI = [2.64, 3.21]) and for nations with moderate cultural 10\ntightness and government efficiency (2.72%, 95% CI = [2.58, 2.86]), but was much lower for nations with high tightness and high government efficacy (1.48%, 95% CI = [1.39, 1.58]). If we combine these estimates with our infection rate estimates for our first set of models, this would suggest that 1.43 more people per million will die every month in loose nations with low\ngovernmental efficiency than in tight nations with high government efficiency. For a nation the 15\nsize of the United States, this would translate to 467.90 total deaths, or 14.7% of the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 (N=3,170) in March in the United States.\nWe suggest that these findings may be crucially related to variance in individuals\u2019\nproclivity to cooperate in tight versus loose cultures under conditions of threat. To illustrate this\nmechanism, we draw from past game theory models of cultural tightness and the evolution of 5\ncooperation. These models do not aim to fully explain our observed data, but they do offer a potential mechanism for why tightness might be related to more adaptive responses to COVID19 and why this effect may be strongest in nations with high government efficiency.\nPrevious evolutionary game theory models have shown that under conditions of high\nthreat\u2014where payoffs are reduced for a population of agents\u2014mutual cooperation becomes 10\nessential for the population\u2019s survival (3). When threat is high and agents are connected in a fixed network (6), clusters of cooperative agents survive whereas individual defectors quickly die off, and cooperation spreads across the network. In the current geopolitical context, reduced payoff rates represent the survival pressures of COVID-19, and the demand for cooperation\nrepresents a heightened need for behaviors such as frequent hand-washing or social distancing 15\nthat may sometimes be costly to the individual but allow the group as a whole to survive (7).\nWe suggest that cultural tightness, which can be operationalized by stronger norms and a\nhigher rate of individual-level conformity, accelerates a population\u2019s responsiveness to threats such as COVID-19 by allowing agents to more efficiently conform to popular neighboring\nstrategies. When there is no threat, this heightened conformity is not necessarily functional, since 20\nagents may conform to successful individual defectors as well as successful groups of cooperators. But in the context of threat, group-based cooperation emerges as essential (3), and conformity will allow cooperation to quickly spread across a population of agents.\nWe illustrate this dynamic in an evolutionary model of agents playing prisoner\u2019s\ndilemmas in a 20 x 20 toroidal grid, with agents\u2019 payoff over time determining their fitness (i.e. their likelihood of dying and reproducing). Agents received a standard prisoner\u2019s dilemma payoff in this model (8) in addition to a base payoff, but their total payoff was reduced according\nto a level of threat \u03c4 which escalated over time (3). One hundred runs represented a loose culture 5\nin which agents have a low probability c of conforming to their neighbors\u2019 strategies (c = .05), whereas another 100 runs represented a tight culture in which agents have a higher probability of conforming (c = .20).\nFigure 4 shows that, in the early stages of the model where threat is low, tight and loose\ncultures are similarly likely to cooperate. However, as time passes and threat levels escalate, 10\nmutual cooperation becomes more essential and agents in tight cultures are able to mimic the behavior of cooperative groups more rapidly than agents in loose cultures. Since mutually cooperative agents received higher joint payoffs than defecting agents, agents in tight cultures were able to survive for longer than agents in loose cultures. Our supplemental materials\nsummarize this model in more depth and perform additional robustness checks and exploratory 15\nruns that suggest that strong normative conformity can be an effective evolutionary strategy during periods of intense threat.\nFigure 4. The results of an evolutionary game theory model of cooperation in the face of a threat such as COVID-19. The figure depicts 200 runs of the model, with each run containing 15,000 iterations. The shadow shows standard error. In 100 \u201ctight\u201d runs, agents had a high likelihood (c = .20) of conforming to their neighbors\u2019 prisoner\u2019s dilemma decisions. In 100 \u201cloose\u201d runs,\nagents had a lower likelihood (c = .05) of conforming to neighbors\u2019 decisions. The model also 5\nincluded a level of threat \u03c4 which started at a low level (5) and escalated every 1,500 iterations and reached its maximum value (27.5) in the 13,500th iteration of the model. The left panel of the plot displays cooperation rates over time, and the right side displays survival rates over time. At the highest level of threat, all agents die out, but at moderate-to-severe levels of threat, tightness\nbolsters agents\u2019 cooperation and survival rates. 10\nWhile this model does not explicitly incorporate government efficiency, it implies that\ntightness should be most effective when populations can rapidly introduce\u2014and allocate resources to enforce\u2014cooperative norms following a global threat such as COVID-19. If\ninstitutions do not supply agents with information about cooperative norms during a pandemic, 15\nor do not invest resources to help agents follow these norms, conformity may not be sufficient to counteract the effects of threat.\nOur empirical and theoretical data make a number of basic and applied contributions. We\nshow that, during a global pandemic, cultural and institutional factors can combine to influence\nnations\u2019 responses. Nations with strict norms and efficient governments may be able to quickly 20\nintroduce, support, and disseminate cooperative norms that increase a population\u2019s survival. These findings may also contain several important lessons for nations around the world. For example, governmental policies that increase communication between the public and private\nsectors may be able to put recommendations into action on a widespread scale. Loose cultures such as Spain and the United States should emphasize the importance of complying with social norms in mass communication about COVID-19, since individuals in these cultures have generally experienced less ecological threat (1) and may therefore be more likely to\nunderestimate the risk of the virus and have reactance to having increased constraint. We 5\nemphasize that, while temporarily tightening norms is likely key to reducing the threat from COVID-19, groups can loosen norms once threat subsides. These recommendations should complement existing behavioral insights into how people and groups should manage the economic and health impacts of the pandemic (9).\nWe note several important caveats in our analysis. First, our data are correlational, which 10\nmeans we cannot infer causation from these findings. Nevertheless, we do take several steps to address this limitation, including controlling for important covariates (e.g. societal wealth, inequality, average age), employing a longitudinal design, and building an evolutionary game theory model with causal dynamics. Second, government efficiency and cultural tightness are not\nthe only other factors that are important for curtailing COVID-19, and our own analyses suggest 15\nthat more developed countries are also at risk for high infection rates. Third, our data focus on the early spread of COVID-19. Since loose cultures have higher creativity than tight cultures (1,10), they may be able to develop more innovative long-term methods of countering the virus. Indeed, it may be that cultural tightness is more effective in the early stages of threats such as the\ncurrent pandemic whereas cultural looseness is more effective at the later stages, after threats 20\nhave been initially contained.\nFinally, we note that strong norms to fight COVID-19 do not imply that governments\nshould become autocratic. Autocratic responses to COVID-19 may actually exacerbate its\neffects. Indeed, some research suggests that extreme levels of tightness can negative affect the well-being of individuals in a nation (11) and can impair group creativity (10). While it is important for governments to introduce and regulate beneficial norms (e.g. social distancing, effective handwashing) and coordinate social action (e.g. distribution of testing kits and\nventilators), authoritarian responses to COVID-19 may do long-term damage to the autonomy 5\nand well-being of a nation\u2019s citizens.\nCOVID-19 has already reshaped our world, and if we are to effectively combat the virus,\nwe must reshape our cultures and institutions. Here we offer two factors\u2014cultural tightness and government efficiency\u2014that predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus and determine whether\nthe virus has a high mortality rate. While these factors are rooted in cultural evolutionary studies 10\nof human history, they make important predictors for our future. Our findings suggest that strong norms and efficient leadership may be the keys to saving millions of lives in the months to come."}, {"heading": "References and Notes:", "text": "1. Gelfand, M.

Distribution of Dependent Variables\nPrior to estimating our models, we examined the distributions of infection rate and\nmortality likelihood. These models found that infection rate was relatively normally distributed,\nwhereas mortality likelihood had an exponential distribution. In other words, some nations had a 5\nfar higher rate of recorded mortalities than most nations. For regression, this implied that a traditional OLS approach with gaussian distribution would be appropriate for modeling infection rate, whereas a generalized linear model with an exponential distribution would be better suited to analyze mortality likelihood. We adopted these models in our hypothesis tests.\n10\nFigure S1. The distribution of infection rate and morality likelihood across nations. Infection rate was normally distributed, whereas mortality likelihood was highly skewed.\n2. Other Potential Factors Related to the COVID-19 Rate of Infection.\nOur models also included several important covariates, including GDP per Capita, Gini 15\ncoefficient, and median age of each nation.

We also investigated population density, which could theoretically lead to more rapid rates of infections. However, population density was not significantly related to infection rate, and was actually non-significantly negatively related to infection rate, r = -.07, p = .38. Nevertheless, we confirmed that, when population\ndensity was modeled along GDP per capita\u2014the only control which significantly predicted 5\nCOVID-19 infection rates, tightness (b = -.14, p = .048) and government efficiency (b = -.20, p = .003) both remained significant predictors of infection rate, and their interaction remained significant (b = -.15, p = .031)."}, {"heading": "3. Theoretical Model Details and Robustness Checks. 10", "text": "Agents are embedded in a 20 \u00d7 20 toroidal (i.e., wrap-around) grid. Each agent has a\nstrategy, which is either cooperate or defect. The simulation starts with a grid that is fully occupied by agents whose strategies are chosen randomly, with both strategies being equally likely. Then the simulation repeatedly performs the following sequence of updating steps:\n1) Immigration: At a randomly chosen empty site, a new agent appears whose strategy is 15\nequally likely to be cooperate or defect.\n2) Interaction: In each iteration, each agent gets a base payoff = 30 from the environment,\nindependent of payoffs it gets from interactions. Each agent also plays typical cooperation games (Table S1) with all of its alive neighbors on the grid, and receives interaction payoffs from the\ngames. Agents\u2019 actions are chosen according to their strategies, which is either cooperate of 20\ndefect. All the pairs in the grid play the games in a random order.\nTable S1.

Thus, an agent\u2019s final payoff, \u03c0, in each iteration is\nas defined in Eq. 1. These payoffs are not cumulative across iterations. 5\n\u03c0 = base payoff + interaction payoff \u2013 \u03c4.

The death probability of an 15\nagent is a function of its fitness, f(\u03c0), defined by Eq. 3. As an agent\u2019s fitness increases, the death probability of the agent decreases as shown in Figure S2.

Drawing upon the Parasite Model of Democratization (Thornhill, R., Fincher, C. L., & Aran, D. (2009), parasites, democratization, and the liberalization of values across contemporary countries, Biological Reviews, 84(1), 113-131) across two large, preregistered experiments conducted in the USA and Poland (total N = 1,237), we examined the psychological and political consequences of this unprecedented pandemic. By manipulating saliency of COVID-19, we demonstrate that activating thinking about coronavirus elevates Americans' and Poles' anxiety and indirectly promotes their social conservatism as well as support for more conservative presidential candidates. The pattern obtained was consistent in both countries and it implies that the pandemic may result in a shift in political views. Both theoretical and practical consequences of the findings are discussed.\nKeywords: COVID-19; personal need for structure; social conservatism; political choices;\nelections; USA; Poland\nWhen in danger, turn right: Covid-19 threat promotes social conservatism and right-wing presidential candidates\nSince December 2019, the world is facing a colossal challenge \u2013 a pandemic of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) (1, 2). As of March 23rd, 2020, more than 331,000 people were diagnosed as infected with COVID-19, out of which more than 14,000 people perished. While COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s economic consequences are tackled in the literature (3, 4), still little is known about its social and political corollaries. As the spread of SARS-CoV-2 coincides with presidential elections both in the United States and in Poland, we sought to examine whether coronavirus influences political preferences. We hypothesized the pandemic will shift people into the more conservative end of the political spectrum, and we tested potential mechanisms of elevated fear, need for structure, and conservatism.\nWhen threatened by pathogens, such as to SARS-COV-2 responsible for the current\npandemic, people\u2019s default line of defense happens via somatic immune responses. These can be supplemented by a set of various tendencies that constrain contacts with disease-causing parasites, a so-called behavioral immune system (5, 6). These supplementary tendencies range from cognitive, through motivational and affective to behavioral (7, 8) and are collectively expediting detection and avoidance of potential disease carriers (9). While behavioral immune system is adaptive and beneficial to humans (8), it can sometimes become overgeneralized. Specifically, it can trigger attitudes and behaviors that are no longer addressing the factual threat only, but also a whole spectrum of similar targets (10, 11).\nNormally, reducing interpersonal contact forms a behavioral buffer against diseases,\nespecially if this contact is with outgroup members or novel objects. This is how the behavioral immune system works: once the risk of pathogens transmission is salient, people tend to be less extraverted, less open to experience, more risk averse (5), more ethnocentric (12), and more prejudiced toward unfamiliar outgroups (10). When prevalence of pathogens is large and constant, such norms can become culturally formalized, and can start playing a role in shaping political\nideologies. Specifically, pathogen prevalence seems to be robustly correlated to collectivism (13). In collectivistic countries, adherence to norms and traditions is especially pronounced (5, 14). Also, regions where, historically, the level of pathogens is higher are characterized by higher tendency to believe in \u201ccontagious and agentic spiritual forces of evil\u201d (lay theory known as moral vitalism). Such beliefs comprise deluded understanding and control over infectious diseases as well as reinforced strategies to avoid containment (15). Moral vitalism mediates the effect of the history of parasites on conservative ideologies. Because parasite stress has been shown to shape political and ideological orientations, it became the core of our interest in the context of current events.\nOne integrative framework that highlights the role of environmental threats in the formation\nof democratization has been proposed by Thornhill et al. (14) and labelled as a Parasite Model of Democratization. It posits that collectivism, autocracy, women\u2019s subordination relative to men\u2019s status, and women\u2019s sexual restrictiveness, all flourished in countries with prevalence of infectious diseases. The opposite ends of these values (individualism, democracy, women\u2019s rights, freedom and increased participation in casual sex) developed in countries with little to no prevalence of infectious diseases (14). Additional evidence comes from observations that liberalization of social values in Europe mirrored decreased prevalence of infectious diseases due to technological progress and that liberal ideologies are more frequent in regions of higher latitude, where parasite stress tends to be lower (14).\nSeveral studies explicitly tested the hypothesis that social conservatism may be related to\nparasite stress. For example, in a study covering 30 nations, national parasite stress was found to be related to traditionalism (16). This hypothesis was also confirmed by Terrizzi and colleagues\u2019 (17) meta-analysis, which revealed that activation of the behavioral immune system was positively related to right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, religious fundamentalism, ethnocentrism, collectivism, and political conservatism. These elements constitute core values of current right-wing social conservative political movements, but do not constitute economic conservatism (17).\nThe current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to activate the behavioral\nimmune system in affected populations. Considering the solid theoretical framework, along with numerous studies providing convincing evidence (16\u201318), we predict that exposure to cues of coronavirus (SARS COV 2) will elevate conservatism. Following Terrizzi et al., 2013, we expect social conservatism only to increase as a function of parasite stress, because economic conservatism is not directly related to pathogen defense strategies (19). This, in turn, can affect political choices of individuals and promote socially conservative candidates in elections. Our research does not only test for these direct effects of the salience of pathogen exposure. We also investigate potential cognitive and affective mechanisms of this change. As the behavioral immune system emerges in order to protect humans from pathogens, a potential psychological mechanism driving this effect leads through the emotion of fear and anxiety. Indeed, fear and uncertainty aversion are good candidates for triggering psychological motives that eventually lead to political conservatism (18, 20).\nConsistently with the hypothesis that fear drives preference for social conservatism,\nconservative individuals who affiliate with right-wing ideologies perceive the world as more dangerous and threatening than liberals do (21, 22). Threat primarily entails negative affect, which leads people to more conservative attitudes through motivation to avoid uncertain situations (23). For more direct evidence, during periods of high social, political or economic threat, the appeal of right-wing conservatism is enhanced (24\u201326). For instance, McCann\u2019s (1997) analysis of presidential elections in the United States showed that during threatening election years, highly conservative winners tended to obtain a wider victory margin, compared with non-threatening election years.\nFor cognitive mechanisms of how threat of pathogens could increase social conservatism, we\nconsider the epistemic need for structure: a desire for predictability and for unambiguity (27). In general, people seem to find predictable individuals as morally superior (28) and give moral premium to predictable acts (29). The need for structure is correlated to conservatism (30\u201333). An unpredictable pandemic that threatens all humans is very likely to strengthen the need to see\nstructure in the world, as when threat is boosted people tend to seek a sense of comprehension of ongoing events (15, 23).\nThe current situation of the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) is most certainly regarded as\nthreatening and fear-inducing (34). As the spread of pathogens (SARS-CoV-2) coincides with presidential elections both in the United States and Poland, we sought to examine whether coronavirus influences political preferences through elevated fear, need for structure, and conservatism.\nThe Present Study\nAcross two preregistered experiments conducted in the USA and Poland (total N = 1,237) we manipulated saliency of COVID-19 and measured the consequences of this saliency on Americans\u2019 and Poles\u2019 anxiety, their need for structure, all the way to their social conservatism and support for presidential candidates. As presidential elections in both these countries are planned for 2020, we found it relevant and interesting to examine whether the new situation created by coronavirus might eventually impact voters' preferences. Our results do support this prediction by demonstrating that thinking about coronavirus makes Americans and Poles more anxious. Next, we observed that anxiety translates into a stronger personal need for closure, which in turn promotes social conservatism and support for more right-wing candidates.\nMethod\nThis research was preregistered. All materials and data are available here https://osf.io/ynd6r/ Participants The Polish part of the study involved 604 Polish adults (341 women, 57%; age range: 18-90, M = 39.47, SD = 13.59), while the US part involved 633 American adults (333 women, 53%; age range 18- 65, M = 40.86, SD = 13.00). Materials Positive and Negative Affect and Anxiety. Participants\u2019 affect was measured using the international Positive and Negative Affect Scale short form (I-PANAS-SF) (35). The scale consists of 10 items: 5\nmeasuring positive and 5 measuring negative affect. The reliability of positive and negative affect was acceptable in both countries: positive affect USA \u03b1 = .76 and Poland \u03b1 = .67; negative affect USA \u03b1 = .82 and Poland \u03b1 = .87. Given the goal of this project, we only investigated items directly related to anxiety. The \u201canxiety\u201d variable was created by averaging two items (\u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cafraid\u201d) in the USA (\u03b1 = .82) and three items in Poland (\u201cnervous\u201d, afraid\u201d and \u201calert\u201d \u2013 given the specific meaning of the last adjective in the Polish language, making it semantically close to \u201cconcerned\u201d or \u201cdisturbed\u201d, \u03b1 = .86). For robustness check, we repeated all analyses for the Polish sample using only the same two adjectives as in the USA; the results were identical, apart from marginally weaker effects, likely caused by restriction range. Other adjectives were not analyzed, but are available for third-party secondary analysis (36). Personal Need for Structure. Epistemic need for closure was measured by Neuberg and Newsom\u2019s (27) Personal Need for Structure scale (PNS). PNS consists of 12 items (e.g. \u201cI enjoy having a clear and structured mode of life\u201d and \u201cI like to have a place for everything and everything in its place\u201d). Its reliability was satisfactory in both countries: USA \u03b1 = .78 and Poland \u03b1 = .80. Conservatism. To measure participants\u2019 conservatism, we used a Social and Economic Conservatism Scale (SECS) (37). The scale consists of 12 items; participants declare their positivity or negativity toward each of the items using a 0-100 scale, with a pre-defined interval of 10. Seven items are devoted to social conservatism (e.g. \u201cmilitary and national security,\u201d \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d) and 5 related to economic conservatism (e.g. \u201cfiscal responsibility,\u201d \u201climited government\u201d). Given the specificity of the Polish context, we decided to omit one item from the economic conservatism scale \u2013 \u201cgun ownership,\u201d as it is inadequate for a Polish reality. Reliability of the social conservatism scale was appropriate in both samples: US \u03b1 = .83 and Poland \u03b1 = .81, while the economic conservatism scale reliability was poor, US \u03b1 = .54 and Poland \u03b1 = .56. The overall scale yielded good reliability in both countries, US \u03b1 = .84 and Poland \u03b1 = .80. Political Preferences. Participants answered a set of questions regarding their political preferences and voting intentions. In both countries, participants were presented with leading presidential\ncandidates. In the USA, the candidates were: the current president \u2013 Donald Trump as well as potential candidates of the Democratic party: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Michael Bloomberg, and Tulsi Gabbard. In Poland, the candidates were: the current president \u2013 Andrzej Duda and registered candidates with the strongest support in election polls: Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, a candidate nominated by the leading opposition party: Civic Platform; Robert Biedro\u0144, a candidate nominated by a leftist Democratic Left Alliance party; W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, nominated by Polish People\u2019s Party; Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, an independent candidate, former media celebrity and writer; and Krzysztof Bosak, nominated by a right-wing Confederation party.\nParticipants answered a number of questions that were universal for both countries and a\nsmall number of specific ones. Country-universal questions were related to a candidate considered for voting (identified from a list of candidates; a multiple-choice question), as well as the first-choice candidate (a single-choice question). Both these variables were dummy coded for all candidates, with 0 = not mentioned and 1 = mentioned. Additionally, all participants evaluated the leading candidates' fit for the president's office using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = a terrible candidate for presidency, 5 = an excellent candidate for presidency). Country-specific questions were related to either a considered candidate\u2019s choice in the second round (specific for Poland, where two election rounds are organized if none of the candidates obtains more than 50% of votes) or perceived best candidate for democratic nominations with J. Biden and B. Sanders being included. Specific questions also addressed previous choices of the participants, namely, their voting decisions in 2015 in the US and in 2016 in Poland. Procedure Our procedure consisted of two steps presented to the participants as two unrelated studies. In the first study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups and presented with three short press reports. They were asked to evaluate the quality of press reports on three questions (i.e. the press report is interesting and riveting; the vocabulary of the press report is understandable; the press report addresses socially relevant issues), using a seven-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = I\ncompletely agree, to 7 = I completely disagree). In the control group, there were two neutral press reports and one press report about climate change, whereas in the experimental group, there were two neutral press reports (exactly the same as in the control group) and one press report about Coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). In both languages, the press reports were equivalent and of similar length (i.e. English versions: 120-129 words; Polish versions: 100-106 words). We did not analyze the ratings of the press reports\u2019 quality, as the goal of the first part was to merely present participants with either a press report about coronavirus or not, and make them read the reports carefully. Three single-choice questions regarding the content of each of the press reports served as attention check. We used only the data from participants who answered all of these questions correctly. In the second part of the study, participants filled the I-PANAS-SF, PNS, SECS, and answered questions related to their political preferences and considered choices.\nResults\nThe Impact of Coronavirus Exposure on Anxiety\nConsistently with our predictions, increasing the salience of coronavirus threat elevated the\nlevel of anxiety (see Figure 1), with a stronger effect among Poles, t(602) = 5.86, p < .001, d = 0.48, 95% confidence intervals for d: 0.35, 0.69, than Americans, t(631) = 2.04, p = .04, d = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.35. This overall effect, albeit significant, should be considered relatively low in the US, and at best moderate in Poland. It is important to note that data in Poland were collected on March 12th and in USA on March 13th. According to World Health Organization (WHO situation reports 52 and 53, 2020), there were only 44 Coronavirus positive cases (no deaths) in Poland on the date of the study, and as many as 1,264 positive cases (and 36 deaths) in the US. Salience of the threat could have already been high in the US, so our manipulation could not increase it much further."}, {"heading": "Overall Evaluation of Candidates for Presidency", "text": "Both Americans and Poles answered a set of questions evaluating the most likely candidates for presidency. Participants indicated their considered and first choice candidates, as well as assessed each candidate\u2019s fit for the president's office. Based on these evaluations, in both countries, we found a clear and similar pattern of perceived fit and overall support for candidates, allowing us to cluster candidates. In the USA, the expected distinction occurred between D. Trump and all democratic candidates for the nomination, while in Poland, Andrzej Duda and Krzysztof Bosak (a candidate of the right-wing Confederation party) formed a conservative pole, and the remaining candidates were clustered together (Figure 2).\nWe created separate aggregate scores for both countries, with higher results denoting support for conservative candidates (D. Trump in the USA; A. Duda and K. Bosak in Poland), and lower scores indicating support for liberal and democratic candidates. The results of detailed analyses conducted for all candidates separately are presented in the online supplementary material. Does Activating Thinking About Coronavirus Indirectly Support Conservative Candidates?\nOur preregistered analysis posited complex sequential mediation. More specifically, we\ntested the extent to which anxiety caused by information about coronavirus translates into a higher personal need for structure, which then informs social conservatism and a tendency to support conservative presidential candidates. This reasoning was confirmed in both countries (Figure 3). Among both Americans and Poles, increasing salience of coronavirus resulted in significantly higher anxiety, which then translated into a higher personal need for structure that increased higher social conservatism as well as support for conservative candidates and rejection of liberal ones (Figure 3).\nThere is an alternative explanation for why we found increased support for ruling presidents over their counterparts. Indeed, they are both conservative, but also their election constitutes status quo. Therefore, participants threatened with coronavirus could increase their support for D. Trump and A. Duda for any of these reasons. Fortunately, the Polish case provides a useful comparison in terms of K. Bosak \u2013 a minority candidate (according to the polls, his support is lowest among all candidates tested, with about 4-5% of adult Poles declaring choosing this candidate in the first round of elections (see http://ewybory.eu/wybory-prezydenckie-2020/sondaze-prezydenckie/) and K. Bosak is considered more right-wing than the ruling president, A. Duda. As Table 1 shows, the indirect effect we found was replicated when K. Bosak\u2019s overall fit for the president office was considered, but the effect was not significant when participants declared how they were actually going to vote. In other words, making coronavirus salient indirectly improved K. Bosak\u2019s perception and assessed his fit for president\u2019s office, yet this effect was not strong enough to generalize into considering this candidate in the election.\nAfter increasing salience of the pandemic, we not only observed increased support for\nconservative candidates, but we also observed decreased support for liberal candidates. Two potential democratic party candidates leading in the polls, namely Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who are moderate and liberal, have their mirror-like reflections on the Polish political stage: Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska and Robert Biedro\u0144, who are moderate and liberal, respectively. As illustrated in Table 1, when selecting from the two counter-candidates, people preferred moderate over leftist candidates. Specifically, people preferred J. Biden over B. Sanders, and M. KidawaB\u0142o\u0144ska over R. Biedro\u0144. These observations from two independent political systems and cultures evidence robustness of our findings.\nNote. *p < .05, estimated based on 5000 bootstrap-corrected 95% confidence intervals\nINDIRECT EFFECTS\nDiscussion In a large-scale, preregistered experiment, we found evidence for a shift in political views of individuals threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, we show that those who feel threatened react with anxiety, tend to seek greater structure in their environment, and thus shift toward social conservatism. All of this increases the support for conservative presidential candidates. A great value of our research is the observed similarity of this effect in two countries: Poland and United States. Different in many aspects, these populations still exhibited the same pattern of results. Further, our findings cohere with political ideology shifts following terrorist attacks (38). Hence, the results suggest a universal character of the threat-to-conservatism path.\nOur results have crucial, practical implications, since they suggest that forthcoming elections\ncan be biased toward right-wing, conservative candidates. People simply seek stability and order, which seem to be more pronouncedly exhibited by conservative candidates. Our findings also have important theoretical implications, as the current pandemic created a unique opportunity to validate the Parasite Model of Democratization (14). We found strong support for it \u2013 pathogen threat boosted preference of values typical for social conservatism. We also provided evidence against an alternative explanation of threat boosting support for status quo, because support was also greater for less liberal (or more centrist) counter-candidates, if participants were to choose among them.\nRegarding applicability of our findings, we believe that all candidates should reframe their\npolitical communication. In the moral foundation theory (39, 40), loyalty and authority constitute the so-called binding values. These moral values are more prominent in conservatives but are not ignored by liberally oriented individuals either. Hence, communication appealing to these values may be an efficient way to mitigate the shift of values in societies: they are accepted by the core supporters of liberal candidates and are actively sought by individuals affected by the coronavirus threat.\nIn general, our results highlight how important it is for people to perceive the world as a\nstable and predictable place. This preference is even stronger in times of chaos. Those interested in\nhuman behavior should consider its importance in the current models explaining how we judge and think.\nReferences\n1. S. H.

With the first exported cases reported in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea in mid-January, the Chinese government chose to take action by imposing an emergency lockdown beginning on January 23, 2020, requiring people to remain in the area and self-quarantine. In response to the quickly spreading virus, many governments around the world followed by recommending, some even mandating, social distancing or quarantine measures.\namounts of uncertainty: Schools are closed or transitioned online, jobs are either substantially reimagined or eliminated altogether, people are testing positive for the virus without showing symptoms, and knowing when the containment of COVID-19 will bring normalcy is impossible. In the meantime, while people wait to see how the virus progresses and when vaccines will become available, social distancing and quarantine are the new normal for many. How can people hold their rising distress at bay as quarantine conditions persist and concerns about the impact of the virus grow?"}, {"heading": "Harnessing Flow and Mindfulness While Coping with Uncertainty", "text": "Two promising candidates for effective coping during the COVID-19 pandemic are flow\nand mindfulness. Flow is a state in which people become absorbed in an enjoyable activity, such that they become blind to their external environment and unconcerned about the self or the passage of time (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). To reach a flow state, people must engage in an intrinsically rewarding activity that is just challenging enough to match one\u2019s skill level and that provides clear goals and feedback. A large body of evidence links flow to greater well-being in a variety of domains, including work (Eisenberger et al., 2005; Fullagar, & Kelloway, 2009), sports (Jackson et al., 1998), collective gatherings and rituals (Zumeta et al., 2016), and general leisure activities (Isham, Gatersleben, & Jackson, 2019). Most relevant to this study, flow is effective for boosting emotional well-being during stressful periods of uncertainty (Rankin, Walsh, & Sweeny, 2018). Notably, researchers have documented the benefits of flow across a number of cultures and countries, including Japan (Asakawa, 2004; Asakawa, 2010), Czech Republic (Brom et al., 2016), Hong Kong (Ho et al., 2017), Sweden (Mosing, Butkovic, & Ullen, 2018), and Italy (Bassi et al., 2014).\nattentive to one\u2019s current internal and external experience, focusing on the present moment and observing without judgment (Martin, 1997). Traditionally a Buddhist teaching, mindfulness has become an asset to medicine, healthcare, and psychology (Batchelor, 1994; Brown & Ryan, 2003; Brown, Ryan, & Creswell, 2007; Kabat\u2010Zinn, 2003; Shapiro et al., 2006). As with flow, a large body of evidence links mindfulness to greater well-being, including lower depression and anxiety (Brown & Ryan, 2003), less psychological distress and invasive negative thoughts (Coffry & Hartman, 2008), and more positive thinking (Hanley & Garland, 2014). A metaanalysis of 163 studies (d = .28; Sedlmeier et al., 2012) confirmed that practicing mindfulness meditation is associated with greater well-being on a number of metrics. Most relevant to the current investigation study, mindfulness promotes effective coping during periods of acute uncertainty (Sweeny & Howell, 2017).\nFlow and mindfulness are similar in that they both involve focused attention on the\npresent moment. They are also both accessible via active engagement in specific activities\u2014that is, one does not have to be a particular kind of person to experience flow or mindfulness (e.g., flow: Keller, Ringelhan, & Blomann, 2011; Rogatko, 2009; mindfulness: Garland et al., 2015; Hawley et al., 2014). However, they differ in important ways. Most notably, flow reduces selfawareness and awareness of one\u2019s external environment, whereas mindfulness draws one\u2019s attention to internal and external experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Reid, 2011; Shapiro et al., 2006). In fact, experimental work has shown that flow and mindfulness are antithetical. When people practice mindfulness prior to engaging in a flow-inducing activity, they report feeling less absorbed in the activity (Sheldon, Prentice, & Halusic, 2014).\nof stressful uncertainty, specifically the rise of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other affected cities in China. We hypothesized that a longer quarantine would be associated with poorer well-being and that flow and mindfulness would protect well-being overall during this period. We further hypothesized that flow and mindfulness may play different roles in mitigating the deleterious effects of quarantine length on well-being. Because flow states reduce self-awareness and speed the apparent passage of time (i.e., time \u201cflies by\u201d), we anticipated that it may be particularly effective for reducing the impact of longer quarantines on well-being. We did not have a strong a priori prediction about the role of mindfulness in moderating that link.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants and Procedure", "text": "Participants in China (N = 5115; 73% female; Mage = 21.36, SDage = 4.49, range 15-71)\nwere recruited online between February 12-19, 2020. Nearly all participants had at least a Masters-level education (97%; only 3.5% had PhD), 28% had at least one sibling, and 51% reported a household income of less than $50,000/year. We recruited as many participants as possible during the relevant period of time. We did not conduct a power analysis; however, our sample size is more than sufficient for the relevant analyses at nearly any effect size.\nThe online survey was hosted on IQEQ, a dedicated online research platform with a\nmobile-friendly interface for smartphones and tablets, which was developed by one of the coauthors (R.Z.) at Nanjin University. Participant recruitment was targeted at college students via social media (WeChat platform). No course credit or monetary reward was offered for participants. The survey took participants an average of 8.99 minutes to complete. The study was approved by the IRB at Nanjing University.\nDue to the challenging context in which this study was conducted, we were only able to\nsurvey our participants once. Thus, our primary measures asked participants to respond based on their experiences in the past week in an effort to capture general experiences during that period of time rather than experiences on what could have been an idiosyncratic day.

With the\nexception of worry (weak association) and unhealthy behavior (positive association), participants who were more mindfulness reported better well-being. However, in contrast to flow, mindfulness did not significantly moderate the association between quarantine length and any measure of well-being.2\nDiscussion\nThis study provides a unique opportunity to understand the experiences of people at\nground zero for a worldwide pandemic, nearly in real-time. As we write this paper in March 2020, the rate of new cases of COVID-19 has slowed considerably in China; however, the number of new cases in the U.S. and Europe is rising rapidly, and millions of people worldwide are currently in or will soon enter some form of quarantine. As such, our findings provide timely guidance to those experiencing distress associated with quarantine conditions.\nSpecifically, the findings reveal three key insights about this unique and stressful\nexperience, which may generalize to similar periods of open-ended uncertainty. First, people who had endured a longer quarantine reported poorer well-being by many definitions: more worry, more negative emotions, more depressive and anxious symptoms, more loneliness, and more unhealthy behaviors. Second, both experiencing flow and practicing mindfulness seem to\n2Because of the majority of the sample was not yet in quarantine, we also ran models coding quarantine length as - 0.5 = no quarantine (n = 3762), +0.5 = 14+ days of quarantine (n = 934). The results were nearly identical, except that flow no longer significantly moderated the associations between loneliness and quarantine length (just below significance) or unhealthy behavior and quarantine length, and mindfulness no longer showed a main effect on loneliness (just below significance).\nChina in February 2020, regardless of quarantine status or length. Comparing effect sizes in Table 1, flow seemed particularly helpful for mitigating loneliness, promoting healthy behaviors, and mitigating unhealthy behaviors, whereas mindfulness was more helpful for mitigating negative emotions and anxious symptoms\u2014although mindfulness was also associated with greater loneliness and more unhealthy behavior. Flow and mindfulness were approximately equally associated with elevated positive emotions and reduced depressive symptoms.\nThird, and perhaps most novel, flow\u2014but not mindfulness\u2014seemed to break the link\nbetween quarantine length and well-being deficits. In fact, people in a lengthy quarantine who reported higher-than-average flow experiences in the past week (i.e., +1 SD) were no worse off than people who were not yet quarantined on many measures of well-being, statistically speaking (see Table 2). Length of quarantine remained a significant predictor of worry and loneliness among those high in flow (albeit a far weaker predictor than among those low in flow), which suggests that worry and loneliness may be particularly stubborn forms of distress during quarantine. In contrast, mindfulness did not moderate any link between quarantine length and well-being.\nWhy did flow so consistently mitigate the deleterious effects of quarantine length\u2014and\nequally important, why did mindfulness not? In short, flow is a form of exquisite distraction, perfect for situations in which the primary goal is to make time pass more quickly (Rankin, Sweeny, & Xu, 2019; Rankin, Walsh, & Sweeny, 2018). As a quarantine wears on, people may find that the tedium of isolation allows their worries to run wild, with little else to keep their mind occupied. If instead people can find activities that absorb their attention, the days feel shorter and the weeks, therefore, more tolerable. Mindfulness, on the other hand, draws attention\nmindfulness is good for reducing distress in a given moment or on a given day during a widespread health crisis. However, mindfulness is nearly antithetical to distraction (in fact, a reverse-coded item on the scale used in this study is \u201cI have been easily distracted\u201d), and distraction may be the very best medicine to bolster well-being during a lengthy quarantine.\nAlthough our study had a number of strengths, most notably the large sample size and the\ntimely, highly significant real-world context, several weaknesses are worth noting. The study was cross-sectional, thus rendering our data incapable of testing causal hypotheses. We argue that our interpretation of the direction of effects is the most parsimonious, given our efforts to control for likely third variables and the well-established causal links between flow/mindfulness and well-being in other contexts. However, it is possible that some relationships are reciprocal, such that experiencing distress disrupts people\u2019s ability to find flow and remain mindful, or that we failed to assess relevant third variables. In addition, we would note that a large majority of our sample was not (yet) in quarantine at the time they completed the survey, although presumably all of our participants were keenly aware of the growing health crisis in their country and experienced significant disruptions to their lives. Ideally, we would have followed participants longitudinally as they passed in and out of quarantine restrictions, or at least had more even coverage across various lengths of quarantine. Finally, we were limited in the length of our survey by practical constraints, and thus we do not have information about the activities that most effectively or consistently promoted flow states. Other studies have found that although people seem capable of reporting on their flow states, they are less successful at identifying activities that are particularly flow-inducing (Rankin et al., 2018). Although flow activities are highly idiosyncratic, activities that provide the right level of challenge (not too hard, not too\n(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).\nDespite these limitations, this study offers a rare glimpse inside a community at the initial\nepicenter of a once-in-a-century pandemic. At the time the data were collected, Wuhan was unique in its strict restrictions and widespread quarantine orders. In the brief time since then, the crisis has grown and spread exponentially, such that people across the world are experiencing conditions like those of our participants. Our findings provide a glimmer of hope for people struggling with the challenges of social distancing or even complete quarantine: The time will pass more quickly if you find your flow.\nK.

To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e. medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious respect to both medicaland non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each predictor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to general population. Also psychological state, gender, and living area were important predictors of these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as gender and alcohol consumption. We discussed these results in the light of risk factors for psychological distress and possible interventions to meet the psychological needs of healthcare workers.\nKeywords: healthcare workers, risk perception, worry, COVID-19, coronavirus outbreak, distress, mental health, physicians, doctors, nurses."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "On December 31, 2019, some cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology have emerged in the Hubei region of China. Then, on January 7, 2020, the causative agent has been identified by means of oropharyngeal swabs, i.e. a virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family called SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). This new coronavirus was responsible of the respiratory syndrome called COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020). Most of the patients with positive swab test developed only minor symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, and pharyngitis, with a benign evolution and spontaneous resolution of the clinical picture. However, some patients developed severe complications, such as interstitial pneumoniae with acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and even death (Sohrabi et al., 2020). Patients at risk were in particular males, aged over sixty, suffering from cardiovascular comorbidities (e.g. arterial hypertension, diabetes, chronic coronary artery disease), affected by chronic pneumopathies or cancer (WHO, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).\nIn the following month, the disease spread to other countries outside China, including Italy, where the first\npositive cases were found on February 21, 2020; Spina et al., 2020). Italy experienced a significant increase in new cases, mostly in the month of March, in particular in the North regions, and this caused in turn a growing alarm throughout the Italian medical-hospital sector due to the imbalance between the resources of the national health system (indicated as SSN, i.e. \u2018Sistema Sanitario Nazionale\u2019) and the expected need for treatment required by the forecast on the spread of the virus. This concern was publicly expressed in the guidelines published by the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Intensive Care (named SIAARTI, i.e. \u2018Societ\u00e0 Italiana Anestesia, Analgesia, Rianimazione e Terapia Intensiva\u2019) on March 6, 2020, which reported that in case of huge imbalance between the real clinical needs of the population and the effective availability of intensive resources, medical doctors should select patients for intensive therapies basing on their actual hopes of survival (SIAARTI, 2020). In fact, in Italy there were about 5200 beds in total for intensive care units, and that on March 11, 2020, 1028 of these beds had already been destined to patients suffering from COVID-19. According to the predicted number of new cases, the peak of contagions would be reached by mid of April, when at least 4000 beds in the ICU (Intensive Care Units) would be needed in order to treat patients with COVID-19 (Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020), with significant consequences also for patients not affected by COVID-19, who would have less availability of assistance in the aforementioned units.\nHowever, while on the one hand doctors and other health workers multiplied their alarms relatively to this\ncritical situation and to the related recommendations regarding behaviors to be followed and the hygienic conduct to be implemented, on the other hand there were daily episodes of violation of such medical recommendations by the population, apparently only scarcely aware of the problem. For this reason, i.e. the failure of the unanimous spontaneous compliance of the population to the proposed hygienic rules and health practices, since February 23 the Italian Government implemented increasingly restrictive dispositions to limit the spread of the disease throughout the country with various Prime Minister Decrees (named DPCM, i.e. Decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri) (see DPCM on February 23, March 1, March 4, March 8, March 9, and March 11, 2020). In fact, a significant portion of population continued to engage in risky behaviors, prompting increasingly stricter rules emanated by the authorities. Therefore, a gap appeared to emerge between the indications and requests from the national health system staff and the reception of these same indications by the population, as well as a general difference in the perception and evaluation of the risks associated with the COVID-19 infection between the two groups. Such a difference seemed more evident especially in the areas of central and southern Italy, where the COVID-19 spread was at that moment less important than those of northern Italy, as reported by the daily data provided by the national civil protection (see Cereda et al., 2020).\nThe spread of the SARS-CoV virus in 2002 has shown how this type of epidemic disease has important\npsychopathological consequences, in the short and long term, in particular on health workers (Lung, Lu, Chang, & Shu, 2009; Maunder, 2009; Sim & Chua, 2004). Thus, in the actual spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus attention to psychological health of doctors and others healthcare workers had already been expressed regarding the Chinese situation relating to COVID-19 (see for example Xiang et al., 2020), with proposals for intervention and support from the hospital structures (Chen et al., 2020). In fact, Chinese health workers in Wuhan faced a situation characterized by poor safety and protection, with excessive workloads, high infectious risk in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and shortage of staff. This risky situation for one's own and loved ones' health could have clinical consequences, but also psychic ones. In fact, these health workers showed a symptomatology characterized by tiredness, worry, fear, frustration, isolation, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, anger, and negation (Kang et al., 2020). In particular, in this group of workers, women, workers with over 10 years of service and operators who had a history of past psychological suffering showed higher risk of stress, anxiety and depression (Zhu et al., 2020).\nA further risk factor for psychological distress could be a reduced social network support, as it increases the\nresilience to stressors (Ozbay et al., 2007). In the emergency situation caused by SARS-CoV-2, healthcare workers are indeed at high risk of acute stress, and this risk could be even higher if they feel such a disjunction from the social community formed by the other citizens, as the current situation in Italy seems to lead. In addition to the personal consequences on the psycho-physical health of the health professionals, this could easily lead to a progressive decline in their health services, with a worsening of the quality of care provided. The experience with the disease caused by H1N1 in Japan showed how policies that take care of healthcare and give physicians confidence positively affected the overall care they provide to the population (Imai, 2020; Maunder, 2009). For all these reasons, it is very important to study the trait and state psychological variables of healthcare workers as risk or protective factors respect to the actual stressful situation. In this manner, it would be possible to evaluate the analogies and the differences with the Chinese model at both intra-cultural and inter-cultural level (McCrae, 2001), for considering which intervention strategies could be suited for Italian healthcare workers and thus importing the most adequate recently developed for the Chinese healthcare system in response to the spread of COVID-19.\nIn such an emergency situation, characterized by contrasts between the opinions and the worries of medical\ndoctors on one side and the behaviors and the attitudes of general population on the other, we designed and conducted this study. On the basis of the evidences reported above, our objectives were i) to probe the opinions and the worries relative to COVID-19 spread in both general population and healthcare workers, ii) to study which demographic, geographic, and psychological variables were related to a higher perception of the health risks, and lastly iii) to assess any difference in risk perception relatively to COVID-19 between general population and healthcare workers. Thus, our aim was to understand the influence of psychological and training/working experience in shaping opinions, worries, and risk perception relatively to COVID-19. To this aim, we administered an online battery including a questionnaire about the direct experience, the opinions and the worries relative to the COVID-19, and some questionnaires evaluating the psychological distress state. To evaluate the distress level of participants, we administered questionnaires measuring perceived stress, anxiety, and death anxiety as they usually increased in general population (Brooks et al., 2020) and in healthcare workers (Brady, 2015; Kang et al., 2020) during emergency situation. As the social-health situation in Italy was evolving continuously in the beginning of March, we limited the data collection in the days 10-12 March 2020.\n2. Methods"}, {"heading": "2.1.

Where possible, we opted for short or brief version of each questionnaire, in order to contain the total number of items (45 total items). We included in our battery, among others, the following questionnaires:\n\u2022 The 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 2006), a questionnaire evaluating\nthe stress perceived by the participant in the last month, i.e. the participant\u2019s perceived feeling to be in control over external events, relationships, and emotional life. We used the short 4-item version. Each item was evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often).\n\u2022 The 6-item version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Marteau & Bekker, 1992), which assessed the\nanxiety of the participants on 6 items including emotions or feelings. Each item was evaluated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always).\n\u2022 The death anxiety scale of the Existential Concerns Questionnaire (ECQ; van Bruggen et al., 2017) which\nevaluated the anxiety of the participant relatively to his or her sense of finitude, to the fear of diseases and death. The total score was computed overall 5 items. Each item was evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always).\n\u2022 The Marlowe & Crowne social desirability scale (M&C; Manganelli Rattazzi, Canova, & Marcorin, 2000),\nwhich assessed the tendency of answering in a socially desirable manner. This version of the scale implied 9 items evaluated over a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (absolutely false) to 6 (absolutely true). We also developed a questionnaire about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-related experience and personal opinion.\nBoth authors LS and CG compiled a first list of items; then this list was revised by five experts (medical doctors and psychotherapists) in order to remove, change or add relevant items. We obtained a final list including 68 items. A complete list of the items was reported in Appendix A.

Data analysis", "text": "Data analysis was conducted with statistical software R, version 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2014). As first step, we assessed differences in our sample between MED and CONTROL groups for the demographic variables in order to control for un-balanced factors in our sample. We conducted these comparisons by means of t-tests for numerical data and of chisquared tests for frequencies. Then, we described the experiences about COVID-19 infection in our sample and compared MED and CONTROL groups again, as well as each group per area (North vs Center vs South Italy). We also compared the psychological state of our participants by group and area to assess difference in levels of anxiety, stress, and death anxiety. For these comparisons, we implied mixed-effect ANOVAs with one between factor (Group, 2 levels: MED vs CONTROL) and one within factor (Area, 3 levels: North, Center, South). We further decomposed significant main or interaction effects by means of LSD corrected post-hoc pairwise comparisons.\nAs main analysis, we computed hierarchical logistic regression on the dichotomic responses reported overall\nour participants about preoccupations, opinions, and behaviors relatively to their experience with the new coronavirus. This analysis allowed us to estimate the odds to obtain a positive response to a particular question given a set of parameters. For non-dichotomous variables (e.g. contagious spread in the next days could either increase, decrease, or stay stable) we created N dichotomous dummy variables, where N was the number of possible alternative responses to \u2018equal\u2019 response (e.g. for contagious spread in the next days we created a dummy variable for increased forecast and a dummy variable for decreased forecast). We used as reference the middle-point response, i.e. \u2018equal\u2019 response, and evaluated the propension to respond \u2018more\u2019 or \u2018less\u2019 respect to this point. Moreover, we did not analyze the questions for which we obtained identical or almost identical responses by all our participants, i.e. question with >98% of equal responses. In fact, for such questions was easy to find one of the outcome categories so underrepresented that it could lead to rare event outcome or be linearly separated by only one of the predictors.\nWe introduced the regressors in the model at different steps of computation. At the first step, we introduced the\ndemographic variables such as gender, age, area (with the North Italy as reference), relationship, number of children, religion belief (catholic or other confessions vs atheist or agnostics), presence of chronic or pre-existent diseases, number of cigarettes smoked per day, alcohol consumption, and utilization of public transportation. At the second step, we added to these variables the psychological state factors of perceived stress (PSS score), anxiety (STAI score), and death anxiety (ECQ score), in order to investigate the contribution of these regressors. As last step, we investigated the difference between MED and CONTROL groups in responding to the questionnaire. For this aim, at the third step we introduced the group variable as regressor."}, {"heading": "3.

Frequencies were compared by means of chi-squared test within each group (or overall sample) with the independent variable of zone.\nFor the overall sample, we found an effect of the living area on: question 3, about the presence of symptoms\nrelated to COVID-19, \u03c72(2)=44.48, p<.01; question 4, about thinking that the symptoms relate to a COVID-19 infection, \u03c72(2)=11.64, p<.01; question 6, about the quarantine status, \u03c72(2)=30.67, p<.01; question 7, about contact with people at risk of infection, \u03c72(2)=21.87, p<.01; question 9, about the presence of positive case in the living area or city, \u03c72(2)=132.71, p<.01.

The interaction was due to a significant difference in anxiety between MED participants from North respect to MED participants from Center and South Italy, ps<.01, and respect to CONTROL participants from Center Italy, p<.01. This analysis thus revealed that MED group participants from North Italy reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than the general population and the medical and paramedical staff from other living areas.\n3.3. Descriptive statistics of the questionnaire about COVID-19\nBefore conducting the regression analysis on the questionnaire data, we reported some descriptive information and statistics about the response frequency of participants. Response frequencies for each item overall sample as well as divided by group were reported in Table 3, left group of columns. Here we reported also a chi-squared test comparing the frequency of \u201cyes\u201d response for the two groups.\nOf note, 57% of participants thought to be at risk of contagion, but only 18% thought to be at risk when the first\ncases appeared in Italy. They also thought that their loved ones would be at risk (65%). MED group reported higher frequency of thinking to be at risk (71%). Many participants in this group (57%) were scared about health consequences or death if infected, but almost all (93%) were more worried for familiar or loved ones\u2019 consequences of infection. Similarly, the 73% of them reported worries about the global socio-political implication of virus spread, and the 83% about the possible collapsing of the national health system. Moreover, 83% of them thought that people\u2019s behavior could be ever scaring that the infection, and 73% was worried by increased aggression risk for health workers in the near future.\nMost of our sample (97%) reported to adhere to hygiene measures and to avoid public events or places (94%),\nand only few participants reported to have risky behaviors for themselves (18%) or their family (17%). However, only 16% of CONTROL and 6% of MED believed that people\u2019s behavior was adequate to the situation. About violation of the public health dispositions, most of participants thought that violation should be punished more severely (90%) or that the national army should be implied (91%), as they reported to be preoccupied or angry toward such violations (89%). Few reported to have bought more canned food (23%) and very few participants reported that they would try to escape if the infection would spread in their living area (2%), even if a great part of them (71%) believed that the infection fear could be considered a valid reason to break the containment rules.\nAbout the possible problem of accessing health care services, most of participants (71%) believed in the national\nhealth system, whereas few thought that it was right to give priority to people with greater hope of survival in case of shortage of hospital beds (25%) and even less (5%) that they would accept an exclusion for them or their loved ones at all kindly. About their opinions on the containment measures disposed, 98% of the participants thought that these measures were necessary, but only 56% thought that these same were adequate (MED group was more skeptical than CONTROL group) and 80% proposed to strengthen them. In line with this, most of participants thought that it was right to limit people\u2019s freedom for controlling the virus (93%) as well as one\u2019s own freedom (99%), as they already limited their behaviors (99%).\nAbout the information, they reported to be properly informed about the virus (84%) and the social situation\nrelated to it (70%), but also requested more information from experts (68%). About perception of risk in public opinion, 64% of participants reported to think that it was lesser than it should be and 30% that it was greater. Interestingly, 40% reported to think that there was some hidden information about the virus and 68% of these that such hidden information was related to a greater danger related to the infection. MED group, instead, reported to be less convinced of the existence of hidden information (34% vs 46% of the CONTROL group).\nLastly, about the spread of the virus, MED group was more pessimistic than CONTROL group. In fact, they\nreported less likely that the spread would slow down in some days (19% vs 45%) or in some weeks (71% vs 78%)."}, {"heading": "3.4. Logistic regression overall sample: effect of demographics", "text": "In this sub-section, we presented logistic regression results on COVID-19 questionnaire. We used each question as a dependent variable in a three-step hierarchical logistic regression. At step 1, we used as regressors the demographic variables (see Data analysis section) and the living area, considering North Italy as the reference (the coefficients\nreported should be interpreted as the odds that a participant from Center or South Italy would answer \u201cyes\u201d to a question compared to a participant from North Italy). At step 2, we added as regressors the psychological factors of perceived stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. Finally, at step 3, we included the group effect. For sake of brevity, we reported only the questions for which we obtained significant regressors.\nAt step 1 (see Table 3, STEP 1 block of columns), we included in the model only demographic variables. Of\nthese, the most influential were gender and age. Respect to male, gender female predicted higher odds to be concerned by the following risks: being infected (1.67), a global crisis (2.03), people\u2019s behavior in response of virus outbreak (1.01), infecting family members or love ones (2.38), and people\u2019s violating the containment provisions (2.81). In fact, females had higher odds to report that the public opinion had less risk-related perception about COVID-19 than it should be (1.83), that risky behavior should be punished more severely (3.32), that containment provisions should be improved (1.85), and that it would be right to limit people\u2019s freedom in this situation (4.33). In line with these results, they reported more likely to have not continued to attend public places and events (0.34). About age factor, older age was related to lower odds of reporting worries about the risk of infection for the loved ones (0.96), or about people\u2019s behavior as more dangerous that virus infection (0.95), or about the perception of risk in public opinion as lower that is should be (0.92). Older age people also reported lower odds to be concerned about their behavior as risky for themselves (0.97) or loved ones (0.96), but higher odds to be concerned about their health status in case of COVID-19 infection (1.03) and by people reaction to virus spreading (1.04).\nAlso the living area had a relative impact on the outcome variables at this step. Respect to participants from\nNorth Italy, those from both Center and South Italy showed greater odds to judge the actual containment measures as adequate (Center=2.23, South=2.90) and to think that some information about COVID-19 was hidden from them (Center=1.79, South=2.22), while they reported less likely to be at infectious risk (Center=0.43, South=0.60) or to consider themselves at risk when the first cases were discovered in Italy (Center=0.43, South=0.40).\nAbout other demographic variables, being in a relationship predicted higher odds to accept a possible exclusion\nfrom intensive care in case of need (5.35) and to propose the use of army in order to enforce containment measures (2.38), while it predicted lower odds to report behaviors considered as dangerous for the loved ones (0.52) and, accordingly, lower odds to continue to attend public events or places (0.34). Religious people had higher odds to be concerned about their health in case of infection (2.26), to request stronger punishments to risky behaviors (2.45), and that there was hidden information about the virus (1.53) related to higher risk for health (3.07). Alcohol consumption was related to lower odds to propose stronger punishment for risky behaviors (0.59), stricter containment measures (0.63), the use of army for public control (0.40), and more severe limitations of people\u2019s freedom (0.43). Participants who habitually use public transportations reported more likely to be worried about possible episodes of violence in the future (2.29), but also that people responded appropriately to the situation (3.22) and that more severe punishments were not right (0.42). Lastly, they reported more likely the opinion that the virus spreading would slow down in the days following the date of compilation (2.78) and less likely that perception of risk related to the virus in public opinion was lesser than it should be (0.55)."}, {"heading": "3.5.

In particular, the PSS score predicted a higher worry to be currently at infection risk (1.10) and a major need of information by experts (1.13), associated to a perception of risk not\nlower than it should be in public opinion (0.83) but higher (1.10), with the virus spread that would show equal speed in the weeks following the compilation (0.84 for both accelerated or slowed down spread). Instead, the STAI score was related to higher concerns of possible episodes of violence among patients (1.14), to higher odds of accepting the lack of cure in case of extreme need (1.21), and of accelerated spread of virus in the weeks following the compilation of the questionnaire (1.18). Lastly, the ECQ score predicted a higher level of worrying about the COVID-19 situation, in particular about possible severe outcome of the disease (1.15) and possible catastrophic social global outcomes (1.06).

Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we investigated the worries and the perception of risk towards the health and social situation in Italy related to the outbreak of COVID-19. To this aim, we conducted a cross-sectional study by means of online questionnaires administered to a convenience sample of volunteer participants including both health workers and general population. We asked to participants to report their worries and opinions about COVID-19 in about 50 different questions combined with psychological variables measuring stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. We obtained and analyzed data from three-hundred fifty-three Italian adult, divided in 167 participants in the MED group (medical doctors, paramedics, health workers and students) and 186 participants in the CONTROL group. We mainly compared the answers given to the questionnaires by these two groups. We also investigated the effect of the living area in Italy, as the northern regions were more involved than the central and southern ones (Cereda et al., 2020)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Anxiety and stress as related to residential area and job", "text": "First of all, we assessed risky situations in which people were involved relatively to COVID-19. As expected, people from North Italy reported more direct experiences with COVID-19, including more symptoms related to the infection, more prolonged quarantine status, more contacts with people at risk, and more presence of positive cases in their zone. MED group, instead, reported a higher number of contacts with people currently infected or at risk. Thus, both living area and group predicted a major or minor probability to be involved in risky situations or contacts. Following this, we found that participants from North Italy reported higher levels of stress and anxiety, and in particular that health workers in North area showed higher level of both health workers from other areas and general population from the same area. Thus, both residential area and job combined with the higher exposition to infection risk in order to increase the level of stress and anxiety in health workers from North Italy. This result was in line with the psychological response of health workers in China, where Lai et al. (2020) found that psychological distress increased for workers closer to the outbreak of epidemic (i.e. who lived and worked in Wuhan region) or assigned to patients affected by COVID-19. Thus, the same rule applies here: the closer to the risk of infection, the higher the risk of acute psychological distress.\nSimilar results were found in previous research on new disease outbreaks. For example, Wong, Gao, and Tam\n(2007) reported higher levels of anxiety in university students during the SARS epidemic, in particular among medicine students and students living in the area in which the infection spread more. Also Wheaton et al. (2012) reported higher levels of anxiety in students in response to pandemic spread of H1N1. More generally, anxiety emerged in response to various viral diseases, from the annual influenza virus to the H1N1 pandemic (Coughlin, 2012). In the period of viruses spread, anxiety seems to increase in population along with mood disorders, and this increase was related to exposition and risk of infection. In line with these results, participants of our study reported higher levels of perceived stress and of anxiety proportional to their risk of infection, i.e. health workers from North were more stressed and anxious than both their colleagues in Center and South Italy and general population.\nWhile our result supports an acute increase of stress and anxiety, we should carefully monitor the\npsychological state evolution in order to assess also the effect of COVID-19 over time. In fact, we expected that the virus spread and the quarantine state endurance in Italy could have also mid- and long-term consequences. Survivors from SARS reported post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms one month after discharge, suggesting that life-threating condition could have important psychic sequelae (Wu, Chan, & Ma, 2005). Such sequelae could be even more significant in health workers, showing higher levels of psychological distress both during and after a quarantine period (Brooks et al., 2020). For this reason, supporting psychological intervention for healthcare workers\ncould be crucial in the first phase of an outbreak (Xiang et al., 2020), in particular considering that a timely and effective intervention could greatly reduce the later onset of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms following a catastrophic event (Watson, Friedman, Ruzek, & Norris, 2002)."}, {"heading": "4.2. Predictors of risk perception and worries about COVID-19", "text": "We analyzed the answers to our questionnaire on COVID-19 by means of logistic regression. For each item, we computed the response odds related to each predictor in three successive steps, by adding sequentially demographic factors, psychological factors, and the group factor. Here we discussed the implication of all these computational steps by dividing the questionnaire items by content. In this section we discussed the predictors that we found for the items relatively to risk perception and worries related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.\nThe stronger predictor of risk perception was the group: healthcare workers showed about 2.5 times the odds of\nother participants to perceive themselves at risk of infection, as well as about 2 times the odds to think they were at risk even at the very start of virus outbreak in Italy. Moreover, they worried about virus spread as they reported that it would not slow down. This supported the idea that medical doctors, nurses, and paramedics had greater risk perception about the COVID-19 infection, probably due to also to a greater exposition to danger and to suspect positive cases. Also living area predicted the perception of risk, as both participants from Center and South Italy reported 0.5 times less preoccupation about risk of infection respect to participants from North Italy. Again, combination of work, i.e. health workers, and area, i.e. North Italy, combined for the greater perception risk.\nAbout the demographics, a major predictor of such worries was the female gender, that incremented the\nperception of risk, both at personal and family level, and of a number of worries about social situation and people\u2019s behaviors. In particular, female healthcare workers were reported to be at higher risk of stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in China (Lai et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). This increased distress level in female health workers could be related to an increased perception of risk for themselves and for their relatives as we found in our study, as also reported usually in researches about risk perception in female participants (Gustafsod, 1998). Our results suggested to carefully support female healthcare workers implied in COVID-19 treatments, as they could be more exposed to risk-related stress compared to their male colleagues. Another demographic predictor was age, as we found that aged people were more worried than younger people about severe consequences of COVID-19, as they already knew that the disease was more dangerous for older people, in particular when over sixty (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020). Being religious was related to a greater worry about severe consequences of or death by COVID-19. This could be explained by the strong positive relationship between religiosity and death anxiety, that could suggest a higher level of worrying on religious people about lethal consequence of the disease (Dezutter et al., 2009).\nLastly, also psychological factors influenced the odds of perceived risk of infection. In fact, stress increased\nsuch perceived risk, while death anxiety directly increased the concern about fatal or severe consequences of COVID19 and that the virus could have an impact on the situation globally. While it was already reported in literature the effect of both stress (Sobkow, Traczyk, & Zaleskiewicz, 2016; Traczyk, Sobkow, & Zaleskiewicz, 2015) and death anxiety (Langford, 2002) on risk perception and risk taking, it should be noted that higher levels of stress could also be due to actual exposure to contagion risk in the case of COVID-19, as showed by our results about comparisons on levels of perceived stress between healthcare workers from North, Center, and South Italy.\nTaken together, all these results suggested a higher risk perception relative to COVID-19 in healthcare workers\nliving in outbreak areas, especially if females and with high levels of stress. For COVID-19, knowledge on medicine\nand on virus could thus increase risk perception, while in other field such as nuclear radiation usually knowledge was associated to lower risk perception (e.g. Sjoberg & Drottz-Sjoberg, 1991). It should be note that, in case of nuclear radiation, knowledge could be associated to an increase capacity of avoiding risky behavior or situations, whereas in case of COVID-19 spread knowing the health risks related to disease but feeling powerless against its containment could exacerbate the perception of danger. An intervention for reducing stress by means of psychological support interventions to medical workers could reduce the level of perceived risk to an acceptable level, at which they could avoid both risky behaviors and overwhelming, stressful concerns."}, {"heading": "4.3. Predictors of COVID-19 related behaviors and containment actions", "text": "We proceed here by discussing the predictors of risky behaviors, judgments about behaviors, and confinement actions related to COVID-19. In this respect, the stronger predictor was the female gender; female participants reported higher levels of worries about their own behavior as well as other people\u2019s behaviors as risky. Related to this, they also were four times more likely than men to report to think it was right to limit people\u2019s freedom in order to block the virus spread, and three times more likely than men to request more severe punishment for risky behaviors. Capraro and Sippel (2017) showed, females adopted more strict moral judgments than men in personal dilemmas, such as behaving appropriately in the actual COVID-19 outbreak scenario. Females seemed more prone to strict adherence to rule, and even to imply stricter rules, probably also in relationship to their increased perception of risk (see Section 4.2).\nAnother important predictor was the living area. For such variable, both participants from Center and South\nItaly were more likely to judge the containment measures as adequate compared to participants from North Italy. On note, participants from South also reported less likely than North ones that concern of COVID-19 was a valid reason to violate the containment measures. This result could be related to the recent great \u2018escape\u2019 of people from the North Italy (when virus spread initially) toward the South, increasing worries in South population, politicians and medical staff.\nOn note, alcohol consumption was related to lower odds in requesting stronger containment measures, the\ninvolvement of the army or more severe punishments to risky behaviors, and in general a major limitation of people\u2019s freedom in order to safeguard public health. This result could be explained by the concern for alcohol users to be limited in findings alcoholic drinks or beverage, or as consequence of the impossibility to drink in a social context. The first explanation seemed more robust to us, since alcohol consumption could be considered as a rudimental yet functional coping strategy for many people (Holahan, Moos, Holahan, Cronkite, & Randall, 2001), and it was possible to imagine that the increased stress level due to a prolonged quarantine could also increase the difficulty for alcohol users to cope with such a stressor, making them more addicted or vulnerable. This is an important point to be considered in view of a public intervention. Another possible explanation relies in the relation between alcohol consumption and moral judgment, with alcohol concentration positively correlated with utilitarianism in a moral dilemma such as the trolley problem (Duke & B\u00e8gue, 2015). This suggests how alcohol users could be favorable to a different strategy for face the pandemic, maybe with less restrictive rules and more utilitarian choices, in which public health could eventually sacrifice few in order to guarantee a perceived better quality of life for more people. While this explanation was intriguing, our present results was inconclusive regard this hypothesis, so more studies focused on this aspect should be conducted in future.\nLastly, we should mention that the group variable had no or little impact on these variables, except for a weak\nincrement in odds to judge the containment measures as inadequate and then suggest their increment. Also psychological factors seemed to have a very limited impact, with only death anxiety score as predictor of a greater\ntendency to stock up on the foods. Thus, our data suggested that opinions and judgments about behaviors and containment actions rely more on demographic variables than on psychological or work-related ones."}, {"heading": "4.4. Predictors of perceived knowledge of COVID-19-related information", "text": "In this section we discuss on how demographic, psychological, and group variables impacted on the perceived level of knowledge relatively to COVID-19 and to its related socio-political situation. In this regard, the group was the stronger predictor. In fact, healthcare workers reported higher odds than non-medical participants of being properly informed about both COVID-19 and its related social situation. They also were less likely convinced that some information about coronavirus was hidden from public opinion, but those who credited such secret information believed more likely that this information was about a greater virus threat. This result pattern suggests a large gap between the two groups about the perception of being properly informed.\nThis information gap could explain the risk perception difference, since a greater knowledge could actually\ninfluence the personal risk awareness. It should be noted that, in general public opinion, the risk related to the new coronavirus was mistakenly considered as similar to that related to the common cold or annual influenza viruses, an error that could have be induced by the similarity in the spreading strategy and of some of the symptoms. This underrepresentation of fatal or serious outcomes of COVID-19 led to a poor adherence to health recommendations in the very first phase of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, with important consequences afterwards. These considerations seem to suggest that the reduction of such an information gap could eventually mitigate the disproportion in risk perception between groups and consequently increase the adherence to public health rules. Also our results seem to support this possibility because of the lack of information from experts lamented by more stressed participants, who also perceived a higher level of personal risk. To this aim, an information campaign about the novel coronavirus characteristics, its related disease symptoms and consequences, and public health problems linked to that could greatly support population in this moment, reducing the stress and also the risky behaviors.\nHowever, increasing the communication and the information could not be the solution to the problem. In the\nlast decades, especially since almost everyone has a large access to internet resources, we have witnessed a significant spreading of online information, but also misinformation; this is causing the diffusion of baseless rumors, difficult to erase from common people system of beliefs (Del Vicario et al., 2016; Kata, 2010). Misinformation spreading combines with people\u2019s distrust in experts\u2019 authority, a more and more raising phenomenon despite the increase in the general education level. As a result, as proposed by Gawande (p.3, 2016): \u201cto defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority\u201d. This kind of problem is well known in the field of the unfounded, yet persisting, vaccine fear. In anti-vaccination movement, the experts\u2019 mistrust phenomenon has been exasperated also by conspiracy theorists and other actors moving criticisms towards experts, accused of having conflict of interests or searching media visibility. The same criticisms did not apply, for the anti-scientific community, to the studies supporting their theories (Kata, 2010). All these factors could have an effect also on the underestimation of medical advices and warning on COVID-19 infection by general population, resulting in the unappropriated behaviors expressed. Thus, providing more information to population could be ineffective, if not supported by psychological evaluation of social dynamics underlying the anti-scientific phenomenon, for example the questioning of the legitimacy of traditional authorities (see Kata, 2009). Understanding how to contrast such a phenomenon could be even more important in case a vaccine for COVID-19 is provided, as already happened for the H1N1 flu in 2009, when\nmany people refused to vaccinate despite the possibility (see Offit, 2009). Further studies are needed in order to investigate these contrasting hypotheses for planning effective interventions relatively to public health problems."}, {"heading": "4.5. Limitations and future directions", "text": "This study is not free from limitations. First, it implied a cross-sectional design, thus causal relationship could be interpreted only with cautions. Second, we implied a convenience sample method to recruit our volunteer participants, with a possibility for introducing biases that could undermine the possibility to generalize our results to the entire population. However, we should note that we conducted this study with two major difficulties. The first was a timerelated issue: we had a very short time to collect data as the containment rules and the virus spread vary at a day-by-day rate. Thus, we should collect our data in a concise and brief timeframe. The second issue was a logistic one: most people in Italy, included the authors of these papers, were quarantined at the time we collected and analyzed the data, so we were forced to opt for an online methodology of data collection.\nWhile methodologically limited, our study opens a number of possible future studies. First, this study could be\nconsidered as a time-zero data collection for a longitudinal study. In this regard, we would contact our previous participants in order to ask if they will participate to further data collection. Thus, we could follow the change in risk perception and psychological situation in general population and healthcare workers during the evolution of COVID-19 infection spread. More experimental and cross-sectional studies are requested in order to understand better the relationship between healthcare workers and general population information gap and risk perception in a pandemic disease scenario. This could greatly help scientific community to find new strategies for conveying life-saving information to population. Reducing such information gap could also help in reducing the sense of separation between the healthcare workers and the rest of population, and thus their sense of isolation with its negative psychological consequences.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that a difference in risk perception between health workers and general\npopulation exists and suggests a number of explanations for its causes as well as possible solutions to reduce it, with benefits in the psychological conditions of both groups of participants. More efforts need to be done in this direction, also because reducing psychological distress could advantage physical health state (Prince et al., 2007), in particular for medical staff facing such a difficult time, improving the quality of caring they could provide (Imai, 2020; Maunder, 2009)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank all participants to our study, who voluntarily donated their time.

Such initiatives have a negative psychological 20 impact causing stress, anger and confusion (1). Even as we prepare this manuscript the situation is evolving with daily news community outbreaks across the globe. Monitoring the news of daily cases reported is important as it prepares citizens to be aware of a possible outbreak in their community and taking necessary steps to mitigate their risk of infection. However, such news also causes anxiety which in turn may lead to sleep disturbance (2). In combination with 25 isolation that comes from social distancing that is likely to be in place in such communities, people in these communities may experience poor mental health and other deleterious outcomes. The resulting sleep disturbance may end up hampering the immune response (3) that is so vital to fight diseases.\nMindfulness defined as non-judgmental awareness of the present moment (4) has been 30 shown to lead to a number of positive outcomes in many domains such as physical health, mental health and behavioral regulation (5). Mindfulness has also been shown to lead to improved sleep outcomes (6). Based on this evidence, we sought to examine whether a mindfulness intervention would buffer the negative effect of exposure to daily news of confirmed cases on sleep in the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak. To examine this question, we recruited volunteers in 35 Wuhan, China that were in the middle of the largest lockdown in human history to prevent the spread of the virus. We conducted a randomized control trial with two treatments over a ten-day period.\nWe recruited 97 adults (Mage = 34.49 years, SD = 5.03 years; 68.04% female) from Wuhan for a study testing effective ways of managing crisis (6). Eligible participants were 40\nresidents who were located in Wuhan during the lockdown starting from 23 January 2020 due to the Coronavirus breakout. The study was conducted for 12 days between 20 Feb to 2 March 2020, within a month of the lockdown. Participants were paid 100 RMB (approximately USD 15) upon completing the study. All procedures in the study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional review board at the first author\u2019s institution. Informed consent was 5 obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Each participant was assigned a subject ID to keep their identities anonymous.\nParticipants completed a baseline assessment on Feb 20th 2020 that asked for their demographic information and trait mindfulness a day before the intervention began. We used a design where participants in the mindfulness intervention condition engaged in a 10-minute 10 mindfulness practice each morning and participants in the mind-wandering condition engaged in a 10-minute mind-wandering practice for 10 consecutive days from Feb 21st 2020 to March 1st 2020 (both days included). Each day, participants in both conditions completed a short morning survey that was sent via WeChat App in the morning (8 am) including audio instructions for the practice, a mindfulness manipulation check, sleep quantity, sleep quality, and caffeine intake in 15 the previous day. Participants in both conditions completed a short evening survey (5 pm) that assessed their anxiety levels.\nIn a between-subjects design, we randomly assigned participants to one of the two 10-day smartphone-based intervention conditions: mindfulness condition or the mind-wandering condition. As all our participants were native Chinese speakers, we used audio instructions in 20 Mandarin that were recorded by a professional mindfulness coach. These instructions were developed based on well-established English mindfulness programs (8). The audio instructions have been used in previous research and were effective in inducing mindfulness and mindwandering in Chinese populations (9). To ensure that the two programs of the two conditions were comparable, the structure and voice tone of the recording in the mind-wandering condition 25 paralleled those of the mindfulness induction, with two minutes of instruction followed by eight minutes of practice. In mindfulness condition, the audio instructed them to be present focus, aware of what was happening, and acceptance. Participants in the mind-wandering condition listened to instructions of unfocused attention, an induction that elicits baseline wakeful states and that is often used as a baseline condition in mindfulness research. Both of the files are 30 available for researchers to download from the online repository.\nEvery morning around 8 am, after listening to the audio clip, participants rated their momentary mindfulness on four items on a 7-point Likert scale (1=not at all to 7=Completely) (10). The four items were \u201cI focused on the present\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018I thought about anything they wanted (reversed coded)\u201d, \u201cI let my mind wander freely (reversed coded)\u201d, and \u201cI was mindful of the 35 present moment\u201d. Participants in the mindfulness condition reported high levels of mindfulness than those in the mind-wandering condition (B = .290, p < .05), indicating that our manipulation was successful. We measured sleep quantity with the following question (11). How many hours of actual sleep did you get last night? To record the number of confirmed cases in the community in Wuhan each day between 20 Feb to 1 March 2020, we used the official records of 40 Chinese National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China. They update such information on their official website at 8am and 3pm each day. In addition to these measures, we measured anxiety on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1(not at all) to 7(completely) in every evening: \u201cI felt anxious today\u201d.\nConsistent with sleep research, we controlled for variables that may influence sleep quantity: sleep quality and daily caffeine intake (11). We measured sleep quality with an overall item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1(very bad) to 7(very good): \u201cHow do you evaluate your night\u2019s sleep?\u201d. We measured daily caffeine intake with the question: Did you have beverage that contains caffeine (such as coke, coffee, etc.). We controlled for these two variables 5 in predicting sleep quantity.\nFurthermore, to check the robustness of our findings, we considered several other factors that were closely relevant to the relationship we predicted such as trait mindfulness, daily cumulative confirmed cases to that date, daily cases of death reported, and sleep quality and quantity on the previous day. Research has shown that poor sleep quality on one night can lead to 10 longer sleep next night (12). Thus, when conducting the robustness check, we included sleep quantity and sleep quality from the previous night (i.e., lagged in time by 1 day), trait mindfulness, daily cumulative confirmed cases to that date, daily cases of death reported as control variables.\nDescriptive statistics and intercorrelations are reported in Table 1. Given the nested 15 nature of the data - daily observations nested within individuals, we used a multilevel modeling approach. Specifically, we analyzed the data with random coefficient modeling (13), in which we specified the within-individual-level relationship between the number of daily confirmed cases and sleep quantity as a random slope and used the between-individual-level mindfulness intervention to predict this slope. 20\nTo test our research question, we examined whether mindfulness would help people cope with the information about the outbreak in the city. In other words, we tested whether the mindfulness intervention would mitigate the effect of number of daily confirmed cases on sleep quantity. Indeed, as shown in Table 2, the mindfulness intervention positively predicted the random slope between daily confirmed cases and sleep quantity (B = .050, p < .05). To further 25 probe into the effect of the mindfulness intervention, we plotted two separate slopes for the mindfulness treatment group and the mind-wandering treatment group. As shown in Figure 1, among people assigned to the mind-wandering treatment, the number of confirmed cases on a day was negatively associated with their sleep quantity on that day (B = -.037, p < .01). On average, they lost 39 minutes of sleep with every thousand confirmed cases reported in the city. 30 In contrast, among people assigned to the mindfulness intervention condition, their sleep quantity was unaffected by the number of confirmed cases (B = .013, p > .10).\nWe then conducted a robustness check of results by controlling for trait mindfulness, daily cumulative confirmed cases to that date, daily cases of death reported, and sleep quality and quantity on the previous day. We found that our findings were robust with all these factors 35 controlled for. None of the other factors had the impact on sleep that the number of daily cases reported had. The results of robustness checks can be found in supplementary materials (Table S1).\nIn addition, we examined whether a mindfulness intervention would lead to reducing anxiety level during 10 days. We conducted a fixed-factor repeated measures ANCOVA with 40 dependent variables as the T1 to T10 measures of daily anxiety, within-subject factor as the time points T1 to T10, between-subject factor as experimental conditions, as well as trait anxiety, age, and gender as covariates revealed a significant between-subject effect of experimental conditions, indicating that daily anxiety level of participants in mindfulness condition was lower\ncompared to daily anxiety level of participants in mind-wandering condition, F(1, 92) = 5.07, p < .05, d = .46 (Figure 2).\nWe are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. As our ability to disseminate information about the pandemic periodically to the community has increased manifold. This comes with anxiety associated with the consumption of this information on an ongoing basis. 5 Specifically, knowing that the virus is spreading in the community can have a negative impact on people. Given the boredom associated with social isolation and the lockdown many communities are facing, the tendency to ruminate over such information may affect sleep \u2013 the very antidote that can restore immunity to protect oneself if one were to catch the virus. Our study shows that a deliberate practice of mindfulness can help people increase the duration of sleep in the midst of 10 the pandemic.\nAs a policy intervention, we suggest that administrators and citizen welfare groups organize mindfulness groups online where people can come together and engage in a short practice. This also perhaps has the benefit of creating a sense of belonging and mitigating the negative effects of social isolation that people may experience as humanity copes with the 15 epidemic (14)."}, {"heading": "References and Notes:", "text": "(1) Brooks, S.

During the outbreak, 1.4 billion Chinese people 8 suspended almost all social activities and stay at home. Although the prevention of the pandemic seems 9 effective, China's consumer economy suffered a heavy blow in the first quarter of 2020. With the COVID-10 19 outbreak gradually controlled in China, many retail businesses are pinning their hopes on the rebound in 11 consumption after the end of the pandemic. This study discusses the psychological mechanism of the 12 consumption rebound and the possible duration of this rebound with the theory of psychological arousal. 13 Based on the results of structural equation modeling of 1464 Chinese people, this study found that during 14 the COVID-19 outbreak, the perceived severity of the pandemic caused an insufficient level of psychological 15 arousal and lead to a higher tendency of sensation seeking, and this will increase people's willingness to 16 spend after the end of the pandemic.

In the absence of an effective vaccine, it is of utmost importance to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to allow timely treatment of infected individuals as well as not to overtax health systems at large (Flatten the curve, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020). Slowing down the spread of COVID-19 is not only beneficial for oneself because it reduces the risk to contract the disease at times when resources for treatment are scarce, but also for others who are likely to severely suffer in case of infection (e.g., elderly people).\nIn order to slow down the spread of COVID-19\u2014i.e., \u2018to flatten the curve\u2019\u2014, health\nand political authorities around the world have introduced rules and recommendations aimed at limiting the number of physical contacts between people. Examples include closing kindergartens, schools, and universities, enforcing home office, prohibiting border crossing, or staying at home in general (e.g., The White House, 2020). Clearly, following the rules and recommendations poses severe restrictions on the personal life of many citizens.\nWhereas most people follow the rules and recommendations by health and political\nauthorities, some have ignored them, and yet others have even celebrated parties or mass tourism (e.g., BBC, 2020). Slowing down the spread of COVID-19, however, requires cooperative actions by many (if not all) people, because the spread is slowed down most effectively if everyone bears the personal restrictions. This request for cooperative action might particularly apply to people who\u2014given the current knowledge\u2014seem less likely to be at risk to severely suffer from COVID-19 (health-wise), e.g., younger people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020)."}, {"heading": "TRAITS AND ACCEPTING RESTRICTIONS TO FIGHT COVID-19 3", "text": "Herewith, we aim to identify factors explaining whether individuals rather accept\npersonal restrictions to slow down the spread of COVID-19, and, if so, whether there are differences in the acceptance depending on whether one aims to protect oneself as compared to others. More specifically, based on the large body of research showing that personality traits account for differences in (pro-)social and cooperative behavior across various domains (e.g., Thielmann, Spadaro, & Balliett, 2020), we explore whether personality traits also account for differences in accepting personal restrictions to support collective efforts of slowing down the spread of COVID-19. To this end, in a timely data set of Danish adults, we consider several individual difference constructs that cover personality in breadth, including traits that have repeatedly been linked to anti/social behavior and non-/cooperation, namely, Honesty-Humility (Ashton, Lee, & De Vries, 2014) and the Dark Factor of Personality (Moshagen, Hilbig, & Zettler, 2018).

When entering the survey, participants were first informed about the survey, and then asked to provide consent. Hereafter, participants answered three demographic questions (about their gender, age, and fluency in Danish and English, respectively). Next, people saw the first page with personality items, including the measures (see below) for the HEXACO traits, risk-seeking tendency, as well as accepting personal restrictions to fight the COVID-19 threat. Items were randomized and included one attention check item. Following this page, people saw the second page with personality items, consisting of the assessment of the Dark Factor of Personality as well as one attention check item. Afterwards, some people filled out a brief cognitive ability measure (depending on the condition, this was mandatory or optional fur successful study completion), and all were finally thanked and incentivized (the incentive differed between conditions).\nEven though people can still participate in the survey, data for these analyses were\nretrieved on March 22nd 2020.

We assessed people\u2019s broad, basic personality trait\ndimensions in line with the HEXACO Model of Personality (Ashton & Lee, 2007). The HEXACO model comprises six basic trait dimensions\u2014Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness vs. Anger, Conscientiousness, and Openness to experience\u2014 which have been meta-analytically linked to a broad array of important outcomes (Zettler, Thielmann, Hilbig, & Moshagen, 2020). Each trait was assessed via the respective subscale of the HEXACO-60 (Ashton & Lee, 2009), consisting of 10 items each. Example items are \u2018I think that I am entitled to more respect than the average person is\u2019 (Honesty-Humility, reverse keyed), \u2018I worry a lot less than most people do\u2019 (Emotionality, reverse keyed), \u2018The first thing that I always do in a new place is to make friends\u2019 (Extraversion), \u2018I tend to be lenient in judging other people\u2019 (Agreeableness vs. Anger), \u2018I always try to be accurate in my work, even at the expense of time\u2019 (Conscientiousness), and \u2018People have often told me that I have a good imagination\u2019 (Openness to experience). For all personality measures, we used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5 = \u201cstrongly agree\u201d as response format. Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was > .72 for each of the six HEXACO subscales.\nDark Factor of Personality.

(2020) recommend to use bi-factor modelling for assessing D, but for equal measurement approaches across the personality constructs, we use the mean score across all items for our analyses. Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was .93 for the D70.\nRisk-taking tendency. We assessed people\u2019s general risk-taking tendency via an\nadapted version (so that it fits the response format) of the risk-taking tendency item from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2020). Our items read \u2018I am a person who is generally willing to take risks.\u2019\nAccepting personal restrictions to fight COVID-19.

But as we know\nfrom research in economics and psychology, individuals differ in their willingness to focus on the individual versus public good (e.g.; Fehr & Schmidt, 2005; Murphy & Ackermann, 2014; Ruch, Bruntsch, & Wagner, 2017). The case of COVID-19 is especially tricky as people can infect others before they experience symptoms themselves. Furthermore, the infection carries a risk that is much more serious to older people and people with previous medical conditions. Thus, adopting preventive measures is often a burden to the individual while having positive consequences for the public.\nAround the world governments are attempting to curb the spread of Corona (COVID-19).\nHowever, particularly democratic societies rely heavily on the individual to use protective measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19. Whether an individual uses a specific protective measure depends on whether or not the individual deems the protective behavior as effective (Floyd, Prentice-Dunn, & Rogers, 2000; Peters, Ruiter, & Kok, 2013; Sheeran, Harris, & Epton, 2014).\nIn the current COVID-19 outbreak protective measures can either serve the individual,\nwhich means they reduce the likelihood of becoming infected, or they can serve the public by reducing the likelihood of spreading the infection to others. However, it is yet to be investigated how much people base their decision to use a protective measure on the subjective protective value for themselves or the subjective protective value for the public.\nBased on theorizing and empirical research in decision-making, prosocial behavior in\ngeneral (e.g.; Hilbig, Gl\u00f6ckner, & Zettler, 2014) and social risk-taking in particular (Leder & Betsch, 2016) are linked to personality traits. We investigate if individuals differ regarding their willingness to use protective measures depending on whether they protect the self or the public and if this difference could be linked to the individual\u2019s social value orientation (Messick & McClintock, 1968).\nSocial value orientation (SVO; Van Lange, Otten, De Bruin, & Joireman, 1997) reflects\nthree social motives that guide decisions that have social and personal consequences: cooperation, competition, and individualism. SVO motives influence behavior because it modulates the weight individuals assign to the consequences that an interpersonal decision has for themselves and others (Van Lange et al., 1997). High SVO (i.e., a stronger prosocial orientation) is positively related to choices that maximize joint outcomes, whereas low SVO is associated with choices that maximize personal payoffs (Balliet, Parks, & Joireman, 2010; Baumert, Schl\u00f6sser, & Schmitt, 2014; Fung, Au, Hu, & Shi, 2012; Hilbig & Zettler, 2009; McClintock & Allison, 1989). Present Study\nIn the present pre-registered study, we sought to address the question whether SVO is\nrelated to the use of protective measures against COVID-19 depending on the assumed protective value of the behavior for oneself or the public. We preregistered two hypotheses (https://osf.io/8faeb): (1) With increasing SVO, protective measures will be seen as more effective for protecting the public. (2) High SVO will result in more usage of measures that are perceived to protect the public and low SVO will result in more reliance on measures that are\nassumed to protect the self. To test these hypotheses, we conducted an online study with a convenience sample from the general population in Germany.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants and Design", "text": "We recruited participants from a database (ORSEE; Greiner, 2015) and via postings in\nuniversity Facebook groups. We collected data from N = 419 (age = 38.07 years (sd = 15.67), female = 71.1 % (diverse = 0.5%), students = 34.37%, for a detailed description see the supplement). We excluded seven participants who had extreme responses (1 or 101) for all responses in at least one category. Participants completed an online survey available from 3/20/2020 until 3/23/2020, and as a thank you for participation, respondents were offered to take part in a lottery for six Amazon gift certificates of 20\u20ac each. Materials\nWe measured social value orientation (SVO; Van Lange et al., 1997) with the slider\nmeasure (Murphy, Ackermann, & Handgraaf, 2011) and asked participants to rate 17 behaviors regarding their protective value for themselves and the public. Then we asked participants how often they currently exhibit these behaviors. As control variables, we assessed honesty-humility with the Hexaco60 (Ashton & Lee, 2007) and trait anxiety (German version of the BFI-2; Danner et al., 2016).\nPersonality measures SVO was measured using the primary items of the SVO slider measure (Murphy et al.,\n2011). Honesty-humility was measured with the Hexaco60 subscale (Lee & Ashton, 2018). To assess trait-anxiety we used the four items forming the anxiety subscale in the BFI-2 (Danner et\nal., 2016). The Cronbach's Alphas, means and standard deviations of the scale scores are reported in Table 1 Internal consistencies, means, and standard deviations of scales..\nTable 1 Internal consistencies, means, and standard deviations of scales.\nScale Cronbach\u2019s Alpha M SD Honesty-Humility 0.71 3.63 0.59 Anxiety 0.77 3.09 0.82"}, {"heading": "Protective behaviors", "text": "The participants rated 17 behaviors (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 for the complete list), 14 of\nthese behaviors had been endorsed as protective measures against COVID-19 by the WHO (www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public). The three other behaviors were (1) one behavior that is not protective (going to corona parties), (2) one behavior that has high public protective value (shopping for members of high-risk groups), and (3) one behavior that has more protective value for the self than for the public (stockpiling food). All three behaviors were used as a consistency check of responses. These three behaviors were analyzed together with all other items. The responses to the item \u201cattend corona parties\u201d were reversed and it was renamed \u201cavoid corona parties\u201d so that all behaviors were protective and not hazardous. The behaviors in Figs. 2 and 3 are ordered based on the reported frequency of usage. However, their order was randomized in the survey.\nThe perceived protective value of behavior for the self and the public was measured with\nthe response to the items, respectively, \u201cBehavior protects me (\u2018Verhalten sch\u00fctzt mich\u2019)\u201d and \u201cBehavior protects the public (\u2018Verhalten sch\u00fctzt die Allgemeinheit\u2019)\u201d. Each behavior was rated on a slider measure with the anchors not at all \u2013 totally and no numeric values were presented. Both items were portrayed with sliders next to each other so that participants could quickly complete the questionnaire. Participants rated each of the 17 behaviors in a matrix.\nDeleted: Table 1\nWe used a similar slider measure to assess the frequency of engaging in a specific\nprotective behavior. The question \u201cHow often do you show this behavior these days (\u2018Wie h\u00e4ufig zeigen Sie derzeit aufgrund von COVID-19 die folgenden Verhaltensweisen?\u2019)\u201d was used but with the anchors never \u2013 very often.\nAs stated in the preregistration and because the study is part of a larger project, we also\nassessed risk perception, attitudes towards measures against COVID-19, flexible goal adjustment and tenacious goal pursuit, and state anxiety. Procedure\nParticipants gave their consent to the study and then responded to the survey which had\nthe following sequence: (1) SVO Slider measure (Murphy et al., 2011), (2) Hexaco60 items for the Honesty-humility subscale (Ashton & Lee, 2007), (3) items assessing trait anxiety, (3) items of the FLEXTEN (Bak & Brandtst\u00e4dter, 1998), (4) ratings of the protective value of behaviors for the self and the public, (5) risk perception regarding COVID-19, (6) attitudes towards COVID-19 measures, (7) reports on the frequency of engaging in specific protective measures, and (8) short version of the state anxiety measure (Grimm, 2009). Finally, participants were able to register for a lottery of six Amazon gift certificates of 20\u20ac each. Statistical Methods\nThe analysis was performed in R version 3.6.3 (R Development Core Team, 2020) using\nTidyverse packages (Wickham et al., 2019). We used library glmmTMB (Brooks et al., 2017) for generalized linear mixed model analysis and psych (Revelle, 2019) for psychometric tools. Responses regarding the self-protective value and public protective value, and frequency of use behaviors was transformed by subtracting one from the raw response and dividing it by 100 so that final values were between 0 and 1.\nResults\nFirst, as preregistered, we checked the validity of the slider measure of social value\norientation (SVO) within our sample. SVO was correlated with Honesty-Humility, r = .29, p <. 0001, Bayes Factor >1000 but not with trait anxiety, r = .019, p = .6834, Bayes Factor =0.12. Inspecting the distribution of SVO in the sample depicted in Fig. 1 shows that 92.2% of participants fall into the prosocial type.\nAttending corona parties (reversed and renamed to \u201cavoid corona parties\u201d for the analysis) received low ratings for the protective value and usage. Participants were sensitive to the objective protective value of behavior and rated shopping for individuals of high-risk groups as particularly as being valuable for the public and rated stocking up on food as particularly valuable for the self. In general, the density of the responses was concentrated at the extreme positive endpoints of self and public perceived protective values with some behaviors (e.g., not shaking hands, wash hands for 30 seconds, etc.) exhibiting almost no variation (see Fig. 2).\nFig. 2. Distribution of behavior ratings for self-protection versus public protection. The geometric density depicts the perceived self-protective value on the x-axis against the perceived public protective value on the y-axis. See supplementary information for the same data replotted for different SVO levels.\nThe frequency of usage of each behavior was clearly dependent on the perceived public\nprotective value and particularly the perceived self-protective value (Fig. 3). Behaviors fell into two clusters: behaviors that people engaged in frequently and behaviors that people engaged in less frequently with almost no middle ground between the two. Although both self and public protective values were positively correlated with the frequency of the behavior, it is only the former that had a strong and a statistically significant effect (see Table 2 for a generalized linear mixed model, beta family with self-protection, public protection and their interaction with SVO\nDeleted: Fig. 3\nDeleted: Table 2\nas fixed factors, behavior and participant ID as random factors). Thus, it is the perceived selfprotective value of behavior that is most important for its usage. Behaviors that were low on selfprotective value (e.g., wearing face masks, wearing gloves, etc.) were reported less frequently despite having medium scores regarding their perceived public protective value.\nPredictor Estimate Std error z p SVO angle 0.00 0.00 0.49 .6246 self-protection value 0.75 0.27 2.79 .0053 public protection value 0.27 0.24 1.12 .2638 self : public protection 0.03 0.15 0.17 .8618 SVO angle : self 0.00 0.01 0.59 .5525 SVO angle : public 0.00 0.01 0.32 .7480\nDiscussion\nThe present study sought to investigate the effect of social value orientation (SVO) on the\nperception and use of protective measures against COVID-19. We found that people use protective measures that foremost protect themselves with public protective value only being a secondary concern. This was found despite the fact that most participants (92.2%) in the present sample can be classified as prosocial according to the SVO measure.\nThe present study shows that health communication was effective in influencing people\u2019s\nperceptions. Protective measures such as social distancing and washing hands, which had been communicated as being effective ways to protect the self and the public, were perceived as such and adopted. Other measures, such as wearing face masks that had been portrayed over and over again as important for the public and but not for self-protection were used much less. Future health communication could build on that finding and elaborate on how public prevention, in the long run, will also affect the individual and the individual\u2019s close relations to increase the perceived self-protective value of protective behavior.\nWe found no evidence that SVO influenced either the perception or the frequency of\nusage of protective measures. However, the majority of the present sample were categorized as prosocial, thus the finding that SVO did not influence the perception of protective measures or\ntheir use cannot be generalized. But the homogeneity of the sample also increases the importance of the present study, as it shows that even individuals who are prosocial and who are motivated by cooperation and fairness seek first to protect themselves in the case of the pandemic. Limitations\nThe current study is based on a non-representative sample and data does not reflect the\nperceptions and behaviors of the general public. Participants in the current study were volunteers and, as the data on SVO indicates, in general very prosocial. Furthermore, the responses in the current study were based on self-reports and therefore are not objective indicators. Self-reports may have been affected by social desirability in that people wanted to present themselves as behaving in a way that is approved of by the public. Still, preventive behavior that does not serve the self was not reported frequently. It is to be expected that endorsing public protection would be socially desirable. Thus, taking social desirability into account, actual behavioral data may be even more extreme, that is, self-protective value may be even more important. Most importantly, the present study was cross-sectional and therefore causal inferences cannot be drawn. Conclusions\nWe reported that even prosocially oriented individuals seek self-protective measures first\nand foremost with public protection being only a secondary motive. Thus, when communicating the importance of a public protective behavior the emphasis should be on how public prevention, in the long run, will affect individuals themselves and their close relations.\nReferences\nAshton, M.

Date: March 23, 2020"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge to societies all over the globe. In recent history, most major societal crises (e.g., the financial crisis of 2008) could be successfully addressed through the interventions of politicians, and citizens should essentially just \u201dkeep calm and carry on.\u201d An epidemic crisis, however, is different. To hinder an accelerating growth in infections, changes in the core social habits of citizens are necessary and these behavioral changes are required to happen exceptionally fast. Specifically, citizens need to engage in rapid \u201cphysical distancing,\u201d that is, the minimization of close contact with others.1 Physical distancing reduces the probability that an infected person spreads the virus SARS-CoV-2 to those not infected (1) and, hence, aims to reduce the excessive demands on health systems and thus allowing effective treatment of the most vulnerable (2). Physical distancing is recommended and promoted by national and international institutions (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; World Health Organization) as well as national governments around the globe. To enforce physical distancing, many health institutions and authorities have opted for a combination of encouragement and the implementation of strong regulatory decisions such as from limiting social life in public spaces over shutting down public institutions and private companies to strict curfews. To understand psychological motivations to engage in physical distancing, it is important to note that it comes at considerable personal cost since it implies reducing social contact with valued close others. At the same time, however, practicing physical distancing does not only protect oneself but has clear prosocial aspects in the sense that it helps to protect other individuals, especially those most vulnerable to the virus. Building on this notion, we tested the idea that physical distancing can reflect, and be encouraged through the engagement of a genuine prosocial motivation\u2014empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus. In three studies that include samples from the US, the UK, and Germany, we test whether (i) empathy is related to the motivation for physical distancing, and (ii) whether inducing empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus causally increase the motivation to adhere to physical distancing. In this way, the present studies identify a basic motivation to adhere to a crucial measure to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Even more importantly, the present research provide direct evidence for policymakers on how to tailor their communication to achieve greater public compliance, and ultimately to save lives. Empathy can be defined as an umbrella term capturing the range of a person\u2019s responses to another individual\u2019s experience (3). Past research has convincingly demonstrated the beneficial consequences of both affective as well as cognitive empathy for the welfare of others. Specifically, cognitive empathy (i.e., taking the perspective of others) has been linked to reductions of inter-group conflicts and prejudice, while affective empathy (i.e., a concern for and an understanding of vulnerable others) has been shown to promote altruism and caring (4\u20136).\n1 The World Health Organization initially referred to \u201dphysical distancing\u201d as \u201csocial distancing\u201d but now recommends the use of the present term. The reason is that it is important to encourage continued social interaction (e.g., via telecommunication) during epidemic isolation periods.\nAnthropologist Margaret Mead considered caring about vulnerable (harmed) others\u2014who would, as is in the animal kingdom, die without the help of a caring individual\u2014to be the first sign of civilization in a culture (7). In the modern health context, affective empathy in particular has been shown to improve health outcomes. For instance, physicians\u2019 affective empathy levels are positively associated with reduced metabolic complications and better self-care in diabetic patients (8, 9). Affective empathy has further been shown to promote healthcare professionals\u2019 adherence to hand washing compliance to protect others in hospitals (10, 11). Overall, past research has shown that empathy reflects a basic motivation that promotes a variety of behavioral outcomes aimed at helping and protecting vulnerable others. Here, we show, first, that empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (e.g., the elderly, who are more likely to suffer from severe symptoms and have a higher mortality (12)) is associated with increased physical distancing (Studies 1 and 2) and, second, that experimentally induced (affective) empathy promotes the motivation to adhere to physical distancing (Study 3)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Study 1 consists of three non-representative samples (each N > 300) from western countries being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: The US, the UK, and Germany. The sample in the US was collected on March 17, 2020 (UK and Germany: March 18). At that time, none of the countries was completely locked down; in fact, it was possible to still go to bars and shops; home office was promoted but not implemented nationwide (this status also holds for the other studies reported in this article). In each sample of Study 1, individuals indicated their physical distancing practice via self-report on a 5-point Likert scale (possible range 1\u20135); a sample item reads, \u201cBecause of coronavirus COVID-19, I am massively curtailing social contact (so-called \u2019social distancing\u2019).\u201d In the items, we used the term \u201csocial distancing\u201d instead of \u201cphysical distancing\u201d because \u201csocial distancing\u201d was much more common in the media and news at the time data was collected. We observed relatively high levels of physical distancing in each country, with some variability (US: M = 4.44, SD = 0.80; UK: M = 4.27, SD = 0.85; Germany: M = 4.24, SD = 0.89). We further assessed individuals\u2019 self-reported empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (possible range: 1\u20135); a sample item reads, \u201cI feel compassion for those most vulnerable to coronavirus COVID-19.\u201d We observed relatively high levels of empathy, with some variability (US: M = 4.46, SD = 0.74; UK: M = 4.56, SD = 0.61; Germany: M = 4.02, SD = 0.93). In line with the idea that physical distancing is motivated by empathy, we document in all three countries a positive relation between empathy and physical distancing (US: r = .61, P < .001; UK: r = .29, P < .001; Germany: r = .48, P < .001; see Figure 1). In Study 2, conducted on March 19, 2020, we replicated the findings of Study 1 in a different German sample (N = 359). We applied the same measurement of empathy as in Study 1 (possible range 1\u20135, M = 4.06, SD = 0.94) but assessed physical distancing in a more concrete and prospective way (overall M = 4.56, SD = 0.65); a sample item reads, \u201cDuring my free time in the next days, I will visit elderly people (e.g., parents, grandparents, elderly friends).\u201d The items were re-coded for the analyses of Study 2 so that higher values reflect more physical distancing. In Study 2, we also found that empathy relates to physical distancing (r = .32, P < .001; see\nFigure 1).\nStudy 3 was built on the knowledge gained from Studies 1 and 2 and sought to test whether we can use empathy to promote physical distancing. Study 3 (N = 868) was run in Germany on March 19 and 20, 2020. We measured motivation to adhere to physical distancing as in Study 2 and tested whether we can increase this motivation by inducing empathy. Study 3 had three randomized between-subjects conditions. In an information only condition, we provided participants with mere background information about why it is important to reduce contact between persons (i.e., physical distancing); it was stated that researchers consider physical distancing to be an effective tool to slowing the spread of the COVID-19 disease, preventing the collapse of hospitals, and protecting those being most vulnerable to the virus. In an information + empathy condition, in addition to the information, we showed participants a one-minute video, in which a 91-year-old man sadly reports that he stops visiting his chronically sick wife due to the virus (see https://osf.io/pq3ky/ for the video). The video was pretested and elicited high levels of affective empathy (see Materials and Methods). In the control condition, no information and no video were given, resembling a situation of no intervention.\nA one-way ANOVA shows that the motivation to adhere to physical distancing differed between conditions, F(2, 865) = 6.06, P = .002 (see Figure 2). Additional analyses revealed that the motivation to adhere to physical distancing did not significantly increase by information only, control condition: M = 4.30, SD = 0.76, information only condition: M = 4.39, SD = 0.74; t(608) = 1.577, P = .115, Cohen\u2019s d = .13. In contrast, the motivation to adhere to physical distancing increased significantly by inducing empathy; the information + empathy condition had a significantly higher mean of 4.51 (SD = 0.66) compared to the control condition, t(561) = 3.523, P < .001, Cohen\u2019s d = .30. The information + empathy condition and the information only condition also did differ significantly from each other, t(561) = 1.973, P = .049, Cohen\u2019s d = .17. In further analyses, we show that empathy significantly increases the percentage of individuals who indicate that they want to adhere strictly to physical distancing (as measured by the percentage of individuals indicating maximal approval of every single physical distancing statement; see https://osf.io/pq3ky/ for these analyses)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The present investigation has two major findings. First, empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus is a basic motivation for physical distancing. Second, we can actually use empathy to promote the motivation to adhere to physical distancing. Importantly, providing individuals with\nmere background information about why it is important to adhere to physical distancing was not enough to significantly increase motivation; only if empathy was added did the motivation for physical distancing increase. The present research has important policy implications. Specifically, in the effort to reach very high levels of physical distancing, it might not be sufficient to provide only basic information about why physical distancing is important. Basic information certainly is important. However, an emotional ingredient\u2014affective empathy\u2014seems to be necessary to reach very high levels of physical distancing. As such, when designing interventions and communication materials to change behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers should consider enriching mere informational content with emotional content. As shown in the present investigation, empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus might be a promising candidate here. In discussing the findings, we want to acknowledge limitations of the present research and point to future directions. The present set of studies was conducted in western countries only, and the samples were not representative of the entire population in these countries. The studies were conducted online using self-reports. The intervention (inducing empathy) was applied and tested on only a short-term scale. As such, it might be useful to replicate the present studies\u2019 findings using different stimuli as well as representative samples; to conduct the studies in other (non-)western countries; to assess actual behavior (instead of self-reported motivation); and, to measure the long-term consequences of (repeated) induction of empathy. Nonetheless, we argue that these shortcomings do not limit the basic conclusions and the potential of the findings in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the present research highlights the potential of using empathy as a tool to promote physical distancing and to save lives, especially of the most vulnerable members of our societies."}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Participants gave informed consent before starting the study. All studies were preregistered. Data, sample characteristics (demographics), materials, and the preregistrations are available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/pq3ky/). All results remain robust in terms of significance levels and effect size when controlling for participants\u2019 gender and age. Participants were recruited via the crowdsourcing platforms Prolific (Study 1) and Clickworker (Study 2 and 3) to complete a short survey on \u201ccoronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d in exchange for 0.40\u00a3 (~0.47 US Dollar). Both platforms provide reliable data. We applied two attention check items to secure high data quality (see OSF at https://osf.io/pq3ky/). Sample size for Studies 1 and 2 was based on an a priori power analysis to detect effects of r > .20 with high statistical power (Power = .95; alpha-level .05, two-tailed). Based on this analysis, we aimed to collect at least 314 participants in each sample (final samples Study 1: 322 participants from the US; 317 from the UK; 326 from Germany; Study 2: 361 from Germany). Study 3 was powered to enable detecting effects of f > .13 with high statistical power (Power = .90; alpha-level .05, two-tailed). Based on this analysis, we aimed to collect at least 800 participants. We finally collected data from 868 German participants.\nIn Study 1, we measured empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus with three items, adapted from Pfattheicher et al. (13) (in all samples, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 > .81). All items are available on the OSF (https://osf.io/pq3ky/). If not indicated otherwise, labels in the studies always ranged from 1 = \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5 = \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d The items measuring empathy were mixed with three filler items to reduce demand characteristics. We measured physical distancing with two items (in all samples, \u03b1 > .79). In Study 2, we measured empathy with the same items as in Study 1 (\u03b1 = .89), and we measured physical distancing with five concrete and prospective items (\u03b1 = .76). A sample item reads, \u201cDuring my free time in the next days, I will visit elderly people (e.g., parents, grandparents, elderly friends).\u201d Labels ranged from 1 = \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to 5 = \u201cvery likely\u201d for this scale (for the reported findings of Studies 2 and 3, the scale was reversed, such that higher values reflect more physical distancing). In Study 3, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: the information only condition (n = 305); the information + empathy condition (n = 258); and, the control condition (n = 305). Conditions did not significantly differ in terms of the assessed demographics: gender, \u03c72(2, N = 864) = 1.08, P = .582), age, F(2, 865) = 0.58, P = .558, and household size, F(2, 865) = 1.09, P = .337. Participants in the information only condition read (translated from German), \u201cAt the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: Researchers emphasize that reducing contact between persons is an effective tool to slowing spreading of the virus. A slowed spread of the virus relieves pressure from the hospitals. A collapse of hospitals would be particularly dangerous for those most vulnerable in our society, in particular elderly and sick people. Therefore, it is important to reducing contact between persons.\u201d In the information + empathy condition, in addition to the information that was presented in the information only condition, we showed participants a one-minute video where a 91-year-old man sadly reports that he stops visiting his chronically sick wife due to the virus. Participants could not proceed with the study before the video ended. The video was pretested in an independent study (N = 51; detailed results are available at https://osf.io/pq3ky/) and elicited high levels of affective empathy. In the control condition, no information and video were given. As the central dependent variable, we measured adherence to physical distancing with the same items as in Study 2 (\u03b1 = .76). In Study 1, we additionally measured \u201cmotivation to stay in self-quarantine if infected\u201d; \u201cmotivation to stay in isolation if infected\u201d; and, \u201cmotivation to follow major rules imposed by the government.\u201d All constructs were significantly correlated with empathy in each sample (all rs > .22 , all Ps < .001). See OSF for all analyses (https://osf.io/pq3ky/). In addition, in the US sample of Study 1 only, political orientation was measured using the item, \u201cHow would you place your political views generally speaking?\u201d The response format for this question was a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 = \u201cextremely liberal\u201d to 10 = \u201cextremely conservative.\u201d Political orientation was negatively correlated with physical distancing (r = -.26, P < .001) and negatively with empathy (r = -.21, P < .001), and it did not significantly moderate the relation between empathy and physical distancing (P = .818)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Mariam S.

Although public health initiatives (i.e., social distancing) help manage its impact, these initiatives can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N=1,195) validated a brief 10- item COVID-19 threat scale that assesses 1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety, and 2) symbolic threats to one\u2019s sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threat predict higher anxiety and lower wellbeing, and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threat diverge in their relationship to public health behaviors (e.g., social distancing): Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported compliance, whereas symbolic threat predicted less self-reported compliance to these social-disconnection initiatives. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation.

Months later, this novel coronavirus unleashed a global pandemic of sickness on a scale unseen since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. The spread of the coronavirus is clearly reshaping the fabric of social life, and social psychology is at the forefront of studying these changes (Everett, Colombatto, Chituc, Brady, & Crockett, 2020; Priniski & Holyoak, 2020; Van Bavel et al., 2020.) Essential to this nascent research movement is understanding\u2014and measuring\u2014how people perceive the threat of the virus (Flake, Pek, & Hehman, 2017).\nLaypeople (Sanchez, 2020), public health leaders (Hennekens, George, Adirim, &\nJohnson, 2020), and social psychologists (Sherif, 1966; Esses, Jackson, & Armstrong, 1998) often conceptualize threat as realistic threat, a concrete attack on physical and material wellbeing. Although realistic threat is undoubtedly important, social psychology research highlights another important kind of threat: symbolic threat, an assault on our cultural and national identity (e.g., Kachanoff, Kteily, Khullar, Park, & Taylor, in press; Stephan, Ybarra, & Morrison, 2006; Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Although both realistic and symbolic threat likely increase psychological distress, they may differentially predict public health behaviors\u2014which can have important implications for how well people and communities respond to pandemics. Here, we validate a\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nbrief ten-item scale that assesses the experience of both symbolic and realistic threat of COVID19, and examine each of their consequences for well-being and public health behaviors."}, {"heading": "Disease and Threat", "text": "The threat of disease powerfully impacts humanity by endangering physical health\n(Hennekens, et al., 2020; Viboud, Tam, Fleming, Handel, Miller, & Simonsen, 2006), psychological health (Matsuishi, et al., 2012; O\u2019Leary, Jalloh, Neria, 2018), and the economy (Smith, Keogh-Brown, Barnett, & Tait, 2009). The ubiquitous specter of disease across history has shaped the evolution of human behavior, emotions, and morality (Rozin, Lowery, Imada, & Haidt, 1999; Haidt, 2001), and the structure of sociocultural systems (Gelfand et al., 2011; Harrington & Gelfand, 2014).\nDiseases most obviously pose realistic threats: concrete risks to an individual\u2019s (or\ngroup\u2019s) physical health and economic well-being (Esses, et al., 1998; Kachanoff & Taylor, 2017). COVID-19 certainly represents a realistic threat through its attack on physical health and capacity to create mass-unemployment (Davies, Partington & Wearden, 2020; Patterson, 2020). Pundits (Sanchez, 2020) and global health leaders (Hennekens, et al., 2020) have emphasized realistic threats from COVID-19, calling the virus \u201can almost perfect killing machine\u201d. A recent Pew research poll on Americans\u2019 perceptions of threat from COVID-19 focused exclusively on realistic threat (Pew Research Poll, Wave 63.5, March 10, 2020).\nDespite the importance of realistic threat, it is not the only threat caused by pandemics.\nHumans are not just animals with basic needs for physical self-preservation; we are social animals who depend on our cultural groups for motivation (Oyserman, 2007), psychological well-being (Kachanoff, Wohl, Koestner, & Taylor, 2020), and structure (Gelfand et al., 2011). Threats to the \u201cintegrity or validity of the ingroup\u2019s meaning system [such as] religion, values,\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nbelief system, ideology, philosophy, morality, and world view\u201d (Stephan, Ybarra, & Morrison, 2006, p.3-5) are called symbolic threats. COVID-19 poses a symbolic threat because social distancing\u2014the primary method for combatting its spread\u2014results in a weakened sense of community or national identity. The neighborhoods, religious communities, schools, and sports groups that give people a sense of meaning are unraveled by COVID-19 (ur-Rehman et al., 2020; Maxouris, et al., 2020). As one quote suggests, COVID-19 means that \u201cAmerica [and all Nations] as we knew it, is on hold\u201d (Maxouris et al., 2020).\nAlthough realistic threats can translate into symbolic threats\u2014if everyone in a group dies,\nso will its culture\u2014theories of intergroup relations argue for the distinctness of these two kinds of threat. Social identity theory (1979) introduced symbolic (social identity) threat when the field was focused solely on realistic concerns (Sherif, 1966; see Jackson, 1993 for review). Later, integrated threat theory (Stephan & Stephan, 2000; Z\u00e1rate, Garcia, Garza, & Hiltan, 2004) reconciled both literatures by showing the unique consequences of both types of threat for intergroup attitudes. Here, we apply this integrated approach and distinction between symbolic and realistic threat to a global pandemic1."}, {"heading": "Unique and Sometimes Opposite Consequences of Realistic Versus Symbolic Threats", "text": "Examining realistic and symbolic threat of COVID-19 provides a unique opportunity to\ntest the predictions of integrated threat theory and may also help better understand people\u2019s response to public health initiatives.\nOne clear prediction is that\u2014as psychological threats\u2014the experience of realistic and\nsymbolic threats should each independently predict increased distress (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alverez, 1979) and lower psychological well-being (Diener,\n1 Our focus is not on whether pandemics exacerbate the symbolic or realistic threats of other groups, but, on the perceived threats posed directly by the pandemic.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nEmmons, Larsen, Griffin, 1985; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Within intergroup contexts, threats to one\u2019s personal or collective physical safety and resources (i.e. realistic threat), or to what it means to be a member of one\u2019s group (i.e., symbolic threat), are both detrimental to psychological well-being (e.g., Kachanoff, Taylor, Caouette, Khullar, & Wohl, 2019, de la Sablonni\u00e8re, Taylor, Perozzo, & Sadykova, 2009).\nAlthough both kinds of threat should increase distress, they may be associated with\nopposite reactions to public health outcomes such as social distancing. The goal of social distancing is to combat the dangers of contagion, but by isolating people from their social groups, it sacrifices social connection. In other words, social distancing might increase symbolic threat while attempting to decrease realistic threat. Accordingly, we hypothesize that feelings of realistic threat would predict increased self-reported support and adherence to public health initiatives, whereas feelings of symbolic threat would predict decreased self-reported support and adherence. The idea that people might compromise their physical health to protect their sense of social identity is clear in cases when people risk their lives to protect the causes and values of their group (B\u00e9langer, Caouette, Sharvit, & Dugas, 2014; King & Taylor, 2011).\nOne final prediction is that symbolic threat might also have a more constructive aspect:\npredicting when individuals find new ways to affirm their social identity, even while social distancing (e.g., interacting virtually online with cultural groups, family dinners). People may find creative solutions to the cruel ultimatum posed by global pandemics of physical safety versus social meaning."}, {"heading": "Present Research", "text": "We conducted three studies using cross-sectional (Study 1 and 2) and longitudinal (Study\n1 and 3) designs to achieve two core objectives. First, we developed a brief and psychometrically\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nsound 10-item scale measuring realistic or symbolic threat. To assess factor structure, we used principal component analysis (Study 1), confirmatory factor analysis (Study 2), and invariance analysis (Study 3). To examine convergent and divergent validity (Studies 1 and 2), we examined associations with individual differences related to threat sensitivity (need for cognitive closure (Rubin, 2018), beliefs in a dangerous world (Duckitt & Fisher, 2013), valuing conservation (Schwartz, Sagiv, Boehnke, 2000), and emotional (in)stability (Schneider, 2004)). Second, as outlined above, we examined the dissociable impact of realistic and symbolic threat on 1) psychological distress/well-being, 2) self-reported adherence to public health initiatives, and 3) new ways of maintaining social identity in the face of social distance.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nStudy 1\nThis study examined the convergent, divergent, and criterion validity of an initial set of\nitems developed to assess perceptions of symbolic and realistic threat of COVID-19. Half of our sample had previously completed a survey unrelated to COVID-19 in October 2019, which allowed us to assess scale validity both cross-sectionally (analyzing all responses during COVID-19), and longitudinally (analyzing pre- and post-COVID-19 differences among the same sample).\nMethod\nSample. Between March 19th and 20th, 2020, 399 American participants were recruited\nfrom MTurk. After pre-registered exclusions, 346 participants (160 male, 184 female, 2 other; Mage=41.51, SDage=13.46; 80.9% White, 9.5% Black or African American, 4.9% Latinx/Hispanic) completed all measures during the COVID-19 crisis. One-hundred and ninetythree of these participants (after exclusions, 86 male, 105 female, 2 other, Mage=42.27, SDage=13.99; 85.5% White, 8.8% Black or African American, 3.1% Latinx/Hispanic) also had completed all non-COVID-19 items in October 2019.

All items were framed with the opening: \u201cHow\nmuch of a threat, if any, is the coronavirus outbreak to\u2026\u201d and were rated from 1 (Not a Threat)\nto 4 (Major Threat). To assess realistic threat, we adapted 5 pre-existing items ( =.77) used by\n2 We note that the scales focused on in Study 1 were part of a larger study focusing on the impact of COVID-19 threat and morality most broadly. See registration for all collected measures.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nthe Pew Research Poll (Pew Research Poll, Wave 63.5, March 10, 2020) to document perceived threat of COVID-19. Participants were asked about the threat of COVID-19 to \u201cyour personal health\u201d, \u201cthe health of the U.S. population as a whole\u201d, \u201cyour personal financial safety\u201d, \u201cthe U.S economy\u201d, and \u201cday-to-day life in your local community\u201d3\nWe used 5 items ( =.85) to assess symbolic threat of COVID-19. Four items were based\non Stephan and colleagues\u2019 (2006) definition of symbolic threat cited above. We asked participants if they felt COVID-19 poses a threat to \u201cWhat it means to be American\u201d, \u201cAmerican values and traditions\u201d, \u201cThe maintenance of law and order in America\u201d, and \u201cAmerican Democracy\u201d. We also included one item assessing threat to the \u201cThe rights and freedoms of the U.S. population as a whole\u201d adapted from Kachanoff and colleagues (2019).\nResults\nFor all studies, we provide a more detailed result summary in Supplemental Materials. Factor structure of Integrated COVID-19 Threat Scale. Principal component analysis\nrevealed a 2-factor solution: one factor with 5 items assessing symbolic threat (Eigen Value = 4.20, Variance Explained = 42.02%), and one factor with 5 items assessing realistic threat (Eigen Value = 1.64, Variance Explained = 16.34%). See Table 1 for factor loadings.\n3 In this initial study we generated a pool of 20 items to explore different types of threat which go beyond the focus of this paper (e.g., threat to loved ones). All items are available in Supplemental Materials and OSF data. We do to focus on items pertaining to loved ones because of their substantial overlap with items pertaining to the self. We also limited the realistic threat items to only those used in the PEW poll so our findings can generalize to their report. Because of the exploratory nature of our initial scale construction we validated our scale structure in two subsequent pre-registered studies (Study 2 and 3) using only the 10-items we focused on.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nCOVID-19 was positively associated with the need for cognitive closure, belief in a dangerous world, values associated with conservation, and was negatively associated with emotional stability (whether both dimensions were combined or\u2014largely\u2014examined independently). Indicating divergent validity, threat of COVID-19 (combining both dimensions) was not significantly associated with any of the other dimensions of Schwartz\u2019s value scale or the TenItem-Personality Inventory. See Table 2 for descriptive statistics and correlations.\nCriterion validity. We examined the association between symbolic threat and realistic\nthreat, and the three criterion outcomes simultaneously with one structural equation path model (SEM; Byrne, 1994), see Supplemental Materials for full description of the analysis. Symbolic threat was significantly positively associated with COVID-19 impact avoidance (b=.98, 95% CI [.26, 1.70], p=.008) and COVID-19 impact intrusion (b=1.10, 95% CI [.43, 1.77], p=.001), but\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nwas not significantly associated with anxiety (b=.56, 95% CI [-.14, 1.26], p=.114). Realistic threat was significantly positively associated with anxiety (b=2.79, 95% CI [1.85, 3,72], p<.001), as well as with COVID-19 impact intrusion (b=3.18, 95% CI [2.29, 4.07], p<.001), but was not associated with COVID-19 impact avoidance (b=.25, 95% CI [-.72, 1.22], p=.613).\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nLongitudinal evidence (repeat participants only). Convergent and divergent validity.

Indicating divergent validity, threat of COVID-19 was largely not associated with other values or personality traits. See Table 3 for descriptive statistics and correlations.\nCriterion validity. We regressed anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic onto symbolic\nthreat, realistic threat, and base-line anxiety assessed 5 months prior to the global pandemic. Realistic threat (b=1,71, 95% CI [.67, 2.75], p=.001) but not symbolic threat (b=.28, 95% CI [- .50, 1.06], p=.486) was associated with anxiety during the pandemic, controlling for base-line anxiety."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We found initial support in Study 1 for the factorial structure, as well as, evidence for the\nconvergent and divergent validity of our scale. While the threat of COVID-19 was robustly associated with individual differences linked to threat sensitivity, COVID-19 threat was not consistently associated with other individual differences. Demonstrating criterion validity, both symbolic and realistic threat were both uniquely related to psychological distress. Realistic threat was robustly associated with having intrusive thoughts about the virus, and heightened anxiety (even when controlling for anxiety five months prior). Symbolic threat (but not realistic threat) was associated with trying to avoid thinking about or dealing with the virus, as well as, intrusive thoughts. We further tested the validity of our scale in Study 2 and examined whether/how realistic or symbolic threat predict public health behaviors.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nStudy 2\nStudy 2 further examined the validity of the Integrated COVID-19 Threat Scale and also\nwhether realistic and symbolic threat might be differentially related to self-reported behavioral adherence and support for public health initiatives, and with finding new ways to maintain social identity while in isolation.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; Byrne, 1994)\nindicated the two-factor model had acceptable model fit indices: comparative fit index (CFI)=.93, standard root mean square intervals (SRMR)=.06, root mean square error\nApproximation (RMSEA)=.08, 90% CI[.07, .10], BIC=12206.97, 2 =161.08 (Hu & Bentler,\n1999; Byrne, 1994; Steiger, 1990) and no negative error variances or improper solutions, see Figure 2. We compared the two-factor model to a one-factor model which did not differentiate between symbolic threat or realistic threat (CFI=.75, SRMR=.12, RMSEA=.15, 90% CI[.14,.16],\nBIC=12519.63, 2 =480.37). The one-factor model had inferior model fit, dif2 =-319.29, p<.001.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nConvergent and divergent validity. Overall, we found a consistent pattern of results\nwith Study 1, supporting both convergent and divergent validity. See Table 5 for descriptives and correlations and Supplemental Materials for full description of results.\nCriterion validity. We examined the association between symbolic threat and realistic threat, and all\ncriterion outcomes of interest simultaneously within one structural equation path model (SEM; Byrne, 1994; using the Lavaan package in R, (Rosseel, 2012), see Supplemental Materials for full description of the analysis. See Table 6 for descriptive statistics and correlations.\nPsychological distress. Replicating Study 1, symbolic threat was significantly positively\nassociated with COVID-19 impact avoidance and COVID-19 impact intrusion. In contrast to Study 1, symbolic threat was also significantly associated with anxiety. Replicating Study 1, realistic threat was significantly positively associated with anxiety and COVID-19 impact intrusion. In contrast to Study 1, realistic threat was also associated with COVID-19 impact avoidance.\nPsychological well-being. Symbolic and realistic threat were positively associated with\nnegative affect. Realistic threat (but not symbolic threat) was negatively associated with life satisfaction. We observed an unanticipated significant positive relation between symbolic threat and positive affect. Exploratory parallel-mediation analysis revealed this effect was partially mediated by increased social identity affirming behaviors in isolation (but not decreased adherence to public health initiatives; See analysis in Supplemental Materials for details).\nSupport and adherence with public health initiatives.

In contrast, symbolic threat was significantly and negatively associated with support and adherence to public health initiatives.\nSocial identity affirmation in isolation. As we expected, symbolic threat was positively\nassociated with engaging in creative behaviors (while in isolation) to affirm one\u2019s American identity (e.g., cooking food subjectively associated with America). Realistic threats were also significantly positively associated with such behaviors.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nNote. b values reflect non-standardized path estimates from one SEM model including all measured variables simultaneously.

Both threats were also consequential. People who experienced greater symbolic and realistic threat reported greater psychological distress, and realistic threats were associated with less life-satisfaction.\nSymbolic and realistic threats had opposite associations with support and engagement\nwith important public health initiatives. People higher in realistic threat reported greater compliance and support for initiatives such as social distancing and hand-washing, while people higher in symbolic threat reported being less supportive and compliant. As predicted, experiencing symbolic threat was positively associated with engaging in social identity affirming behaviors in social isolation. Unexpectedly, realistic threat was also associated with identity affirming behaviors, potentially because individuals high in realistic threat were spending more time in isolation.\nStudy 3\nIn Study 3 we aimed to replicate Study 2\u2019s findings pertaining to criterion outcomes,\nusing a longitudinal design in which we examined whether perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted outcomes one week later. To do this, we re-sampled as many participants who took part in Study 1 (Time 1: March 19th-20th) as possible and asked them to complete criterion measures one week later (Time 2: March 27th-28th). In addition, we asked participants to complete the ten-item COVID-19 threat scale at the end of the survey, so we could test the longitudinal invariance of the scale.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nMethod\nSample. Three hundred and eleven participants recruited from Mturk completed the\nsurvey on March 27th-28th 2020. Three hundred and ten participants had completed the study one week prior (T1) on March 19th-20th (i.e., participants from Study 1). After pre-registered exclusions, our sample consisted of 259 participants (122 male, 137female; Mage=41.51, SDage=13.46; 81.9% White, 9.3% Black or African American, 3.5 % Latinx/Hispanic). See Supplemental Materials and https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=2ed62c for more information.\nMeasures. We assessed realistic and symbolic threat and all criterion validity measures\nused in Study 2. See Tables 9 for reliability and the Supplemental Materials for the full questionnaires. Results\nScale invariance. We examined the invariance of both subscales using longitudinal\nconfirmatory factor analysis (Meredith, 1993) with the SemTools package in R (Jorgensen, 2019). Because we confirmed there being two distinct factors in Study 2, and because all our analyses focus on the separate sub-scales we explored the invariance of each sub-scale separately. We tested for configural invariance (i.e., does the scale assess the same construct over time), metric invariance (i.e., does the scale have the same meaning over time), scalar invariance (i.e., can we compare means over time) and the equivalence of means over time. See Supplemental Materials for full details. As illustrated in Table 8, we find evidence for configural, metric and scalar invariance, as well as equivalence in the latent means, for both the symbolic and realistic threat scales (all \u0394CFIs<.003; all \u0394 \u03a72 n.s; all \u0394RmSEAs <.007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002).\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19"}, {"heading": "Criterion validity.", "text": "Using SEM, we examined the association between symbolic threat and realistic threat (at\nT1), and all criterion outcomes assessed one week later (at T2), simultaneously in one model. See Table 9 for descriptive statistics and correlations.\nPsychological distress. Symbolic threat (at T1) was significantly positively associated\nwith COVID-19 impact avoidance, COVID-19 impact intrusion, and general anxiety over the course of the following week (measured at T2). Realistic threat was also associated with COVID-19 impact intrusion and anxiety, but was not associated with COVID-19 impact avoidance.\nPsychological well-being. Both types of threat (at T1) were positively associated with\nnegative affect experienced over the course of a subsequent week. Replicating Study 2, Realistic threat (but not symbolic threat) was negatively associated with life satisfaction. As in Study 2, we again observed an unanticipated significant positive relation between symbolic threat and positive affect.

Replicating Study 2, experiencing\nrealistic threat (at T1) was significantly and positively associated with support and compliance with public health initiatives to fight COVID-19 over the course of the subsequent week (assessed at T2). In direct contrast, experiencing symbolic threat was significantly and negatively associated with support and compliance.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nSymbolic threat (but not realistic threat) assessed at T1 was positively associated with\nengaging in behaviors (while in isolation) to affirm one\u2019s American identity over the course of the next week.4\nDiscussion\nBoth dimensions of the 10-item threat scale were invariant over time. This provides\ninitial evidence showing the scale can be used to compare changes in perceived threat over time (Flake et al., 2017).\nConsistent with Study 1-2, both threats were uniquely associated with greater\npsychological distress and diminished psychological well-being one week later (with some nuance in terms of which outcome they impacted). Both threats had distinct consequences for adherence to public health initiatives, such that realistic threat predicted greater self-reported compliance and support, while symbolic threat predicted diminished compliance and support. However, symbolic threat (but not realistic threat) was associated with greater engagement in behaviors affirming American identity.\n4 In all studies we assessed political ideology by having participants rate their overall political views from 1 (extremely conservative) to 7 (extremely liberal). Across studies, total threat was not related to political ideology; symbolic threat was weakly and inconsistently positively associated with conservatism and; realistic threat was consistently negatively associated with conservatism. We repeated the SEM analyses assessing outcomes, including political orientation as a predictor. Results were consistent except: In Study 2 the positive association between positive affect and symbolic threat became n.s.; In Study 2 the positive association between social identity affirmation and symbolic threat became n.s; in Study 3 the negative association between life satisfaction and realistic threat became marginal.

We note that participants in Study 3 were the same as those recruited in Study 1 (which reflects responses at T1 in Study 3).\np < .10 , *p=.05, **p=.01, ***p=.001\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nGeneral Discussion\nWe validated a ten-item scale assessing two kinds of psychological threats\u2014realistic\nthreat and symbolic threat\u2014in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal methodologies, we found the psychometric properties of the scale were sound, with both principal component analysis (Study 1) and confirmatory factor analysis (Study 2) supporting two distinct types of COVID-19 threat (realistic and symbolic). In Study 3, we also found evidence of strong scalar invariance when administering the scale twice over a one-week period (Flake, et al., 2017).\nOur scale demonstrated convergent and divergent validity. Symbolic and realistic threats\nwere significantly related to individual difference traits linked to threat sensitivity. On the other hand, COVID-19 threat was not reliably related to individual difference traits less clearly tied to threat sensitivity. This pattern of results was robust when we assessed COVID-19 threat and the individual difference traits at the same time, as well as when we assessed the individual difference traits five months prior to the pandemic hitting the United States.\nBoth threats were uniquely associated with important outcomes for psychological health\nand public health, when measured simultaneously with (Study 2) or one week prior (Study 3) to outcomes. Perceptions of symbolic and realistic threat were both uniquely associated with having greater anxiety, greater negative affect, and more intrusive thoughts about the pandemic. Realistic threat was also associated with diminished life-satisfaction, while symbolic threat was most consistently associated with having an avoidant response to the pandemic.\nSymbolic and realistic threats also had significant yet different consequences for self-\nreported adherence to and support of public health initiatives essential to stopping the spread of the virus (i.e., social distancing, hand washing). People who perceived high levels of realistic\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nthreat to their (and their group\u2019s) physical and financial security reported greater adherence and support for such practices. In direct contrast, people who perceived more symbolic threat to what it means to be an American, reported less support for and adherence to public health guidelines. However, if people do engage in social distancing, symbolic threat is positively associated with finding creative ways to enact and express their social (e.g., national) identity even in isolation. Implications\nThe global impact of COVID-19 is undeniable. Beyond the race for a vaccine and\ntreatment, it will be important for the scientific community to find ways to mitigate the psychological toll of the pandemic, and increase people\u2019s adherence to public health initiatives geared at reducing transmission (e.g., Everett et al., 2020). Investigating these questions requires valid and psychometrically sound tools, such as the Integrated COVID-19 Threat Scale we offer in this work.\nThe most obvious starting point for assessing threats posed by a global pandemic are\nrealistic threats, such as those captured by the recent Pew research poll (Pew Research Poll, Wave 63.5, March 10, 2020). By applying insights from theories of intergroup relations, we show the importance of also considering another distinct form of threat\u2014symbolic threats to social identity\u2014especially as they relate to public health behaviors. Only by considering both realistic and symbolic threats can we have a complete picture of how people respond to global health pandemics5.\nBy providing a scale to assess both threats, we provide a tool for research which aims to\ndevelop future interventions\u2014interventions which should hopefully address both realistic and\n5 In contexts in which both symbolic and realistic threat are theoretically expected to predict outcomes in the same direction, it may be acceptable to also combine both factors into a composite measure (so that shared variance is not lost). However, even in these contexts, like when assessing psychological distress, we find that useful information can be garnered from assessing the independent contributions of both threats.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nsymbolic threats. Our work is also one of the first papers to demonstrate the validity of applying theories of intergroup threat (Stephan et al., 2006) to understand how people perceive threats from an agent or entity other than another social group (but see Gamez-Djokic & Waytz, in press for their analysis of threat elicited by automation)."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "We note some limitations of this initial work. First, we only assessed COVID-19 threat\namongst online samples of Americans. People from different nations or cultural groups might be impacted differently by COVID-19, and may have different perceptions or responses to symbolic and realistic threats of the virus. For instance, nations with more (or less) vulnerable health care systems, or with greater (or less) poverty may be most susceptible to realistic threats posed by the pandemic. Cultures relying on social gatherings to express their identity (e.g., religious communities; ur-Rehman et al., 2020) may be particularly susceptible to symbolic threat. Future work is needed to validate our scale in these different social contexts, as well as with different racial groups, genders, and people of different socioeconomic status (Stephens, Markus, & Fryberg, 2012). This research relied fully on self-reported measures: More research is essential to see if our findings replicate when assessing actual behavior.\nWe acknowledge some unexpected results. In both Study 2 and Study 3, symbolic threat\nwas associated with greater positive affect. Exploratory parallel-mediation analysis we conducted suggests this increase in positive affect might be due to increases in practicing social identity affirming behaviors in social isolation but not diminished compliance with public health initiatives (See Supplemental Materials). Values relating to self-enhancement were also associated with realistic threat. While we did not predict this a priori, previous work has found self-enhancement to be associated with threat sensitivity (Schwartz et al., 2000). It is possible\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\npeople who value self-enhancement may be concerned about the realistic threat COVID-19 poses to their (or their group\u2019s) resources, as scarce resources can be important for maintaining power and status (Kachanoff & Taylor, 2017).\nConclusion\nAs the scientific community rallies to help flatten the curve of COVID-19 and mitigate its\nnegative psychological toll, it will be essential for us to fully capture how people feel threatened by the pandemic. We offer a brief scale which helps capture two important kinds of threat, and present preliminary evidence that it may be important for public health initiatives to not only help protect people\u2019s physical bodies, but also their social identities.\nPsychological Threats of COVID-19\nReferences\nAltemeyer, B.

Detailed Description of Sample, Measures and Results\nSample. Between March 19th and 20th, 2020, 399 American participants were recruited\nfrom MTurk. After pre-registered exclusions, 346 participants (160 male, 184 female, 2 other; Mage=41.51, SDage=13.46; 80.9% White, 9.5% Black or African American, 4.9% Latinx/Hispanic) completed all measures during the COVID-19 crisis. One-hundred and ninetythree of these participants (after exclusions, 86 male, 105 female, 2 other, Mage=42.27, SDage=13.99; 85.5% White, 8.8% Black or African American, 3.1% Latinx/Hispanic) also had completed all non-COVID-19 items in October 2019. We determined our sample size on the basis of the number of participants we had available in our pre-COVID-19 sample, and thus we aimed for ~ 200 participants who completed pre-COVID measures and ~200 new participants (to increase sample size and statistical power). A large sample size of ~ 400 (or ~ 200 cases for our longitudinal sub-sample) provides sufficient power (> 80%) for the correlational based analyses we used in this study in which we expected effects of at least r=.20. We also had at least 5-10 observations per parameter for our planned SEM analysis (in this case at least an n=150; see Kline, 2011). See our pre-registration at https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=zj99wh for more information1 Measures\nAll scores represent the means of all items, with the exception of the Beck Anxiety\nInventory and Impact of the COVID-19 event which was summed according to guidelines (Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alverez, 1979).\nIntegrative COVID-19 Threat Scale. All items were framed with the opening: \u201cHow\nmuch of a threat, if any, is the coronavirus outbreak to\u2026\u201d and were rated from 1 (Not a threat) to\n1 We note that the scales focused on in Study 1 were part of a larger study focusing on the impact of COVID-19 threat and morality most broadly. See registration for all collected measures.\n4 (Major Threat). To assess realistic threat, we adapted 5 pre-existing items ( during_COV19 =.77)\nused by the Pew Research Poll (Pew Research Poll, Wave 63.5, March 10, 2020) to document perceived threat of COVID-19. Participants were asked about the threat of COVID-19 to \u201cyour personal health\u201d, \u201cthe health of the U.S. population as a whole\u201d, \u201cyour personal financial safety\u201d, \u201cthe U.S economy\u201d, and \u201cday-to-day life in your local community\u201d\nWe used 5 items ( during_COV19 =.85) to assess symbolic threat of COVID-19. Four items\nwere based on Stephan and colleagues\u2019 (2006) definition of symbolic threat cited above. We asked participants if they felt COVID-19 poses a threat to \u201cWhat it means to be American\u201d, \u201cAmerican values and traditions\u201d, \u201cThe maintenance of law and order in America\u201d, and \u201cAmerican Democracy\u201d. We also included one item assessing threat to the \u201cThe rights and freedoms of the U.S. population as a whole\u201d adapted from Kachanoff and colleagues (2019).\nWe used 5 novel items ( during_COV19 =.85) to assess symbolic threat of COVID-19. Four\nitems were based on Stephan and colleagues\u2019 (2006) definition of symbolic threat cited above. Specifically, we asked participants if they felt COVID-19 poses a threat to \u201cWhat it means to be American\u201d, \u201cAmerican values and traditions\u201d, \u201cThe maintenance of law and order in America\u201d, and \u201cAmerican Democracy\u201d. We also included one item based on Kachanoff and colleagues\u2019 (2019, in press) extension of symbolic threat as involving threats to the group\u2019s collective freedoms. Participants reported whether COVID-19 poses a threat to \u201cThe rights and freedoms of the U.S. population as a whole\u201d.2\n2 For full transparently, in this initial study we generated a pool of 20 items to explore different types of threat which go beyond the focus of this paper (e.g., threat to loved ones). All items are shown below p.9 and we make the data for all items available on OSF. We decided not to focus on items pertaining to loved ones because of their substantial overlap with items pertaining to the self. We also limited the realistic threat items to only those used in the PEW poll so are findings can generalize to their report. Because of the exploratory nature of our initial scale construction we validated our scale structure in two subsequent pre-registered studies (Study 2 and 3) using only the 10-items we focused on.\nConvergent validity. We tested whether each dimension of COVID-19 (as well as the\ntotal threat scale) related significantly to several individual difference traits which were found in previous research to associate threat sensitivity in other contexts (e.g., intergroup contexts). These included:\nThe Need for Cognitive Closure. We assessed need for cognitive closure with 15 items\n(Webster & Kruglanski, 1998). Participants rated agreement on a scale anchored at 1 (Completely Disagree) and 6 (Completely Agree). A sample item included: \u201cI feel uncomfortable when I don\u2019t understand the reason why an event occurred in my life\u201d\n( before_COV19 = .89 ; during_COV19 = .89 ).\nThe Fear of a Dangerous World. We assessed fear of a dangerous world with 12 items\n(Altemeyer, 1988). Participants rated agreement on a scale anchored a 1 (Strongly Disagree) and 7 (Strongly Agree). A sample item included: \u201cThere are many dangerous people in our society\nwho will attach someone out of pure meaness, for no reason at all\u201d ( before_COV19 = .92 ;\nduring_COV19 = .93 ).\nValues associated with Conservation. We assessed the importance that people placed on\nthree values tapping into Schwartz\u2019s (1992) conceptualization of conservation: valuing security, conformity, and tradition (items adapted from Stern, Dietz, & Guagnano, 1998). Participants rated each value (e.g., security) on a scale anchored at 0 (Opposed to My Principals) and 8 (Of\nSupreme Importance; before_COV19 = .63 ; during_COV19 = .65)\nEmotional Stability (Neuroticism). We assessed emotional stability using two items from\nthe Ten Item Personality Inventory (Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003). Participants rated if they saw themselves as having different traits on a scale anchored at 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7\n(Strongly Agree). A sample item included: \u201cAnxious, easily upset\u201d ( rbefore_COV19 = .69 ; rduring_COV19 =.41) .\nDivergent Validity. We also tested if, compared to values associated with conservation,\nthere would be relatively weaker associations between COVID-19 threat and other values assessed using the Schwartz value survey: These included values associated with openness to change (i.e., stimulation, self-direction; rbefore_COV19 = ; rduring_COV19 = .23), values associated with\nself-enhancement (i.e., achievements, hedonism, power; before_COV19 = ; during_COV19 = .58 ;), and\nvalues associated with self-transcendence (i.e., universalism, benevolence; rbefore_COV19 = ; rduring_COV19 =.33 ;).\nSimilarly, we tested whether compared to emotional stability we would find relatively\nweaker associations between COVID-19 threat and other personality traits assessed using the Ten Item Personality Inventory: extraversion (rbefore_COV19 = .70 ; rduring_COV19 = .69), agreeableness (rbefore_COV19 = .18 ; rduring_COV19 = .31), conscientiousness (rbefore_COV19 = .51 ; rduring_COV19 = .49), and openness to experience (rbefore_COV19 = .52 ; rduring_COV19 = .46).\nBecause there is no clear theoretical basis to suggest their association with threat, we did not\nexpect associations with perceived threat from COVID-19.\nCriterion Validity.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic. We assessed distress in response to the pandemic by\nadapting the 15-item Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alverez, 1979). The scale assesses potentially maladaptive responses to traumatic or stressful events. The scale includes two distinct sub-scales assessing (1) impact intrusion (i.e., whether people have intrusive\nthoughts about the event, e.g., \u201cI thought about the event when I didn\u2019t mean to\u201d during_COV19 =\n.87); and (2) impact avoidance (i.e., whether people avoided thinking about the event, e.g., \u201cI\nstayed away from reminders of the virus\u201d; during_COV19 = .81). Participants rated how much each\nof these affective responses to COVID-19 were true of how they felt during the past seven days. Responses were rated on a scale anchored at 0 (Not at all) and 3 (Often).\nAnxiety. We assessed general anxiety using the 9-item Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck,\nEpstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988). Participants rated symptom severity of anxiety symptoms in the past week on a scale anchored at 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Severely \u2013 I could barely stand it;\nbefore_COV19 = .85 ; during_COV19 = .87).\nResults\nFactor Structure of COVID Threat Scale\nWe used Principal Component Analysis to extract the factors, and a Varimax rotation to\ninterpret the factor loadings (Bryant & Yarnold, 1995; Thompson, 2004). This analysis revealed a 2-factor solution in which one factor reflected the 5 items assessing symbolic threat of the pandemic (Eigen Value = 4.20, Variance Explained = 42.02%) and one factor reflected the 5 items assessing realistic threat from the pandemic (Eigen Value = 1.64, Variance Explained = 16.34%). We summarize the rotated factor loadings for each scale item in Table 1.\n(See Table 1 reported in Main Text)\nCross-Sectional Analysis (Full Sample)\nWe report in Table 2 descriptive statistics for all scales measured during the COVID-19\ncrisis (i.e., N= 346 participants) as well as the zero-order correlations between symbolic and realistic threat and each other variable.\n(See Table 2 reported in Main Text)\nConvergent and divergent validity. Overall, we found evidence for convergent and\ndivergent validity of the COVID-19 threat scale. Consistent with the literature, the perceived threat of COVID-19 (combining both dimensions) was positively associated with the need for cognitive closure, belief in a dangerous world, values associated with conservation, and was negatively associated with emotional stability. In contrast, indicating divergent validity, threat to COVID-19 (combining both dimensions) was not significantly associated with any of the other dimensions of Schwartz\u2019s value scale or the Ten-Item-Personality Inventory.\nResults were consistent when we examined the associations for each threat dimension\nseparately, with a few exceptions. Valuing conservation was robustly associated with symbolic threat but not realistic threat. However, examination of the sub-values associated with conservation revealed that realistic threat was significantly related to valuing security (r(346)=.15, p=.006), but not valuing tradition, or conformity. Symbolic threat in contrast was significantly associated with all three sub-dimensions (all ps<.001). We also observed an unanticipated significant association between symbolic threat and values associated with selfenhancement.\nCriterion Validity. We examined the association between symbolic threat and realistic\nthreat, and the three negative psychological responses that people might have to the pandemic (i.e., anxiety, COVID-19 impact intrusion and COVID-19 impact avoidance) simultaneously within one structural equation path model (SEM; Byrne, 1994). This analysis was conducted using the Lavaan package in R (Rosseel, 2012). In the model, we regressed each of the three outcomes onto both threat dimensions. We allowed the two threat dimensions to covary, and, the three outcomes to covary. The model was fully saturated, \u03c72 (0) = 0. Our results remained\nconsistent when regressing symbolic and realistic threat simultaneously on each single outcome in a series of separate regressions.\nSymbolic threat was significantly positively associated with COVID-19 impact\navoidance (b=.98, 95% CI [.26, 1.70], p=.008) and COVID-19 impact intrusion (b=1.10, 95% CI [.43, 1.77], p=.001), but was not significantly associated with anxiety (b=.56, 95% CI [-.14, 1.26], p=.114). Realistic threat was significantly positively associated with anxiety (b=2.79, 95% CI [1.85, 3,72], p<.001), as well as with COVID-19 impact intrusion (b=3.18, 95% CI [2.29, 4.07], p<.001), but was not associated with COVID-19 impact avoidance (b=.25, 95% CI [-.72, 1.22], p=.613).\nStudy 1 from the Qualtrics Survey Threat of COVID-19- Initial Item Pool: We initially generated an exploratory pool of 20 items to explore people\u2019s threat of COVID-19. The final 10 items focused on in the paper are reported in Table 1 of the main text.\nThe Need for Cognitive Closure\nThe Belief in a Dangerous World\nSchwartz Value Survey (adapted to be condensed for present research)\nTen Item Personality Inventory (TIPI)\nImpact of Event Scale \u2013 Adapted to COVID-19 Context\nBeck Anxiety Inventory\nStudy 2 \u2013 Detailed Description of Sample, Measures, and Results\nSample. Five-hundred and fifty American participants recruited from Mturk completed\nthe survey on March 26th, 2020. After pre-registered exclusions, 537 participants (256 male, 278 female, 3 other; Mage=41.51, SDage=13.46; 77.8% White, 11.7% Black or African American, 5.6% Latinx/Hispanic) were included in our analyses. We pre-registered a desired sample of at least ~ 500 participants and oversampled (i.e., N=550) in anticipation of exclusions. We aimed for a slightly larger sample size than Study 1 to ensure that we followed guidelines of having at least 5-10 cases per parameter in our pre-determined CFA and SEM models (in this case at least 105-210 for our CFA model and 330-660 for our SEM model; see Kline, 2011).

We assessed realistic threat ( =.73) and\nsymbolic threat ( =.86) using the 10-items we focused on in Study 1.\nConvergent Validity. We used scales identical to Study 1 to assess the need for\ncognitive closure ( = .89), the fear of a dangerous world ( = .89), values related to\nconservation ( = .92), emotional stability (r =.64).\nDivergent Validity.

We assessed people\u2019s general satisfaction with life using Diener\u2019s five-\nitem scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, Griffin, 1985). Participants rated each item on a scale anchored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) and 7 (Strongly Agree). A sample item included: \u201cIn most\nways my life is close to my ideal\u201d; = .89).\nPositive and Negative Affect. Participants rated their positive affect ( = .91) and negative\naffect ( = .92) at the time of writing the survey using the PANAS short form (Watson, Clark, &\nTellegen, 1988). Participants rated to what extent they felt each emotion at the time of completing the survey with scales anchored at 1 (Very Slightly or Not at All) and 7 (Extremely).\nAttitudinal and Behavioral Responses to COVID-19.\nCompliance with the Center for Infectious Diseases (CDC) guidelines. We adapted three\nitems from Everette and colleagues (2020) used to assess how much people reported adhering to the practices recommended by the CDC for preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Participants rated how much they were doing each of these behaviors on a scale anchored at 1 (Not at All) and 5 (Always). A sample item included: \u201cStaying at home and avoiding all social\ncontact\u201d ( =.68).\nSocial Identity Affirming Behaviors in Isolation. We developed 4 items to assess support\nfor restrictive policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. Participants rated their agreement with the following statements: \u201cThe social distancing restrictions being put into place to stop the spread of Covid-19 are doing more harm than good\u201d (reverse coded) ; \u201cWe need to\nprioritize going back to our normal routines as soon as possible, regardless of COVID-19\u2019s spread\u201d (reverse coded); \u201cRight now the most important thing we can do is take all measures possible to stop the spread of COVID-19\u201d; \u201cIt is essential that we strictly practice social distancing as a nation, until health care experts say otherwise\u201d. Participants rated agreement to\neach item on a scale anchored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree) ( = .89).\nIntegrative COVID-19 Threat Scale. We developed five items to assess how much people\nengaged in behaviors aimed at maintaining their old way of life while still conforming to restrictive social distancing. Participants rated how much they were doing each of these behaviors on a scale anchored at 1 (Not at All) and 5 (Always). Behaviors included: \u201cI find creative new ways to maintain my old routines (e.g., video chats with family and friends; online exercise classes; cultural activities online)\u201d ; \u201cI watch or listen to music, videos, movies, or replays of cultural events that remind me most of American culture\u201d; \u201cI share things with my friends and family on the phone or through social media that remind us of what life was like in America before COVID-19\u201d ; \u201cI engage with \u201cvirtual communities\u201d through social media and online groups to replace the in-person communities I can no longer be a part of\u201d ; \u201cI engage in behaviors that I associate with American identity (e.g., I cook foods that make me feel\nAmerican)\u201d ( =.80).\nResults"}, {"heading": "Confirmatory Factor Analysis", "text": "We conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; Byrne, 1994) to test whether a two-\nfactor solution representing symbolic threat and realistic threat perceptions of COVID-19 fit our data well (See Figure 1). Overall, the two-factor model had acceptable model fit indices: comparative fit index (CFI)=.93, standard root mean square intervals (SRMR)=.06, root mean\nsquare error Approximation (RMSEA)=.08, 90% CI[.07, .10], BIC=12206.97, 2 =161.08 (Hu &\nBentler, 1999; Byrne, 1994; Steiger, 1990) and no negative error variances or improper solutions. We compared the two-factor model to a one-factor model which did not differentiate between symbolic threat or realistic threat (CFI=.75, SRMR=.12, RMSEA=.15, 90% CI[.14,.16], BIC=12519.63, 2 =480.37). The one-factor model had inferior model fit, dif2 =-319.29,\np<.001. Convergent and divergent validity\nWe report in Table 4 descriptive statistics and inter-item correlations for the variables\npertaining to convergent and divergent validity.\nOverall, we found a consistent pattern of results with Study 1. As in Study 1, the\nperceived threat of COVID-19 (combining both dimensions) was positively associated with the need for cognitive closure, belief in a dangerous world, values related to conservation, and was negatively associated with emotional stability. Supporting divergent validity, threat to COVID19 (combining both dimensions) was not significantly associated with the other dimensions of Schwartz\u2019s value scale of the Ten-Item-Personality Invention with the exception of a week yet significant correlation with self-enhancement values (this association was also observed in Study 1 when assessing self-enhancement values 5 months prior to the global pandemic).\nOur results were mostly consistent when we examined the associations for each threat\ndimension separately. Overall, conservation was robustly associated with symbolic threat but not realistic threat. However, as in Study 1, realistic threat was significantly related to valuing security (r(537)=.11, p=.010), but not valuing tradition, or conformity. Symbolic threat in contrast was significantly associated valuing tradition and conformity (all ps<.001), but not valuing security (r(537)=.02, p=.657. Consistent with Study 1, we again observed unanticipated\nsignificant associations between symbolic threat and values relating to self-enhancement, and realistic threat and values relating self-transcendence. Criterion Validity\nIn Table 5 we summarize descriptive statistics for all nine criterion outcomes, as well as\ntheir zero-order correlations with realistic and symbolic threat.\n(Table 5 is presented in Main Manuscript)\nWe examined the association between symbolic threat and realistic threat, and all\ncriterion outcomes of interest simultaneously within one structural equation path model (SEM; Byrne, 1994). This analysis was conducted using the Lavaan package in R (Rosseel, 2012). In the model, we regressed each of the 9 criterion outcomes onto both threat dimensions. We allowed the two threat dimensions to covary, and, the nine psychological response outcomes to covary. The model was fully saturated, \u03c72 (0) = 0. Results for the SEM path analyses are summarized in Table 6. Our results remained consistent when regressing symbolic and realistic threat simultaneously on each single outcome in a series of separate regressions.\nPsychological Distress. Replicating Study 1, symbolic threat was significantly positively\nassociated with COVID-19 impact avoidance and COVID-19 impact intrusion. In contrast to Study 1 we found that symbolic threat was also associated significantly associated with anxiety. Replicating Study 1, realistic threat was significantly positively associated with anxiety and COVID-19 impact intrusion. In contrast to Study 1, realistic threat was also associated with COVID-19 impact avoidance.\nPsychological Well-Being. Experiencing symbolic and realistic appeared to be\ndetrimental for psychological well-being. Both types of threat were robustly positively associated\nwith negative affect. Realistic threat (but not symbolic threat) was negatively associated with life satisfaction.\nWe observed an unanticipated significant positive relation between symbolic threat and\npositive affect. To probe this effect further, we conducted an exploratory parallel-mediation analysis in which we tested whether experiencing symbolic threat was associated with greater positive affect because of symbolic threat being associated with (1) reductions in adherence to CDC guidelines and/or (2) increases in social identity affirming behaviors. The two potential mediators (CDC adherence and identity affirming behaviors) were entered in parallel in the model. We found a significant indirect effect of symbolic threat on positive affect through greater engagement in social identity affirming behaviors (indirect effect = .37, 95%[.01, .78]) but not in changes to CDC adherence (indirect effect = .06, 95%[-.07, .22]).\nAttitudinal and Behavioral Responses to COVID-19. As we predicted, experiencing\nsymbolic threat was significantly and negatively associated with support for restrictive preventative policies like social distancing, and significantly less self-reported behavioral adherence to CDC guidelines. In direct contrast, we found that experiencing realistic threat was significantly and positively associated with support for restrictive preventative policies like social distancing, and significantly greater self-reported behavioral adherence to CDC guidelines.\nAs we expected, symbolic threat was positively associated with engaging in behaviors\n(while in isolation) to affirm one\u2019s American identity (e.g., cooking food people associate with America). Realistic threats were also significantly positively associated with such behaviors.\n(Table 6 is presented in Main Manuscript\nStudy 2 Scales from the Qualtrics Survey *Note.

We examined the invariance of both subscales using longitudinal\nconfirmatory factor analysis (Meredith, 1993) with the SemTools package in R (Jorgensen, 2019). Because we confirmed there being two distinct factors in Study 2, and because all our\nanalyses focus on the separate sub-scales we explored the invariance of each sub-scale separately.\nTo assess whether our scale items assessed the same construct over time (configural\ninvariance) we allowed the factor loadings, item intercepts, residual item variances, and the variance of the latent means to freely co-vary across groups. The latent means were set to equal zero. To assess whether the scale had the same meaning overtime (metric invariance) we fixed the factor loadings to be equivalent across groups and assessed the resulting change in model fit relative to the configural (base-line) model. To justify mean comparisons across time (scalar invariance) we additionally constrained the item intercepts and fixed the latent means of one group to 0 while estimating the latent means in the other group: we compared the scalar invariance model to the metric invariance model. Lastly, in an additional model, we constrained the latent means to be equivalent across groups and compared this to the scalar invariance model. As illustrated in Table 8 we find evidence for configural, metric and scalar invariance, as well as equivalence in the latent means, for both the symbolic and realistic threat scales (all \u0394CFIs<.003; all \u0394 \u03a72 n.s, ; all \u0394RmSEAs <.007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002).\n(Table 8 is Presented in Main Manuscript)\nCriterion Validity\nIn Table 9 we summarize descriptive statistics for all nine criterion outcomes, as well as\ntheir zero-order correlations with realistic and symbolic threat.\n(Table 9 is Presented in Main Manuscript)\nUsing SEM, we examined the association between symbolic threat and realistic threat (at\nT1), and all criterion outcomes assessed one week later, simultaneously in one model.

Both types of threat (at T1) were robustly positively\nassociated with negative affect experienced over the course of a subsequent week. Replicating Study 2, Realistic threat (but not symbolic threat) was negatively associated with life satisfaction.\nAs in Study 2, we again observed an unanticipated significant positive relation between\nsymbolic threat and positive affect. As in Study 2, we also found a significant indirect effect of symbolic threat on positive affect through greater engagement in social identity affirming behaviors (indirect effect = .60, 95%[.18,1.11]) but not in changes to CDC adherence (indirect effect = -.09, 95%[-.44, .14]), when we conducted an exploratory parallel-mediation analysis (both mediators were entered simultaneously into one model).\nAttitudinal and Behavioral Responses to COVID-19.

In our study (N = 783), conducted shortly after the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in our country, we examined whether people with higher anxiety and lack of control concerning the pandemic adopt more conspiracy beliefs about the origin, spread and potential cure of the new coronavirus. We also tested whether the rise of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs is associated with the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect (i.e. paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific) beliefs as well. Our results show that higher perception of risk and lower trust in institutions concerning the COVID-19 pandemic were related to the feelings of anxiety and lack of control which in turn predicted an increase in coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Importantly, these beliefs were further related to the higher endorsement of generic paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific beliefs. The results show how threatening events, such as the current pandemic, lead to a rise in various epistemically suspect beliefs by increasing people\u2019s feelings of anxiety and lack of control.\nKeywords: conspiracy beliefs, COVID-19, anxiety, lack of control, epistemically suspect beliefs\nAs we are writing this, people all over the world face the outbreak of the new coronavirus which has led to a serious crisis in many countries. Regardless of how far away you are from the closest disease epicenter, you are likely flooded by information about the coronavirus \u2013 the sharply increasing figures of the identified cases and fatalities, and the harsh preventive measures which have to be taken simply to give us a fighting chance against the deadly infection. Not only are many people under the risk that they will contract the COVID-19 disease but even those who are in relative safety are likely to feel that everything may change for the worse in a matter of mere days. Unsurprisingly, people are feeling anxious and without control about what is to come. Such feelings prompt sense-making mechanisms focused on reducing anxiety and regaining the sense of control which have been shown to lead to a higher susceptibility to various conspiracy explanations of the events that are taking place (van Prooijen, 2019; van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). In the present study, we examined whether the feelings of anxiety and lack of control about the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with the endorsement of conspiracy beliefs about the origin, spread, and potential cure of the coronavirus. Importantly, we also aimed to establish whether the increase of coronavirusspecific conspiracy beliefs will prompt people to adopt generic unwarranted beliefs as well.\nSocietal crises and stressful events \u2013 e.g. natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or stock market crashes \u2013 may lead to an increased belief in conspiracy theories by evoking the feelings of anxiety and lack of control (van Prooijen, 2019; van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). Conspiracy beliefs have an important psychological function \u2013 they are the result of sense-making mechanisms that provide people with a feeling of security and meaning in the world after they encountered some threatening event (van Prooijen & van Vugt, 2018). Put simply, conspiracy theories thrive because they give people a scapegoat \u2013 be it their government, pharmaceutical industry, or financial giants \u2013 who could be blamed for what has happened. It is often much\nwithout it being anyone\u2019s fault in particular.\nThere is ample evidence for the role of anxiety and lack of control in higher belief in conspiracy theories (for reviews, see van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017; van Prooijen & van Vugt, 2018). For example, lack of control has been associated with the more pronounced perception of patterns in random stimuli as well as specifically with the higher endorsement of various popular conspiracy theories (van Prooijen & Acker, 2015; Whitson & Galinsky, 2008). The effect of stressful and anxiety-provoking situations on higher conspiratorial thinking was also reported (Grzesiak-Feldman, 2013; Swami et al., 2016), although the evidence is somewhat mixed in this regard. However, this might be because the studies mostly examined a connection between anxiety or stress in general and the endorsement of conspiracy beliefs which were not related to the sources of that stress or anxiety. In our study, we focus on the feelings of anxiety and lack of control with regard to the COVID-19 outbreak and their relationship to the conspiracy beliefs specifically related to the new coronavirus. As such, we hypothesize that both higher anxiety and feeling of lacking control about one\u2019s life will be associated with the endorsement of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs.\nAn open question is whether threatening events prompt people to adopt conspiracy beliefs pertaining to that specific situation or rather they stimulate a mentality in which people endorse more epistemically suspect beliefs1 in general. Previous research showed that people who believe in some specific conspiracy theories are very prone to hold other non-related conspiracy beliefs as well (Swami, Chamorro-Premuzic, & Furnham, 2010), and they are also much more\n1 The term \u201eepistemically suspect beliefs\u201c is used to refer to categories of beliefs which are based on claims that either cannot be empirically tested, are unsupported, or disproven by modern science. These are mainly thought to comprise various paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific beliefs (e.g., \u010cavojov\u00e1, \u0160rol, & Jurkovi\u010d, 2020; Lobato, Mendoza, Sims, & Chin, 2014; Pennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015; \u0160rol, n.d.)\nal., 2014; \u0160rol, n.d.). A study by Lewandowsky, Oberauer, and Gignac (2013; however, see Landrum & Olshansky, 2019) further shows that conspiratorial ideation may be the key factor in explaining the rejection of well-established scientific findings and subsequently, the endorsement of pseudoscientific beliefs. Based on this evidence, we expected that not only will people with stronger feelings of anxiety and lack of control concerning the COVID-19 pandemic endorse more coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs, but also that there will be a spillover effect which will subsequently make these people prone to adopt more conspiracy, paranormal and pseudoscientific beliefs in general.\nTo help us better understand the role of anxiety and lack of control in the increased belief in conspiracy theories about the coronavirus, we have included two additional variables in our study \u2013 coronavirus risk perception and trust in the institution\u2019s response with regard to the coronavirus outbreak. Concerning the risk perception, Van Prooijen and Van Dijk (2014) showed that events with larger consequences invoke more conspiracy beliefs in comparison with inconsequential events. More threatening and harmful events have a higher potential to increase people\u2019s feelings of anxiety and stress which could then result in a higher tendency toward conspiratorial thinking. This is important since COVID-19 may not be equally threatening to all people. For example, older individuals may feel more at risk since the infection is much more dangerous for them (Zhou et al., 2020). Therefore, higher perception of risk associated with the COVID-19 infection will likely lead to stronger feelings of anxiety and these will subsequently predict the endorsement of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs.\nTrust in institutions\u2019 response to the coronavirus outbreak may be an important variable related to the lack of control. Since people themselves can do little about the pandemic, they have to rely on the appropriate institutions \u2013 governments, WHO, doctors and scientists \u2013 to tackle the virus. If they believe these authorities are not doing enough, this may be crucial for developing\nwith a range of popular conspiracy beliefs (van Prooijen & Acker, 2015). Indeed, it is at the very nature of conspiracy mentality to be paranoid when it comes to authorities and distrustful of scientists, governments or international organizations (Landrum & Olshansky, 2019). This is why we expected the trust in institutions to negatively predict people\u2019s feelings of lacking control and thus lead to an increase in coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs.\nMETHODS"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Data were collected through queries on social media as well as through participant recruitment agency, which distributed our online survey among 500 Slovak participants. In total, we received data from 976 people who have read the informed consent and agreed to take part in the study, however, 193 did not pass the attention check controls and their data were omitted from all analyses. The final sample consisted of 783 participants (417 female, 363 male, 3 preferred not to disclose their gender), who filled in the questionnaire between 13th and 22nd March 20202. Participants were aged between 18 \u2013 84 years (M = 42.00, SD = 16.84). Most of the sample reported having finished high school with diploma (38.2%), or that they attended college which they finished after obtaining bachelor\u2019s (10.6%), master\u2019s (39.5%), or doctoral degree (4.5%). The rest of the participants either finished high school without diploma (4.7%) or attainted elementary education (2.6%).\n2 During this period, there were 32 \u2013 185 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Slovakia. On the 16th of March the Slovak government initiated harsh preventive actions which gradually started to take place. These included limiting all personal foreign travel, compulsory quarantine for people who came from abroad, closing of schools and most non-essential shops and services.\nFeelings of anxiety and lack of control with regard to the coronavirus pandemics. Participants indicated their agreement with 12 statements reflecting feelings about the new coronavirus pandemic. Six of the statements pertained to feelings of anxiety (e.g. \u201cWhen it comes to the new coronavirus, I am afraid that we are all in a grave danger\u201d) and the other six were related to the feelings of lacking control about one\u2019s life or health as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. \u201cI am afraid that the new coronavirus has already spread so much that we will no longer be able to stop it \u201d). Participants rated the statements on a seven-point scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). Average ratings on the respective six items were used to measure the feelings of anxiety (M = 4.32, SD = 1.17, \u03b1 = .69) and lack of control (M = 3.47, SD = 1.08, \u03b1 = .67) with regard to the new coronavirus.\nPerceived risk of coronavirus. Participants rated three items about the perceived infectiousness, severity, and overall dangerousness of the new coronavirus. Their average rating on a sevenpoint scale was used as a measure of perceived risk of the coronavirus (M = 5.65, SD = 1.07, \u03b1 = .86).\nTrust in institutions. Three items were used to measure participants\u2019 trust in institutions. Using a seven-point scale, participants rated the degree to which they trusted that the Slovak government, World Health Organization, and doctors and researchers took appropriate actions and preventive measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The average rating on the three items was 4.89 (SD = 1.20, \u03b1 = .62).\nCoronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Participants were given 10 statements pertaining to the coronavirus and were asked to rate the extent to which they believed the respective statements. The statements described various conspiracy theories or typical conspiracist ideas concerning the outbreak, spread, and potential cure of the new coronavirus (e.g., \u201cCOVID-19\nrelabeled to increase the sales of drugs\u201d). The average rating on these ten items was used as the endorsement of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs (M = 2.07, SD = 0.87, \u03b1 = .90).\nGeneric epistemically suspect beliefs. To measure the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect beliefs, we used a questionnaire taken from \u0160rol (n.d.). For the purpose of our study, we selected 6 items for paranormal, 6 items pertaining to conspiracy, and 7 items measuring pseudoscientific beliefs. Participants were asked to rate their agreement with the statements on a 5-point scale. We used average ratings on the respective scales as the measure of the endorsement of paranormal (M = 2.85, SD = 0.80, \u03b1 = .69), conspiracy (M = 2.20, SD = 0.92, \u03b1 = .86), and pseudoscientific beliefs (M = 2.50, SD = 0.68, \u03b1 = .72)."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "The relationships among the main variables in the study are first examined through correlation analysis. We inspect the correlations between feelings of anxiety and lack of control, coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs and generic epistemically suspect beliefs, as well as risk perception, trust in institutions, and demographic factors. Next, we present mediation analyses conducted to test whether the feelings of anxiety and lack of control about the COVID-19 pandemics predict an increase in coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs which then lead to a higher tendency to endorse generic epistemically suspect beliefs. Finally, two mediation models are presented to examine whether anxiety and lack of control mediate the relationships between trust in institutions, risk perception, and coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs.\nCorrelates of the coronavirus-specific and generic epistemically suspect beliefs\nCorrelations among the main variables are presented in Table 1. First, we focus on the key question of whether anxiety and lack of control are related to the increased endorsement of\nendorsement of all three types of epistemically suspect beliefs is strongly intercorrelated (see also \u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Lobato et al., 2014; \u0160rol, n.d.), we have calculated a single composite score by averaging the ratings on all 19 items of the epistemically suspect belief questionnaire (M = 2.52, SD = 0.68, \u03b1 = .89). Both anxiety and lack of control are consistently positively related to the endorsement of coronavirus-specific conspiracies as well as generic epistemically suspect beliefs. While the lack of control seems slightly more strongly associated with coronavirus-specific and generic conspiracy beliefs than anxiety, both of the main predictors show weak to moderate correlations with all of the epistemically suspect belief variables.\nAs could be expected, a higher perception of risk of the coronavirus is strongly related to feelings of anxiety and also moderately correlated with a lack of control. Interestingly, risk perception shows correlations, albeit weak, not only with coronavirus-specific but also generic epistemically suspect beliefs. The same is true for the trust in the institution\u2019s response about the coronavirus, it correlates with all epistemically suspect beliefs except for generic paranormal claims. Also, participants with higher trust in institutions exhibited slightly less anxiety and lack of control about the coronavirus pandemics.\nSeveral demographic factors showed up to have a noteworthy role in regard to the present analyses. Age was correlated with a slightly higher endorsement of all epistemically suspect beliefs. More importantly, older people had a much higher risk perception of the coronavirus and felt more anxious and lacking control. This is understandable since age is a very important risk factor associated with suffering a worse course of the COVID-19 infection (Zhou et al., 2020). Concerning gender, females also felt slightly more anxious and lacking control and endorsed more paranormal and pseudoscientific beliefs than men. This latter finding is in line with some past research which has already shown that women are slightly less likely to reject epistemically suspect beliefs than men (e.g. Lobato et al., 2014). Finally, higher education was\nepistemically suspect beliefs, which is in line with many prior studies (e.g., Aarnio & Lindeman, 2005; Lindeman, 2011; St\u00e5hl & van Prooijen, 2018; van Prooijen, 2017).\nTable 1.

Percentile bootstrap confidence intervals for indirect effects were calculated using 10,000 bootstrap samples. All mediation models were constructed after the model 4 outlined by Hayes (2018). Additionally, in all of the mediation models presented below, we controlled for participants\u2019 age, gender, and education as covariates, since all of these demographic factors were meaningfully related to the main variables included in the mediation models (see Table 1). However, note that all mediations were also run without controlling for age, gender and education, and the results were completely consistent with what is reported below.\nWe examined two mediation models: Model 1 with anxiety (X) as a predictor of generic epistemically suspect beliefs (Y) and coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs as a mediator (M) depicted in Figure 1A, and Model 2 with lack of control (X) as a predictor of generic epistemically suspect beliefs (Y) and coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs as a mediator (M) depicted in Figure 1B. In both analyses, coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs fully mediated the effect of anxiety or lack of control on the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect beliefs. After controlling for coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs, neither feeling of anxiety nor lack of control concerning the COVID-19 pandemic predicted the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect beliefs. However, both of the factors were associated with higher belief in conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. This rise in coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs was further strongly predictive of the endorsement of epistemically suspect beliefs in general. The results show that it is not just that anxiety and lack of control stemming from the current pandemic increase specific conspiracy beliefs associated with the coronavirus, but through them, people become more prone to adopt other unwarranted beliefs as well.\nresponse\nTwo mediation models were carried out to help us better understand the feelings of anxiety and lack of control about the coronavirus by examining participant\u2019s perception of risk associated with COVID-19 infection and trust that the key institutions made the appropriate response to stop the spread of the virus.\nFirst, we examined whether the coronavirus risk perception (X) increases the coronavirusspecific conspiracy beliefs (Y) directly or rather whether this effect is mediated by feelings of anxiety (M). As can be seen from Figure 2A, anxiety fully mediates the effect of risk perception on coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Cognitive perception of the risk of the virus of itself does not seem to lead to increased conspiratorial thinking. Rather it increases the feelings of anxiety which in turn lead to a higher tendency to make sense of the situation by adopting various conspiratorial explanations for the events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the final mediation model, we entered the trust in the institution\u2019s response to the COVID19 outbreak (X) as a predictor of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs (Y) with a lack of control (M) as a mediator of this effect. Feeling the lack of control about one\u2019s health because of the coronavirus partially mediated the effect of trust in the institution\u2019s response on conspiracy beliefs about the COVID-19 (Figure 2B). The negative direct effect of trust in the institution\u2019s response on conspiracy beliefs about the COVID-19 is, however, also significant. This likely reflects the fact that trust in institutions is central to most conspiracy motives and has been shown to negatively predict the endorsement of various popular conspiracy theories (van Prooijen & Acker, 2015). Therefore, while the distrust in the institution\u2019s effort to stop the outbreak does lead to a higher lack of control, it is also directly related to higher conspiracy beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemics.\nThe present study shows that people who feel anxious and lacking control about their lives amidst the ongoing pandemic adopt more conspiracy beliefs related to the origin and spread of the COVID-19. Our results fit well with existing theoretical accounts (van Prooijen, 2019; van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017; van Prooijen & van Vugt, 2018), which propose that witnessing threatening situations increases conspiracy belief by the means of increased anxiety and lack of control which naturally lead to the higher sense-making efforts. Importantly, the findings go a step further that the previous research and show that such an increase in conspiracy beliefs may further lead to a higher endorsement of variety of generic paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific beliefs. This is presumably because of the strong interrelationships among various types of epistemically suspect beliefs (Lewandowsky, Oberauer, et al., 2013; Lobato et al., 2014; \u0160rol, n.d.).\nOur results complement the existing studies on the lack of control, anxiety-inducing situations, and the belief in conspiracy theories (Grzesiak-Feldman, 2013; Swami et al., 2016; van Prooijen & Acker, 2015; Whitson & Galinsky, 2008). While some of those studies used fictitious situations or arbitrary methods to examine the issue, a strong aspect of our research was that we examined a real-life situation \u2013 the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 and studied conspiracy beliefs that were specifically related to it. Moreover, we ran our study shortly after the first cases in our country were identified. At this time, the feelings of anxiety and lack of control might have been very immediate, while the information about the virus has been available for a longer time so that people could think about the possible causes and origins of the disease and come up with their own conspiracy theories or endorse some that they found online.\nWe have also examined participants\u2019 perception of risk associated with the COVID-19 infection and their trust that the government, WHO, doctors, and scientists are doing their best to stop the spread of the virus. While the cognitive perception of risk of the new coronavirus increased\nCOVID-19. This suggests that it is the emotional (feeling of anxiety about the coronavirus) rather than the cognitive (coronavirus risk perception) aspect which engages the sense-making mechanisms and results in higher adoption of conspiracies after witnessing a threatening event. Cognitive mechanisms presumably come into play later when people engage higher-order functions to construct arguments supporting their newly adopted views (e.g. van Prooijen & van Vugt, 2018). Additionally, we have also found that people who did not trust the formal institutions exhibited a stronger sense of lacking control about their lives and had more coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Trust in institutions was, however, also directly negatively related with the endorsement of generic conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs. This is likely because of the nature of such beliefs, which are often based around the distrust in the actions of the government, scientists, and other authorities, since these were also central themes of the items used to measure generic epistemically suspect beliefs here.\nAs we are writing this, people undergo one of the most threatening global crises in years. The COVID-19 struck many countries so suddenly that they had little time to prepare and the figures of infected people and fatalities rose to immense levels in a matter of days. While specialists from the natural sciences and physicians are doing their best to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, social scientists have an important role in studying emotional and cognitive responses to the COVID-19 pandemics and their implications for people\u2019s psychological functioning. As was shown by Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang, and Rand (n.d.), there is a lot of misinformation being spread about the coronavirus on social media these days. It is not surprising that people who feel like there is nothing they can do welcome any information which helps them to regain their sense of safety and control. While this is understandable, it is necessary to point out what might be the consequences of uncritically accepting any kind of comforting information. As we have shown, people with higher anxiety and lack of control\nCOVID-19, and also subsequently endorsed more epistemically suspect beliefs in general. It seems that the current situation provides perfect grounds for the spreading of various misinformation. It is also important to note that our study was conducted in relatively early stages of the coronavirus spread in Europe. It is likely that the feelings of anxiety and lack of control among us are growing stronger every day, with every new casualty and every new prohibitive preventive measure that people have to take. While the doctors are fighting the virus in hospitals, we must not forget that there are other battles \u2013 such as those related to the spread of misinformation \u2013 which have to be fought as a result of the coronavirus pandemic."}]}, {"paper_id": "m8jy0", "claim2": "The Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about Coronavirus through the increase in anxiety.", "claim3a": "exposure to information about COVID-19 on Day 1 is positively related to anxiety level and feelings toward different nationalities on Day 2.", "claim3b": "a mediation analysis wherein a newly created variable (positive attitude toward Italians) was regressed on intensity of search for information about coronavirus at T1 (independent variable) and anxiety declared at T2, while simultaneously controlling for anxiety declared at T1.", "claim4": "As presented in Figure 5, there was a negative link between T2 anxiety and the positive attitude toward Italians, as well as statistically significant, negative indirect effect.

Introduction The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 causing COVID-19 disease. The virus originated in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019 (Heymann & Shindo, 2020; Lipsitch, Swerdlow, & Finelli, 2020; Liu & Saif, 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has a number of global effects (Baldwin & di Mauro, 2020; McKibbin & Fernando, 2020), however, no-one has yet analyzed the psychological consequences of the disease spread.\nNegative attitudes toward foreign groups, i.e., prejudice, can be predicted by various\nfactors, including history of conflict, current competition over limited resources or lack of knowledge about a certain group (Bilewicz, 2007; Esses, Jackson, Dovidio, & Hodson, 2005; Zagefka et al., 2017). The prejudice relates to an affective component of attitudes, and, along with stereotypes (cognitive components) and discrimination (behavioral component), describe the barriers in inter-group relations (Fiske, 1998). Although prejudice is often shared and maintained for years, it is not necessarily resistant to sudden events or acute environmental changes (Butz & Yogeeswaran, 2011), and we predict that COVID-19 outbreak can be a factor significant enough to influence social attitudes toward outgroups.\nAccording to the behavioral immunology theories (Altizer, Harvell & Friedle, 2003;\nMurray, Shaller, 2012; Thornhill, Fincher, & Aran, 2009), human attitudes and behaviors are likely to be shaped by pathogen stress. Authoritarianism or conformism can be seen as elements of anti-pathogen behavioral immune system just as aversive behaviors and attitudes toward \u201coutgroups\u201d, especially if these individuals are seen as unhealthy (Thornhill et al., 2009). In countries with low parasite stress, general openness to novelty (including foreigners) tends to be higher than in those with high parasite stress (Schaller & Murray, 2008). Moreover, experimentally primed disease salience can boost conformism (Murray & Schaller, 2012; Murray, Trudeau, & Schaller, 2011), but also xenophobia and ethnocentrism (Faulkner, et al., 2004; Navarrete & Fessler, 2006; Prati & Pietrantoni, 2016). In Faulkner and colleagues (2004) study, the manipulation-elicited less favorable attitudes were not specific to any nationality and they involved activation of thinking about disease in general. All these studies clearly suggest a link between evolved disease-avoidance mechanisms and discriminatory attitudes. Current study Except for China, in all countries the source of the COVID-19 disease was foreign. Therefore, we decided to conduct two studies that addressed the psychological consequences of the current epidemiological situation in the context of inter-group relations. More specifically, we assessed whether the threat of SARS-CoV-2 affected prejudice toward different nationalities, as predicted by behavioral immunology. In correlational Study 1, we examined the relationship between media exposure and attitudes toward foreigners, while in longitudinal Study 2 we tested whether search for information about the pandemic predicts the level of prejudice. The present studies were pre-registered (see https://osf.io/3xyuj for the first study, and https://osf.io/9cjqx for the second study). Access to our database is available via the\nfollowing link: https://figshare.com/s/e52afd0bad96e47f0de6. Studies\u2019 protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee at XXX.\n2. Study 1\nIn Study 1, we examined whether media exposure (with most news being currently related to the COVID-19 outbreak) predicts to the level of prejudice toward four nationalities (i.e. Chinese and Italian, representing one culturally close and one culturally distant nation, currently identified as those struggling with a massive outbreak of the virus, and Hungarian and Mongolian, representing one culturally close and one culturally distant nation not affected by the epidemic to such a great extent, as of the date of studies conduction).\n2.1. Materials and methods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "A survey sample consisted of 410 participants [204 Poles, aged between 18 and 66 years old (M = 38.80, SD = 11.91), 53% women and 206 Britons, aged between 18 and 76 years old (M = 39.87, SD = 12.94), 50% women]. Participants were recruited through an external survey company. The respondents in such survey panels are typically a very diverse group, differing in age, education, residence, etc., but in this study we did not control for the representativeness of the employed sample. All participants provided an informed, written consent to take part in the study, and were compensated for the participation."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Subjects were invited to participate in two, seemingly unrelated studies. In the first one, they were presented with questions regarding the frequency of their mass media attendance. Participants estimated how much time, on an average day, they spend on: watching television, using the Internet, listening to radio, browsing, reading or listening to the news. We computed\na single measure of news exposition (average mass media attendance time) and used it in all subsequent analyses.\nIn the second part of the study, we measured participants\u2019 attitudes toward four\nnationalities (i.e. Hungarian, Italian, Mongolian, and Chinese), presented in a random order. We used Bogardus Social Distance scale (Bogardus, 1933; Wark & Galliher, 2007), a measure commonly used to assess prejudice (e.g., Groyecka et al. 2019; Soral, Bilewicz, & Winiewski, 2018), that consists of three questions (i.e., whether participants would mind if a member of a given group was their co-worker, neighbor, and a part of their family). Participants responded to each question on a seven-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = definitely wouldn\u2019t mind, to 7 = definitely would mind). We averaged the scores across the three questions about a given nationality to obtain four single measures of social distance toward the Hungarians, Italians, Mongolians, and the Chinese.\n2.2. Results\nTo examine possible differences in prejudice toward four nationalities, we first conducted a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with participants\u2019 country as a betweensubject factor. We observed statistically significant differences in social distance overall, F(3, 1224) = 11.35, p < .001, h2 = .027, as well as Participants\u2019 Country x Assessed Nationality\ninteraction, F(3, 1224) = 9.8, p < .001, h2 = .022. More specifically, the declared social\ndistance toward Chinese (M = 2.66, SD = 1.88) was found to be higher (p < .001) than the distance toward Hungarians (M = 2.33, SD = 1.75) and Italians (M = 2.51, SD = 1.86, p = .015), but it did not differ significantly from the distance toward Mongolians (M = 2.62, SD = 1.88) (p = .50). The distance toward Italians was significantly higher than toward Hungarians (p < .001). Poles and Britons did not differ in terms of their declared social distance (M = 2.49, SD = 1.64 and M = 2.57, SD = 1.72, respectively, F(1, 408) = 0.28, p = 0.60, h2 = .001).\nOur main analysis examined if the exposure to media and more intense media\nattendance were related to the social distance to four nationalities tested. Given that our dataset had clustered structure (participants assessed the social distance toward four nationalities), we used multilevel regression. More specifically, the social distance toward others was regressed into participants\u2019 media exposure and their country, controlling for participants\u2019 sex and age. Additionally, to control for the potential differences in the distance toward specific nationalities, the model included instrumental variables describing the nations toward which the social distance was measured (Mongolians served as a reference category). To facilitate interpretability, both continuous variables (media exposure and age) were included in the model in a standardized form, while dichotomous variables were introduced in a centered form. Therefore, in the case of media exposure and age, the coefficients reported\nmight be interpreted as standardized regression coefficients (b coefficients), while for the\nremaining variables, the coefficients might be interpreted as Cohen\u2019s d, i.e., a standardized difference between two groups (Table 1).\ndistance to foreigners (see Figure 1, left panel). Women were found to be less distanced than men. We did not observe a statistically significant effect of the nation toward which the\ndistance was measured, nor exploratorily tested and omitted here interaction Participants Country (PL, UK) x Nation (see the right panel of Figure 1).\n2. Study 2\nIn Study 2, we tested whether exposure to information about COVID-19 on Day 1 is positively related to anxiety level and feelings toward different nationalities on Day 2.\n2.1. Materials and methods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The sample consisted of 242 university students (88% women) recruited from two large Polish cities (i.e. Warsaw and Wroc\u0142aw) on Day 1 (T1), among whom 146 (85% women) completed the study on Day 2 (T2). All participants provided an informed, written consent to take part in the study, and were not compensated for their participation."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Participants were invited to participate in a diary study. On Day 1 (T1), the participants were asked a number of questions regarding their activity during the university closure, among these there were two questions about their exposition to information about Coronavirus: how\nintensively they searched for information about Coronavirus, and how much time they spent talking about Coronavirus (the participants\u2019 used a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = I did not do it at all, to 7 = I did it very intensively). We averaged scores across the two questions to obtain a single measure of the exposition to information about Coronavirus (Day\n1 a = .72, Day 2 a = .82). Moreover, we measured participants\u2019 anxiety level (i.e., how often\nthey felt afraid, nervous, and concerned on that day), using a seven-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = not at all, to 7 = very often). Again, we averaged scores across the three questions to\nobtain a single measure of participants\u2019 anxiety level (Day 1 a = .79, Day 2 a = .76). The\nsame questions were repeated on Day 2 (T2), during which, participants additionally reported their feelings toward nine nationalities (i.e., Hungarians, Mongols, Italians, Germans, Chinese, Jews, Russians, Poles, and Americans). Feelings were reported using slider questions ranging from 0 \u2013 \u2018cold, negative\u2019, to 100 \u2013 \u2018warm, positive\u2019 (the so called \"feeling thermometer\", a measure used to capture the affective component of intergroup relations, see e.g., Brener, Hippel, Kippax, 2007; Piston, 2010; Witkowska, Beneda, \u010cehaji\u0107-Clancy, & Bilewicz, 2019).\n2.3. Results\nDescriptive statistics, correlations between Study 2 variables and short discussion of these results are presented in supplementary materials (Supplementary File 1).\nAnxiety and information about Coronavirus\nThe exposure toward Coronavirus-related news and declared anxiety were correlated both at T1 and T2 (see Supplementary File 1). We conducted a cross-lagged regression, to untangle whether this was (A) an exposition toward information about Coronavirus (T1) that translated\ninto higher anxiety at T2, or (B) anxiety at T1 that made people searching for Coronavirusrelated information more intensively at T2. Prior to our main analysis, we examined if the missing data between Day 1 and Day 2 were missing at random using Little\u2019s (1988) Missing Completely at Random Test (MCAR). As this test was not statistically significant (MCAR c2\n= 41.77, df = 2, p = .41), we conducted the path analysis in R (package \u201clavaan\u201d, see Rosseel, 2012) using full information maximum likelihood estimator1. Consistently with our\npredictions, it was rather the exposure toward Coronavirus that built the anxiety (b = .20) than\nvice versa (b = -.02) (see Figure 2).\nAttitudes toward foreigners \u2013 mediation analysis\nOur initial correlation analyses (Supplementary File 1) showed substantial correlations between attitudes toward different nations. As the overall attitudes toward others (with the\nattitudes toward Poles excluded) were highly consistent (a = .89), we created a global\n\u201cpositive attitude toward other nationalities\u201d index by averaging the assessments of separate nations. Our next step involved a mediation analysis wherein a newly created variable was"}, {"heading": "1 That the same analysis using a robust maximum likelihood estimator with listwise-deleted missing data", "text": "provided the same results.\nregressed on intensity of search for information about coronavirus at T1 (independent variable) and anxiety declared at T2, while simultaneously controlling for anxiety declared at T1. As illustrated in Figure 3, search for information about Coronavirus at T1 predicted anxiety at T2 (even when controlling for anxiety declared at T1). However, there was no relationship between anxiety at T2 and the overall attitude toward other nationalities. Neither direct (information about Coronavirus \u2013 attitudes toward other nations) nor indirect effect (information about Coronavirus \u2013 anxiety \u2013 attitudes toward other nations) was statistically significant, but the total effect was negative and marginally significant (B = -0.14, p = .05).\nAs the b path in the presented model was not significant, thus making the hypothesized mediation implausible, we decided to exploratorily examine some relationships that were not originally preregistered, i.e., explore the possible mediation effects for each single nation included in our study. To this end, we first analyzed correlations between T2 anxiety and attitudes toward other nations in more detail. As illustrated in Figure 4, the overall tendency observed was similar across nations, yet visibly stronger for the attitudes toward Italians, the nation currently struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak.\nGiven the seemingly strongest effect observed for the attitudes toward Italians, we\nrepeated our mediation analysis, this time regressing attitudes toward Italians on Anxiety (T1 \u2013 control and T2 \u2013 mediator) and the intensity of search for information about Coronavirus at T1. As presented in Figure 5, there was a negative link between T2 anxiety and the positive attitude toward Italians, as well as statistically significant, negative indirect effect. In other words, people who were exposed to or searched for more information about Coronavirus at T1, were found to be more anxious and distancing themselves from Italians at T2.\nFigure 5. Mediation effect with information about Coronavirus explaining negative attitudes toward Italians via anxiety.\n4. General discussion Behavioral immune system theories (Schaller & Duncan, 2007; Schaller & Murray, 2008), suggest that pathogen-related threat can translate into willingness to distance oneself from others also on a psychological level (Faulkner et al., 2004; Inbar et al., 2016; Navarrete & Fessler, 2006). Building on this notion, we predicted that the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus can differentiate attitudes toward foreign nationalities. The correlational study in the UK and in Poland revealed that prejudice against foreign groups was positively related to media exposure and thus to exposure to information about the Coronavirus, regardless of the extent of COVID-19 outbreak in the assessed countries. These results were followed up with a short-term longitudinal study which showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about Coronavirus through the increase in anxiety. The fact that Coronavirus information exposure was not related to feelings about foreign groups other than Italians suggests that this effect may be of short duration and peak when the outreach of the pandemic in the given country is high and salient in media.\nIn summary, COVID-19 virus outbreak and constant processing of information about\nit can certainly be perceived as highly arousing and eliciting anxiety (Al-Rabiaah et al., 2020), and thus, influencing the level of any potential prejudice. Observed effect should be further controlled in longitudinal studies. This seems especially important, as while physical distancing from others (e.g. Sorokowska et al., 2017) is highly recommended during epidemic and can slow down the speed of the virus expansion significantly (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020), the less favorable attitudes about foreign groups that social distance usually go along\nwith (Soral et al., 2018), can be dangerous and in a long term can increase discrimination and injustice.\nReferences:\nAl-Rabiaah, A., Temsah, M.

We share it here to inform other scientists conducting research on this topic, but the reported findings should not be used as a basis for policy or practice.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives, changing our behaviors to prevent the spread of the disease is a moral imperative. Here, we investigated the persuasiveness of messages inspired by three major moral traditions. A sample of US participants representative for age, sex and race/ethnicity (N=1032) viewed messages from either a leader or citizen containing deontological, virtue-based, utilitarian, or non-moral justifications for adopting social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the messages\u2019 effects on participants\u2019 self-reported intentions to wash hands, avoid social gatherings, self-isolate, and share health messages, as well as their beliefs about others\u2019 intentions, impressions of the messenger\u2019s morality and trustworthiness, and beliefs about personal control and responsibility for preventing the spread of disease. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, compared to non-moral control messages, deontological arguments had a modest effect on intentions to share the message. Message source (leader vs. citizen) did not moderate any of the observed effects of message type. A majority of participants predicted the utilitarian message would be most effective, but we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions or beliefs. We caution that our findings require confirmation in replication studies and are modest in size, likely due to ceiling effects on our measures of behavioral intentions and strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. Although we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions and beliefs, exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in one key dimension of utilitarianism\u2014impartial concern for the greater good\u2014were strongly and positively associated with public health intentions and beliefs. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens is a promising approach for future studies of interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the US. Ongoing work is investigating the reproducibility and generalizability of our findings across different populations, what aspects of deontological messages may drive their persuasive effects, and how such messages can be most effectively delivered across global populations."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic threatens millions of lives. Compared to the seasonal flu, current estimates suggest that the novel coronavirus is nearly twice as contagious, and it takes much 1 longer for symptoms to present. Thus, someone who feels otherwise healthy may be 2 unknowingly transmitting the disease to others well before they even know they are sick. COVID-19 presents a growing public health crisis, and current worst-case estimates, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others, suggest that anywhere between 60% and 80% of people might eventually contract COVID-19, potentially killing tens of millions (Fink, 2020, The New York Times; Ferguson et al., 2020). Accordingly, any measures to prevent the transmission of the disease and avoid these worst-case scenarios are of great importance, and public health experts believe that \u201cindividual behaviour will be crucial to control the spread of COVID-19\u201d (Anderson et al. 2020). These behaviors include washing hands more frequently and for longer, avoiding public gatherings, cancelling travel plans, and keeping distance from others. If measures like these are adopted, experts suggest that the deaths caused by coronavirus would drop dramatically (Ferguson et al. 2020). Many people, from politicians to celebrities to health officials to local businesses, are urging members of the public to adopt these behaviors immediately as a moral imperative, and there are several distinct moral principles that may be persuasive. One might, for example, appeal to utilitarian moral theories (see e.g. Mill, 1863; Singer, 1972), focused on the expected consequences of failing to slow the spread of the pandemic. One might appeal to deontological moral theories (see e.g. Kant, 1785/1959; Scanlon, 2003), focused on notions of the duties, obligations, and responsibilities we have to our families and communities. Or one might appeal to moral theories based on notions of virtue and moral exemplars (see e.g. Aristotle, 350BC/2019; Hursthouse, 1999), considering what an ideal person would do during this crisis. To our knowledge, there is almost no work that directly investigates how these different moral justifications might influence intentions to act, and certainly not in the context of the current pandemic. Past work in our lab and others suggests that deontological appeals will be more effective than utilitarian appeals, as deontological agents are seen as more trustworthy than utilitarian agents (Bostyn & Roets, 2017, Everett, Pizarro & Crockett 2016; Rom, Weiss & Conway 2017; Everett et al. 2018; Rom & Conway 2018) and people are more likely to be influenced by and accept advice from people they trust (Koenig, Cl\u00e9ment, & Harris, 2004; Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2011). Other work on moral exemplars suggests that appeals based on virtue may also be effective in promoting individual prosocial behaviors (Han\n1 One study found that the median reproductive index (R0) of the seasonal flu was 1.28 (Biggerstaff et al., 2014, BMC Infectious Diseases), while estimates from China suggest that R0 for coronavirus is 2.2 (Li et al., 2020, The New England Journal of Medicine). Put another way, the average person with the flu will infect about one other person, while the average person with coronavirus will infect about two. 2 According to the CDC (2018), the incubation period for the seasonal flu is about 2 days, while current estimates suggest that the incubation period for COVID-19 is up to two weeks (median is 5 days; Li et al., 2020, The New England Journal of Medicine).\net al. 2017), since upward moral comparison increases behavioral intentions to act prosocially (Zhang et al., 2017). A second question concerns whether the effectiveness of moral messaging depends on the source of the message. Right now, people are getting information about coronavirus from their family, friends, strangers on social media, and people in leadership positions. Previous work suggests that the effectiveness of different moral justifications may depend on who communicates them. For example, people who follow utilitarian principles, spending their free time or extra money on needy strangers rather than their immediate family, are judged to be worse spouses but not worse political leaders (Everett et al. 2018). Even if, as we predict, deontological or virtue-based messages will be more effective than utilitarian messages, it might be that this effect is attenuated or even reversed when it comes from a person in authority, who is supposed to act more impartially and make cost/benefit decisions for the greater good. Of course, not all people are reacting to this pandemic in the same way. In the US, there is evidence that demographic factors such as age and political identification are related to feelings and behaviors about COVID-19, with younger people and more conservative people feeling less concerned and reporting fewer changes to their behavior (YouGov, 2020). We therefore sought to investigate how demographic factors predict perceptions of pandemic threat and public health behaviors, and whether moral messaging effects are robust to controlling for these factors. Finally, we examined how individual differences in utilitarianism relate to pandemic-related beliefs and intentions. Though much work in moral psychology explores utilitarianism in the context of sacrificial moral dilemmas, where someone must commit harm in service of the greater good (see e.g. Kahane et al., 2018; Everett & Kahane, 2020), utilitarian theories in ethics are most often concerned with an impartial concern for the wellbeing of all (see e.g. Singer, 2011). Thus, recent work has explored individual differences in these two components of utilitarianism separately\u2014what Kahane, Everett and colleagues (2018) call Instrumental Harm (IH) and Impartial Beneficence (IB), respectively. Given the global nature of this pandemic, and the fact that public health behaviors can help not just one\u2019s own family and friends but also distant strangers, we anticipated that participants higher in IB, but not IH, would show greater intentions to adopt public health behaviors. Because past work has shown that mistrust in utilitarian (relative to deontological) agents is lower for people with utilitarian tendencies themselves, we expected that the effects of message type would be weaker for people with stronger utilitarian tendencies. To test these hypotheses, we recruited a sample of US participants representative for the US population on age, sex and race/ethnicity (final N = 1032). Data were collected between 3/15/2020 and 3/16/2020. In a 2 x 4 between-subjects design, we randomly assigned participants to read a Facebook message from either a leader or citizen urging people to stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, providing either no moral justification (non-moral control condition) or a moral justification (deontological, virtue-based, or utilitarian; see Table 1). Following this, they answered questions about their own intentions to adopt public health\nbehaviors (washing hands, avoiding social gatherings, self-isolating, and sharing public health messages). Because we expected potential ceiling effects for behavioral intentions due to the strong social desirability of these behaviors, we also measured participants\u2019 second-order beliefs about the behavioral intentions of others, which we expected would be less sensitive to social desirability effects. Additionally, we measured perceptions of the morality and trustworthiness of the messenger and attitudes toward the pandemic, followed by measures of utilitarianism (Kahane, Everett et al. 2018) and demographics. Finally, we measured participants\u2019 own intuitions about whether deontological, virtue-based or utilitarian messages would be more effective in persuading others to take action. We pre-registered our hypotheses and methods (https://osf.io/wy93v) and posted all our materials and data (https://osf.io/5vj8y/) on OSF.\nResults: Moral message effects First, as specified in our pre-registration, we conducted ANOVAs to analyze the effects of moral message type (deontological vs. virtue-based vs. utilitarian vs. control), source (citizen vs. leader), and their interaction on behavioral intentions, second order beliefs, perceptions of the messenger, and pandemic attitudes. Message source did not significantly affect most of our dependent measures. One important exception was intentions to share the message: participants reported stronger intentions to\nshare messages from leaders than citizens (F(1,1023) = 5.21, p = .02). Source did not interact with message type for any of our dependent measures, contrary to our predictions. In what follows, we focus on the effects of message type. Across several of our dependent measures, we find some modest effects of deontological and virtue-based messaging, in line with our predictions (Fig. 1 & 2). We also observed strong relationships between demographic factors and most of our dependent measures. Because of this we supplemented our pre-registered analyses with exploratory ANCOVAs testing the effects of message type, source, and their interaction while controlling for age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, education, income, employment status, political ideology, and religiosity. These are reported after our pre-registered analyses. In our pre-registration, we did not plan to apply Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. However, a review of our initial preprint by Anvari (2020) suggested we should have corrected all of our tests of behavioral intentions and second-order beliefs for the total number of tests across these two categories of measures (i.e., corrected alpha of 0.006) . Most of our results do not survive Bonferroni corrections at this level of stringency and therefore should be treated with caution. For further details, see Supplementary Note on multiple comparisons correction.\nBehavioral intentions. As expected, many of our self-reported behavioral intentions measures suffered from ceiling effects. Nevertheless, we found a main effect of message type on intentions to share the message (F(3, 1023) = 3.95, p = .01). Planned comparisons showed that participants reported significantly stronger intentions to share the deontological message (M=3.34) relative to the non-moral message (M=2.82, t(1023)=3.10, p = .01) and the virtue-based message (M=2.86, t(1023)=2.83, p = .02). All other pairwise comparisons were non-significant.\nNext, we conducted exploratory ANCOVAs controlling for demographic factors. These additionally revealed a marginal effect of message type on intentions to wash hands (F(3, 1007) = 2.29, p = .077). Pairwise comparisons revealed a marginal difference such that deontological messages were more effective than virtue-based messages (t(1005)=2.30, p = .1). For intentions to share the message, there remained a significant effect of message type (F(3, 1006) = 4.02, p = .007), and pairwise comparisons again revealed significant differences between deontological messages and both the virtue-based (t(1006)=2.82, p = .03) and non-moral (t(1006)=3.16, p = .01) messages. Second order beliefs. We observed a marginally significant main effect of message type on second-order beliefs about hand-washing (F(3,1024) = 2.36, p= .07). Planned comparisons revealed that participants reported significantly stronger second-order beliefs about handwashing after reading the deontological message (M=4.95) relative to the virtue-based message (M=4.62, t(1024)=2.65, p = .04). We also observed a marginal main effect of message type on second-order beliefs about avoiding social gatherings (F(3,1024) = 2.24, p= .08). Planned comparisons showed that the deontological message (M = 4.68) led to marginally stronger second-order beliefs about avoiding social gatherings, relative to the non-moral message (M = 4.40, t(1024)=2.36, p = .09) In the exploratory ANCOVAs controlling for demographic factors, we also found a significant effect of message type on second-order beliefs about washing hands (F(3, 1007) = 2.94, p = .03), and pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference such that deontological messages were more effective than virtue-based messages (t(1007)=2.96, p = .02). For second-order beliefs about avoiding social gatherings, we again found a marginally significant effect of message type (F(3, 1007) = 2.25, p = .08), and pairwise comparisons again revealed a marginal difference between deontological messages and non-moral messages(t(1007)=2.37, p = .08). Perceptions of messenger. We observed a trend-level effect of message type on perceptions of messenger morality (F(3,1024) = 2.40, p=0.07). Planned comparisons showed that people who shared deontological messages were seen as significantly more moral (M = 5.47) than non-moral messengers (M = 5.20; t(1024)=2.60, p = .05). In the supplemental analyses at the end of this document, we report exploratory mediation analyses testing whether deontological messages impact behavioral intentions and second-order beliefs via increasing perceived morality of the messenger. Exploratory ANCOVAs controlling for demographic factors revealed no effects of message type on perceived morality or trustworthiness of the messenger, though in this analysis a significant effect of message source emerged for trustworthiness, such that participants reported higher trust in leaders compared to citizens (F(3,1007) = 4.18, p = 0.04). Pandemic attitudes. We observed a trend-level effect of message type on feelings of personal responsibility for protecting others from contracting the disease (F(3,1024) = 2.20, p=0.09).\nPlanned comparisons showed that virtue-based messages lead to a marginally greater sense of responsibility (M = 5.63) compared to non-moral messages (M = 5.29; t(1024)=2.42, p = .07). In the exploratory ANCOVAs controlling for demographic factors, the effect of message type on feelings of personal responsibility was significant (F(3,1007) = 2.70, p=0.045), and planned comparisons revealed that virtue-based messages were significantly more effective than non-moral messages (t(1007)=2.57, p = .05).\nFigure shows effects of message conditions relative to non-moral control as the percent change in impressions of morality (left panel) and trustworthiness (right panel) of the messenger. Error bars represent 95% CIs. Results: Lay beliefs about message effectiveness To explore whether our findings reflect \u201ccommon sense,\u201d we explored our participants\u2019 intuitions about whether deontological, virtue-based or utilitarian messages would be most effective. Participants were presented with these three different moral messages as described in Table 1, and we asked them which would be most effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19. 53% of participants reported that they thought the utilitarian message would be most effective, 34% thought the deontological message would be most effective, and 13% thought the virtue-based message would be most effective (one participant did not respond). We performed a chi-square test of independence and found that this difference was significant, X2 (2, N = 1031) = 247.52, p < .001, and post-hoc tests revealed that all pairwise comparisons were significant at p < .001. Thus, lay intuitions were at odds our findings on message effectiveness, since we found no evidence that utilitarian messages were more effective than any other condition. Results: Demographic effects\nIn the tables below, we summarize main effects of demographic variables on our dependent measures from the exploratory ANCOVAs. Overall, older people and more religious people reported stronger intentions to practice public health behaviors and stronger beliefs about what others would do. People who self-identified as White, male and conservative reported weaker intentions to practice public health behaviors and weaker beliefs that others would do so. Education level was also negatively related to second-order beliefs. Older people reported feeling more personally responsible for preventing the spread, and also felt people generally had more control over doing so. People who identified as Black and Asian also believed people had more control over social distancing. Meanwhile, people who identified as White and male reported feeling less personally responsible for preventing the spread. Political conservatives believed people had more control over practicing social distancing, while at the same felt less personally responsible for preventing the spread, and also held others less personally responsible.\n\u201c+\u201d = positive relationship with variable, \u201c-\u201d = negative relationship with variable \u201c+++/---\u201d = p<0.01; \u201c++/--\u201d = p<0.05; \u201c+/-\u201d = p<0.1\nSelf-identified gender\nSelf-identified race\n-- (White) -- (White) --- (White) --- (White)\nEducation -\nIncome\nEmployed status ++ + ++\nPolitical conservatism\n-- ---\nReligiosity + ++ ++ +\n\u201c+\u201d = positive relationship with variable, \u201c-\u201d = negative relationship with variable \u201c+++/---\u201d = p<0.01; \u201c++/--\u201d = p<0.05; \u201c+/-\u201d = p<0.1\n\u201c+\u201d = positive relationship with variable, \u201c-\u201d = negative relationship with variable \u201c+++/---\u201d = p<0.01; \u201c++/--\u201d = p<0.05; \u201c+/-\u201d = p<0.1\nSelf-identified gender --- (Male) - (Male)\nSelf-identified race +++ (Black) + (Asian)\n-- (White)\nEducation\nIncome\nEmployed status\nPolitical conservatism +++ --- ---\nReligiosity +\n\u201c+\u201d = positive relationship with variable, \u201c-\u201d = negative relationship with variable \u201c+++/---\u201d = p<0.01; \u201c++/--\u201d = p<0.05; \u201c+/-\u201d = p<0.1"}, {"heading": "Results: Utilitarianism", "text": "Finally, in exploratory analyses, we investigated the relationships between our dependent measures and utilitarianism scores, assessed using the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (Kahane, Everett et al. 2018). The OUS dissociates two independent dimensions of utilitarian tendencies: impartial beneficence (IB; impartial concern for the greater good) and instrumental harm (IH; permissive attitude toward causing harm for the greater good). Across most of our dependent measures, we find consistent positive effects of IB, but not IH. We therefore focus here on the effects of IB. Below, we report the results from exploratory multiple regressions that include IB as a predictor along with demographic variables of age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, education, income, employment status, political ideology, and religiosity. We also ran analyses that allowed IB to interact with all three moral message types. Although IB strongly predicted most of our dependent measures, there were only a few interactions between IB and message type, none of which were predicted in our pre-registration. Details of interactive effects can be found in the supplemental analyses at the end of this document. Behavioral Intentions. Impartial beneficence had a positive effect on all of the self-reported behavioral intentions measures. Higher scores on impartial beneficence were associated with stronger intentions to wash hands more frequently (\u03b2 = .15, t(1007) = 4.10, p < .01), stronger intentions to avoid social gatherings (\u03b2 = .26, t(1007) = 5.85, p < .01), stronger intentions to completely self-isolate (\u03b2 = .39, t(1007) = 7.17, p < .01), and stronger intentions to share the message (\u03b2 = .54, t(1007) = 9.84, p < .01). Second-order beliefs. Higher scores on impartial beneficence were associated with stronger beliefs that others would wash hands more frequently (\u03b2 = .14, t(1007) = 3.67, p < .01), avoid social gatherings (\u03b2 = .21, t(1007) = 5.32, p < .01), completely self-isolate (\u03b2 = .31, t(1007) =\n7.06, p < .01), and be willing to cancel a vacation they\u2019d already paid for (\u03b2 = .13, t(1007) = 2.71, p < .01). Perceptions of messenger. Higher scores on impartial beneficence were associated with stronger perceptions of the messenger as more trustworthy (\u03b2 = .26, t(1007) = 7.28, p < .01), and more moral (\u03b2 = .24, t(1007) = 7.40, p < .01). Pandemic attitudes. Higher scores on impartial beneficence were associated with stronger beliefs that people have control over practicing social distancing (\u03b2 = .18, t(1007) = 4.58, p < .01), stronger feelings of personal responsibility for preventing the spread of the disease (\u03b2 = .35, t(1007) = 8.53, p < .01), and stronger tendencies to view others as responsible for preventing the spread (\u03b2 = .33, t(1007) = 7.02, p < .01)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The best advice from public health experts emphasizes that, in order to slow the coronavirus pandemic, healthy people must take basic steps to change their behavior, and doing so has the potential to collectively save thousands if not millions of lives. This urgent moral message can fit into a number of ethical frameworks, and this study tested which might be most effective in a nationally representative U.S. sample. We predicted that messages presented in a deontological framework, referencing the duties and obligations we have to one another, would increase behavioral intentions to wash hands, avoid gatherings, socially isolate, and share public health messages. We anticipated ceiling effects for these behavioral intentions, which are socially desirable (especially so now), and this seems to have been the case. Nevertheless, compared to a non-moral control condition, we found a significant effect of deontological messages on intentions to share a public health message, in line with our pre-registered predictions. Exploratory analyses controlling for demographic variables revealed further trend-level effects in the predicted direction where deontological messages marginally increased intentions to wash hands relative to control. However, this result did not survive multiple comparisons correction and thus should be treated with caution. To reduce social desirability, and thus the likelihood of ceiling effects, we also measured second-order beliefs about how likely other people reading a given message would be to change their behavior. Here, exploratory analyses controlling for demographic variables showed that participants reading deontological messages showed trends toward increasing second-order beliefs about hand washing and avoiding social gatherings relative to non-moral messages (though again, these did not survive more stringent corrections for multiple comparisons). With respect to person perception, in line with our predictions, participants thought that people who posted deontological messages were more moral than those who posted non-moral\nmessages (though again, this finding did not survive more stringent corrections for multiple comparisons). Based on past work, we also expected that virtue-based messages appealing to moral exemplars would be effective. For the most part, this was not the case, with the exception of feelings of personal responsibility. Here, exploratory analyses revealed that virtue-based messages were significantly more effective than non-moral messages, though this result did not survive multiple comparisons corrections. While theoretically based in previous work (e.g. Everett et al. 2016, 2018), our findings seem to be counterintuitive - at least to the participants in our study. When participants read the different moral framings of public health messages, the majority predicted that the utilitarian message would be most effective in convincing others to change their behavior. This was not the case, and it highlights the importance of empirically testing the effectiveness of different moral framings, especially since the stakes are now so high. In line with past work, we expected that the source of the message, whether it came from a leader or a citizen, would interact with message type. We found no support for this prediction, and few effects of message source in general, though participants reported being more likely to share messages from leaders rather than citizens. It may be the case that our manipulation of leadership in this study (Department of Education director) was not perceived to have authority or expertise relevant to the pandemic crisis. Other types of leaders, such as public health officials, or high-power political figures may be more persuasive, and we will test this in future studies. We observed strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. In general, older people and more religious people reported stronger behavioral intentions and second-order beliefs about public health behaviors, while people who self-identified as White, male and conservative reported weaker behavioral intentions and second-order beliefs. Older people felt more personally responsible for preventing the spread of disease, while people who identified as White and male reported feeling less responsible. Political conservatives believed people had more control over preventing the spread while at the same time attributing lower responsibility to both themselves and others. In line with past empirical and theoretical work, the Impartial Beneficence component of Utilitarianism, but not Instrumental Harm (c.f. Kahane, Everett, et al. 2018), predicted behavioral intentions, beliefs about others\u2019 intentions, trust in the messenger, and perceptions of pandemic threat. These results are, of course, limited in a number of important ways. We only tested one of many potential messages for each ethical framework. Kahane and Everett (2020) argue that we should adopt a multidimensional approach to utilitarianism, and it is plausible that messages related to different psychological instantiations of the utilitarian ideal may have different effects, just as different flavours of deontological justifications differentially influence person perception\n(Everett et al., 2016). Second, despite keeping the messages as structurally similar as possible, it remains possible that the messages unintentionally differed in ways other than their moral content. If this is the case, it is plausible that something apart from the deontological framing of a message leads to increased effectiveness. That said, these concerns are allayed somewhat because that our participants actually expected the utilitarian message to be most effective at influencing others, suggesting that, on the face of it, participants did not perceive the deontological message as more persuasive. Nevertheless, future work can use multiple variants of messages from these different moral traditions and treat these as random effects in our analyses, to improve generalizability (Yarkoni, 2019). On a related note, in conducting an online survey, we are inherently limited in exploring behavioral intentions and second-order beliefs, rather than actual behaviors to promote public health. These results are an important first step in exploring what types of messaging could be most effective at encouraging protective public health behaviors, but future work remains to determine whether these beliefs and intentions translate into actual changes in behavior. There are reasons to be optimistic, however, since meta-analytic research suggests that persuasion manipulations have similar effects on measures of attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behavioral outcomes (O\u2019Keefe, 2013, 2018). Finally, we note that past empirical work demonstrates that people who express deontological moral judgments are trusted more than those who express utilitarian judgments, not just in terms of self-reported impressions (Rom, Weiss & Conway 2017; Rom & Conway 2018) but also in terms of actual trust behavior (Bostyn & Roets, 2017, Everett, Pizarro & Crockett 2016; Everett et al. 2018). This prior work, alongside research showing that persuasion depends on trust (Koenig, Cl\u00e9ment, & Harris, 2004; Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2011), already suggested that deontological arguments may be conducive to persuasion, and the present findings are not inconsistent with this hypothesis. Perhaps most importantly, our effects appear to be small and in many cases do not pass conventional levels of statistical significance, which means estimated effect sizes are unreliable and need to be confirmed with future studies. If our preliminary findings do reflect a real effect in line with previous research, however, in the context of a public health crisis, even changing the behavior of a small percentage of individuals can save lives, and small changes in framing of messages are a cheaply-implemented tool that could be readily implemented on communications platforms. We intend to replicate these findings in a larger sample as soon as possible. Future research also needs to test whether different types of messages are more effective for different segments of the population; whether our main results replicate across different countries; and how to most effectively deliver such messages, both in terms of the context of the message (e.g., embedded within a personal narrative, news story or generic public service announcement) and its source (e.g., whether it comes from someone familiar, a stranger, or someone with authoritative scientific or moral expertise). For the time being, however, as we search for evidence-based recommendations about how to persuade others to change their behavior to prevent the spread of COVID-19, our preliminary conclusion is that messages focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens are a promising approach worthy of further study."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Participants. We aimed to recruit a sample of 1100 participants from Prolific Academic, representative of the US population on age, sex and race.

We expected our manipulation to produce small effect sizes on our dependent measures. Nevertheless, these small effects are incredibly important to know in this pandemic context. With the exponential growth of COVID-19, even a small fraction of the population changing their behavior to prevent the spread can save lives, just as political targeting affecting less than 1% of the sample can have drastic effects on voting and, ultimately, electoral outcomes (Bond et al. 2012, Nature).

He argues that because both of these dependent measures would \u201cbe used to draw inferences about the effectiveness of moral messaging\u201d, they are therefore are \u201cnot representing a separate set of hypotheses\u201d. As such, he argues that \u201cthe 4 items measuring behavioural intentions and the 4 items measuring second-order beliefs can be considered to be of the same family of tests examining which moral framings are most effective for influencing people\u2019s behaviours. This results in a total of 8 dependent variables corresponding to 8 (ANOVA) tests. Applying the Holm-Bonferroni approach to correct for multiple comparisons means that the lowest p-value from the results of these 8 tests should be tested against an alpha of (.05/8) .00625, the second lowest p-value against (.05/7) .0071, the third lowest p-value against (.05/6) .0083, and so on. Based on these corrected alpha levels, even the main effect of message type on the behavioural intention item of sharing the message on social media (p = .0082) becomes statistically nonsignificant.\u201d We respectfully disagree that the behavioral intentions measures and second-order beliefs measures should be treated as part of the same family of tests. As can be seen in our pre-registration and open materials, these sets of measures are clearly treated as separate categories of measures and were collected in separate sections of the experiment. While we pre-registered hypotheses about how moral messaging would affect each of these sets of measures, this does not mean they are the same: indeed all of our outcome measures are relevant to assessing the effectiveness of moral messaging, or we would have not included them. We therefore think it is more appropriate to correct for 4 tests, rather than 8, resulting in a corrected alpha of p = 0.0125, which the sharing intentions measure survives. Ultimately however, in the absence of clear standards for how Bonferroni corrections should be applied in a case like this, the robustness of our findings are better addressed by pre-registered replication studies rather than debates about the appropriate level of stringency for multiple comparisons correction. Mediation of messaging effects by impressions of messenger We conducted a series of exploratory mediation analyses to investigate whether the significant effects of message type on our dependent measures were mediated by impressions of the messenger, in the form of increased trust and morality. In other words, mIght different types of moral justifications influence behavior and beliefs by specifically altering perceptions of the messenger\u2019s character? Because impressions of trustworthiness were not affected by message type, we focus here on impressions of morality, which as predicted were affected by the different types of justifications (see Results in Main Text). Across all the significant effects message type had on intentions, beliefs, and attitudes, we found that increased perceptions of\nmessenger morality significantly mediated the effects of deontological and virtue-based messaging when the relevant contrasts involved non-moral messaging, but not when the relevant contrasts involved other types of moral messaging. We describe these results below. All confidence intervals were calculated via bootstrapping with 5,000 samples. Behavioral intentions. Impressions of the messenger\u2019s morality mediated the effects of the deontological message on intentions to share the post relative to the non-moral message (indirect effect = .16, 95% CI = [.04; .30], p = .01), but not these same effects of deontological message relative to the virtue-based message (indirect effect = .04, 95% CI = [-.08; .17], p = .51). Second order beliefs. Impressions of the messenger\u2019s morality did not mediate the effects of the deontological message compared to the virtue-based message on second-order beliefs about hand-washing (indirect effect = .02, 95% CI = [-.05; .09], p = .53). However, they did mediate the effects of the deontological message compared to the non-moral message on second-order beliefs about avoiding social gatherings (indirect effect = .09, 95% CI = [.02; .16], p = .01). Pandemic attitudes. Impressions of the messenger\u2019s morality marginally mediated the effects of the deontological message on responsibility for protecting others from contracting the disease relative to the virtue-based message (indirect effect = .09, 95% CI = [.00; .18], p = .05). Moderation of message effectiveness by impartial beneficence. To explore whether impartial beneficence moderates the effects of our manipulation, we conducted a series of ANCOVAs that include IB as a predictor along with demographic variables of age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, education, income, employment status, political ideology, and religiosity and allowed IB to interact with message type. The strong effect of IB on our dependent measures is reported in the main text; we report here the interactions. Impartial beneficence did not interact with moral message type on behavioral intentions or perceptions of the messenger, but it had a trending influence on some aspects of pandemic perception and second-order beliefs (full results are available at the OSF: https://osf.io/5vj8y/). First, the positive effects of deontological messaging and the negative effects of virtue-based messaging were stronger for individuals who scored higher on impartial beneficence. In particular, the positive effect of deontological messages on frequency of seeking information about the pandemic was weaker in people lower in impartial beneficence (\u03b2 = .25, t(1007) = 2.02, p = .04), while the negative effect of virtue-based messages on beliefs that others would avoid gatherings was stronger in people higher in impartial beneficence (\u03b2 = -.20, t(1007) = -1.93, p = .05), and so was the negative effect of virtue-based messages on beliefs that others would self-isolate (\u03b2 = -.30, t(1007) = -2.47, p = .01)."}]}, {"paper_id": "4qm4q", "claim2": "We found that engagement in social distancing and handwashing was most strongly predicted by the perceived likelihood of personally being infected, rather than likelihood of transmission or severity of potential transmitted infections.", "claim3a": "it is apparent that perceived risk is likely to affect individuals\u2019 behavior during a pandemic", "claim3b": "We used multiple linear regression to assess the extent to which of our 10 items assessing risk perception (shown in Figure  6) were associated with engagement in two primary protective behaviors, hand washing and social distancing (assessed through asking subjects whether they were staying home more than normal), controlling for age.", "claim4": "The  clearest  effect  common  to  both  behaviors  was  a  significant  effect  of  perceived  likelihood  of personally  becoming  infected  (hand  washing  \u03b2  =  0.17,  p  <  .001", "content": [{"text": "By mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread to over 100 countries and all 50 states in the US. Government efforts to minimize the spread of disease emphasized behavioral interventions, including raising awareness of the disease and encouraging protective behaviors such as social distancing and hand washing, and seeking medical attention if experiencing symptoms. However, it is unclear to what extent individuals are aware of the risks associated with the disease, how they are altering their behavior, factors which could influence the spread of the virus to vulnerable populations. We characterized risk perception and engagement in preventative measures in 1591 United States based individuals over the first week of the pandemic (March 11th-16th 2020) and examined the extent to which protective behaviors are predicted by individuals\u2019 perception of risk. Over 5 days, subjects demonstrated growing awareness of the risk posed by the virus, and largely reported engaging in protective behaviors with increasing frequency. However, they underestimated their personal risk of infection relative to the average person in the country. We found that engagement in social distancing and handwashing was most strongly predicted by the perceived likelihood of personally being infected, rather than likelihood of transmission or severity of potential transmitted infections. However, substantial variability emerged among individuals, and using data-driven methods we found a subgroup of subjects who are largely disengaged, unaware, and not practicing protective behaviors. Our results have implications for our understanding of how risk perception and protective behaviors can facilitate early interventions during large-scale pandemics.\nIntroduction\nThe genesis of the novel coronavirus epidemic (spread of COVID-19 disease) has been tied to the Hubei province of China and rapidly progressed to the level of a global pandemic, with multiple countries across the globe reporting exponentially increasing numbers of cases (1). The first case in the US was reported in January 14 2020 (2), followed by government interventions in travel restrictions. On March 11, however, COVID-19 officially become an global pandemic (3) and the introduction of a series of governmental decisions to restrict social and economic behavior began. By March 17, all 50 states reported at least one person with the virus (2). Like most developed countries, a major focus of the US has been minimizing transmission of the virus in order to flatten the epidemic peak and lessen the impact on healthcare services (4,5), enabling the most severe cases to be treated successfully and reduce overall mortality. The success of these measures is particularly critical in the case of COVID-19 due to its high transmissibility, even in the absence of symptoms (6,7), severity (4), and mortality rate, particular among older individuals (5). However, these protective measures rely largely on rapid changes in population behavior, which are dependent on individuals\u2019 ability to perceive risks associated with the virus and adapt their behavior accordingly (8).\nGiven the importance of human psychological and behavioral factors in managing pandemics, it is crucial to assess psychological and behavioral responses to the situation and determine how perceived risk is linked to engagement in protective behaviors (9). There is limited evidence on reactions to prior pandemics in the early stages when preventative measures are most necessary (9). While some studies have emphasized the role of risk perception, predominantly the personal effects of the disease (in terms of likelihood and severity if infection for the individual), on preventative behaviors, these often take place either in anticipation of an outbreak or long after its emergence (9). In addition, lab-based research has suggested that increased perceived effects of disease spread on others may increase engagement in social distancing (10). The few studies that have surveyed individuals during the early stages of a pandemic have also suggested that perceived personal risk of infection and health effects are linked to engagement in protective behaviors (11). However, it is also well established that individuals typically tend to underestimate their likelihood of experiencing adverse life events (such as cancer) relative to the average person, an effect known as optimism bias (12). Together, it is apparent that perceived risk is likely to affect individuals\u2019 behavior during a pandemic, but that individuals are often poor at perceiving risk. However, it is unknown how perceived risk relates to protective behaviors in the early stages of a pandemic on the scale of COVID-19. Additionally, we are unaware of any data of this kind for the current COVID-19 pandemic; given COVID-19\u2019s ongoing rampant nature, this data may have global value to the medical community, government leaders, and society more broadly.\nResults\nWe conducted an online survey of 1591 individuals in the USA during the early stages of the country\u2019s outbreak in March 2020, asking about their perceptions of risk and behavioral responses to the pandemic (see Figure 2 for demographic information). Subjects were recruited through Prolific (13) between 3/11/20, the day when the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and 3/16/20. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at California Institute of Technology. We focused on how perceived risk from the virus and propensity to engage in protective behaviors developed as the pandemic progressed. We also sought to quantify the extent to which engagement in protective behaviors was dependent on perceived risk. 375 subjects of the 495 who participated on the first day were followed up after 5 days to provide a picture of within-person changes in perceptions and behaviors. We also replicated cross-sectional results in a subset of our data to ensure robustness.\nPerceptions of risk from COVID-19 While at the time of submission it remains unclear exactly how widespread the pandemic will be, current estimates suggest that up to 80% of the population may contract the disease (4). We sought to characterize perceptions of infection likelihood and severity, for both the study participants themselves and others. All responses were recorded on a visual analogue scale coded between 0 and 100. We also examined changes in behavior over time by sampling independent groups of subjects over five days and retesting subjects who participated on the first day after a five-day period. Despite being a short\nperiod of time, multiple significant political events occurred during this time period, including travel bans and restrictions on public gatherings (Figure 1).\nAs shown in Figure 3, subjects assessed their risk of being infected as relatively high (mean = 43.06, SD = 26.62). Additionally, they reported perceiving the disease as being a threat to their health (mean = 44.70, SD=26.93). They also indicated that they would be personally affected economically, such as through loss of work (mean = 45.68, SD = 34.35), and that they would be affected by the global economic consequences, such as through economic recession and effects on healthcare provision (mean = 64.38, SD = 24.02), although responses to this question were not unimodally distributed..\nSubjects were also aware of the potential for contagion, indicating that if they became infected, they would be likely to pass it to someone else (mean = 66.18, SD = 27.39, Figure 3). As with perceptions of infection likelihood, subjects believed that if they did infect another person, they would be worse affected than themselves, both in terms of health and of economic effects (mean difference = 14.82, SD difference = 26.67). Linear regression indicated that the difference between perceived effects on another person and reported personal health risk was partially dependent on age (t(1550) = -8.33, p < .001), suggesting that this may be explained, in part, by the relatively young age of the participants (median age=30 years) and knowledge of the worse health effects in older individuals. However, the intercept in this model remained positive and significant (\u03b2=29.68, p < .001), indicating the presence of such a bias even after accounting for age.\nPerceived likelihood of infection however differed according to who participants were rating (F(3, 4737) = 579.00, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.27), with participants rating the average person in the US to have the highest risk of infection, but themselves to have the lowest risk, in line with work on optimism bias (12) (Figure 4C). Perceived likelihood of infection differed across samples tested on different days, demonstrating a higher rate over time (F(6, 1579) = 6.48, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.024, Figure 4C). An increase in perceived likelihood was found within-subjects in a subsample followed up after 5 days (F(1, 374) = 69.19, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.16, Figure 4D). There was an interaction between time and subject of rating (F(3, 1122) = 7.56, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.02), representing the greatest changes in risk perception for the self, however this was weak and likely influenced by ceiling effects.\nEngagement in protective behaviors We next assessed the extent to which subjects reported engaging in protective behaviors, such as social distancing and hand washing, in addition to superficially helpful behaviors such as buying more food and water. On average, subjects indicated that they were engaging in such behaviors more than usual, although response distributions included peaks at the extremes (Figure 5). Five out of six protective behaviours had a peak for not engaging in the protective behaviour more than normal, and three out of six had a peak for engaging in the protective behaviour more than normal. In particular, subjects reported washing their hands more than normal (median = 77, IQR = 38) and staying home more than normal (median = 62, IQR = 69), representing high engagement with sanitization and social distancing measures. In subjects who completed the survey a second time point 5 days after first completion (3/11/2020), responses had changed for both hand-washing (Wilcoxon W(375) = 25027.5, p < .001) and social distancing (W(375) = 12269, p < .001) to reflect increased engagement in these behaviors.\nWe also asked people how likely they would be to attend events with varying numbers of people (10 to 1000) to assess how they were adapting their behavior according to transmission risk. As expected, we observed a main effect of group size (F(4, 6316) = 1311.68, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.45, Figure 4A), whereby individuals were less likely to attend an event with more people. We also saw markedly lower likelihood ratings over time in separate samples collected across multiple days (F(6, 1579) = 22.84, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.08, Figure 4A). Congruently, a decrease over time emerged in our within-subject analysis (F(1, 374) = 279.02, p < .001, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d 2 = 0.43, Figure 4B), providing evidence that individuals reported dramatically changing their intended behavior within the space of only a few days. Notably, this occurred before and\nafter the CDC\u2019s recommendation of avoiding gatherings of 50+ people (3/15/20) and on the same day of President Trump\u2019s announcement to avoid gatherings of 10+ people (3/16/20).\nInfluence of risk perception on protective behaviors We next investigated the extent to which risk perception was predictive of engagement in protective behaviors. We used multiple linear regression to assess the extent to which of our 10 items assessing risk perception (shown in Figure 6) were associated with engagement in two primary protective behaviors, hand washing and social distancing (assessed through asking subjects whether they were staying home more than normal), controlling for age. We performed this analysis in a subset consisting of 75% of participants and repeated it in the remaining 25% to ensure reproducibility of our results. Results reported here are from the larger dataset but were consistent across both subsets (Figure 6). All data were scaled to zero mean and unit variance prior to analysis to allow comparability of regression coefficients.\nThe clearest effect common to both behaviors was a significant effect of perceived likelihood of personally becoming infected (hand washing \u03b2 = 0.17, p < .001, social distancing \u03b2 = 0.20, p < .001, Figure 6), while perceived severity of illness was not a significant predictor (hand washing \u03b2 = -0.03, p = .37, social distancing \u03b2 = 0.002, p = .95, Figure 6). Perceived impact from global consequences (e.g. economic recession, healthcare overcapacity) also significantly predicted engagement in both behaviors to a lesser extent (\u03b2=0.08, p = .01, social distancing \u03b2=0.14, p < .001, Figure 6). Notably, likelihood of passing the virus on to others and perceived negative effects for another individual who contracted the virus did not significantly predict behavior (Figure 6). Age did not have a significant effect in either dataset.\nIdentification of subgroups demonstrating low engagement in protective behavior The distributions shown in Figure 5 clearly indicate that the pattern of responses to questions on protective behaviors was not Gaussian, and was not consistently unimodal, suggesting that there are likely to be subgroups of individuals responding to the outbreak in qualitatively different ways. To explore this further, we used a Bayesian Guassian mixture model (GMM) to decompose the distribution of responses to four primary questions (avoiding social interaction, hand-washing, staying home, and travelling less) into latent components. The Bayesian GMM approach assigns weights to these components and we rejected any with a weight below 0.01 as these had a negligible contribution to the model, leaving 16 components as the final solution (Figure 7B). Based on the mean response scores of the components, two components (components 4 and 6) were characterised by high and very low reported engagement with the four protective behaviours respectively (Figure 7A). Others indicated that there were clusters of individuals selectively engaging in certain protective behaviours but not others (components 3, 10, and 16 for example).\nThe model allowed us to assign a probability of each subject being described by each component, which we used to select individuals most likely to belong to the low or high engagement cluster. Having labelled individuals according to their behaviour, we then assessed Z-scored responses to other items\nto examine how these individuals compared to the group average in terms of percevied risk, information seeking, and personal effects of the pandemic (Figure 7C). This revealed a broad pattern of below average perceived risk for both themselves (mean Z = -0.68) and others (mean Z = -0.38), perceived likelihood of transmission (mean Z = -0.28), low engagement with information sources (mean Z = -0.89), and low perceived personal effects (mean Z = -0.66), while the opposite pattern was observed in the high engagement group. Significant differences from the group average are shown in Figure 3C. Together, this indicates that there exists a subgroup in the population who are generally disengaged in terms of information seeking, feel unaffected by the situation, and perceive the risk of COVID-19 as being low for themselves and others, and who do not engage in protective behaviours.\nDiscussion\nUnderstanding how psychological factors influence behavior in severe, global pandemics such as that COVID-19 is key to facilitating disease minimization strategies. Our analyses indicate that although most individuals are aware of the risk caused by the pandemic to some extent, they typically underestimate their personal risk relative to that of others, an example of optimism bias (12). In turn, higher perceived personal risk predicts engagement in protective behaviors such as hand washing and social distancing, as shown in studies of prior pandemics (9). Notably, we identified and characterized a non-negligible subset of subjects reporting little to no engagement in protective behaviors, who rated overall likelihood of infection as low and reported being generally disengaged in information seeking and being personally unaffected. Overall, the presence a subgroup is concerning given the threat posed by COVID19 and the beneficial effects of widespread behavioural changes.\nOne explanation for our results is the optimism bias (12). This bias is associated with the belief that we are less likely to acquire a disease than others, and has been shown across a variety of diseases including lung cancer (14). Indeed, those who show the optimism bias are less likely to be vaccinated against disease (15). Recent evidence suggests that this may also be the case for COVID-19 and could result in a failure to engage in behaviors that contribute to the spread this highly contagious disease. Our results extend on these findings by showing that behavior changes over the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic such that as individuals perceive an increase in personal risk they increasingly engage in riskprevention behaviors. Notably, we observed rapid increases in risk perception over a 5-day period, indicating that public health messages spread through government and the media can be effective in raising awareness of the risk. This effect was strongest for perceptions of subjects\u2019 own risk, diminishing the optimism bias. The speed at which perceptions changed is such that this could have a meaningful effect in terms of reducing disease transmission.\nOur results point to candidate targets for intervention in public information campaigns during pandemics on this scale. Clear communication of risk could aid the development of accurate risk perception, in turn facilitating engagement in protective behaviors. It would be particularly important to target the subset of individuals who remain disengaged and are not themselves seeking information on the pandemic. This suggests the need to expand outreach methods to individuals who do not seek information themselves (e.g., emergency alerts on phones). Furthermore, such disengagement should be considered in epidemiological models used to forecast the effects of behavioral interventions on disease spread. Additionally, education on the beneficial effects of such behaviors for others may improve engagement, particularly in those at low perceived personal risk; it is possible that links between protective behavior and perceived personal risk minimization are merely easier to appreciate.\nThere are limitations to our work that should be considered. First, the median age (30 years) of our sample is relatively young. However, many of our results do not appear to be highly dependent on age, for example age was not a significant predictor of hand-washing or social distancing. In addition, young people are typically the primary target of efforts to encourage social distancing, having on average larger social networks (16) and therefore a higher likelihood of engaging in social contact. This is particularly important in the context of COVID-19, where there is evidence that the spread of the virus has been facilitated by the movement of young people with limited to no symptoms (5,6). Second, our data only reflects views of those in the United States and may not be applicable to other cultures. It will be important to characterize psychological and behavioral responses across the globe during pandemics in order to recommend and implement the most optimal strategies for effecting behavioural change, which often are culturally specific.\nAdaptation of behavior will be fundamental to the management of a pandemic on the scale of COVID19. Our results provide insights into key psychological and behavioral states during a crucial time in the developing situation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by US National Institute of Mental Health grant 2P50MH094258 and a Chen Institute Award (P2026052) (support to D.M.).

One example is the run on many basic goods. However, conflicts of interests also afford the expression of personality traits associated with individual differences in prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility, in particular, is associated with prosocial behaviour at a personal cost. Across two studies (N = 601), Honesty-Humility was positively associated with refraining from stockpiling in the past and intentions to do so in the future. This was not due to differences in beliefs that others would refrain from stockpiling. Instead, results suggest that individuals high in Honesty-Humility may have been motivated to maximise societal outcomes, even at the cost of foregoing individual benefits.\nKeywords: Coronavirus, Honesty-Humility, Prosocial Behaviour, Trust.\nWho Hoards? Honesty-Humility and Behavioural Responses to the 2019/20\nCoronavirus Pandemic\nWith the spread of the 2019/20 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to Europe and\nNorth America in early March 2020, there were widespread reports that people were buying up soap and hand sanitiser, but also food and other daily necessities. Social media reports showed emptied shelves and people buying entire shopping carts full of toilet paper. Indeed, by mid-March, stores across these regions had run out of many items, leading to further fears of long-term supply shortages (Corkery & Maheshwari, 2020).\nStocking up on goods during an emergency forms a social dilemma. Under normal\ncircumstances, there are few reasons to stockpile canned foods or toilet paper. During an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, however, expectations change. People come to expect others to increase their purchases (Paloyo, 2020). This creates a coordination problem in which people would be best off if everybody kept purchasing regular amounts, but in which people may begin to stockpile out of fear that others will deplete supermarket stocks, leaving them with nothing. Indeed, it appears that at least in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and North America, mass purchases were caused by fears that other people were buying up reserves (Corkery & Maheshwari, 2020).\nWhen others are stockpiling food and toilet paper, even if they do so out of fear of\nbeing left without, refraining from making extra purchases is a form of prosocial behaviour. What psychological traits may lead people to hold back on hoarding? Among broad personality traits, Honesty-Humility has been most consistently and most strongly linked to prosocial behaviour (Thielmann, Spadaro, & Balliet, 2020). As proposed in the HEXACO model of personality, Honesty-Humility represents a tendency to forego opportunities for personal gain when they come at a cost to others (Ashton & Lee, 2007). Indeed, Honesty-Humility has been shown to be associated with a wide range of prosocial behaviours including cooperation in economic games (Thielmann et al., 2020) and organisational citizenship behaviours (Pletzer, Bentvelzen,\nOostrom, & de Vries, 2019). However, most research so far has studied the relationship between Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour in the laboratory, and it is much less clear how strongly Honesty-Humility relates to prosocial behaviour in daily life (Columbus, Thielmann, & Balliet, 2019).\nRecent work has emphasised that Honesty-Humility should not predict prosocial\nbehaviour independent of context. Rather, it is a predictor of active acts of prosociality in contexts that involve a conflict of interests (Thielmann et al., 2020). One reason for this is that those high in Honesty-Humility are willing to forego opportunities to benefit themselves when this would come at a cost to others (Ashton & Lee, 2007). A particular motivation to do so is to increase social welfare (Mischkowski, Thielmann, & Gl\u00f6ckner, 2019). In contrast, studies of motives to \u2018prep\u2019 for a doomsday scenario show that Honesty-Humility is associated with a competitive view of survival (Fetterman, Rutjens, Landkammer, & Wilkowski, 2019). Thus, individuals high in Honesty-Humility may refrain from stockpiling because they are willing to make sacrifices to promote social welfare.\nAnother reason that Honesty-Humility may drive people to behave prosocially\nduring a crisis is the relationship between Honesty-Humility and trust (Balliet & van Lange, 2013; Thielmann & Hilbig, 2015). Those high in Honesty-Humility expect others to be more cooperative (Thielmann & Hilbig, 2014), which may motivate them to behave prosocially themselves. Indeed, recent meta-analytic evidence shows that Social Value Orientation\u2014which can be conceptualised as a facet of Honesty-Humility (Hilbig, Gl\u00f6ckner, & Zettler, 2014)\u2014is linked to prosocial behaviour in large parts through expectations that others will behave cooperatively (Pletzer et al., 2018). Thus, high Honesty-Humility may also lead people to refrain from stockpiling because they expect others to do the same; conversely, low Honesty-Humility may be associated with distrust and lead people to buy up goods so they are not left without. I thus hypothesised that Honesty-Humility would predict stockpiling, in part because individuals high in Honesty-Humility would have more positive beliefs about the behaviour of their peers.\nStudy 1"}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Participants.

People thus clearly overestimated the proportion of people who engaged in stockpiling. 1Data, code, materials, and preregistration for Study 2 are available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/xm6kg/?view_only=7be67990149d4b28abce12aae1144612)\nI used a generalised linear mixed model to examine the relationship between\nHonesty-Humility and stockpiling (Fig. 1A).

However, only a non-significant share of this relationship was mediated by beliefs about others\u2019 behaviour. Believing\nthat others had increased their purchases was associated with having done so oneself; however, Honesty-Humility did not predict beliefs that others were stockpiling.\nOne way to interpret these results is that people higher in Honesty-Humility\nrefrained from stockpiling out of altruistic concern for others\u2019 well-being. Recent work suggests that Honesty-Humility is associated with both an aversion to inequality and motivation to maximise joint outcomes (Mischkowski et al., 2019). While recognising that other people may engage in stockpiling, those high in Honesty-Humility may thus have held back to ensure that everybody receives a fair share or because they perceived stockpiling as harming social welfare.\nStudy 2\nStudy 1 was largely exploratory and involved a relatively small sample. I thus\nsought to replicate the observed results in a preregistered follow-up study. Because the results suggested that Honesty-Humility may relate to stockpiling not because people differ in their beliefs about their peers, but in their prosocial motivation, I also included measures of motivation to maximise joint outcomes (\u2018MaxJoint\u2019) and own outcomes (\u2018MaxOwn\u2019).\nAlthough I hypothesised that people\u2019s beliefs that others engage in stockpiling\nmay drive them to change their shopping behaviour, it may be that people\u2019s behaviour drives their beliefs (Thielmann & Hilbig, 2014). This could be because shopping exposes people to others\u2019 behaviour (e.g., in the form of empty shelves), or because they seek to justify their own behaviour. To further disentangle these factors, I therefore included people\u2019s future shopping intentions as a second outcome.\nTo test causally whether beliefs mediate between personality and behavioural\nintentions, I used an instrumental variable approach in which the mediator\u2014beliefs\u2014is manipulated exogenously. For this purpose, I exploited the fact that in Study 1, people vastly overestimated how many of their peers engaged in stockpiling. Appeals using descriptive norms have been shown to be powerful interventions to promote prosocial behaviour (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990), and research on the Theory of Planned\nBehaviour has directly linked descriptive norms to intentions (Rivis & Sheeran, 2003)."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Sample.

Materials and procedure were largely the same as\nfor Study 1. Honesty-Humility (\u2126t = 0.85) was measured using 16 items from the HEXACO 100 (Lee & Ashton, 2018).2 Stockpiling was measured using the same one-item measure; also included were two masking questions about social distancing and hand washing.\nParticipants answered three items each measuring their motivation to maximise\njoint outcomes (e.g., \u201cI wanted to assure the best outcome for everybody.\u201d) and their motivation to maximise their personal outcomes (e.g., \u201cI wanted to make sure I have enough for myself.\u201d; Likert-type, 1 = \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d, 5 = \u201cstrongly agree\u201d).

To test whether MaxJoint and MaxOwn motivation mediated the relationship between Honesty-Humility and stockpiling, I conducted two causal mediation analyses using the R package \u2018mediation\u2019 (Tingley et al., 2014). For MaxJoint motives, this revealed a significant average causal mediation effect, \u03b2 = -0.01, 95% CI = [-0.02, 0.00], p = 0.032, proportion of total effect mediated = .19.

Across Studies 1 and 2, Honesty-Humility\nand past stockpiling were assessed the same way. I therefore exploratorily combined data from both studies.

Across two studies (one preregistered), Honesty-Humility was negatively associated with past stockpiling, although only significantly so in the first study and in an exploratory combined analysis. Moreover, in the second study, Honesty-Humility was positively associated with intentions to refrain from stockpiling in the (near) future.\nThe association between Honesty-Humility and past (Study 1) or future (Study 2)\nstockpiling was not mediated by beliefs about the shopping behaviour of others. In Study 2, I used an appeal to descriptive norms in a parallel encouragement design to successfully (and accurately) reduce people\u2019s beliefs that others were buying more goods than normally. However, this did not reduce intentions to stockpile. Further results suggest that people\u2014and especially those higher in Honesty-Humility\u2014refrain from stockpiling because they are motivated to maximise societal outcomes, and willing to forego individual welfare maximisation.\nPrevious work has found that Honesty-Humility is associated with trust in\nstrangers (Thielmann & Hilbig, 2014). However, much of this work has studied trust behaviour in experimental games, where it is confounded with prosocial motives (Thielmann et al., 2020). In contrast, there was no apparent association between Honesty-Humility and expectations that others would engage in stockpiling. In turn, it appears that those high in Honesty-Humility were motivated to refrain from stockpiling because they cared about maximising joint welfare, and were willing to forego individual gain to do so."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "The present studies largely use cross-sectional, correlational designs with their\naccompanying shortcomings. In particular, the relations between personality, beliefs, and retrospective self-reports of behaviour in Study 1 do not allow for strong causal claims. Some of these weaknesses are addressed in the design of Study 2, which manipulated beliefs directly to test a causal mediation hypothesis. Study 2 also used\nintentions as a second outcome measure to somewhat disentangle own behaviour and beliefs about others\u2019 behaviour. However, additional future work, including experimental and longitudinal designs, would be welcome.\nStudy 2 also included two measures of social motives as alternative mediators\nbetween Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour. Indeed, results show significant indirect effects through both motivation to maximise societal outcomes and motivation to maximise personal outcomes (in opposite directions). In this case, the total effect of Honesty-Humility on stockpiling behaviour was not significant. However, the power to detect an indirect effect can be larger than that to detect a total effect (Kenny & Judd, 2014).

However, when threat is uncertain\nand continuous, as in the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, fear can become chronic and burdensome. To better understand predictors of fear of the coronavirus, we conducted an online survey (N = 439) between March 14 and 17, 2020, which started three days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Fear of the coronavirus was assessed with eight questions pertaining to different dimensions of fear (e.g., subjective worry, avoidance, preferential attention) and an open-ended question. The predictors included measures of psychological vulnerability factors (i.e., intolerance of uncertainty, worry, health anxiety), media exposure, and personal relevance (i.e., personal health, risk for loved ones, and risk control). We found that respondents reported a wide range of concerns relating to the coronavirus outbreak, such as their employment, spreading of the virus, and economic and societal consequences. Four predictors for fear of the coronavirus were retained after forward selection in a multiple regression analysis: intolerance of uncertainty, health anxiety, more media exposure, and risks for loved ones (R2 = .36). We discuss the relevance of our findings for managing people\u2019s fear of the coronavirus.\nKeywords: Fear; Coronavirus; Intolerance of uncertainty; Health anxiety; Media exposure\nFear is an adaptive emotion that serves to mobilize energy to deal with potential threat.\nHowever, when fear is not well calibrated to the actual threat, it can be maladaptive. For instance, when fear is too excessive, this may have detrimental effects both at the individual level (e.g., mental health problems such as phobia and social anxiety), and at the societal level (e.g., panic shopping or xenophobia). On the other hand, when there is insufficient fear, this may also result in harm for individuals and society (e.g., due to people ignoring government measures to slow the spread of coronavirus or due to reckless policies that ignore the risks). Furthermore, safety behaviors (e.g., hand washing) can mitigate certain threats (e.g., contamination), but they can paradoxically also enhance fear (e.g., contamination concern and health anxiety) (see Deacon & Maack, 2008; Engelhard et al., 2015; Olatunji et al., 2011). Likewise, societal safety measures (e.g., lockdowns) have their use to prevent spreading of infections. However, when such safety measures are too prolonged or strict, they can have negative consequences (e.g., disruption of the economy, unemployment).\nWith the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in China in December 2019 and in\nEurope in February 2020, national polls indicate sharp increases in fear and worries relating to the virus (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020; McCarthy, 2020). Given the potential detrimental effects of both excessive and insufficient fear (at both the individual and societal level), it is important to better understand and know the relevant predictors of fear of the coronavirus.\nSeveral possible predictors can be derived from the scientific literature. First, there are\npsychological vulnerability factors (see also Asmundson & Taylor, 2020). Some people are more disposed to experiencing anxiety and fear than others. Of particular interest is intolerance of uncertainty, which is usually described as a disposition towards finding uncertain situations\nanxiety-related disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (Boswell et al., 2013; Rosser, 2019). We expected intolerance of uncertainty to predict higher levels of coronavirus fear. Furthermore, two other vulnerability factors implicated in anxiety-related disorders are of interest here: worry and health-related anxiety (Abramowitz et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 1990). We also expected these factors to be related to fear of the coronavirus, but it was uncertain whether they would explain variance beyond the explained variance by intolerance of uncertainty.\nAnother variable of interest is exposure to information about the impending threat. Threat\ninformation is known to elevate levels of fear, both in laboratory (Mertens et al., 2018; Muris & Field, 2010) and in field (Cauberghe et al., 2009) studies. There is evidence that repeatedly engaging with trauma-related media content for several hours daily shortly after collective trauma may prolong acute stress experiences (Holman et al., 2014). Therefore, we expected that for the coronavirus outbreak, more exposure to threat information (e.g., reading news bulletins about new deaths, social media posts) would increase fear of the virus (Garfin et al., 2020).\nFinally, individual vulnerability factors and exposure to threatening messages may not\nsuffice to explain subjectively experienced threat and fear. A third important factor to consider is whether the threat is personally relevant, either to oneself or to loved ones (Stussi et al., 2015). As such, one would expect more worry and fear if the threat of the coronavirus is highly relevant for oneself (e.g., because of worse general health) or to loved ones (e.g., grandparents). Additionally, fear of the virus may be moderated by perceived coping potential. Coping refers to available (mental) resources to mitigate potential threat (Taylor & Stanton, 2007). If perceived coping is high, threat perception and fear are expected to be low. Hence, we expect that personal\nrelated to the coronavirus fear.\nTo investigate individual vulnerability, media exposure, personal relevance, and coping\nability as predictors of the coronavirus fear, we conducted an online survey with a custom-built questionnaire to assess fear of the virus. The study was conducted between March 14 and 17, 2020, which was three days after the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, and it included the weekend after most European countries announced increasingly strict measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Sample and sample size determination Respondents for this study were recruited through online advertisements using social media platforms of the involved researchers (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit). Data from 695 respondents were recorded. However, 253 respondents did not complete the questionnaire and data from three additional respondents were removed because they did not answer all questions, so the final sample consisted of 439 respondents (completion rate: 63.17%), representing 28 different countries. The majority of our sample consisted of women (69.93%) and a large portion of the respondents lived in the Netherlands (47.61%) (see Table 1 for a detailed overview of the demographics of our sample). Participation was on a voluntary basis. The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Science of Utrecht University approved this study (FETC20-166).\nThe minimal sample size of this study was based on an a priori power calculation.\nParticularly, we decided to recruit at least 194 respondents, as this would provide sufficient statistical power (.80) to detect small sized correlation coefficients (.20) (https://www.sample-\nthe statistical power for detecting smaller effects and strengthen the robustness of the findings. Data collection was stopped after three days due to the collection of sufficient responses and the announcement of stricter safety measures by the Dutch government and other European countries (which could affect subsequent responses)."}, {"heading": "2.2.1.

These items were chosen because they correspond with different fear components, such as subjective experiences (worrying), attentional biases, and avoidance behaviors (Lang, 1968). The internal consistency of this scale was evaluated and found to be acceptable (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.77). Hence, we calculated a sum score of this scale as the outcome measure for our statistical analyses (possible range: 8-40), with higher scores indicating more fear of the coronavirus outbreak.\nIn addition, we included one open-ended question in which respondents were asked to\ndescribe their biggest concern about the coronavirus.

Second, we did not include whether respondents had paid attention to the source of the additional information they had looked up, because not all respondents had looked up additional information and including this variable would result in the list-wise exclusion of these respondents. Finally, we did not separately assess the additional information sources respondents consulted for extra information (e.g., regular news, social media, professional websites, etc.). This was decided because respondents could select multiple options, and therefore consultation of the different sources was not independent of one another other (e.g., the same respondent could have consulted social media, specialized websites, and family and friends). Instead, we calculated a sum score of the number of additional sources consulted by respondents.\nFollowing univariate analyses, a multiple regression model was conducted including all\nsignificant predictors from the univariate analyses to investigate the unique contribution of each of the predictors in explaining variance in the fear of the coronavirus questionnaire.

The only significant predictor was having looked up additional information about the coronavirus outbreak (not taking into account coincidentally seeing/reading about it in the news). The other categorical predictors did not significantly predict fear of the coronavirus.\nTo investigate which combination of the different predictors explained best the variation in fear of the coronavirus questionnaire, all significant continuous predictors (intolerance of uncertainty, PSWQ, health anxiety, number of information sources, overall health, and danger for loved ones), and the significant categorical predictor (looked up information) were entered into a multiple regression model. Using forward selection, intolerance of uncertainty, health anxiety, number of information sources, and risk for loved ones were included in the final model (R2 = .36, F(4, 433) = 60.49, p < .001). The other predictors (i.e., PSWQ, overall health, and looked up information) did not further improve model fit. Table 5 provides the standardized regression coefficients of the predictors in the final model. Model fit indices of the multiple regression analysis are provided in Supplementary Table 2.\nThe current report investigated predictors of fear of the coronavirus (COVID-19)\noutbreak in an online survey study. Based on the literature, we expected that individual difference variables (intolerance of uncertainty, worry-proneness, and health anxiety) would predict increased fear of the coronavirus. Additionally, we expected that more media exposure and higher personal relevance of the threat (for both oneself and loved ones, and less risk control) would predict increased levels of fear. In line with these predictions, we found that all these factors predicted higher scores on the fear of the coronavirus questionnaire. Particularly, intolerance of uncertainty, health anxiety, risk for loved ones, and consulting more information sources were independent predictors for the fear of the coronavirus questionnaire. Furthermore, we found a wide range of worries that respondents reported in the open-ended question, of which concerns for others\u2019 was the most often indicated concern. Such results are relevant for policy makers and (mental) health care workers to know who is more inclined to react fearfully toward the coronavirus outbreak, and for journalists to be aware the potential fear-inducing impact of their work.\nAnswers of respondents to the open question revealed a wider range of concerns than\nthose included in the fear of the coronavirus questionnaire. Particularly, apart from concerns for their own safety, those of others, and related safety and avoidance behaviors (which were already included in our questionnaire), respondents also worried about the impact of the coronavirus on the healthcare system, the economy, society, losing their job and changes in daily routines. To a lesser extent, respondents reported concerns regarding properties of the virus itself, reactions of\nassessments of fear of the coronavirus also include items relating to these concerns.\nWith regard of predictors for fear of the coronavirus questionnaire, as expected, our\nresults indicate that people who are more at risk of developing general anxiety-related symptomatology (i.e., individuals with heightened intolerance of uncertainty, worry, and health anxiety) are also more afraid of the coronavirus outbreak. Interestingly, after selection in a multiple regression model, only intolerance of uncertainty and health anxiety were retained, whereas worry was not. The latter finding is most likely due to the large overlap between the constructs. Particularly, the intolerance of uncertainty scale and PSWQ were highly correlated in this sample. Nonetheless, it is interesting that health anxiety explained additional variance beyond the variance explained by the intolerance of uncertainty scale and PSWQ. This indicates that health anxiety is a unique component in explaining fear of the coronavirus, beyond mere uncertainty and worrying.\nFurthermore, we found that more media exposure was positively related to fear of the\ncoronavirus questionnaire. This is consistent with earlier findings in other types of collective lifeevents (Garfin et al., 2020). Some suggestions for the management of fear can be made based on this finding. Particularly, if this relationship is causal, then there are opportunities for policy makers and journalists to affect excessive fear. One way to do this is to ensure that communication is clear and unambiguous, because uncertainty tends to increase fear (Lissek et al., 2006). Information should also be provided without sensationalism or disturbing images (Garfin et al., 2020). In addition, there are also opportunities for individuals themselves to tackle their fear. People can be advised to somewhat restrict their exposure to media coverage of the\ncontinuously throughout the day) and avoid sensational media, which may enhance stress and decrease well-being.\nAnother major source of fear of the coronavirus was the perceived risk of infection by the\nvirus for loved ones. In fact, this was the strongest predictor of fear of the coronavirus questionnaire in our sample. Likewise, the risk of infection by loved ones was the most commonly reported concern by the respondents in the open-ended question. This worry could be mitigated by providing the general public with clear information about the risk of threat and by taking (additional) steps to protect vulnerable groups for risk of infection. Clear communication regarding this concern may also be helpful in motivating people to follow government guidelines: when they ignore social distancing guidelines, because they deem their own risk to be low, they are actually increasing health risks for their loved ones.\nOur results may also be taken as indicative that stronger messages in the media may\ninduce more fear and therefore more compliance with the social distancing and lock down policies imposed. However, we caution against using media messages to induce more fear in the general public. Particularly, there is evidence that suggest that such \u2018fear appeals\u2019 do not work very well to promote behavior change (Peters et al., 2013), particularly when people have little coping strategies. Under such circumstances, which may apply to the current coronavirus crisis, it may not be very helpful to maximize fear, as this may only increase distress. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of respondents in our sample was concerned about the role of (social) media on mass panic and hysteria. Hence, fear appeals in the media should be used carefully and whether fear appeals work for the current situation requires empirical evaluation.\ntemporal proximity to the initial developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak. This study was conducted within days that the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and strict safety measures imposed by various European countries. Another strength is that the included measurement instruments had good psychometric properties and that our sample size was sufficiently large for detecting small correlations. Limitations of this study include the nonrepresentativeness of our sample, which consisted to a large extent of Dutch highly educated females aged between 20 and 40, and the cross-sectional nature of the study. This may limit the generalizability of our results to a wider population and claims about the directionality of the results.\nIn conclusion, in this online study, we found that respondents report a wide range of\nconcern regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Furthermore, anxious individual differences, exposure to media information about the coronavirus outbreak, and risk of infection by loved ones were positively related to increased fear of the coronavirus. These results may help policy makers and health care workers to manage maladaptive levels of fear and worry due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe research reported in this paper was funded by a NWO Vici grant (grant number: 453-\n15-005) awarded to Iris M.

Do differently phrased public-health messages appeal to different people? I based predictions on the five-factor, triarchic psychopathy, and Dark Triad models of normal-range and dark traits; the extended parallel process model (EPPM); and schema-congruence theory. In a survey of 502 online participants, normal-range traits (esp. agreeableness and conscientiousness) predicted endorsement of social distancing and hygiene, as well as the appeal of health messages in general. Consistent with the EPPM, conscientiousness and neuroticism evidenced an interaction. Dark traits (esp. psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) predicted low endorsement of health behaviors and the intent to knowingly expose others to risk. Most participants preferred a message appealing to compassion (\u201cHelp protect the vulnerable...\u201d), but dark traits predicted lower appeal of that message. Personality appears relevant to epidemiology and public-health communication in a contagious-disease context.\nAdaptive and Dark Personality Traits in the Covid-19 Pandemic:\nPredicting Health-behavior Endorsement and the Appeal of Public-health Messages\nPersonality predicts health and health behaviors broadly (Strickhouser et al., 2011), but\nless is known about its links to protective vs. risk behavior relevant to infectious disease. There is no prior research on personality and responses to public-health messages (PHMs) in a pandemic. I linked general, psychopathy-related, and dark personality dimensions to health-behavior endorsement and tested whether PHMs\u2019 trait-congruence predicted their appeal.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a pandemic of severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease (Covid-19). By March 20, all U.S. states were reporting Covid-19 and had announced states of emergency, as had the federal government. Diverse individual reactions to this were apparent (So et al., 2020), potentially implicating personality. Who conforms to emergent hygiene and social distancing norms? Who may benefit from stronger or different messaging to help contain a pandemic?"}, {"heading": "Health Behavior and Normal-range Personality", "text": "Normal-range personality domains from the five-factor model (FFM; Digman, 1990) may\nshed light on people\u2019s different reactions. Outside the pandemic context, conscientiousness predicts health-promoting and risk-avoiding behavior (Roberts et al., 2005). Early in the pandemic, authorities called for such behavior (e.g., \u201cwash your hands,\u201d \u201cavoid crowds\u201d). Agreeableness (which entails empathy and cooperativeness) predicts compliance with social norms for specific health behaviors (e.g., in physical exercise, driving, sexual activity, alcohol use, and smoking; Malouff et al., 2006). Covid-19 messaging appealed to compassion and cooperation, e.g., \u201cprotect others, even if your risk is low.\u201d Neuroticism, usually a liability in health and risk behavior (Lahey, 2009), nevertheless promotes fear and may make people\nsusceptible to \u201cfear appeals\u201d (dire warnings) to change behavior (Awagu & Basil, 2016). Such informal appeals were prevalent early in the pandemic. Extraversion may make social distancing aversive, and openness may facilitate health behaviors through accurate perceptions of risk (Trobst et al., 2000). Overall, conscientiousness and agreeableness, the model\u2019s prosocial domains, seem most likely to predict health and risk behaviors in general.\nMore narrowly, personal hygiene\u2019s links to personality have hardly been studied.\nPersonality-bound processes like disease worrying (Liao et al., 2011) seemed to predict hygiene during an influenza pandemic in 2009, implicating neuroticism. Extraversion and (low) neuroticism may predict oral hygiene (Kressin et al., 1999).\nResearch on non-respiratory communicable diseases and the FFM may also inform\npredictions about responses to contagious SARS. Aspects of neuroticism, (low) conscientiousness, and (low) agreeableness may predict HIV risk behavior (Trobst et al., 2002) and sexually-transmitted infection (M\u00f5ttus et al., 2012). Would this generalize to SARS?\nBeyond bivariate relationships, conscientiousness and agreeableness may interact in\npredicting adaptive responses to a pandemic, as they interact in academic and job performance (e.g., Witt et al., 2002). The extended parallel process model (EPPM) of persuasion in PHMs suggests that threat sensitivity (entailed in neuroticism) and self-efficacy (linked to conscientiousness) may interact in predicting fear-appeal susceptibility (Witte, 1992)."}, {"heading": "Health Behavior and Dark Personality", "text": "Maladaptive, clinical conceptualizations of personality may also explain people\u2019s diverse\nreactions. For example, sensation seeking and neuroticism\u2019s clinical manifestations predict many risk behaviors, including HIV-risk sexual behavior (Kalichman et al., 1998; Razei et al., 2017), as do antisocial and borderline personality disorder features (Adams et al., 2016; Ladd & Petry,\n2003; Kelley & Petry, 2000). Such findings implicate psychopathy (which relates to sensation seeking, antisocial, and borderline personality).\nPsychopathy is a cluster of characteristics that revolve around callousness and lack of\nempathy (Verschuere et al., 2018) and include egocentricity, grandiosity, superficial charm, remorselessness, deceptiveness, manipulativeness, recklessness, unreliability, and antisociality (Hare, 1996). It partially overlaps with the other Dark Triad traits (Paulhus & Williams, 2002): narcissism (which involves less disinhibition and more exhibitionism) and Machiavellianism (which entails less grandiosity and disinhibition and more cynicism, mistrust, and calculated exploitativeness). Psychopathy is not unitary. In Patrick et al.\u2019s (2009) triarchic model, it is the confluence of boldness (dominance, fearlessness, adventurousness, and stress immunity), disinhibition (lack of constraint of one\u2019s self-centered needs or anger), and meanness (callousness and instrumental exploitativeness).\nPsychopathy and, to some extent, narcissism and Machiavellianism, predict not only\nantisocial (including aggressive and violent) tendencies, but also various health behaviors and outcomes (Fulton et al., 2010; Jonason et al., 2015; Hudek-Knezevic et al., 2016; Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2019), including HIV-risk sexual behavior (Hudek-Knezevic et al., 2007). Like normal-range traits, the Dark Triad has not been studied in relation to health-promoting and risk behavior in pandemic of SARS or to PHMs. Maladaptive Personality and Harm to Others\u2019 Health\nIf maladaptive personality partially explains reactions to the pandemic and PHMs, it\nmatters to public health. For example, it may explain who intentionally spreads, or threatens to spread, disease \u2013 which raises societal concern (Dryer, 2020). Sensation seeking\u2019s link to HIVrisk behavior in persons with HIV has such implications (Kalichman et al., 2008; Shuper et al.,\n2014). Findings link psychopathy to deliberately misleading sex partners about one\u2019s HIVpositive status (Benotsch et al., 2012) and narcissism to knowingly putting others at risk of HIV infection (Martin et al., 2013). More generally, psychopathy and the Dark Triad correlate with endorsement of unethical behavior (Pletti et al., 2017; Roeser et al., 2016). During a pandemic, and perhaps in response to PHMs, dark personality may predispose people to dismiss PHMs and endanger others."}, {"heading": "Personality and Health Communications", "text": "Personality may have applied implications (Ferguson, 2013), particularly for\ncommunicating health advice (Dutta-Bergman, 2003). According to schema-congruence theory (Brock et al., 1990), people prefer and find more persuasive messages that align with their views of themselves. This has been suggested in such contexts as commercial advertising (Chang, 2005), antismoking campaigns (Chang, 2009), diabetes education (Lawson et al., 2010), college drinking (York et al., 2012a, 2012b), dental-hygiene promotion (Sherman et al., 2008), and condom use (Noar et al., 2006). Respectively, to the extent that personality is reflected in their self-concept, people may favor messages that match their self-reported traits."}, {"heading": "The Current Study", "text": "Given the paucity of research on personality in relation to SARS-protective and risk\nbehaviors during a pandemic, I tested such relationships using a survey. Measuring actual behaviors would be ideal, yet self-reported current and intended behaviors provide a starting point to probe the boundaries of personality theory.\nAmong the constructs discussed above, conscientiousness, agreeableness, (low)\nextraversion, neuroticism, (low) boldness, and (low) disinhibition are likely to predict selfreported current social distancing. Conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, and low\nboldness, disinhibition, and psychopathy may predict endorsement of intent for future social distancing (presumably in response to increasing knowledge and PHMs about the pandemic). Conscientiousness, agreeableness, (low) disinhibition, and (low) meanness are likely to predict intent for future hygiene (which protects not only the self but also others). Psychopathy, meanness, disinhibition, and Machiavellianism may predict endorsing the willingness to infect others.\nAdditionally, conscientiousness and agreeableness, and conscientiousness and\nneuroticism would interact in predicting current social distancing and future intent for social distancing (as per prior research and the EPPM).\nPer schema-congruent theory, differently phrased PHMs\u2019 appeal would correlate with\npersonality dimensions: (a) for a \u201cself-centered\u201d message, with narcissism, meanness, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy; (b) for a \u201cresponsible\u201d message, with conscientiousness and (low) disinhibition; (c) for a \u201ccompassionate\u201d message, with agreeableness, conscientiousness, (low) narcissism, (low) Machiavellianism, (low) psychopathy, and (low) meanness; (d) for an \u201cavoidant\u201d message, with neuroticism and (low) boldness; and (e) for a \u201csociable\u201d message, with extraversion, boldness, and openness.\nMethod\nAfter pre-registering the study on March 20, I collected data from March 20-23, just after\nCalifornia and New York (followed by other states) issued shelter-at-home orders. At that time, Americans had varied and evolving opinions about the pandemic, whether it posed risk to them, and whether the public was overreacting (Rakich, 2020)."}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "U.S. Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers with master status (N = 502), received $2.50 to\ncomplete a 15-min. survey.

I anticipated careless (possibly automated) responding on MTurk and planned to screen the data for invalid responding before any other analyses. Of 652 people who reached the survey\u2019s end, 616 passed effort checks; of them, 562 passed validity checks, 540 passed subsequent inconsistency checks, 503 passed a completion-time check, and 502 had completed all questionnaires (Supplementary Materials, SMs, Tables S1-S4.)

A third questionnaire, with broader content, was intended to covertly measure participants\u2019 willingness to deliberately put others at risk (or to use hygiene and social distancing to protect others).\nCurrent Health Behavior (CHB). This 10-item questionnaire asked participants how\nmuch they currently did each behavior as a precaution against Covid-19 (e.g., \u201cLimit contact with people as much as possible\u2026\u201d) on a 4-point scale from not at all or never to extremely or\nalways. I expected the data to be reducible to CHB: Social Distancing and CHB: Hygiene. A principal components analysis (PCA) supported this (Table S5).

These associations were mostly negative. Adaptive traits, e.g., the superfactors Stability (rp = .27 , p = 7.1 -10 ), Plasticity (rp = .17 , p = 9.7 -5 ), and P (rp = .26 , p = 2.2 -9 ) predicted the message\u2019s appeal, as they did endorsement of all other PMHs (Tables 4, S17).\nThe hypotheses that PMH2: Responsible\u2019s appeal would correlate with\nConscientiousness (rp = .15 , p = 4.6 -4 ) and Disinhibition (rp = -.11, p = 7.1 -3 ) received support. However, as was generally the case for MPHs, its appeal also correlated with other traits: positively with adaptive and negatively with maladaptive ones.\nThe hypotheses that PMH3: Compassionate\u2019s appeal would be predicted by\nAgreeableness (rp = .37, p = 5.6 -18 ) and Conscientiousness (rp = .17, p = 8.0 -5 ) and, negatively, by Meanness (rp = -.31, p = 3.3 -13 ), Machiavellianism (rp = -.23, p = 1.6 -7 ), and SD3 Psychopathy (rp = -.26, p = 2.5 -9 ) received support; the hypothesis that it would correlate negatively with Narcissism (rp = -.04, p = 2.0 -1 ) did not. In EAs, PMH3 appeal correlated also with Openness (rp = .15, p = 3.3 -4 ), Disinhibition (rp = -.24, p = 1.7 -8 ), and all superfactors.\nAs predicted, Neuroticism correlated with PMH4: Avoidant\u2019s appeal (rp = .13, p = 2.2 -3 )\nbut also with all other PMHs, and PMH4 had a stronger correlation with Agreeableness (rp = .24, p = 2.7 -8 ).

Instead, like the other PHM\u2019s, PHM5 correlated with Agreeableness (rp = .21, p\n= .6 5 -7 ) and Neuroticism (rp = .18 , p = 2.1 -5 ) and, negatively, Meanness (rp = -.13 , p = 2.3 -3 ). Post Hoc Analyses\nUnplanned regression analyses clarified the relative unique contributions of normal-range\nand dark traits to key health-related variables (Tables S19-21).\nPHM: Compassionate was participants\u2019 top choice by far (n = 208; more than twice as\noften as other PHMs). In EAs, participants\u2019 top-ranked PHM did not predict any MIP variables. It predicted AMP and SD3 scores except Boldness and Psychopathy. For example, Meanness, F(4, 493) = 5.5, p = 2.4 -4 , partial  2 = .043 (small effect), was lower than average in participants who ranked the Compassionate PHM the highest, t = -.114, p = 8.5 -4 , 95% C.I. = [-.18 - -.05]. Disinhibition, Narcissism, and Machiavellianism evidenced similar patterns.\nDiscussion\nThis research extends personality theory to differences in people\u2019s reactions to a\npandemic of communicable SARS. The five-factor, triarchic psychopathy, and Dark Triad models informed such questions as: What traits predict intent for social distancing and hygiene, endorsement of behavior that risks others\u2019 health, and the appeal of differently phrased PHMs? Such knowledge may aid individual risk prediction (Chapman et al., 2019). It may have applied implications when a minority of people dismisses the usual PHMs (de Bruin et al., 2020).\nTwenty-four of 40 hypotheses received support, particularly those based on trait theory\nand concerning current and future health behavior intent, as well as risk to others. Although most correlations were small (a few were medium), they may reflect meaningful differences in\nbehavior over time. Self-reported traits are good predictors of trait-relevant behavior (Fleeson & Gallagher, 2009) and appear to predict health behaviors in experience sampling (Kroencke et al., 2019). Furthermore, intentions for behavior likely predict actual behavior (Webb & Sheeran, 2006)."}, {"heading": "Normal-range Personality", "text": "Regarding the FFM, eight of 11 hypotheses received support. In planned and exploratory\nanalyses, agreeableness and conscientiousness predicted endorsement of social distancing and hygiene. This agrees with the literature on these traits and health (Strickhouser et al., 2011), health behaviors (Roberts et al., 2005; Malouff et al., 2006), and non-respiratory infections (M\u00f5ttus et al., 2012). Neuroticism may play a small role in hygiene intent, whereas extraversion\u2019s negative links to social distancing and hygiene became nonsignificant after controlling for other traits. Consistent with the EPPM (Witte, 1992), conscientiousness and neuroticism interacted in predicting adaptive responses to the pandemic (perhaps by increasing susceptibility to PHMs). Somewhat consistent with prior research on work and school behavior, conscientiousness and agreeableness showed a trend toward a synergistic interaction.\nIf such findings replicate, future research should address mechanisms behind them. The\nempathic concern for others and flexibility in interpersonal behavior entailed in agreeableness (Graziano & Tobin, 2017), and the industrious self-efficacy and self-regulation involved in conscientiousness (Jackson & Roberts, 2017) may be candidate processes."}, {"heading": "Dark Personality", "text": "Regarding the triarchic model and the Dark Triad, nine of 12 hypotheses received\nsupport. In planned and exploratory analyses, meanness and disinhibition (and overall psychopathy) as well as Machiavellianism (less so) predicted lower intent for social distancing\nand hygiene. Together with boldness, the psychopathy traits predicted endorsement of risky, venturesome behavior under the pretend scenario that one is a disease carrier. This agrees with research on dark personality in relation to health risk, including risk of non-respiratory communicable disease (Hudek-Knezevic et al., 2007; Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2019).\nAs predicted, meanness and disinhibition (and overall psychopathy, but not boldness)\npredicted endorsement of knowing and possibly deliberate behavior that puts others at risk of infection. This corroborates the link between psychopathy and unethical everyday behavior (Benotsch et al., 2012; Pletti et al., 2017; Roeser et al., 2016). In exploratory analyses, disinhibition was implicated in all undesirable behaviors; meanness was particularly implicated in putting others at risk; whereas boldness may be linked to (desirable) intent for hygiene. This recalls prior research in non-forensic samples, whereby boldness either does not predict maladaptive outcomes or predicts adaptive ones (Berg et al., 2017; S\u00f6rman et al., 2016).\nDo similar mechanisms explain the links between the two sets of traits (maladaptive vs.\nadaptive) and health outcomes? The results for normal-range traits were not the inverse of the results for dark traits. Beyond this project\u2019s scope, the incremental validity of dark traits in predicting maladaptive, health risk behavior (over and above normal traits) merits further study."}, {"heading": "Public-health Message Appeal", "text": "Knowledge of the kind presented above becomes useful if it can inform public-health\ninterventions, e.g., to limit a pandemic. As noted earlier, personality theory\u2019s ability to inform the tailoring of effective communication is being tested in applied contexts. I tested whether personality predicted participant\u2019s ratings of differently phrased PHMs.\nThis was, indeed, the case, but not always in the predicted manner. Only eight of 17\npredictions received support. This may reflect methodological limitations. For example, it is not\nknown whether the PHMs were, however face-valid, congruent with the self-schemas they were meant to match. The findings may also mean schema-congruence theory cannot encompass selfreported traits and trait-congruent PHMs (York et al., 2012b).\nAgreeableness and conscientiousness did predict the appeal of the Compassionate PHM\n(\u201cHelp protect the vulnerable!\u201d), conscientiousness of the Responsible message (\u201cTake personal responsibility!\u201d), and neuroticism of the Avoidant message (\u201cAvoid the disease!\u201d). Psychopathy, meanness, and Machiavellianism did predict negatively the Compassionate message\u2019s appeal. However, such findings were largely message-nonspecific. Overall, adaptive traits predicted PHM\u2019s appeal, whereas maladaptive traits predicted their non-appeal.\nParticipants typically chose the Compassionate message over others (including the Self-\ncentered one: \u201cKeep yourself healthy!\u201d). This parallels experiments finding that appeals to altruism improve hygiene in analog (Betsch et al., 2013) and real-life (Grant & Hofmann, 2011) scenarios. Yet, ranking the Compassionate message as most effective was linked to lower meanness, disinhibition, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. Thus, altruism appeals may work for most people, but they might backfire in antagonistic individuals. This requires further study."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "The sample included participants from across the U.S. However, most represented were\nCalifornia (13%) and New York (6%), already heavily affected by the pandemic. In conjunction with the study\u2019s timing, self-selection into research on Covid-19, and the participants\u2019 relatively high education, the sample\u2019s composition may have affected the results. The most likely impact is range restriction of the health and risk behavior scores. Indeed, consistent with polls, most participants highly endorsed health-protective behaviors. Thus, I may have underestimated the true magnitude of the links between personality and health behavior, perhaps promoting false\nnegative results. This was countered by a respectably large sample. Future research, if using similar methods, may benefit from more sensitive rating scales to mitigate range restriction.\nScreening out noncompliant and suspicious responses likely increased measurement\nreliability, thus promoting power to obtain true positive results. Conversely, screening may have limited the range of irresponsible, disinhibited, antagonistic, and deceptive (i.e., psychopathic) traits in the dataset, making it harder to detect their links to other variables.\nThe self-report, cross-sectional, survey method using convenience sampling enabled\nrapid data during a historically unique moment. It also poses limitations, some of which were already noted. Besides age, gender, and health status, the study did not incorporate potentially relevant predictors or suppressors, such as Covid-19 knowledge accuracy, misinformation susceptibility, political affiliation (Allyn & Sprunt, 2020), and regional policies. Furthermore, the measures were acontextual vis-\u00e0-vis interpersonal factors like kinship, in-group/out-group membership, and situational factors that may interact with personality.\nConclusion\nThis is the first demonstration that personality theory may matter in understanding\ncommunicable respiratory disease. More generally, personality has implications for contagious diseases and public-health communication. The findings, if replicated, may find applications in public-health messaging, individual risk prediction, and doctor-patient communication.\nThe key results (e.g., about agreeableness, conscientiousness, meanness, and\ndisinhibition) do not mean that it is mostly irresponsible and inconsiderate people who spread viruses. The correlations I reported were mostly small, and the traits\u2019 scientific conceptualizations do not equate to popular judgments about character. The results do not mean\nthat people who contract a disease like Covid-19 have maladaptive traits. The findings do suggest that further research on personality in public health is likely to be productive.\nReferences\nAdams, L.M., Stuewig, J.B., Tangney, J.P. (2016).

In this particular context, people have been accused of being excessively pessimistic regarding the future consequences of this emerging health threat. However, consistent with previous research in social psychology, a large survey conducted in Europe in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic shows that the majority of respondents was actually overly optimistic about the risk of infection."}, {"heading": "A rational panic?", "text": "Human behaviours play a fundamental role in the propagation of many pathogens by either amplifying or attenuating their transmission through person-to-person contact1. From an epidemiological perspective, the massive adoption by the population of health protective behaviour, through improved personal hygiene or social distancing measures, is generally effective in reducing or slowing down the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases2. However, from a social and economic perspective, avoidance behaviours can also have dramatic side effects when they result in discrimination towards sub-groups of individuals or a shortage of basic necessities such as food or pharmaceutical products3. In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, the question as to whether the emergence of the coronavirus in China triggered a panic reaction, i.e. disproportionate public risk perceptions and emotion-driven behaviours with regard to the available epidemiological data, led to somewhat contradictory comments from famous experts. For instance, Dr. Michelle Dusart publicly decried the people\u2019s exaggerated fear and hysterical reaction to the risk of the coronavirus infection, while Prof. Didier Raoult and Prof. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, on the other hand, argued that it was rational for people to fear such an emerging health threat. Nevertheless, as mass media have the tendency to highlight aberrant behaviours, and as we know little to date about what people really think about the risk of coronavirus infection, it is not possible to determine whether they are overly optimistic or pessimistic about the future consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic for population health."}, {"heading": "The research survey", "text": "In late February 2020, prior to the Italian and French outbreak, an international research survey was conducted among large samples of citizens (N = 4,348) in four countries of the European Region (France, Italy, United Kingdom, and Switzerland) via a network for influenza surveillance4. Here, we examine public perceptions of risk of coronavirus infection by asking the participants to estimate on a discrete percentage scale, the probabilities for themselves and the general national population of getting the disease in the next few months. During the last decades, a great number of psychological studies have shown that risk perceptions are generally subject to an optimistic bias5,6. The optimistic bias tend\nharmful event), and the comparative risk judgments (most people think they are less likely to experience harmful event than the others). In the case of emerging infectious diseases, it is practically impossible to demonstrate that individual\u2019s optimistic or pessimistic expectations about the future are unrealistic, as we cannot know in advance what the final prevalence rates of infection will be in various populations. However, it is possible to rely on opinions made and released to the press by some famous experts in the field of epidemiology of infectious diseases, in order to determine whether the current expectations of the public and experts are congruent. For instance, based on (unpublished) simple epidemiological models using basic assumptions about the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, Prof. Marc Lipsitch or Prof. Gabriel Leung roughly estimated that more than 40% of the worldwide population could become infected in the coming year7."}, {"heading": "Evidence of unrealistic optimism", "text": "Figure 1 shows the distribution of the perceived risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for oneself and that for others on a discrete percentage scale. Consistent with previous research in social psychology8,9, people were found to estimate the coronavirus risk in an optimistically skewed manner. On the one hand, both the perceived risk of infection for oneself, as well as that for others, were substantially lower than expert\ncoronavirus infection would affect less than 1% of the national population. However, as reliable epidemiological predictions related to COVID-19 are not yet available at this stage, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that mean expectations made by the European populations are actually more pessimistic than optimistic. On the other hand, the comparison between perceived risk of infection for oneself and that for others shows that these two variables are significantly different (P < 0.001). Thus, approximately half the participants judged coronavirus infection less likely to happen to them than to other people, demonstrating strong evidence of \u201cunrealistic optimism\u201d in their personal expectations related to the COVID-19 epidemic, whereas only around 5% expressed the opposite comparative risk judgment. Moreover, as presented in Table 1, people showed different levels of optimism across countries and socio-demographic groups, with the French, female and less educated participants exhibiting a greater optimistic bias in their comparative risk judgments (P < 0.001).\nOverall, these empirical data suggest that most people in Europe were more subject to \u201cunrealistic\u201d optimism than an excessive pessimism concerning the risk of coronavirus infection. Of course, with the rapid spread of the disease in Europe, as well as potential developments in the biomedical sciences (such as the identification of an effective and affordable treatment against SARS-CoV-2), we could not expect to find the same pattern of risk perceptions and epidemiological predictions in the coming weeks10. However, the use of similar questions in future international surveys would make it possible to monitor the change in risk perceptions and health behaviours over time. This might provide us a valuable empirical material to understand and predict better the complex interplay between public risk perceptions, emotion-driven protective behaviours and key epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission and fatality rates of COVID-19."}]}, {"paper_id": "o1obo", "claim2": "For Americans who scored higher on the Perceived Infectability subscale, they were more likely to endorse travel bans on people coming from China and all of Asia.", "claim3a": "PVD (Perceived Vulnerability to Disease) predicts support for travel bans in response to the coronavirus outbreak among people in the United States.", "claim3b": "regressions with Perceived Infectability (PVD) and Germ Aversion as simultaneous predictors and the three travel ban items (\u201cWuhan\u201d, \u201cChina\u201d, \u201cAsia\u201d) as separate dependent variables.", "claim4": "Perceived Infectability significantly predicted support for travel bans on Asia.

This research examines chronic concerns about infectious diseases (using the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease questionnaire) and travel ban supports in response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak in January 2020. Two studies were conducted in the United States (Study 1; N = 241) and Singapore (Study 2; N = 138). For Americans who scored higher on the Perceived Infectability subscale, they were more likely to endorse travel bans on people coming from China and all of Asia. For Singaporeans who reported greater Germ Aversion, they were more supportive of travel bans on people from both China and their Malaysian neighbor. Saliency of the outbreak may account for differences in subscale predictors between Americans and Singaporeans.\nThroughout history, diseases have universally threatened the survival of human beings\n(Ackerman, Hill, & Murray, 2018; Schaller & Park, 2011). In response to such threat, humans engage in behavioral responses to avoid contact with pathogens to ensure survival such as lowering their sociability and movement at the interpersonal level (Mortensen, Becker, Ackerman, Neuberg, & Kendrick, 2010). At the intergroup level, pathogen threat triggers ethnocentrism to defend against outgroups (Faulkner, Schaller, Park, & Duncan, 2004; Green et al., 2010). Those who are more chronically concerned about the threat of diseases are more likely to engage in such adaptive behaviors or attitudes when diseases are particularly salient such as an outbreak (Green et al., 2010; Inbar, Westgate, Pizarro, & Nosek, 2016). At the current moment of this writing, the World Health Organization (WHO; 2020) had declared a 2019-nCoV coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, as a global health emergency. This naturally salient threat may trigger certain responses to protect one\u2019s survival and health. This research examines how chronic sensitivities to diseases predict supports for restrictive travel bans in light of the outbreak among people in the United States and Singapore. Behavioral Immune System\nHumans adapted a \u201cbehavioral\u201d immune system that complements the biological immune\nsystem, and it acts as a precautionary measure to prevent infection (Schaller & Park, 2011). When diseases are made salient (via images of diseases, odor, proximity to ostensibly sick individuals, etc.), people become more introverted and less sociable (Mortensen et al., 2010). Similarly, people who live in (historically) pathogen-rich environments also exhibit low levels of sociability (Schaller & Murray, 2008). This system minimizes likelihood of being infected by\ndiseases as measured using the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease questionnaire (PVD; Duncan, Schaller, & Park, 2009; Faulkner et al., 2004). For these individuals, avoidance or exclusion of an entire outgroup or country can be seen as beneficially outweighing the cost of infections."}, {"heading": "Current Research", "text": "This research examines how PVD predicts support for travel bans in response to the\ncoronavirus outbreak among people in the United States (Study 1) and Singapore (Study 2). Both studies were conducted approximately 1 or 2 days after the coronavirus reached the respective countries, providing a unique context to understand how the behavioral immune system responds to a contextually salient pathogen threat. For people in both countries, greater PVD (specifically the Germ Aversion subscale) should predict more restrictive travel ban supports on travelers coming from Wuhan specifically and China broadly. Furthermore, this should extend even to travelers from a whole continent (Study 1) or a neighboring country (Study 2).

Although I did not make specific prediction\ncontext (Green et al., 2010; Wang, Michalak, & Ackerman, 2018).\nParticipants and procedure. Pre-registration goal was set at 250 participants, which\nwould provide 80% power to detect r = .18 (two-tailed, alpha = 05) and provide a stable estimate of correlation (Sch\u00f6nbrodt & Perugini, 2013). A total of 277 MTurk workers participated, but 36 participants did not pass an attention check and/or reported that they randomly responded to questions. After exclusion, 241 participants (40.2% women; M age = 35.44) remained.\nParticipants first read a description of the outbreak adapted from various news outlets: \u201cAn outbreak of a new virus has infected more than 570 people and killed at least 17 people, mostly in China and parts of Asia. The virus is also known as the Wuhan virus, named after the city of Wuhan, China where the outbreak began. The virus is from the same family as the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS.\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials announced Tuesday\nJanuary 21, 2020 that the United States has its first confirmed case of the coronavirus in Washington state.\nSymptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\u201d\nParticipants indicated if they have heard of the virus or not (51.5% yes, 12.9% unsure/\nmaybe, 35.7% no). Two open-ended questions followed on how participants felt and what they thought the US government should do about this situation. Afterwards, participants indicated their support for travel bans and completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale.\nSupport for travel bans. Participants rated their support for travel bans on three items (1\n= strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree): \u201cThe US government should impose a travel ban to\nreliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .87); they were averaged to form an index of travel ban support.\nPerceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD). PVD measures individual differences in\npeople\u2019s chronic concern over infectious diseases (Duncan et al., 2009). It is divided into two subscales of Perceived Infectability (7 items; \u03b1 = .82) and Germ Aversion (8 items; \u03b1 = .73), using a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree).\nPerceived Infectability measures individuals\u2019 perceptions of their own susceptibility to\ninfectious diseases. Example items of Perceived Infectability include \u201cIn general, I am very susceptible to colds, flu, and other infectious diseases\u201d and \u201cIf an illness is \u2018going around,\u2019 I will get it.\u201d Germ Aversion measures discomfort and fear of contexts in which disease transmissions are particularly likely. Examples of Germ Aversion are \u201cI am comfortable sharing a water bottle with a friend\u201d and \u201cI prefer to wash my hands pretty soon after shaking someone\u2019s hand.\u201d While the two subscales are correlated, Perceived Infectability captures beliefs about likelihood of being infected in the future as well as threat to the self but Germ Aversion captures immediate affective responses to pathogen-salient contexts (Duncan et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2018).\nTwo items from the Germ Aversion subscale were modified from the original scale to be\nmore reflective of current culture. One item was changed from \u201cI avoid using public telephones because of the risk that I may catch something from the previous user\u201d to \u201cI avoid using public bathrooms.\u201d Another item was modified from \u201cMy hands do not feel dirty after touching money\u201d to \u201cMy hands do not feel dirty after touching door handles.\u201d These items were modified because public telephones and cash are less commonly used nowadays.\nMeasures\nStudy 1 M (SD)\nStudy 2 M (SD)\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n1.

The averaged index of travel ban support was included as an exploratory dependent variable. See\nTable 1 for descriptive statistics and correlations. Primary analyses. As shown in Table 2, Perceived Infectability significantly predicted supports for travel bans for all items. Germ Aversion, however, was a weaker predictor. Germ Aversion did not significantly predict support for travel bans on China but it did significantly predict support for travel bans on Wuhan, Asia, and in general using the averaged index. This suggests that people who perceived themselves as more susceptible to infectious diseases are more supportive of restrictive immigration policies that would ban people from an entire continent in order to protect themselves against a current outbreak.\nvs. unaware of the virus. Participants were grouped into those who indicated awareness of the virus (n = 124) and those who were unsure or unaware (n = 117). The averaged index of travel bans support was used as the dependent variable.\nAmong those who were unsure or unaware of the virus, Perceived Infectability\nsignificantly predicted support for travel bans (standardized \u03b2 = .45, p < .001) but Germ Aversion did not (\u03b2 = .06, p = .470). Among those who were aware of the virus, both Perceived Infectability (\u03b2 = .23, p = .011) and Germ Aversion (\u03b2 = .18, p = .042) predicted travel ban support. Interestingly, Perceived Infectability was a stronger predictor when participants were unaware relative to aware of the virus, but Germ Aversion showed the reverse pattern (albeit weakly). This suggests that Perceived Infectability may be a stronger predictor when pathogen threat is more distal.\nStudy 2"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Study 2 sought to replicate the findings in another geographic context: Singapore.

With 138 participants, r = .24 could be detected with 80% power (two-tailed, alpha = 0.5).\nAll participants read a similar description of the coronavirus outbreak as Study 1, with\nslight alteration to fit the Singaporean context:\n\u201cAn outbreak of a new virus has infected more than 570 people and killed at least 17 people, mostly in China and parts of Asia. The virus is also known as the Wuhan virus, named after the city of Wuhan, China where the outbreak began. The virus is from the same family as the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS.\nOn Thursday 23 January, 2020, Singapore announced it has its first confirmed\ncase of the coronavirus.\nSymptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\u201d\nto prevent travelers from [Wuhan, China/ any parts of China/ Malaysia] from entering Singapore.\u201d The three items correlated strongly with one another (see Table 1) and showed good internal reliability (\u03b1 = .80); they were averaged to form a singular index.\nPVD. Perceived Infectability (\u03b1 = .87) and Germ Aversion (\u03b1 = .73) were measured on 7-\npoint scales (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "As shown in Table 2, Germ Aversion emerged as the sole significant predictor of all\ndependent variables. Germ Aversion predicted more restrictive policy, extending beyond China to Singapore\u2019s neighboring country of Malaysia. Contrary to Study 1 and pre-registration, Perceived Infectability was not a significant predictor among the Singaporean sample.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe 2019-nCoV coronavirus outbreak ignited a global panic at the onset of 2020. Within\na week after Study 2 was run, Singapore declared a travel ban that prevented people with recent travels in any part of China from entering the country (Johnson, 2020). Although such restrictions may seem reasonable given the spread of the outbreak throughout China, Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that such fear could generalize beyond the infected country. Americans with greater perceived susceptibility to infections were more willing to ban travelers from an entire continent. For more germ-averse Singaporeans, they would be willing to extend the ban to their Malaysian neighbor with whom they share important natural resources.\nStudies 1 and 2 diverged in their predictors. In Study 1, Perceived Infectability was more\npredictive of travel ban supports whereas Germ Aversion was more predictive in Study 2. One\nproximity with China made Singapore a more vulnerable target than the United States. As such, Germ Aversion may be a stronger predictor among Singaporeans because it is more contextually salient and a more immediate threat. Exploratory analyses in Study 1 further showed that Perceived Infectability is more predictive among those who were unaware of the virus, suggesting that it is a stronger predictor when pathogen threat is not seen as an immediate environmental threat (Wang et al., 2018).\nThis research provides a unique snapshot into individual differences in response to a\nnaturally occurring pathogen threat within two countries. An outbreak such as this may threaten not only the health of a country\u2019s citizens but also jeopardizes its relations with other countries.\nconcerns and future directions.

However, the relationship between emotions, empathy, and prosocial behaviour is unknown. It is said that empathy is affected by moods and influences pro-sociality. Thus, how does an emergency change people\u2019s empathy and prosocial willingness? We\nconducted a study with 1,190 participants before (N=520) and after (N=570) the coronavirus outbreak. We found that prosocial willingness decreased post-outbreak, maybe by the decreased empathy levels, in accordance with compassion fatigue theory. Trait empathy could affect prosocial willingness indirectly through the empathy level. News discriminability and distance from the outbreak epicentre played a role in the trait empathy change. Given how emergency health events influence emotion and the effects of personal traits on prosocial willingness, social media users and providers should understand the negative effects of information over-exposure on mental health during the outbreak.\nThe impact of the current global health emergency, termed COVID-19 by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO), has significantly changed people's lives worldwide, casting a shadow over the mind of an enormous population. The world is fighting a war against the new universal \u2018enemy\u2019. Compared to the outbreak of the SARS 17 years ago, more transparent and timely information is available, partially due to more advanced and diverse information platforms. Although clarity and immediacy guaranteed the right to be informed, people are bombarded by various information and their moods enter a cycle of complexity1, especially when effects can be broad, substantial, and long-lasting2.\nEncouraging slogan and unequivocal instruction can stabilize mood, while aversive news\ninduces emotional responses to pain in others such as sadness and anxiety3. For example, when we see the pain or even death of a patient and the desperation of the health care workers, a heart-breaking feeling hits us and tears well up. The capacity associated with feeling and evaluating the pain level of other as well as further understanding others is specifically referred to as pain empathy4, which is a fundamental feature of our innate capacity for empathy5. Empathy is considered to be a developmental social function that helps individuals to understand others\u2019 emotions or mental states6.\nTwo components in the psychological structure of empathy have been proposed:\nempathetic concern (also known as trait empathy) and perspective-taking (also known as cognitive empathy)7. This division of empathy shows particular functions of empathy: cognitive empathy describes how people recognize others\u2019 emotions and understand their perspectives, while affective empathy refers to the autonomic and vicarious emotional responses to others\u2019 emotions8,9. Watching others\u2019 pain experiences may activate one\u2019s own sensory region of the brain10 as if it were a personal experience. A theoretical \u2018pain matrix\u2019 specifically describes the sensory and affective qualities of pain empathy11. It is said that people activate the \u2018pain matrix\u2019 networks when feeling self-pain; interestingly, the same neural network will also be activated when they observe and feel others\u2019 pain11. However, prior work\nexamined the shared and unique networks for sensory and affective pain and the possibility that when empathy occurs, the \u2018pain matrix\u2019 is partially activated, specifically, only the affection related components mediate empathy12. In essence, EEG and fMRI studies on pain empathy have reached an explanation that a mirror neuron system may be the physiological basis of empathy5.\nFor decades, research on empathy has mainly focused on empathy for negative events,\nsuch as physical pain4,5,13 or social pain14, resulting from the idea that empathy is a potential motivator for prosocial behaviours. From rescuing behaviour in ants15 to the feeding each other in bats, prosocial behaviour is observed throughout the non-human species16. In a graylag geese flock, an increase in heartrate (considered as distress levels) has been detected when they observe a conflict involving close kin, consistent with an empathic response17. Decety (2016) emphasized the mediation effect of empathy on pro-sociality in conspecifics, when one is sensitive to others\u2019 stress and well-being. A growing body of research has indicated that a spontaneous motivation to alleviate the pain of others is generated from empathy when people feel others\u2019 suffering19,20. Besides, the implementation of altruistic behaviour to a certain extent relieves negative feelings12, or even physical pain on oneself 21.\nAlthough empathy is an aspect of social responsiveness, which is conducive to many\naspects, it is very energy-consuming and compassion fatigue happens when one\u2019s empathy reaches its limit22. Compassion fatigue is defined as the stress and breakdown caused by a short-term, intense exposure to an unfortunate situation, as well as the numbness and depression caused by prolonged exposure23. Due to massive news updating, heavy exposure to victims\u2019 pain is a serious problem not only for those who provide care and services, but for average individuals as well24. Hence, in the context of this global public health emergency, it is crucial to understand how this outbreak would influence people\u2019s empathy and whether empathy could still drive prosocial behaviour, especially considering that altruistic behaviours can facilitate human sharing and cooperation and enable group members to collectively survive\nvarious crises, such as food shortages and natural disasters25.\nRegarding understanding of the effects of a socially traumatic event, the ripple effect\nsuggests that the impact of an unfortunate event decays gradually as ripples spread outward from the epicentre26. In contrast to the ripple effect, Li et al. (2009) proposed a counterintuitive model\u2014the \u2018Psychological Typhoon Eye\u2019 effect (PTE) \u2014which describes a psychological phenomenon observed during China\u2019s Wenchuan earthquake, in which the closer one is to the epicentre of a devastated area, the lower a resident's concern/anxiety about health and safety. These two models indicate that the distance from the disease epicentre should play a role in human emotions and cast doubts regarding the influencing direction (i.e. facilitating or decreasing concern/anxiety levels along with further distance in the current context of the coronavirus). It has been found that negative mood harms empathy, as someone experiencing negative mood might be less empathic and motivated to help a suffering person than someone experiencing positive mood (Li, Meng, Li, Yang, & Yuan, 2017). Therefore, it is likely that the anxiety generated by this outbreak may impair empathy and prosocial behaviour, and distance could change this effect to some extent.\nGiven the importance of empathy and prosocial behaviour for collaboration during a crisis,\nit is crucial to assess the relationship between empathy level and prosocial willingness. Moreover, exposure to adverse life events typically predicts negative outcomes, and it is unknown how the current aversive events may foster subsequent emotional responses and changes in empathy and pro-sociality. Despite its significance, there is a relative lack of empirical and theoretical work linking event outbreak, empathy, and prosocial tendencies. To address these issues, participants in the present study were presented with 12 video clips which displayed either real or faked expressions of pain (see Methods) before and during the coronavirus outbreak. We recorded a total of 1,190 (N = 520 in the first dataset, N = 570 in the second dataset, details in Table 1) participant pain ratings of the performer in each clip as well as participants\u2019 empathy levels, vicarious experiences, and the degree to which they would like\nto share the pain with the performer as an indicator of prosocial willingness (Figure 2, Figure S2). Additionally, Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) scores were collected to investigate the potential effects of trait empathy and distance from the disease epicentre (i.e. Wuhan, China), and anxiety levels were also collected to investigate potential modulation effects on empathy and prosocial behaviours. For more information about people\u2019s understanding of COVID-19, we also included an 18-item COVID-19 relevant questionnaire to investigate certain relationships related to how people\u2019s information load affects their pain empathy (see supplemental materials).\nFig.1| Online data components\nIn light of previous literature on pro-sociality, during a life-threatening period, people may\nincrease their avoidance of social interactions for the sake of survival27. However, from an evolutionary perspective, altruistic behaviours would be selected to facilitate cooperation and enable group members to collectively survive various crises, such as food shortages and natural disasters25. Further, the impact of quarantines strongly influences approach motives2. It is also well-established that empathy drives prosocial behaviour28,29, and people are now immersed in emergency-related information that can lead to compassion fatigue. Therefore, rather than promoting prosocial tendencies, we assumed that as the COVID-19 and news reports increase, empathy-induced prosocial tendencies (pain-sharing willingness) would decrease during the outbreak, and this prosocial tendency shift would be most strongly evidenced by empathy\nlevels (pain ratings of the performer) decreasing in our online task.\nFurthermore, we considered that trait empathy would affect pro-sociality, and it could\nestablish a certain correlation with empathy levels in our task. During the epidemic time, we were interested in more possible impactors. Repeated exposure to news coverage of negative events has been linked to poor mental health outcomes30. Thus, in the current situation, people most likely keep experiencing overexposure to various information, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period31, which particularly changes their state of mind32, and further influences empathy. Finally, it is possible that outbreak-generated anxiety may influence empathy and prosocial behaviour in terms of distance, according to the PTE.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Participants\u2019 age and gender", "text": "Firstly, we summarized the participants distribution regarding age and gender. The results\nshowed that in dataset1 (pre-outbreak) and dataset2 (post-outbreak), the groups were unevenly distributed in terms of age, t(1088)=6.64, P<0.001 and gender, \u03c72=14.89, P<0.001. Hence, age and gender were included as covariates in the following analysis to control for the mixed effect and the questionnaire results (Table S1). Video authenticity judgment significantly affected perceived pain in others (i.e. empathy level), self-pain (vicarious experience), and shared pain (i.e. prosocial willingness, supplementary Table 1). Therefore, it was controlled in the further model analysis as a possible confounding variable. Empathy levels and prosocial willingness pre- and post-outbreak\nTo determine the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on empathy and prosocial behaviour,\nt-tests were conducted to compare the differences in perceived pain in others (i.e. empathy level) and shared pain (prosocial willingness) between pre- and post-outbreak. The results showed both empathy levels (pre: M=3.89, SD=1.55; post: M=3.60, SD=1.53; t=4.27 , P<0.001) and prosocial willingness (pre: M=3.73, SD=1.67; post: M=3.50, SD=1.63; t=3.16 , P<0.01) significantly decreased during the outbreak (Fig. 2).\nTrait empathy pre- and post-outbreak\nSince we were interested in the potential influence of the epidemic disease on trait\nempathy, a t-test was also conducted on IRI subscales, including perspective-taking, triat empathy, personal distress, and fantasy. The results showed that when the outbreak occurred, a negative fluctuation was witnessed in the individuals\u2019 empathy-related traits (Fig. 2). Except for personal distress (pre: M=23.53, SD=4.07; post: M= 4.14, SD= 3.50; t=-2.62, P<0.01) and fantasy (pre: M=24.54, SD=4.68; post: M=23.98, SD=4.49; t=2.03 , P<0.05), all other IRI subscale scores were significantly decreased in the post-outbreak: trait empathy (pre: M=25.05, SD=3.50; post: M=24.56, SD=3.03; t=2.48, P<0.05) , and perspective taking (pre: M=24.14, SD=2.97; post: M=23.43, SD=4.06; t=5.71 , P<0.001). However, the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) seems to be stable in the two stages (pre: M=23.47 SD=3.27; post: M=23.52, SD=2.86; t=-0.27, P=0.79). The aforementioned results showed that empathy levels, trait empathy, perspective-taking, fantasy, and prosocial willingness decreased during the coronavirus outbreak. Simple mediation models\nWe further investigated whether empathy level would mediate the relationship between\nindividual differences in trait empathy and prosocial willingness by establishing three mediation models with trait empathy (empathy, perspective-taking, and fantasy) as the respective predictor, empathy level as a mediator, and prosocial willingness as the dependent variable. Data were standardized in the analysis of the moderation and mediation models and we used PROCESS in SPSS for the mediation and moderation analysis33.\nThe results showed a significant mediating model for trait empathy and perspective-taking,\nbut not for fantasy. Trait empathy positively predicted prosocial willingness (\u03b2=0.052, t(2095)=3.16, P=0.0016; path C\u2019) and empathy level in a positive manner (\u03b2=0.057, t(2098)=3.49, P< 0.001; path A). Furthermore, empathy level robustly predicted prosocial willingness (\u03b2=0.70, t(2095)=21.97, P<0.001; path B) (Fig. 3).\nPerspective taking significantly positively predicted prosocial willingness (\u03b2=0.096,\nt(2095)=5.85, P<0.001; path C\u2019), and empathy level as well (\u03b2=0.043, t(2098)=2.64, P=0.008; path A). Similarly, perspective taking significantly predicted prosocial willingness (\u03b2=0.62, t(2095)=22.07, P<0.001; path B) (Fig. 3).\nFinally, the same model was not proved valid for fantasy. Fantasy did not predict empathy\nlevel (\u03b2=0.03, t(2098)=1.96, P=0.05; path A); although, empathy level robustly predicted prosocial willingness (\u03b2=0.62, t(2095)=21.98, P<0.001; path B). In addition, fantasy did not predict prosocial willingness (\u03b2=0.01, t(2095)=0.69, P=0.49; path C\u2019).\nOur results indicated that empathy level could only mediate the predictive relationship\nfrom empathy and perspective taking to prosocial willingness, but not from fantasy. We further included a binary variable of time (pre- and post-outbreak) as a moderator to test whether the coronavirus would have a moderating effect (model 14 in PROCESS). These results showed that the moderating effect happened on an empathy level predicting prosocial willingness (\u03b2=-\n0.083, P = 0.012 < 0.05, 95% CI: [-0.15,-0.02], path B), suggesting that the predictive extent from empathy to prosocial behaviour decreased after the coronavirus outbreak (Fig. S5). Distance from the outbreak epicentre\nTo test the cognitive empathy-driven prosocial behaviour changes in terms of distance\nunder the emergency according to the PTE, a moderation model (model 1 in PROCESS) was used. The variable \u2018distance to Wuhan\u2019 is a binary value (near/far) separated by the mean of the distance calculated by the IP address (see supplementary Methods). There was no evidence that distance influenced how empathy level correlated with prosocial willingness (Fig. S5). Anxiety\nWe then investigated the effect of anxiety on this process, considering that anxiety would\nhave a negative influence on empathy and prosocial behaviours. To investigate this possibility, we established a serial two-part mediation model (model 6 in the PROCESS). The results showed that anxiety could influence prosocial willingness through trait empathy and empathy\nlevel (Fig. 4). Regarding the current mental state development, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate post-outbreak anxiety levels (Table 1), along with some direct questions about how people felt during the outbreak in terms of anxiety, depression, and fear (see more in supplementary material). Although state anxiety did not directly predict prosocial willingness, this pattern could be explained by suppressing effect34 (\u03b2=0.096, t(2095)=5.85, P<0.001; path C\u2019).\nFinally, we explored the effect of distance according to the PTE. We calculated each\nparticipant\u2019s distance to the disease epicentre, which was based on IP address (near and far) by the mean of the distance (see supplementary Methods). The interaction of state anxiety and distance to Wuhan was significant (\u03b2=0.17, P=0.007). In the post-outbreak stage, compared to\npeople near the outbreak epicentre, the state anxiety of people in the far region did not sensitively predict trait empathy (Fig. S10). Therefore, we continued to analyse the possibility that distance could play a role in the serial mediation chain. Our result indicated that distance moderated the influence that state anxiety has on trait empathy and further affected prosocial willingness (Fig. 4).\nFig.2| Changes from pre- to post-outbreak\nFig.3| Simple mediation models a, Time functioned as a moderator in the path B (empathy level to prosocial\nwillingness) (pre: 95% CI = [1.5%,5.6%], 44.12% mediated; post: 95% CI = [1.2%, 4.8%], 38.88% mediated). b,\ntime still had moderating effect in the path B (pre, 95% CI = [0.6%, 4.6%], 22.08% mediated; post, 95% CI =\n[0.5%, 4.1%], 19.00% mediated).\nFig.4| A serial two-part mediation model (post-outbreak).

The interaction between distance to Wuhan and state anxiety was\nsignificant, \u03b2 = 0.17, t(1117) = 2.74, P < 0.01, which suggested there was a moderating effect of distance in the serial two-part mediation model.

State anxiety in this model predicted empathy (\u03b2=-0.17, t(1119)=-5.62, P<0.001). News discriminability did not significantly predict trait empathy (t(1119)=0.02, P=0.98). The more anxious people felt, the less empathy they displayed. The interaction of news discriminability and state anxiety was significant (\u03b2=-0.07, t(1119)=-2.38, P=0.02). In the post-outbreak period, people became confused about overwhelming news which imposed a bad influence on trait empathy."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The salient coronavirus threat may trigger government intervention and certain\npsychological responses to public health problems. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of an emerging infectious outbreak on people\u2019s empathy levels and prosocial willingness and further explore the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between these variables. Importantly, our study provides several moderation and mediation models to examine the effects of empathy on prosocial behaviour before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We explored the influence of other potential impactors like emotional states, particularly anxiety. Furthermore, the PTE effect was also tested under the infectious health emergency instead of geographical disasters as usual.\nIn line with previous studies, we found a significant empathy-driven prosocial\ndisposition14,19,21. From the evolutionary perspective, when people find others at a disadvantage such as physical pain and mental setback experiences, a motivation to help is generated for both individual and collective benefit35. People with more empathy tend to do more altruistic helping behaviours for others\u2019 wellbeing. In other words, as our results suggested, the willingness to behave pro-socially would decrease as empathy levels (feeling other\u2019s pain) decrease in the post-outbreak period. Moreover, we found trait empathy could influence sharing tendencies, which were mediated by the fundamental perception of others\u2019 pain. In terms of emotional state, our data indicated the salience of trait empathy was markedly inhibited by\nanxiety level, variations in distance difference (near and far regions), and different news authenticity discriminability.\n\u2018Collateral damage from trauma\u2019, that is, those who do not experience misfortune\ndirectly, can also create a similar psychological impact when witnessing others\u2019 pain experience 36. Staub and Vollhardt (2008) put forward the \u2018suffering altruism\u2019 (altruism born of suffering) concept for the sake of development38. Previous study investigated the explanation of the \u2018suffering altruism\u2019 found out people may gain more social support and thus generate a sense of gratitude that enhances prosocial inclination39. Nevertheless, instead of enhancing the possibility of benevolence under the current situation, less kindness was observed in the present study. First of all, the overall feeling of others\u2019 pain significantly decreased after the outbreak. Emotion contagion as the primary stage of empathy, is widely seen in daily life, for example, yawning, tickling, and feeling distress, which represents certain sensitivity to what others are experiencing40. Our results also showed a decreasing tendency of perspective taking ability in the post-outbreak that people less stood the perspective of others to feel others\u2019 pain feelings during the outbreak period. Considering the possible large energy costs associated with empathy, empathy is never easy, and requires the involvement of emotional and cognitive aspects41. This may explain why empathy avoidance may be a preferable choice as people only have limited one\u2019s inner resources.\nAdditionally, individual differences in trait empathy exist, which largely influences\nbehaviour tendency18. In this study, trait empathy was measured by the IRI, which is considered a valid instrument to assess people\u2019s ability to empathize. Besides, in accordance to previous studies, we considered the \u2018feeling of others\u2019 pain\u2019 ratings as indicators of empathy levels4,5,13. Our findings indicated that empathy level was significantly predicted by the trait empathy, suggesting an effective induction of empathy in the study. We were primarily concerned with how trait empathy affected prosocial behaviour and the role of empathy level in the process. As expected, a robust mediation effect was established when the effect of COVID-19\n(comparison between two-time stages) was taken into account. We found that trait empathy could predict prosocial willingness directly, but also indirectly through empathy level, which varied in pre- and post-timepoint. Perspective taking, the critical part of cognitive empathy, had similar mediating effects, referring to some extent to the theory of mind: an important aspect of empathy is the ability to put oneself in other people's shoes42.\nAlthough emotional contagion of pain feeling weakened during the outbreak, other types\nof emotion were widely spreading. Disaster makes people over-stressed and anxious, even leading to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder years after the event24. Moreover, negative mood such as anxious feeling, inhibits the neural underpinnings (i.e. mirror neuron system) of empathy36. As for emotional states, we further explored how they are affected by anxiety. We found that people who currently felt anxious (state anxiety) and more confused about the authenticity of the news showed a lower level of empathy. It is worth noting that state anxiety, in addition to being directly predictive of trait empathy, can also be moderated by information uncertainty. Understandably, when one\u2019s own survival is at stake, one can no longer provide help or emotional support to others. Besides, other than the direct predictive effect, state anxiety also predicted trait empathy in terms of distance to the outbreak epicentre. Contrary to our hypothesis according to the PTE, an infectious pandemic disease indeed frustrated people near the epicentre more than people in regions farther away. Nevertheless, the moderation analysis indicated that distance predicted trait empathy post-outbreak. Unfortunately, as our results suggested, we did not learn that people far from the outbreak epicentre show different prosocial inclinations from the near population, even though they had the same empathy level. As the COVID-19 questions in dataset 2 (post-outbreak) suggested, people in the near region reported patients to receive more stigmatization and rejection from others. Stigma from others was a major theme throughout the literature43,44, and it may be a long-lasting issue, even after the outbreak is under control. Therefore, compared to the far distance regions, people may experience a heavier burden of psychological stress in the near\ndistance region. In terms of the effects that anxiety imposed on empathy during the outbreak, the direction was inverse to what is suggested by the PTE or ripple effect. The trait empathy in people near the epicentre declined faster as state anxiety grew, while in people outside the epicentre trait empathy did not change significantly when personal anxiety increased.\nWhenever a major event occurs, all kinds of information can be mixed, especially novel,\neye-catching information with some degree of uncertainty. Admittedly, the nature of the media will make this type of information get more attention in more exaggerated ways1, and the news is still controlling our knowledge of the situation. It's always about breaking down the audience's defences and making every disaster feel worse than it is45. When watching a lot of news regarding topics such as disasters, illness, and homelessness, people experience symptoms similar to compassion fatigue, such as depression and anxiety to varying degrees46. Under the current barrage of information, we also verified compassion fatigue in our study, protecting people from burnout47. If empathy and compassion produce motivation, but there is no practical way of action, people will inevitably feel more anxious and miserable, which will further influence pro-sociality48. At a time when compassion fatigue is emerging, we may need to re-examine our psychological capacity and the environment around us. We have been amazed at how much technology has changed and connected us; however, in this rapidly changing world, there is only so much each of us can do. Instead of soaking oneself in the deluge of online emotions, one should need proper ways to do with compassion and empathy. Additionally, it is important to distract oneself from the anxiety-provoking pictures and headlines, and not simply retweet emotion-laden tweets (good or bad), but instead truly communicate, discuss, and analyse with others.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, data were obtained by self-report from a\nsample that was not fully randomly distribute. Second, the participants were in isolation period during the second assessment. Third, we could not formally evaluate the specific psychometric properties of our questionnaire on the psychological effects of COVID-19. Fourth, due to the\nanonymous nature of the data collection, we could not pair individuals at the two-time intervals. Fifth, using a dichotomous distance variable, the possible influence of a continuous geographical position was not explored. Sixth, even though a large sample was used in the study, the difference in IRI subscales between the two periods might have been caused by the unpaired sample that was actually systematically different. Besides, the slightly difference components of the data made it difficult to further examine the contrast between the two time stages.\nTo some extent, this study explains how individuals\u2019 prosocial willingness changed pre-\nand post- outbreak. The study provides a new perspective on how trait empathy can decrease pro-sociality behaviours. Empathy allows us to engage in more prosocial behaviours. However, being over-exposed to information generates anxiety, which dampens our prosocial motivation. Caring for disadvantaged people is conducive to resolving social contradictions, manifesting morality, easing conflict situations, and promoting harmonious social development14. As the basis of human social cooperation and progress, prosocial behaviour needs to be promoted and practiced in an organized way as a highlight point in psychological health education.\nWe all want to be kind-hearted people during a crisis; however, indifference is often\nproduced by news reports. As an energy-consuming ability, our care workers are especially experiencing the overconsumption of their own empathy and feeling much more stressed because of close contact with patients\u2019 death over and over24. Thus, mental health services should be readily available for certain medical care workers worldwide.\nTo sum up, we aimed to investigate the effect of being chronically worried about the threat\nof diseases on engagement in trait empathy, adaptive empathy, or prosocial behavioural\ntendency, especially when diseases are particularly salient such as an outbreak. The\npreconditions for intervention lay on the knowledge of changes in psychological states and the\npotential mechanisms. For example, it is necessary to raise awareness about the potential\ndamage to mental health that over-exposure to information during the outbreak can cause. Thus,\nit is important to distract oneself from the anxiety-provoking pictures and headlines. Future interventions to help people manage their emotions during public health crises are worthy of attention.\nMethods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The first dataset (539 participants, 274 females, Mage = 28.43, SD = 7.84) was collected\nbefore the emerging infectious disease outbreak of COVID-19 (2019.11.21~2019.11.23), while the second dataset (570 participants, 366 females, Mage = 25.08, SD = 8.75) was collected during the peak period of public concern about COVID-19 (2020.2.23~2020.2.24). We distributed the task and questionnaires on an online platform. As Table 1 shows, in pre- and post-outbreak, the groups were unevenly distributed in terms of age (t(1088)=6.64, P<0.001) and gender (\u03c72=14.89, P<0.001). Hence, when we compared the response variables cross the timepoint, we controlled for age and gender as possible confounding variables. Stimuli\nThe stimuli consisted of 12 video clips portraying actors telling either the truth or lies\nabout the pain induced by electric shocks. Twelve participants in Beijing (six females and six males, Mage = 22.4) were recruited as actors for video recording. All actors were asked to either express their true feelings about pain (electric shock pain) or lie when they were not really experiencing pain.\nIn the real pain scenario (i.e. telling the truth about their pain), participants were asked to\nexpress and describe their genuine feelings of pain evoked by the electric shock induction approach. The electric shock approach is a commonly used pain induction method, in which an electric shock is delivered to the participants fingers.\nIn the fake pain scenario (i.e. lying about the pain), the participants were asked to pretend\nto have been shocked and to describe those fake feelings. The actors in the fake pain scenario had been sitting in the room and watched videos of people getting electric shocks, but they\nwere not shocked personally. The research paradigm was approved by the China Academy of Science ethics committee, and all performers in the video recording gave informed consent to participate in the study. Online study task\nFigure 1 illustrates the present study components in both the first and second online study\ntasks. Video rating task\nTwelve video clips (six genuine pain and six vicarious pain) were presented to the\nparticipants in randomized order. After each video clip played, the participants judged whether the actors actually received electric shocks (choose \u20181\u2019 if it is true, choose \u20182\u2019 if it is not). Then, the participants were asked to rate (choose form \u20181\u2019 = \u2018None\u2019 to \u20187\u2019 = \u2018very much\u2019 ) \u2018how much pain do you think the person felt?\u2019 , followed by \u2018how much pain you feel when you are watching this video clip?\u2019, and \u2018how much would you like to decrease the pain of this person?' There was no time limit to provide feedback, and the next video was played after all the ratings were completed. After watching and rating all 12 videos, participants completed a questionnaire. Questionnaires\nThe participants completed the IRI questionnaire at the end of the online task. The IRI is\na widely used scale to measure individual differences in empathy. It captures four separate aspects: Perspective Taking, Fantasy, Empathic Concern, and Personal Distress49. Participants rated how well each of the 28 statements in the IRI described their feelings on a scale ranging from \u20181 = totally not agree\u2019 to \u20185 = totally agree\u2019. The Cronbach's coefficient of the questionnaire in this study was 0.71.\nFurther, regarding the effect of quarantine, participants were asked to complete the\nAutism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) 50,51, which has been used to assess autism spectrum disorder in adults52. The Cronbach's coefficient of the questionnaire in this study was 0.38.\nNote that there were some differences in the questionnaires that were administered in the\nsecond study given that it took place during the peak period of public concern about the coronavirus. Specifically, the second online task included the STAI to capture both the participants\u2019 trait anxiety and state anxiety components53. The Cronbach's coefficient of the questionnaire in this study was 0.94. Moreover, an 18-item questionnaire about the emerging COVID-19 outbreak was included (Fig. 5, Fig. S10, more details in supplementary material). Demographic information\nAfter the questionnaire session, participants were asked to provide demographic\ninformation including location, age, gender, etc. Statistical analysis\nA total of 520 and 570 participants in the first and second dataset, respectively, were\nincluded in the final analysis. Nineteen participants with missing values of demographic information (three participants did not provide age data and 16 participants did not provide distance information calculated by IP) were removed from the final analysis.\nData were analysed using SPSS 25.0 statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and\nR. Based on the hypotheses of the research, descriptive analysis were first conducted in SPSS. For the data characteristics comparison between the two datasets (pre vs. post-outbreak), group comparisons of nominal variables were analysed using the chi-square test, and independent samples t-tests were used to compare group differences (pre vs. post groups). Linear regression analysis exploration and correlation analysis were executed using R function lm() and cor.test(). As for model construction, mediation and moderation models were computed with PROCESS 3.4 in SPSS and R packages MeMoBootR for serial moderated mediation model.

Maybe\nthat\u2019s because they were using the same Wi-Fi network at that time, so we cannot\nneglect them arbitrarily. Another one is that there was no IP address which exists in\nboth pre- and post-dataset, a possible explanation could be the usage of dynamic IP\naddress. As for distance calculation, we assumed that the earth is a uniform sphere\nwith the radius r=6400km. We assumed that there\u2019s point A which latitude and\nlongitude are (x1,y1), and point B which latitude and longitude are (x2,y2).

Many\nincidents were publicized in the media or caught on video and featured widely on social media. In an incident in Manhattan, an individual yelled, \"Where is your Corona mask you Asian b*tch?\" at a Korean woman before punching and attacking her, dislocating her jaw. (ABC7 News) There were various instances reported similar to this, in which individuals of Asian descent were subjected to blatant\nbigotry with perpetrators explicitly citing Coronavirus as their motive.\nFurther, large institutions alike have perpetrated anti-Chinese sentiment in\ntheir messages. For example, UC-Berkeley's University Health Services published a document that stated that \"Xenophobia: fears about interacting with those who might be from Asia and guilt about these feelings\" is an acceptable response to the Coronavirus pandemic. (Asmelah 2020) Such a bigoted statement coming from such a place of high authority demonstrates the scale and pervasiveness of the xenophobic reaction to Coronavirus. Asian-Americans have also experienced plain discrimination in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic. In Indiana, two HmongAmerican men were rejected from two hotels after reportedly the hotel staff thought the men might have had Coronavirus, presumably a discriminatory assumption\nmade based on their race. (Nottingham and Alsup 2020)\nTrump's rhetoric related to Coronavirus has also been called racist and has\nbeen accused of inciting racism against Chinese and Asian Americans, based on Trump's tendency to refer to Coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" and on other occasions simply the \"foreign virus\". This has been met with considerable controversy. Undoubtedly, it would seem that such language would lead to Coronavirus being more strongly associated with China and Asia than would be otherwise, which presumably could have an impact on how Chinese and Asian\nAmericans are treated.\nEvidence has shown that commerce at Chinese businesses has fallen\nsubstantially since the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic. It is commonly thought that this decline is due to the Americans' perceived association between Asian Americans and Coronavirus, in response to Coronavirus originating from and\ninitially primarily spreading in China.

The power dynamics between groups play a substantial role, as larger or higher-power groups may pose a greater perceived threat, additionally higher-power groups may have stronger reactions to perceived threats. (Corenblum and Stephen\n2001, Stephan et al 2009)\nBesides Asian Americans, another racial minority group typically subjected\nto a high degree a large scale of Xenophobia in recent years in the United States has been Hispanic Americans. While there were large numbers of hate crimes against both Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans, in 2018 there were nearly four times as many against Hispanic Americans compared to Asian Americans. (Uniform Crime Reports 2018) Compared to Hispanic or Black Americans, Asian Americans are often viewed more favorably by White Americans. (Wong et al 1998) Asian Americans are less likely to report experiencing discrimination/hostility in specific\nways. (Pew Research Center)\nTrump has increasingly used anti-Mexican and anti-Hispanic rhetoric\nthroughout his 2016 Presidential Campaign and subsequent presidency, at times referring to Mexicans as criminals and/or rapists. (Reilly 2016) His rhetoric has generally indicated he believes Mexican immigrants are threatening to the well-\nbeing United States, threatening national safety and security and economic health. Most Hispanic Americans report the situation for Hispanic Americans has worsened since Trump took office. (Pew Research Center 2018) Trump's rise to power has generally led to a substantial increase in hate crimes in the United States. (Edwards 2018)\nGroup Threat theory hypothesizes that prejudice towards out-groups is\npositively correlated with the relative size of the out-group. (Blalock 1967) Research has found that the level of Hispanic immigration in an area is correlated with increases in the rate of Hispanic hate-crime victimization in that area. (Stacey et al. 2011) Additional research has found that Hispanic hate-crime victimization is highest in white neighborhoods with recently growing Hispanic populations. (Green et al. 1998) Generally, violent Hate Crimes against Hispanic Americans have been rising substantially over recent years, increasing 300% between 2011 and 2012\nalone. (Bureau of Justice Statistics)\nCoronavirus has triggered national insecurity, fear of foreigners, and general\nXenophobia. Various anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents related to the Coronavirus pandemic demonstrate the common theme: Americans feel threatened by immigrants and/or individuals they perceive may be immigrants. In the case of Coronavirus, this has resulted in individuals racially discriminating against individuals that they perceive as potential carriers of Coronavirus as well as generally expressing hostility and violence towards the Asian race for being to blame for Coronavirus as they see it. Beyond these blatant actions, however, I hypothesize that Coronavirus will stimulate an increase in Xenophobic attitudes broadly in Americans. Since Americans recently have tended to manifest their Xenophobic attitudes in the way of hostility and discrimination towards Hispanic Americans, I hypothesize that Coronavirus will not only cause an increase in AntiAsian sentiment, as has been supported by anecdotal evidence, but that anti-\nHispanic sentiment will increase as well.\nSpatially, I would expect that places with higher proportions of Asian\nAmericans to have higher increases in Xenophobic sentiment, since Integrated Threat theory hypothesizes that larger groups are perceived as more threatening. Thus, in the context of a new perceived threat, I would expect prejudice to rise the most in places with the largest populations of the perceived threatening out-group. In regards to Hispanic Americans, I would expect places with higher levels of antiHispanic sentiment to begin with to experience the largest increases in antiHispanic sentiment, since a large component of anti-Hispanic sentiment generally has to do with the perception that the group consists largely of immigrants, the population in these places tend to likely already be sensitive to perceived threats from out-groups with large immigrant/foreign-born populations, and thus are primed to respond to threats from immigrant or foreign-born populations with anti-\nHispanic sentiment.\nFrom an additional point of view, evidence also supports the hypothesis that\nracism/hatred towards other racial minority groups may fall in response to rising anti-Asian sentiment. Past research has additionally shown an inverse relationship between how White Americans view Asian Americans and how they view African Americans. (Ho and Jackson 2001) Ho and Jackson (2001) found that White subjects that had more favorable stereotypes of Asian Americans tended to have subsequent less favorable stereotypes of African Americans, they attributed this finding to the notion that the groups are viewed in contrast to one another. Additionally, it is possible increasing media focus and attention on Coronavirus and Asian Americans may subsequently reduce the salience of and attention on AfricanAmericans, a \"distraction\" of sorts. Since African-Americans are generally viewed as Americans and not stereotyped as immigrants or viewed as a group with a large foreign-born population, I would not expect Coronavirus to have any type of positive effect on bigoted/racist attitudes towards African-Americans in the way that it would on Asian-Americans or Hispanic-Americans, and instead would in total\nexpect a slight negative effect."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Stephens-Davidowitz (2013) created a method for spatially-proxying an area's\nlevel of anti-black racial sentiment. His proxy for anti-black sentiment rests in the proportion of searches for a particular black slur that starts with \u201cn\u201d, and ends with \u201cer\u201d. Stephens-Davidowitz controls for the proportion of searches for another variation of the racial slur that ends in \u201ca\u201d and is commonly used in rap songs, \"african american\" (in order to control for some areas simply having higher interest in African-Americans) and a particular swear word (to simply control for the fact that some areas simply having higher interest in expletives). Stephens-Davidowitz found the proxy to be significantly-correlated with other spatial measures of\nracism/bigotry towards Black Americans.\nTo measure anti-black sentiment, I will follow the same method Stephens-\nDavidowitz utilized. To measure anti-Chinese sentiment, I will be examining the proportion of searches for a specific racial epithet used to describe a person of Chinese descent. To measure anti-Hispanic sentiment, I will similarly be examining the proportion of searches for a specific racial epithet used to describe a Hispanic person. Following in line with Stephens-Davidowitz's methodology, I will also be controlling for the search rate for \"chinese american\" and \"hispanic american\"\nrespectively, and the proxy search rate for profanity. (See models in Appendix)\nAdditionally, I will also measure the relationship between \"coronavirus\"\nsearches and \"chinese food\" and \"mexican food\" and \"chinese restaurant(s)\" and \"mexican restaurant/restaurant(s)\" google searches controlling for \"food\" and \"restaurant(s)\" searches respectively and \"coronavirus\" searches for both. This operationalizes the discriminatory impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on people's\nrelative interest in Chinese and Mexican restaurants.\nTemporally, I will examine the timeframe from December 24th, 2019 to\nMarch 24th, 2020, a 90-day timeframe, looking at day-by-day search rates. This\ntimeframe is broad enough to contain dates in which the search rate frequency was extremely low (less than 1% of what it was at its peak in the timeframe) but specific enough to minimize the risk of confounding variables. Spatially, I will look at current search rates with states as my geographical level of analysis over the 30- day period February 24th to March 24th, 2020. Spatially, I control for past search rates, utilizing the period September 23th, 2019 to December 23rd, 2019, again focusing on utilizing a recent enough timeframe to minimize the risk of confounding variables, but long ago enough for interest in Coronavirus to be minimal/irrelevant, as well as for there to be no overlap between that date range and the date range I\nutilize for my temporal analysis."}, {"heading": "Results and Discussion", "text": "Temporally, I find evidence that days with higher search rates for\nCoronavirus had higher search rates for anti-Chinese and anti-Hispanic slurs, even controlling for variation in search rates for \"chinese american\" and \"hispanic american\" respectively as well as the search rate for profanity. Table One shows the model for anti-Hispanic sentiment, while Table Two shows the model for antiChinese sentiment. I find the effect of daily search rates for Coronavirus actually to have a significantly larger effect on search rates for anti-Hispanic slurs than antiChinese slurs. I find no evidence that the daily search rate for Coronavirus has a\nsignificant effect on search rates anti-black slurs.\nTemporally, I additionally find some evidence that Coronavirus has\ndiscriminatorily affected search rates for Chinese and Mexican cuisine. As Table Five and Six show, the effect of search rates for Coronavirus on search rates for \"chinese food\" and \"mexican food\" are both negative and significant, approximately the same size. As Table Four shows, I find no significant negative effect of search rates for Coronavirus on search rates for \"chinese restaurant/restaurants\". I do find a slight negative effect of search rate for Coronavirus on search rates for \"Mexican\nrestaurant/restaurants\", again highlighting the seriousness of Coronavirus on anti-\nMexican and, by association, anti-Hispanic discrimination.\nSpatially, I find a positive interactive effect between the local Coronavirus\nsearch rate and prior anti-Hispanic sentiment on present anti-Hispanic sentiment. In other words, as expected, Coronavirus presumably primed individuals with high levels of anti-Hispanic sentiment already to expand on that sentiment and hatred. I find a negative interaction between the percent Asian in a state and the Coronavirus search rate and anti-Chinese sentiment. There is a strong positive effect of percent Asian as a constant, however, indicating that there may not be enough variation in public interest in Coronavirus as proxied by Coronavirus search rates from state to state for noticeable variation in increases in anti-Chinese sentiment to arise, but that generally, the Coronavirus pandemic has increased anti-Chinese sentiment more greatly in states with larger Asian-American\npopulations.\nNotably, I find evidence that anti-black sentiment has decreased more in\nstates with higher search rates for Coronavirus. As Table Ten shows, controlling for differences in anti-Chinese and anti-Hispanic sentiment mediates much of this effect, though not in the way I hypothesized. I find that differences in anti-Chinese and anti-Hispanic sentiment are positively correlated with differences in anti-black sentiment. Thus, the negative effect of Coronavirus on anti-black sentiment cannot be attributed to Coronavirus's positive effect on anti-Chinese and anti-Hispanic\nsentiment.\nSpatially, I find evidence that state-to-state variation in interest in\nCoronavirus as proxied by Coronavirus search rate, has a negative effect on search rate for \"chinese restaurant/restaurants\" as indicated by Table Eleven. I additionally find an interacting negative effect between search rates for \"coronavirus\" and differences in anti-Chinese sentiment on search rates for \"chinese food\" thus specifically implicating anti-Chinese sentiment in discrimination against Chinese restaurants. I otherwise do not find any significant effects of Coronavirus\ninterest spatially in interest in Chinese or Mexican cuisine. I again believe this may be somewhat attributable to the lack of substantial variation in interest Coronavirus between states in the US. The state with the least interest in Coronavirus still had 68% of the level of interest as of the state with the most interest.\nTo summarize, I find evidence that Coronavirus has increased anti-Hispanic\nand anti-Chinese sentiment. I find some evidence that anti-black sentiment has fallen in response to Coronavirus, though this evidence is weaker, and the mechanisms remain unclear. I additionally find evidence that both Chinese and Mexican restaurants have been discriminatorily impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic. Broadly, the most insightful finding of this paper is that despite not being a racial group broadly perceived to be associated with Coronavirus, Hispanic Americans are faced with substantial increases in bigoted sentiment towards their racial/ethnic group, possibly even larger than the effect towards Chinese/AsianAmericans. From an Integrated Threat Theory point of view, this demonstrates an instance in which an in-group's perceived threat from an out-group has been\nresponded to with prejudice towards a distinct out-group.\nReferences\nABC7 New York. \"'Where's your (expletive) mask?': Asian woman attacked in Manhattan hate crime\". 11 March 2020.\nAsmelash, Leah. \"UC Berkeley faces backlash after stating 'xenophobia' is 'common'\nor 'normal' reaction to coronavirus\".

Seeking \u201cpeople\u2019s behavioral changes,\u201d in which the 23 government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was 24 one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when 25 Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where 26 the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a 27 cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on 28 quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we 29 had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported 30 practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and 31 more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent 32 handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of 33 over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the 34 infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 35 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, 36 was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the 37 participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis 38\nindicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years 39 old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher 40 extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these 41 individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence 42 them. 43\n44 45\nIntroduction 46 47 The new coronavirus in Japan 48 Pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in China and first officially reported on 31 49 December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a name for the new 50 coronavirus disease, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), on 11 February 2020.[1] Since then, 51 COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the world, and a rapid increase in deaths has been 52 reported in many countries. As of 28 March, a total of 571,678 cases and 26,494 deaths have 53 been confirmed.[2] One study has estimated that there will be a total of 81,114 deaths from 54 COVID-19 over the next four months in the US alone.[3] The number of COVID-19 cases and 55 deaths in Japan is gradually increasing, with 1,499 cases (including 60 critical cases) and 49 56 deaths reported as of 28 March.[4] Several small clusters of infected groups have been increasing 57 in urban areas, including those in hospitals and nursing homes, in addition to cases with 58 unlinked infections. Nevertheless, the total number of deaths and severely ill patients has been 59 comparatively small, especially relative to the country\u2019s population size, and the trend of the 60 increase is not sharp. The reasons for this mild trend have been questioned outside Japan.[5] 61 Over the past few decades, Japan has not experienced any serious damage from new 62 infectious diseases, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East 63 respiratory syndrome) or the Ebola virus. Ironically, this history of escapes might delay the 64\nestablishment of the emergency operation headquarters in Japan. The implementation of 65 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which must be the frontline response to the novel 66 coronavirus outbreak, has faced time-consuming obstacles. In Japan, a recent revision of the Act 67 on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and 68 Response allows the Prime Minister to declare a state of emergency for the outbreak, but under 69 the current legislation, no central or local government can enforce lockdowns such as those 70 undertaken in other countries. If the Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical 71 Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases is revised for COVID-19, local governors can restrict 72 or block the traffic in contaminated places for a specified period of not more than 72 hours for 73 the purpose of preventing the spread of the coronavirus. 74 Under such limitations, the current goal of the Japanese government is to avoid an 75 explosive increase in patients that would exceed the limit of intensive or critical care units in 76 hospitals in urban areas. To meet this goal, the government policy consists of three strategies: 77 early detection of clusters and rapid response, enhancement of the early diagnosis of patients 78 and intensive care for severely affected patients, and strengthening of the universal healthcare 79 system and people\u2019s behavioral change.[6] 80\n81\nThree strategies against COVID-19 82 With regards to the first and second strategies, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare 83 (MHLW) strongly promotes contact tracing, social distancing and pneumonia surveillance under 84 the direction of the Patient Cluster Countermeasure Group in the MHLW Headquarters for 85 Novel Coronavirus Disease Control. Regional public health centers conduct contact tracing, 86 asking infected persons and their close contacts to maintain social distancing for 14 days and 87 allocating available hospital beds or hospital wards in designated local communities. In clinical 88 settings, the large number of computed tomography (CT) scanners in Japan (111.49 per million 89 population[7]) supports physicians with investigating suspicious pneumonia cases in the absence 90 of conducting massive PCR tests in the population. This policy approach might lead to a 91 relatively slower increase in the number of cases and deaths. 92 Regarding the third strategy, people\u2019s behavioral change, by the middle of February 2020, 93 the MHLW encouraged the Japanese public to practise frequent handwashing and \u201ccoughing 94 etiquette\u201d (using a handkerchief or sleeve instead of hands to catch a cough or sneeze). 95 Furthermore, the MHLW has prioritized access to healthcare for elderly people, people suffering 96 from fatigue or shortness of breath and people with underlying health conditions. The MHLW 97 has also asked the public not to visit clinics for at least four days if they have experienced cold 98 symptoms or a fever of 37.5\u00b0C or over.[8] This restriction might be a shock to Japanese citizens, 99\nwho are typically allowed to freely access clinics and hospitals. 100 In analyses of contact tracing, it was found that one infected person tended to infect more 101 than one other person at locations with certain characteristics. On 24 February, the Expert 102 Meeting on the Control of Novel Coronavirus Infection asked the public to refrain from 103 attending places involving close face-to-face contact (within an arm\u2019s length of each other) in 104 conversations and similar interactions for more than a given length of time in crowds. Since 105 then but prior to other similar slogans that have appeared in the world, the government has been 106 campaigning for avoidance of these situations with the slogan \u201cAvoid overlapping three Ms\u201d 107 mippei-kukan [poorly ventilated closed space], misshu-basho [large gathering] and 108 missetsu-bamen [conversations or shouting in close proximity], in addition to regular ventilation 109 and wiping of shared surfaces (door handles, knobs, and bed fences) and goods with diluted 110 household chlorine bleach. \u201cAvoid overlapping three Ms\u201d has been the core and unique message 111 against COVID-19 in Japan. 112\n113 Previous studies and our research questions 114 This study examines three research questions: 1) How do Japanese citizens implement the 115 government\u2019s three Ms precautionary measures? 2) How effective are these requests from the 116 government? and 3) Who has changed their daily precautionary behavior and who has not? 117\nSeveral previous studies have investigated changes in people\u2019s precautionary behavior 118 against the coronavirus. For example, an online survey conducted on 29 January of 3,083 119 mainland Chinese respondents revealed that adults living in urban areas had a better awareness 120 of the issue than those in rural areas (72.7% vs. 66.1%, p<0.001).[9] Another online survey 121 conducted between 23 February and 2 March in the US (N=2,986) and the UK (N=2,988) adult 122 residents showed that people have a good understanding of the main mode of disease 123 transmission and common symptoms, although they also have several important misconceptions 124 and discriminatory attitudes towards people with East Asian ethnicity due to COVID-19\u2019s origin 125 in China.[10] The latest study in Italy clarified the three types of attitude to COVID-19 among 126 Italian citizens: people who trust authority and choose isolation, fatalists who are keen on social 127 media and uniformed youth. [11] The Gallup International Association also recently conducted a 128 snap poll in 28 countries (including 1,115 Japanese participants), asking about precautionary 129 procedures, and their findings indicated that 71 percent of Japanese participants had adopted 130 more frequent handwashing.[12] It is still unclear, however, what the trigger is for behavioral 131 change around COVID-19 and who is more actively implementing the prevention measures. In 132 this survey, the response period and sample attribution are also unclear. Furthermore, this survey 133 is not necessarily informative for policymaking, as it does not reveal who is not implementing 134 prevention measures. 135\nUsing a large sample of cross-sectional survey data, this study investigates how and at what 136 point Japanese citizens changed their precautionary behavior in this situation, where the 137 government has only requested, rather than mandated, their cooperation. 138\n139 Materials and Methods 140 141 Survey design and participants 142 This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted via an online 143 platform of an online research company, MACROMILL INC, Japan. From a pool of 144 approximately 1.2 million registered individuals residing in Japan, we recruited a total of 11,342 145 males and females aged from 20 to 64 years. In the recruitment process for this study, quota 146 sampling was conducted so that the sample distributions among gender (male or female), age 147 group (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s), and employment status (regular employee, non-regular 148 employee, self-employed or not working) became equal to those of the representative Japanese 149 population, based on the statistics of the Labor Force Survey (Ministry of Internal Affairs and 150 Communications). The survey was conducted between 26 and 28 March 2020. 151\n152 Questionnaire and analysis 153 In addition to providing individual characteristics, the participants were asked to 154\nanswer 11 items rating their prevention measures against novel coronavirus infections, such as 155 social distancing and coughing etiquette on a scale of 1 to 5. Thus, after summarizing 156 demographic characteristics based on the total, male and female, and under-40 and over-40 157 categories, we aggregate and compare a proportion of the participants who have been taking 158 those prevention measures. 159 The participants were also asked what kind of events caused them to change their 160 behaviors and rated the frequency and reliability of 10 information sources about the 161 coronavirus on a scale of 1 to 5. Thus, we calculate and compare the frequency and reliability 162 depending on the information sources. 163 Next, to detect factors associated with behavioral change, the participants were also 164 asked about their drinking and smoking habits. Personality traits were measured by the Five 165 Factor Personality Questionnaire: Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI). We estimate a logit 166 model, where the dependent variable is a dummy indicating 1 if the participant chose \u201cnot at all\u201d 167 or \u201cnot true\u201d to the question \u201cDo you avoid the three overlapping Ms?\u201d and where independent 168 variables are individual characteristics. 169\n170 Data analysis 171 We analyzed the data using STATA/MP version 16.0 for Mac (StataCorp, College 172\nStation, TX, United States). 173\n174 Ethical issues 175 Our survey falls outside the scope of the Japanese government\u2019s Ethical Guidelines for 176 Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects, and there are no national guidelines in 177 Japan for social and behavioral research. Therefore, our study was carried out in accordance 178 with the Ethical Principles for Sociological Research of the Japan Sociological Society, which 179 do not require ethical reviews. 180 All survey participants gave consent to participate in the anonymous online survey by 181 MACROMILL INC. The authors did not obtain any personal information about the participants. 182 After being informed about the purposes of the study and their right to quit the survey, 183 participants agreed to participate. They were provided with the option of \u201cI don\u2019t want to 184 respond\u201d for all questions. Completion of the entire questionnaire was considered as participant 185 consent. 186\n187 Results 188 189 Demographic characteristics 190 The characteristics of the sample, both as a whole and separated by gender (male or 191\nfemale) or age (under or over 40 years old), are summarized in Table 1. The total sample size is 192 11,342, with almost equal gender distribution. Gender and age distribution are proportional to 193 that of the Japanese population. University or college graduates constituted about 50\u201360 percent 194 of respondents. About half of the total sample is composed of regular employees (usually, 195 indefinite and full-time employees). About a quarter of respondents had a household income of 196 4\u20135 million yen. 197\n198 199\n204 To what extent have prevention measures been taken? 205 In the survey, the participants were first asked to answer to the question \u201cHave you 206 ever conducted any measures to prevent novel coronavirus infections or outbreaks?\u201d About 76 207 percent of participants evaluated themselves as having taken some action. 208 To observe the details of those actions, Table 2 shows a variety of prevention measures 209 taken, aggregating a proportion of the participants who answer \u201cvery true\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d for each 210 prevention measure. 211 212\n217 Looking at the first four prevention measures, which have been continuously 218 requested by the Japanese government and the Expert Meeting on Control of Novel Coronavirus 219 Infection, it was found that 80 percent have attempted to avoid the \u201coverlapping three Ms.\u201d Of 220 the total, 57% have attempted avoid conversations or shouting in close proximity, which was a 221 relatively low figure among the three Ms. Looking next at the fifth prevention measure, more 222 than 85 percent of all participants reported practising social distancing by avoiding mass 223\ngatherings. Regarding gender and age differences, more females than males and more older than 224 younger participants are supportive of social distancing, as shown by the differences in the 225 confidence intervals. 226 Regarding hygiene practices, frequent handwashing is conducted by about 86 percent 227 of all, about 91 percent of female and about 88 percent of over-40 participants. Coughing 228 etiquette was implemented by 77 percent of the participants. Many also answered that they have 229 avoided going out when ill with a cold. 230 As for the measures to strengthen individual immunity, around 70 percent of the 231 participants reported getting sufficient rest and sleep or eating a nutritious diet. Again, focusing 232 on gender and age differences, prevention measures are conducted more often by females and 233 older people. 234 However, regardless of gender and age, about 40 percent of participants have prepared 235 consultation and transportation methods for if they were to become ill. 236\n237 What has caused the behavioral changes? 238 To explore the triggers of the behavioral changes and preparedness observed above, 239 the participants were asked \u201cWhat was the most important event influencing these actions?\u201d; the 240 responses are summarized in Fig 1. The figure shows that about 23 percent of the participants 241\ncited the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship [13] that occurred around early 242 February 2020, when there were still few domestic cases. Diamond Princess is a 243 British-registered cruise ship on which an 80-year-old passenger from Hong Kong tested 244 positive for COVID-19 on 1 February 2020. Because the ship was in Japanese waters, the ship 245 was quarantined in February 2020 for nearly a month with about 3,700 passengers and crew on 246 board. Other participants noted events from the end of February, including the alert from the 247 Expert Meeting (5.6 percent), the statement of emergency by the governor of Hokkaido 248 (northern island of Japan) (7.4 percent) and the request by the Prime Minister to not attend mass 249 gatherings (7.8 percent). The next large trigger was the request by the Prime Minister for 250 nationwide school closures in Japan on 28 February 2020 (about 14 percent). Finally, worldwide 251 outbreak around early March (22 percent) also attracted participants\u2019 attention. 252 To explore what kind of information affected their behavioral change and 253 preparedness, the survey asked participants to report the frequency at which they consult certain 254 sources about the novel coronavirus infection and rate their reliability of the information source. 255 The results are summarized in Table 3. 256\n257 258\n262 Table 3 shows that almost 90 percent receive information from TV news programs and 263 Internet news sites, and that about 50 percent trust such information. Mainstream scientists are 264 annoyed about the fear-mongering that happens on TV talk and variety shows; indeed, these 265 formats are slightly favored, but considered less credible, among the public. Meanwhile, 266 information from the central and local government (received by 60 percent), including the 267 Prime Minister and the Expert Meeting, is relatively trusted by the participants (50 percent). 268 Among official sources, the local government is most trusted. Newspapers (national and local) 269 are read by only about 42 percent of the participants, and about 48 percent answered that they 270 trust information from newspapers. 271 Looking at the differences in gender and age, females tend to seek more information 272 and trust it more than males, except for the information from newspapers. Participants over 40 273 years old tend to access and trust the information from TV, newspapers and officials more than 274 those under 40 years old do, while young people often seek and trust news from the Internet and 275 SNS apps. 276\n277 Who does not adhere to social distancing? 278 As we confirmed in Table 2, more than 80 percent of the participants have been 279\nimplementing social distancing measures and most Japanese citizens seem to be exhibiting 280 some behavioral change to prevent coronavirus infections. However, this also means that about 281 20 percent may not be conducting sufficient prevention measures. 282 To detect what kind of individuals are included in the group not conducting prevention 283 measure, Table 4 shows the estimation results of the logit model. Like the other tables, Table 4 284 shows the results based on the total, male and female, and under-40 and over-40 categories. The 285 number shown in the table is an odds ratio, so the estimates that are significantly higher than 1 286 indicate a higher tendency to not conduct proper social distancing. 287\n288 289\nLooking at the estimation results in Table 4, males, people in their 20s and unmarried 292 people exhibit significantly higher odds ratios, indicating that these groups tend not to conduct 293 preventive social distancing. Although work status is not generally associated with this 294 prevention measure, females, regular employees and non-regular employees tended to exhibit 295 higher odds ratios than self-employed or unemployed people. 296 Regarding household annual income, the lowest group (less than 2,000K JPY) has 297 significantly higher odds ratio for the total, female and under-40 categories. 298 Higher odds ratios for not conducting social distancing are associated with drinking 299 for males and smoking for females. Furthermore, those with higher extraversion scores also 300 tend to exhibit significantly higher odds ratio in many cases, while conscientiousness and 301 agreeableness are associated with lower odds ratio in most cases. 302\n303 Should the government change its policy on mass gatherings? 304 Before this survey was conducted, the request by the Japanese government for 305 self-restraint in avoiding mass gatherings had become an issue. For example, on 22 March 2020, 306 the K-1 Grand Prix, a martial arts event, was held despite the Minister\u2019s and local governor\u2019s pleas 307 for restraint, and 6,500 participants were packed into the Saitama Super Arena. On 23 March, more 308 than 50,000 gathered in Sendai to see the Olympic flame, which had recently arrived from 309\nGreece.[14] We asked the participants whether they supported this policy approach. About 29 310 percent of participants supported the idea that the government should now allow mass 311 gatherings. Males tend to support allowing mass gatherings more than females. On the other 312 hand, 65 percent supported government limitations of movement, in addition to self-restraint to 313 avoid mass gatherings in order to shorten the period of the pandemic. There are no significant 314 differences in gender and age category for this question. 315\n316\n320 Discussion 321 322 Under circumstances where there is no enforced ban on mass gathering or travelling 323 beyond the home region, our findings indicate that a large portion of Japanese citizens seem to 324 be implementing proper prevention measures on their own. 325 First, more than three-quarters of the survey participants have taken some preventive 326\nactions, including social distancing, handwashing, coughing etiquette and strengthening 327 immunity. Because the previous empirical studies did not include developed countries like 328 Japan, [15] there is little scientific evidence that Japanese people prefer cleanliness and tend to 329 wash their hands relatively more frequently than other countries. In Japanese communities, 330 water facilities for handwashing with soap and hand sanitizers are normally placed various 331 public places, such as train stations and supermarkets. Moreover, handwashing became part of 332 regular practice at home and school through post-war education.[16] In general, Japanese people 333 have developed the discipline of washing their hands before having meals or after using the 334 toilet. It is also well known that Japanese bow for greetings instead of handshaking, kissing and 335 hugging. This cultural behavior implies that the frequency of body contact among Japanese 336 people may be less than for those who greet with handshaking, kissing and hugging. During hay 337 fever season, Japanese citizens regularly wear surgical-style masks for prevention; it may be 338 that wearing a mask was a less popular preventive measure than some of the others in this study 339 due to there being a shortage of these products. These already habitual practices might help 340 behavioral changes develop among Japanese citizens during these unusual times. 341 In the survey, more than half of the participants had not prepared access to 342 consultation centers or transportation methods for if they were to become ill, implying that they 343 had not planned for the possibility of contracting COVID-19. We must advise the public to 344\nprepare for such an event, to talk to family and close friends about unexpected advanced care 345 planning, and to imagine not being able to use ventilators or extracorporeal membrane 346 oxygenation at the severe stage. 347 Second, one of the main motivations for people\u2019s behavioral changes was the infection 348 aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in early February 2020. At that time, only a few cases 349 of domestic infection had been reported in Japan, but news of the quarantine and positive test 350 results among the passengers was broadcasted daily. This may have contributed to Japanese 351 citizens changing their mindset and behavior toward precautionary measures earlier than in 352 Europe and the US. The sudden request by the Prime Minister for nationwide school closures in 353 the end of February might also have been an effective measure for changing the mindsets of 354 Japanese citizens toward prevention, even though this move was scientifically questioned and 355 confusing to the public, especially to single parents and double-income households. 356 Third, information from the Expert Meeting and central/local governments, including 357 the Prime Minister, are relatively trusted by survey participants. The Expert Meeting and 358 central/local government have held frequent press conferences, trying to clarify the tentative 359 scientific risks and advocating for citizens to conduct prevention measures. Such crisis 360 communication attempts may have caused behavioral changes in Japanese citizens. The most 361 trusted resource in this study was information from the local government, which was a hopeful 362\nresult, considering that the countermeasures against the virus are decided and conducted by the 363 local government. It is also important to support residents with disadvantages to information 364 and communication in the local communities. 365 However, the results also show that about 20 percent of the participants are reluctant 366 to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicates that typically those 367 people are male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, are in lower income household, have 368 a drinking or smoking habit and have a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of 369 infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral 370 change in various ways that will reach and move them. It is notable that approximately 65 371 percent of the participants support stricter countermeasures, such as limitation of movement. As 372 we mentioned in the introduction, as of yet, the government has not made stay-at-home orders 373 mandatory and it has not offered financial aid to those affected by such measures. The current 374 requests from central/local governments are not legally binding and people/businesses have to 375 arrange financial compensation independent of the government. We should observe how 376 effective these measures are in Japan over the long term. 377 There are several limitations to this study. First, the data were self-reported, and 378 participants\u2019 actual behaviors have not been observed. Second, the sample was not collected 379 based on random sampling. Quota sampling ensured a similar distribution to the Japanese 380\npopulation among demographic groups (gender, age and work status), but the sample within 381 each group does not necessarily reflect the population. Third, we obtained this dataset at the end 382 of March 2020, when the infection is not explosively widespread in Japan. This study should be 383 reanalyzed after the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end. 384\n385 Acknowledgments 386 387 We would like to thank the participants in our online survey for offering valuable data.

Understanding Wuhan\u2019s COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effects of prevention approaches is of significant importance for containing virus global transmission.

An improved diagnostic capability created the second peak and increased the number of documented infections. The proportion of documented infections changed from 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%) to 37% (95% CI, 33% to 41%) when the detection kits were released after January 26, and later up to 73% (95% CI, 64% to 80%) after the diagnostic criteria were improved."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), identified originally in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China in 2019 December, has been causing concern of global pandemic1 -2. As the disease continues to grow, many studies have characterized disease transmission dynamics and estimated certain important epidemiological properties, including the basic reproductive number R0 and the number of actual infections1\u20137. The estimation of transmissibility R0 is important because the level of control measures required to contain the outbreak can thus be obtained6. Although a wide range of the R0 was produced after the disease dynamics occurred in Wuhan, most of the studies focused on early transmission dynamics1,4,6,8. Characterizing the transmissibility after initial periods when the control measures have been put in place and the COVID-19 detection capability has been improved is important to understand the effect of those measures4. However, none of the studies has considered the changes in both prevention measures and detection capability.\nAs of January 22, 2020, the virus has infected 571 individuals in China, including around 74.4 percent of cases within Wuhan9 10. Transportation restrictions were implemented in Wuhan after January 2311. Many studies have illustrated the effects of Wuhan lockdown on disease spreading to other places6 12 13 14; however, few studies investigated the contribution of transportation restriction in local transmission dynamics15.\nChanges in detection capability can largely affect the proportion of documented infections. A recent study had shown that the number of cases was largely underestimated and more than 80% of infections were not documented during the initial periods when COVID-19 was just discovered to be the causal agent16. After the introduction of new commercial kits to provide a higher diagnosis rate17 and the improvements of diagnostic criteria18 (Figure 1), the capacity of diagnosis has been gradually increased. The proportion of documented infections raised as the capacity of diagnosis progressed. E.g., a higher diagnosis or healthcare capacity indicates that the proportion of documented infections can be higher given the same amount of infected persons; Consequently, along with the epidemic growth, a higher number of cases can thus be documented.\nOne of the benefits of using transmission models, such as SIR or SEIR, to estimate Re is that many complex epidemiological factors and control measures can be naturally incorporated. The inclusion of the infectious incubation period, during which an infected individual has no symptoms, but can infect others, may affect transmissibility estimation. Studies have shown the presence of the incubation infections of COVID-1919. Specifically, a recent study reported a 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed it to five of her family members but never got physically sick herself20. Another study in Germany reported that a case with mild symptoms infected two colleagues when they worked together21. Given the transmission by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic persons, it indicates that time from exposure to infection may be shorter than the incubation period. However, in most studies with SEIR models, an assumption was made that the incubation cases had weak\nor no infectious capacity8 22, which may not be able to reflect the incubation infectious of the COVID-19.\nIn this study, we have developed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantinedrecovered (SEIQR) model, embedding with latent periods and the transportation restriction control under the different proportion of documented infections to describe the Wuhan COVID-19 transmission pattern after the initial outbreak stage. Our model was an extension of the classic SEIR model by including quarantined status. We also demonstrated that transportation restriction and quarantine measures were able to contain the epidemic growth."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Data collection", "text": "We fitted our model using the daily number of newly infected COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The daily numbers of newly confirmed cases from January 11 to March 10 were collected from the bulletins of Wuhan Municipal Health Commission9.\nDescription of the SEIQR epidemic model.\nWe constructed a SEIQR model to illustrate the spreading of COVID-19 within the Wuhan local population (Figure 2). S, E, I, Q and R represented the number of individuals in susceptible, exposed (partly asymptomatically infectious), infectious (symptomatically infectious), quarantined, and recovered statuses with total population size N = S + E + I + Q + R. Here, the Wuhan population was assumed to be fixed as 11 million. We made assumptions that exposed individuals became asymptomatically infectious after the latent period, and only symptomatically infectious individuals can be quarantined.\nThe SEIQR equations were derived as the following:\nSt = St\u22121 \u2212 \u0394E,t\n(1)\nEt = Et\u22121 + \u0394E,t \u2212 \u0394I,t\nIt = It\u22121 + \u0394I,t \u2212 \u0394R,t \u2212 \u0394Q,t\nQt = Qt\u22121 + \u0394Q,t\nRt = Rt\u22121 + \u0394R,t\nConsistent with the assumption of most SEIR models, where \u0394E,t was defined as the number of individuals that were newly infected but not yet symptomatic from S to E status during time t to time t+1, \u0394I,t was the number of newly symptomatic infectious cases from E to I, \u0394Q,t the newly quarantined cases from I to Q, and \u0394R,t the newly recovered individuals from I to R. We assumed that \u0394E,t, \u0394I,t, \u0394Q,t, and \u0394R,t followed Poisson distributions:\n\u0394E,t~Poisson ( \u03b2t\u22121[(\n1 \u03c3 \u2212\u03b7\n1 \u03c3\n)Et\u22121+It\u22121]St\u22121\nN )\n(2) \u0394I,t~Poisson(\u03c3 \u00d7 Et\u22121)\n\u0394Q,t~Poisson(q \u00d7 It\u22121)\n\u0394R,t~Poisson(\u03b3 \u00d7 It\u22121)\nwhere \u03c3 was the incubation rate, determining the rate of exposed individuals becoming symptomatic cases. \u03b7 was the latent time. q was the quarantine rate. \u03b3 was the recovery rate, which can be expressed as \u03b3 = 1/(tau \u2212 1/\u03c3), with assuming a fixed generation time tau equal to 10 days. \u03b2t was the transmission rate on day t. In this model we assumed Wuhan transportation restriction policy modulated \u03b2t through an exponential relationship with a lag effect of lag1 = 6 days4:\n\u03b2t+lag1 = e (\u03b1\u00d7polt+log (\u03b20 )) (3)\nwhere polt was an indicator for transportation restriction policy (e.g. polt = 0 means there was no transportation restriction on that day (before January 23)11, otherwise polt = 1 ), and \u03b1 was the transportation restriction effect coefficient. \u03b20 was the basic transmission rate without transportation restriction.\nLinking hospital documented cases to the SEIQR model.\nWe included an observation model to link Wuhan's incidence and hospital documented cases. The estimation of the number of hospital daily confirmed cases (hosp_confirm)t+lag2 given the simulated \u0394I,t was derived with a delay of lag2 = 6 days by equation (4), and the proportion of documented infections could be calculated by equation (5):\n(hosp_confirm)t+lag2 = \u0394I,t \u00d7 p(m|i) \u00d7 p(hosp_diag|i)t+lag2 (4)\n(Proportion of documented infections)t = p(m|i) \u00d7 p(hosp_diag|i)t (5)\nwhere p(m|i) represented the probability that a person with COVID-19 seek medical attention, which was assumed as 0.8; p(hosp_diag|i)t was the hospital-diagnose rate, the probability that a person infected with COVID-19 would be diagnosed as COVID-19 case by the hospital; (Proportion of documented infections)t , the probability that a person infected with COVID-19 would be confirmed and documented by hospitals, could be estimated by the conduct of p(m|i) and p(hosp_diag|i)t. Since the hospital diagnostic rate progressed by time, p(hosp_diag|i)t was assumed to have three different values: p(hosp_diag|i)_1 when the test kits were limited (before January 27), p(hosp_diag|i)_2 when the kits were enough but the diagnostic criteria were biased7 (January 27 to February 11), and p(hosp_diag|i)_3 when the kits were enough and the diagnostic criteria were accurate18 (after February 12). The values of p(hosp_diag|i)_1,2,3 were estimated after fitting the model to the hospital's daily confirmed cases. The recorded cases on January 27, February 12, and February 13 were over-documented than the actual new infections due to the sudden change of detection capability happened on these days, we filled these points with smoothing values on the model fitting process."}, {"heading": "Effective reproductive number Rt", "text": "After obtaining the posterior simulation matrix of parameters and model hidden compartments, Rt, the effective reproductive number at time t, was calculated using the next-generation matrix approach.

We then calculated the effective sample size (ESS) and Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic statistic across the three independent chains."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Reconstructing disease dynamics\nThe spread of the Wuhan local epidemic followed an exponential growth before February 4, and a short decreasing period. This decreasing period was followed by a second high peak occurring on February 12. Our stochastic SEIQR model successfully reproduced the dynamics with two peaks (Figure 3A). Specifically, the rise of the second peak was mainly caused by improved diagnostic criteria with delayed case ascertainment18. The predicted hospital cumulative numbers were higher than the documented cases until delayed cases being documented on February 12 (Figure 3B). The time from illness onset to quarantine was estimated to have a mean of 5.65 days (95% CI, 1.91 to 9.76), the mean incubation time was estimated to be 5.57 days (95% CI, 2.67 to 7.95), and the mean latent time was estimated to be 2.92 days (95% CI, 1.09 to 5.28) (Table1).\nEffects of prevention measures\nBoth transportation restriction and quarantine measures had a significant impact on the effective reproductive number Re . The value of Re was calculated using the disease transmission baseline with transportation restriction coefficient and time to quarantine from onset (Table 1). The initial Re was estimated to be 3.09 (95% CI, 2.10 to 3.63) during the early epidemic period (Figure 4); however, after the transportation restriction implemented, Re was dropped 87% to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.66). Quarantine of symptomatic cases was a critical part of prevention efforts. Without the quarantine effect, the estimated Re increased to 4.28 (95% CI, 3.72 to 6.63) based on equation (6).\nEffects of detection capability\nA sharp rise in cumulative cases on February 12 can be explained by the improved diagnostic criteria with delayed case ascertainment. After the outbreak occurred, the detection capability of COVID-19 in Wuhan has been improved several times (Figure 1). These improvements greatly affect the documented proportions of infected cases. E.g., from January 11 to January 26, the estimated proportion of documented infections was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.26), then increased to 0.37 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.41) since the kits production enhanced after January 26, finally rose to 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.80) as the diagnostic criteria became more accurate after February 12 (Figure 5A). The simulated cumulative infectious with symptomatic onset were correlated but higher than the documented cases (Figure 5B). Care should be taken in interpreting the speed of growth in cases during the early outbreak, given an increase in the proportion of documented infections relating to the availability and use of testing kits has progressed. Our results suggested a sharp rise in cumulative cases on February 12 can be explained by the delayed case being documented using new diagnostic criteria."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of transportation restriction measures together with the improvement of diagnostic capacity on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan. We found that the proportion of the documented infections increased as the availability of test kits and the accuracy of diagnostic progressed by time. Our initial estimated proportion of documented infections was consistent with a recent study16. However, the estimated proportion increased up to around 73% after February 12. Also,\nour results showed that transportation restrictions in Wuhan successfully contained disease growth. These findings may provide some suggestions for further analyses.\nUnlike most studies with the proportion of documented infections being fixed over time, our estimated proportion was close to the prediction in the study of Ruiyun et al. (14%)16 at the initial stage, but increased to around 70% by progress. Diagnostic capability strongly influenced the proportion of documented infections. During the early outbreak in Wuhan, a large proportion of cases were not able to be confirmed as the test kits were insufficient16. On January 26, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) approved four new coronavirus detection kits from four companies17 to increase the supply of detection kits, and our estimated proportion of documented infections increased to 37% after then. On February 12, the diagnostic criteria were enhanced by including clinically diagnosed cases18. The undocumented infections may be of mild illness and insufficiently serious about seeking treatment16. We found the estimated undocumented proportion of infections was less than 30% after February 12. This finding suggested that the proportion of mild symptomatic cases were likely to be around or less than 30%.\nOur estimation of Rt during the curve up period aligns with other recent studies 24 (3.11 by Jonathan et al. 6, 3.15 by Tian et al. 8, 1.4 to 3.9 by Li et al. 1). Furthermore, our results showed both transportation restriction and quarantine measures were able to limit virus transmission. Transportation restrictions, including halting all forms of public transportation, trains, and air travel, sharply reduced social contacts and virus transmission rates. Concurrent with the implementation of transportation measures, personal awareness of the virus and protective behavior (e.g., wearing facemasks, washing hands frequently, social distancing) also increased. Although our study did not exclude the effects caused by changes in public response coming along with the transportation measures, we found Re dropped by 87% after the introduction of transportation restriction. These findings are in agreement with the results of Kucharski et al. 7 and Ruiyun et al. 16. Besides, quarantine of the symptomatic infections was also essential in curbing the epidemic25. Under the actual condition in Wuhan (with quarantine), the estimated time from symptom to quarantine was around 5.65 days at the initial stage, possibly due to a lack of sufficient resources during this period. Our estimated incubation time was consistent with other recent studies1 8 19 26. Given the estimated incubation period as 5.57 days but the latent period as 2.92 days, there can be a lot of transmissions that occurred during the asymptomatic infectious period. How to reduce possible contact during the asymptomatic infectious period is one of the major tasks to contain the virus spread. Our results were in agreement with the advocation from the government that people who had close contact with confirmed cases need to be quarantined for at least 14 days27.\nOverall, our studies suggested an improved capability with intensive transportation control and quarantine measures, can be able to contain COVID outbreak in a city."}, {"heading": "Supplementary", "text": "Figure S1.

There has, however, been remarkable variation in how extensively it has spread 64 and in the national responses to this spread [1, 2]. For example, although the virus is 65 thought to have first emerged in China, European countries such as Italy and Spain 66 have reported roughly 30-fold higher number of infections per capita than China [1, 67 2]. Understanding the reasons underpinning this heterogeneity in spread is crucial to 68 ongoing prevention efforts. The cornerstones of prevention efforts have included 69 extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation and various forms of social 70 distancing/quarantining [3, 4]. Whilst there have been important differences in how 71 these were implemented in different countries, arguably the most striking difference 72 in approach has been in the use of universal face masks in public. Whereas a 73 number of predominantly Asian countries have promoted this practice, the World 74 Health Organization (WHO) and most European and North American countries have 75 not promoted this strategy [5, 6]. The head of the Chinese Center for Disease 76 Control and Prevention has stated that the biggest mistake that Europe and the US 77 were making in tacking COVID-19 was their failure to promote the widespread usage 78 of face masks in public [7]. The WHO argues against universal face mask use 79 based on a lack of evidence to support the practice, as well as a concern that using 80 face masks will provide users with a false sense of security which may result in 81 poorer hand hygiene and hence increased transmission [3, 5, 8]. The US Centers for 82 Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are well wear 83 a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 84 [5]. In fact, the US Surgeon General stated that facemasks \u201care not effective in 85\npreventing (the) general public from catching coronavirus\u201d and urged people to 86 stop buying face masks [5]. 87 88 Advocates of universal usage of face masks point to four types of evidence. Firstly, 89 SARS CoV-1 and -2 are spread mainly through contact- and droplet- but also 90 through airborne-transmission [6, 9]. Detailed environmental and epidemiological 91 investigations from the large Amoy Gardens outbreak of SARS CoV-1 revealed that 92 airborne transmission played an important role in the outbreak [10, 11]. Likewise in 93 vitro studies demonstrate that SARS CoV-2 can be aerosolized and remain viable in 94 the air in this form for at least 3 hours [12]. Although viral viability was not assessed, 95 air samples from hospital rooms and toilets used by COVID-19 patients as well as 96 from a crowded entrance to a department store tested positive for SARS CoV-2 [13]. 97 Even if we discount the evidence of airborne transmission, face masks could play a 98 major role in reducing droplet and possibly contact (via reduced digital-oral 99 interactions) transmission. The second type of evidence is that from epidemiological 100 studies showing that masks do provide this protective effect. One systematic review 101 on the efficacy of face masks to prevent influenza, found evidence that face masks 102 were effective in preventing the transmission to others and weaker evidence that 103 they prevented influenza acquisition [14]. Likewise, a systematic review and 104 metanalysis in health care workers found that mask wearing was associated with a 105 lower incidence of clinical respiratory infections [15]. A Cochrane review of different 106 physical measures to prevent the acquisition of respiratory viruses found face masks 107 to be the most effective of all measures investigated - including social distancing 108 [16]. The results were similar for studies limited to SARS CoV-1 transmission, with 109 the authors concluding: \u2018wearing a surgical mask or a N95 mask is the measure with 110\nthe most consistent and comprehensive supportive evidence\u2019 [16]. Thirdly, there is 111 increasing evidence that a large proportion of SARS CoV-2 transmission occurs from 112 pauci- or asymptomatic individuals. An estimated 30% of infections are truly 113 asymptomatic and 80% mild infections [17]. Evidence is also mounting that infected 114 individuals are infectious prior to the onset of symptoms [18]. Taken together these 115 findings provide an explanation for why epidemiological studies have found that 116 nondocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases 117 in Wuhan, China [18]. In this setting limiting masks to confirmed infections is far less 118 likely to have an impact on transmission than universal use. The key argument for 119 universal use is thus preventing transmission and a secondary argument is 120 preventing acquisition [7, 9]. 121 122 These considerations provided the motivation for the current analysis where we 123 assessed if there was ecological level evidence that countries that promoted face 124 mask usage in public had a lower number of COVID-19 diagnoses per capita. 125 126 Methods 127 Dependent variable: 128 The cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 infection per million inhabitants on 29 129 March 2020 per country. This data was obtained from the European Centre for 130 Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) data repository: 131 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases 132 133 Independent variables: 134\nUniversal face mask. A binary variable equal to 1 or 0 according to whether or not 135 national policies promote the wearing of face masks in public regardless of 136 symptoms. Countries were classified according to a narrative review of official 137 national documents and other sources (STable 1). 138 139 Testing intensity. Cumulative number of nucleic acid amplification SARS CoV-2 tests 140 conducted per country per million inhabitants up till 29 March 2020. This data was 141 extracted from the Wikipedia COVID-19 testing site on 29 March 2020: 142 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing 143 144 Age of epidemic. The date the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in each 145 country. This was measured in days after the first COVID-19 case was officially 146 reported in China (10 January 2020). This data was obtained from the ECDC data 147 repository on 29 March 2020: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-148 distribution-2019-ncov-cases 149 150 Data analysis 151 Linear regression was used to analyze the association between the independent and 152 dependent variables. We controlled for the fact that SARS CoV-2 epidemic is at 153 different stages in different countries via two methods. Firstly, the \u2018age of the 154 epidemic\u2019 variable was included in all analyses. Secondly, we only included countries 155 with at least 500 cumulative cases and countries whose first case was reported 156 before 7 March 2020. Countries with missing data were dropped from the analyses. 157 The analysis was performed in STATA version 16 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tx). 158 Although Hong Kong is a part of China it was included as a separate data point in 159\nkeeping with its population size and relative autonomy as regards public health 160 responses. Because Czechia was the only country to introduce universal face masks 161 late in the epidemic (18 March 2020), we repeated the analyses excluding Czechia 162 [19, 20]. 163 164 Results 165 Forty-nine countries were found with complete data, epidemics older than 7 March 166 2020 and more that 500 cases/million inhabitants (STable 1). Large variations were 167 evident in the number of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants (median 158, 168 interquartile range [IQR] 20-486), testing per million (median 1723, IQR 307-4802) 169 and the date of the first case (median 24 February, IQR 28 January \u2013 28 February; 170 STable 1). Only 8 of these countries advocated wearing face masks in public \u2013 171 China, Czechia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and 172 Malaysia. These countries tended to have older epidemics. Seven of the 8 were in 173 the group of countries with the 10 oldest epidemics (STable 1). 174 175 In multivariate analysis face mask use was negatively associated with number of 176 COVID-19 cases (coef. -326, 95% CI -601- -51, P=0.021; Table 1). Testing intensity 177 was positively associated with COVID-19 cases (coef. 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, 178 P<0.001). 179 180 Repeating the analyses excluding Czechia strengthened the association between 181 COVID-19 cases and face mask usage slightly (STable 2). 182 183 Discussion 184\nIn this ecological study we found that countries that promoted widespread face mask 185 usage had lower cumulative numbers of COVID-19 diagnosed after controlling for 186 testing intensity and age of the epidemic. It is important to note that this association 187 may be entirely explained by unmeasured confounders. For example, if countries 188 promoting universal face masking also conducted more effective contact tracing and 189 isolation than other countries and this was responsible for the slower spread, our 190 study design would have falsely attributed this effect to using face masks. We did not 191 have accurate data to control for these confounders. We did however control for 192 testing intensity which is an important potential confounder. We also controlled for 193 the age of the epidemic which is an obvious independent determinant of the size of 194 the epidemic. A further limitation of our study was that we were unable to quantitate 195 the intensity of face mask use per country. This resulted in a rather crude binary 196 classification of face mask usage per country. 197 198 At this albeit early phase of the pandemic it is important to explore why the virus has 199 spread more extensively in many European countries than China and neighboring 200 countries where the outbreak appeared to have commenced. This is difficult in the 201 absence of data that quantitates national competency in terms of the various 202 components of successful national COVID-19 response plans. Narrative reviews of 203 the features that resulted in the success of countries such as China, Hong Kong, 204 Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have noted a number of common features. These 205 include: rapid response, extensive testing, contact isolation and the widespread 206 usage of face masks in public [4, 21]. 207 208\nThere are a number of countries in Western European such as Italy that have 209 conducted intensive screening, contact tracing, isolation, social distancing and 210 widespread lockdowns and yet have amongst the largest COVID-19 epidemics in the 211 world [2]. A striking omission from this response-list if we compare it to the 212 responses in China and other Asian countries with lower COVID-19 incidence is that 213 the widespread use of face masks in public was not promoted. The only European 214 country to adopt this strategy was Czechia, and it did so at a relatively late stage in 215 the epidemic [19, 20]. Early indications suggest that despite higher testing rates than 216 the average for western European countries, the number of new infections is lower in 217 Czechia [1]. Future studies will however be crucial to evaluate the impact of this 218 intervention in Czechia and elsewhere. These studies may benefit from including 219 data from Taiwan and Macau where use of face masks in public has been high and 220 the cumulative number of infections has remained so low that they did not meet the 221 500 case threshold for inclusion in this study (Taiwan 283 and Macau 34 cumulative 222 cases as of 29 March) [1]. 223 224 It is likely that a single intervention is not sufficient to suppress the spread of COVID-225 19 [2]. The safest approach in the middle of this epidemic may be to introduce the 226 full package of interventions that have been proven to work in Asian countries and 227 then scale back according to new findings [3, 9]. Our analysis provides further 228 evidence that this package should include widespread usage of face masks in public. 229 Currently the only European country that can be considered to be doing this is 230 Czechia. 231 232\nAuthors\u2019 contributions 233 CK conceptualized the study, was responsible for the acquisition, analysis and 234 interpretation of data and wrote the analysis up as a manuscript. 235 236\nFunding 237\nNil 238 239 Conflict of interest 240\nThe author declares that he/she has no competing interests. 241\n242 Ethical approval 243 The analysis involved a secondary analysis of public access ecological level data.

Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of COVID-19 in 199 countries/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country\u2019s policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country\u2019s life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor. While this retrospective epidemiological study potentially suffers from a number of unknown confounding factors, these associations support the idea that BCG vaccination may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, which, together with its proven safety, encourages consideration of further detailed epidemiological studies, large-scale clinical trials on the efficacy of this vaccine on COVID-19, and/or reintroduction of BCG vaccination practice in the countries which are currently devoid of the practice.\n2"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the most serious threats to the human race in this millennium. There appears to be a large variability among countries in the risk of infection and mortality by this virus1. For example, Japan, which has close physical and social distance from China, is one of the first countries that recorded the first case in the earliest phase of this pandemic. As of March 30th, while many governments have \u2018locked-down\u2019 numerous cities and even the entire country, the Japanese government still keeps applying mild measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. The citizens have simply been \u2018advised\u2019 to stay home. Nevertheless, most people in Japan, with the notable exception of Tokyo metropolitan, are currently working as usual. Surprisingly, despite such a liberal measure taken and relatively low number of PCR tests conducted, Japan is ranked at 117th and 69th among 199 countries and regions1, as of March 28th, regarding the number of cases per 1 million population and the number of deaths per 1 million population, respectively. Also, there seem to be visible differences in COVID-19 prevalence and mortality between countries in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. There are many potential geographical, social, and biological factors, such as temperature, humidity, life expectancy, average income, social norms, and ethnical genetic background, that could potentially explain such variabilities among countries, but it remained fully explored. In case they are successfully identified, such information could potentially contribute to the mitigation of the spread of the virus. Some vaccines (e.g., measles and Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccines) are associated with a lower risk of illness and death from other disorders2\u20134. A systematic review of epidemiological studies provided evidence for the non-specific beneficial effects of BCG vaccine on all-cause mortality5,6. Induction of cytokines associated with trained immunity is proposed to underly such protection against non-related viral infections7. Researchers in four countries will soon start a clinical trial of BCG vaccine on this disease, based on the proposed beneficial effect of BCG4. Interestingly, a blogger noticed that there might be a correlation between the administration of BCG vaccine in each country and the extent to which the spread of COVID-19 occurs8. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that BCG vaccination has some protective effect against COVID-19 by utilizing publicly available datasets through linear regression modeling. Among the potentially confounding factors, we assessed two factors, life expectancy and the average\n3\ntemperature of the countries. We also tried to evaluate the potential effect of BCG vaccination policy on the growth rate of COVID-19, controlled by the onset of its propagation in each country."}, {"heading": "Methods and Results", "text": "The data on COVID-19 and life expectancy were retrieved on March the 28th from \u201cCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\u201d page1 and \u201cLife Expectancy of the World Population\u201d page9 in worldmeter website. The average temperature data were retrieved from \u201cList of cities by average temperature\u201d page10 in Wikipedia. Average temperature of each country was obtained by averaging those of the cities in each country. The raw data on which our analyses are based is attached as Supplementary Table 1. Also, the STROBE Statement for cohort studies is in the supplementary materials11. Three sets of linear regressions were run. The dependent variables (DVs) were the rate of total cases per one million population (Model 1), the rate of death per one million population (Model 2), and the ratio between these two variables (Model 3). The country\u2019s BCG policy was the independent variable (IV) of interest. In accordance with the BCG world atlas12, this variable had three levels: Group A, the country currently administers the BCG; Group B, the country used to administer the BCG and currently does not; and Group C, the country has never administered the vaccine. The country\u2019s life expectancy and mean temperature (\u00b0C) in February and March 2020 were added as control variables in all the models in order to rule out potentially confounding effects. In fact, infection rates and mortality rates may have been influenced by the subject\u2019s age (i.e., the older, the more vulnerable) and climate conditions (i.e., the higher the temperature, the less contagious the virus). Finally, the Order Quantile (ORQ) normalization transformation was used to standardize the continuous variables. Beyond meeting the statistical assumption of linear modeling (normalization), this procedure is also useful to mitigate potentially confounding effects of outliers.\nThis study included 136 countries or regions for which complete data about total cases per one million population, life expectancy, and temperature were available (Model 1). The data regarding total deaths per one million population and deaths/cases ratio were available for 91 countries (Models 2 and 3). All the analyses were run with the R software13, and the graphs were produced by using the package ggplot214. The ORQ transformation was performed with the\n4\nbestNormalize R package15. Finally, the rsq R package was employed to calculate partial R2 statistics (i.e., unique variances)16. Descriptive statistics of each variable (e.g., means, medians, and quantiles) are retrievable from the R codes provided online.\nRegarding total cases per one million population, the linear model showed a statistically significant effect for both Group B (b = 0.6483, p = .0002) and Group C (b = 0.8666, p = .0025; as compared to Group A). Temperature was barely significant (Figure 1a; b = \u20130.1232, p = .0424). As anticipated, life expectancy was significant (Figure 1c; b = 0.5544, p = 6.33\u00d710-14). The model\u2019s adjusted R2 was .6409 (i.e., approximatively 64% of the observed variance was explained). The amount of unique variance \u2013 i.e., the variance explained by a certain variable by controlling for all the other variables in the model \u2013 accounted for by the BCG variables was 12.50%. The amount of unique variance accounted for by life expectancy and the country\u2019s mean temperature was 34.52% and 2.37%, respectively. Since life expectancy was the strongest predictor of cases, we reran the analyses only with those countries with a life expectancy higher than 78 (n = 45). This way, the mean life expectancy was homogeneous across BCG groups (A: 80.92\u00b12.31; B: 82.41\u00b11.27; C: 81.33\u00b12.44). The pattern of results was essentially the same. There was a statistically significant effect for both Group B (Figure 2a; b = 0.6122, p = .0024) and Group C (Figure 2a; b = 0.6511, p = .0326). The temperature had no significant effect. The amount of unique variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 19.78%.\nRegarding total deaths per one million population, the linear model again showed a statistically significant effect for both Group B (b = 0.7262, p = .0007) and Group C (b = 1.495, p = 7.11\u00d710-5). While life expectancy was significant (Figure 1d; b = 0.4251, p = 6.20\u00d710-6), the country\u2019s mean temperature was not (Figure 1b; b = \u2013 0.0761, p = .3453). The model\u2019s adjusted R2 was .5473. The amount of unique variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 20.37%. The amount of unique variance accounted for by life expectancy and the country\u2019s mean temperature was 20.33% and 0%, respectively. Again, since life expectancy was a strong predictor in the model, we reran the analyses only with those countries with a life expectancy higher than 78 (n = 40). The pattern of results was the same. There was a statistically significant effect for\n5\nboth Group B (b = 0.7918, p = .0011) and Group C (b = 1.498, p = 8.05\u00d710-5). The temperature had no significant effect. The amount of unique variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 38.39%.\nRegarding the ratio between deaths and cases, the linear model showed a statistically significant effect for Group C (b = 1.140, p = .0267) but not Group B (b = 0.1356, p = .6442). This time, life expectancy was not significant (b = \u20130.1294, p = .3019). By contrast, the country\u2019s mean temperature was significant (b = 0.2629, p = .0226). The model\u2019s adjusted R2 was .1019. The amount of variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 3.39%.\nFinally, a potential issue of the above analyses is that we used data that were not corrected by the onset of the spread of the virus. We are now in the middle of the rapid development of a pandemic and the time since the onset significantly differs across different countries, which may serve as a potentially confounding factor. To address this issue, we utilized the curves of the cumulative number of confirmed cases by the number of days since 100th case (Figure 3a), which was reported on a website17. Since we did not obtain the numerical data behind the figure in the website, we classified the 70 countries into three groups, that is, high (h), middle(m), and low(l) growth rate (Figure 3a; Boundary between h and m was approximately 2500 cases and the one between m and l was approximately 1400 cases at Day 15 since 100 cases; The countries in which 15 days was not reached, the value of Day 15 was estimated by projecting the growth curve to 15th day). While based on a rough classification, this analysis was useful to explore the potential impact of the country\u2019s onset of the virus on our findings. The Group A countries significantly tend to be classified in lower growth group compared to Groups B and C countries (as a single group) with all the 68 countries with known BCG policy (Figure 3b; Chi-squared test: p = 0.0002; B and C groups were combined for this test). As in the linear regression models, given that life expectancy may affect growth rate, we also conducted a Chi-squared test after excluding the countries that had a shorter life expectancy (\u226478 years old, n = 40), and found that the difference remained significant after the exclusion (Figure 3c; Chi-squared test: p < 0.0001; B and C groups were combined for this test), where pvalue became even smaller adjusting life expectancy despite the decrease of sample number. Both the analyses thus showed that Group A countries tended to exhibit a\n6\nlower growth rate compared to Groups B and C countries regardless of their life expectancy."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Associations of BCG policy with COVID-19 after controlling two major confounding factors In this study, we have shown that the countries that currently adopt universal BCG vaccination programs (Group A) have, compared to the other countries, a lower number of cases and deaths per one million people. The countries that no longer recommend BCG vaccination for everyone (Group B) and those that have never had universal BCG vaccination programs (Group C) reports more cases and deaths. We have also evaluated the impact of two potentially confounding factors, the country\u2019s life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020. Crucially, the effects of BCG groups on the two dependent variables remain significant, even when the country\u2019s life expectancy and temperature are controlled for. The amount of variance explained by BCG vaccination is about 12.50% and 20% for cases and deaths per one million population, respectively. The percentage of explained variance is greatly increased when only countries with a life expectancy above 78 years are considered (about 20% and 38% for cases and deaths, respectively). Also, only Group C appears to play a role in the deaths/cases ratio and explains little more than 3% of the observed variance. This latter result may suggest that, unlike cases and deaths per one million population, the death rate is weakly affected by the type of BCG vaccination policy adopted by the country. We thus hypothesize that the protective effect of the vaccine, if any, may consist of a significant reduction of the spread of the virus rather than a reduced mortality rate. It is also possible that the vaccine prevents progression of the disease after infection, since only the persons with severe symptoms tend to be able to receive PCR tests in many of the countries at present. This hypothesis requires additional empirical corroboration. Finally, in line with the results of the linear regression analysis, the Chi-squared analyses highlight that BCG vaccination policy appears to affect how quickly this virus spreads. Taken together, these results suggest that the overall impact of BCG vaccination on the COVID-19related cases and deaths is, at the very least, non-negligible and worth of further empirical investigation.\n7\nWe have reported that a large part of the variance in the two dependent variables is explained by life expectancy, while the effect of temperature seems to be marginal at best. This is not surprising, considering the fact that age is a major risk factor in COVID-1918,19. Life expectancy is highly correlated with the income level of individuals20 and countries21, which would also be related to the quality of medical care that people can receive. If life expectancy is controlled, higher income and quality of medical care may decrease the risk and mortality of diseases in general, which is expected to decrease the positive effect of life expectancy on the risks in COVID-19. Considering the highly significant contribution of life expectancy on the risks, we could consider that the income level or the quality of medical care cannot be the confounding factor that explains the association between BCG vaccination and the risks in COVID-19. Regarding the tight relationships between age and mortality in COVID-1918,19, BCG protection may wane with time since vaccination22, and it could be potentially contributing to the higher mortality in aged populations to some extent. These possibilities need to be examined by further analyses.\nAs seen, the average temperature in countries exhibits a small and sometimes even non-significant negative correlation with the risks of COVID-19 infection and mortality. That said, we have not assessed the effect of humidity, which we plan to do in the near future, since absolute humidity is considered to be associated with influenza infection23,24. However, it is unlikely that absolute humidity significantly affects the results. In fact, absolute humidity does not seem to play any major role in the transmission rates of the COVID-1925. Moreover, absolute humidity and temperature are usually highly correlated, and it is thus unlikely that humidity may play a major role in explaining the spread of the COVID-19 if the temperature does not.\nBCG vaccination policy is associated with a lower COVID-19 growth rate We are still in the midst of the pandemic, during which the virus keeps spreading in most of the countries (except for China, where the rise has nearly been stopped). Also, the role of the observed between-country differences concerning the date of the spread of the COVID-19 is still unclear. In brief, the current state of affairs might change quickly and, therefore, our findings should be interpreted with caution. That being said, we have found a highly significant difference among the BCG groups of the slope of increase of the cases in log scale, that is, adjusted by the\n8\nday when 100th cases have been achieved. While this analysis is based on a somewhat subjective classification of the slope steepness in each country, and the number of countries assessed is only 68 here, the result indicates that the difference of the onset cannot be a major contributing factor underlying the association between COVID-19 indices and BCG vaccination. The Group B countries are heterogenous regarding 1) the years in which the vaccination started and stopped12 and 2) the strain of the vaccine26. Also, in the A groups, there are differences in coverage levels among countries27. For example, many of A countries reside in Africa, where BCG vaccination is mostly mandatory12, but coverage is not necessarily high27, which could potentially have distorted the results. However, in this regard, analyzing those countries with a life expectancy above 78 years, which excluded most of the African countries, did not substantially affect the results. Since the initiation of the spread of COVID-19 in African countries were relatively late compared to the ones in other continents, it might be necessary to conduct similar analyses by taking the coverage rate into consideration after further spreading of the disease.\nPotential mechanisms BCG, originally developed against tuberculosis, is hypothesized to develop \u2018frontline\u2019 immunity, training it to respond non-specifically to certain viruses with greater intensity7,3,4. This idea is supported by clinical and epidemiological studies, which showed that BCG appeared to lower overall mortality in children5,2,6. BCG, which can remain alive in the human skin for several months, triggers not only specific memory B and T cells, but also stimulates the innate blood cells for a prolonged period7. In a randomized placebo-controlled study, it was shown that BCG vaccination protects against experimental infection with a weakened form of the yellow fever virus7,4. By showing a strong association of BCG vaccination program with COVID-19-related risks, our results are in line with the idea that BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against COVID-19.\nRecommended future research The retrospective nature of the study requires extra caution in interpreting the results presented here because they may be affected by unknown confounding factors. Examples include the country\u2019s overall hygienic conditions, number of PCR testing per population, ethnical genetic backgrounds, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 strains, strength of the mitigation/suppression policy, people\u2019s compliance to such\n9\npolicies, and culture/life style (e.g., shaking hands and hugging, wearing masks, and washing hands). Some of these elements might affect the observed relationships between COVID-19 indices and BCG vaccination policy by affecting both the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and BCG vaccination policy in an indirect manner. These and other factors need to be examined in future studies (or even before formal publication of this manuscript in a journal with peer review; see \u201cproduction note\u201d below).\nAs outlined above, we have employed a rough classification for the statistical test for the relationship between BCG groups and the growth curve of COVID-19 in each country with a limited number of observations (Figure 3a). Obviously, it would be preferable to use continuous data to produce a more accurate estimation of the impact of BCG vaccination policy on how quickly the virus spreads. Also, examining variables such as BCG strain26 and the timing and the number of vaccinations (including the ones for other diseases) would be worth some attention. These variables might be easier to be examined in those countries where mandatory BCG vaccination was terminated by investigating the history of vaccination of COVID-19 patients and their symptoms and condition severity. In our study, we used the data that are publicly available from several websites (see Method and results section), which have not been validated by any official institutions (to the best of our knowledge). Therefore, further analyses are recommendable once the data\u2019s reliability has been certified. It may also be worth looking into the relationship between the age of BCG vaccination and the risk of infection and severity /mortality in COVID-19 patients18,19. An SNP in IL-1b (IL1B; rs16944) was found to affect the trained immunity response induced by BCG7, and it is of interest to evaluate the association of this SNP and the protective effect of BCG vaccine against SARSCoV-2."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study reports significant associations of BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality from COVID-19 in 136 countries, even when the country\u2019s life expectancy and average temperature are controlled for.

Here we analyze the mobility data from 41 cities to look at the effect of these interventions.\nWe downloaded mobility data from the Citymapper Mobility Index (CMI) from March 2,\n2020 to March 26, 2020 for our analysis.3 Citymapper is a public transit and map service spanning 41 urban cities globally. It has over 20 million users and helps optimize routes for public transit, biking, walking and ridesharing applications; it does not support personal automobile navigation. The CMI is based on planned trips on the Citymapper application.3 We tabulated the data on implementation of governmental social distancing measures between March 2 and March 26 from official government and media websites. We classified a city to have instituted social distancing measures if non-essential businesses were closed; these measures were further classified as moderate or intense based on the intensity of closure. We estimated the effect of time and social distancing measures using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model.\nWe had a total of 1,025 observations across 41 cities (25 observations per city) in our\ndataset. The median mobility across cities on March 2, 2020 was 100% (IQR: 94%, 107%), which decreased to a median of 10% (IQR: 7%, 17%) on March 26, 2020 (Figure 1).

There was no difference in mobility reduction based on whether the measures were moderate or intense.\nThe reduction of 3.4% per day in mobility can be explained by the repeated emphasis on\nsocial distancing by public health authorities. In addition, social distancing measures introduced by governments reduced the mobility in the concerned cities by 23%. Our findings may not be generalizable to the population that does not use public transport.

Here, we assess the health seeking behavior of residents with acute respiratory infections (ARI) during the outbreak of COVID-19 between December 2019 and March 2020 in Wuhan, China."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Between March 10 and 24, 2020, two population-based surveys were conducted in Wuhan to understand the health seeking behaviors of patients suffering from ARI during the COVID-19 outbreak. The surveys included: i) a telephone-and-online survey of 2,595 adults (individuals aged \u226518 years); ii) an online survey of 816 children (individuals aged <18 years). The study participants were current residents who had lived in Wuhan for at least three months before the date of the survey. Based on the assumption that 6% of the population would have ARI [3], we calculated that a minimum sample size of 784 participants per age group (i.e., 3-17, 18-39, 40-59, 60 years of age) would allow a healthcare seeking proportion of 60% to be estimated, with a statistical significance level of 5%, and 14% of marginal error.\nThe telephone-and-online survey among adults was conducted in two steps. First, we randomly dialed Wuhan mobile phone numbers to invite the participants through a computer-assisted interviewing system. An overview of the study was\nprovided at the beginning of each call. We attempted to contact each generated number twice a day at different hours and one more time on the following day; if no contact was established after the third call, the number was classified as invalid or unreachable. Second, we sent a telephone message with the online link of our questionnaire to the identified participants, who were asked to complete the questionnaire on their own. Of 48,965 calls answered, 2,858 persons (5.8%) completed the questionnaires (Figure S1 in Appendix).\nThe online survey of children was commissioned to the ePanel data company, which has a national online survey library with emails and household information registered. An online link to our questionnaire was provided to Wuhan families with children. The questionnaire was answered by the parents of recruited children. Among 35,770 email invitations, 933 persons (2.6%) completed the questionnaires (Figure S1 in Appendix).\nRandom dials/emails with proportional quota sampling were used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the general population, with quotas based on sex (female-to-male 1:1). Characteristics of respondents were collected, including age and sex. We also obtained the history of ARI for respondents in the last three months (presence of fever and/or any respiratory symptoms, e.g., cough and sore throat), and if they sought medical assistance for these symptoms. Questionnaires completed in less than 2 minutes and containing logical errors were excluded from the analysis (Figure S1 in Appendix). The full questionnaires are reported in Appendix.\nTo estimate the proportion of individuals with ARI and their probability of seeking medical assistance, participants\u2019 ages were weighted to match the age structure of the Wuhan population. This corrected the underrepresentation of\nindividuals aged 60+ years. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used for binary variables. Two-sided P values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

Among the reasons for not seeking medical care, parents reported concerns with nosocomial infections for their sick children, while experiencing mild illness was linked to lack of seeking care in adults. Our findings highlight the possible relevance of self-isolation at home and/or at designated medical facilities to manage mild cases and lower the load on hospitals [4].\nThe proportion of seeking medical assistance of ARI patients during COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was lower than that during 2009 influenza pandemic (35.4% vs. 46.1%)[3]. The health seeking behavior of typical patients with ARI may differ from that of COVID-19 cases. We asked adult participants if they were diagnosed as laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases. Only 2.2% of them (57/2,595) self-reported to be a laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 case. Among COVID-19 patients, 35.1% (20/57) did not answer the questions regarding healthcare seeking behavior. Hence there was not enough data to compare healthcare seeking behavior between COVID-19 cases and those with typical respiratory diseases. Additionally, the number of questionnaires completed by participants aged 60+ years was relatively small (n=361), probably due to the hurdles encountered by this segment of the population to fill an online\nsurvey.

However, these estimates were mainly based on laboratory-confirmed cases captured by surveillance system, which may overestimate COVID-19 severity. In fact, we found that the majority of mild cases did not seek medical assistance and thus were hardly detectable by surveillance systems. The number of COVID-19 cases in the community level remains unclear due to changes in health seeking behaviors during an outbreak; an assessment of the full severity pyramid of COVID-19 is lacking.

This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time.\nMETHODS: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet on platforms: Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry, from January 2020 to 29.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.20). We present trend analysis with a support of natural language processing techniques.\nRESULTS: We identified seven temporal major clusters of interest on the topic COVID-2019: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Social distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield, 7) Restrictions releasing. There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government \u201cdeclared war against disease\u201d around 11/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term 'antiviral mask' in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection.\nCONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.\nkeywords: Internet, medical sociology, epidemiological monitoring, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, communications media, risk perception\nINTRODUCTION\nAlthough a large part of the Polish population has heard about coronaviruses for the first time a few weeks\nago, in reality they face less dangerous coronaviruses causing simple cold all the time. Only the emergence of a novel strain \u2013 SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan gave the word \u201cCoronavirus\u201d (pl \u201cKoronawirus\u201d) a new dramatic meaning. Before disease introduction, less than a half of surveyed Poles believed that \u201cCoronavirus\u201d is the most important topic in the second half of February 2020 (1). The disease was not detected in Poland until 04.03.2020. This topic did not receive much attention until the introduction and only started to drive media and social life afterwards. During opinion polls performed on 09-10.03.20, 63% of respondents reported that this is a serious threat for Poland, 40% that this is a serious threat for their family and 73% that this is a serious threat for the Polish Economy (2). Opinion polls performed on 25-27.03.20 showed that almost 90% surveyed Poles declared \u201cKoronawirus\u201d as the most important current threat for them (3) [to disclose - different methodologies were used in each of these studies].\nRisk perception is not as straightforward as the term used in risk assessment, i.e. value at risk - expected\nvalue of loss (infection or death) with given probability of an event, but a complicated socio-psychological construct with biases and errors (4). For instance, on average people believe that negative events such as infection and death are less likely to happen to them than to others (5). In the previous epidemics (A/H1N1, SARS, Ebola) in the Internet era societies (such as Polish (6)) experienced quite similar phases of interest starting from fear, then moving to practical issues such as prevention and finishing with scapegoating (7). Recently media activities are being analysed worldwide to better understand perception and spread of diseases (8) as COVID-19 (9). Social media can serve as a valuable source of information as well as disinformation about the virus globally, fuelling panic and creating socalled infodemics (10), at unprecedented speed. Propaganda and persuasion techniques are widely used on the Internet, easily reaching certain target groups susceptible to conspiracy theories and effectively polarizing societies (9, 11). Panic-related behaviours accompanying a virus outbreak (7) are influencing the epidemic spread, with the Internet being the main mediating mechanism. This could lead to destructive collective behaviour, such as e.g. xenophobia against people from affected countries (12). Moreover, infodemiology and infoveillance (10) should be employed for standard surveillance purposes within the emerging field of \u201cdigital epidemiology\u201d and in the area of public health.\nIn this study, by quantitative analysis of \u201cdigital traces/footprints\u201d on the Internet (social and traditional\nmedia), we concentrate on the number and nature of events such as information queries and information propagation. The Internet, social media, apps and web-information are now our every-day life experience and practice. Tracking \u201cdigital footprints\u201d of Internet users brings understanding of customers\u2019 behavior and preferences on a large scale in the commercial and scientific sectors. Up to our knowledge there were no previous studies quantitatively linking the Internet activities and perception of infectious diseases in Poland (13, 14), except for our own studies (15, 16) and some straightforward attempts such as correlating the incidence of influenza with Google Trends (8). Moreover, during the first few weeks of COVID-19 pandemic a tremendous amount of studies appeared targeting English and Asian languages (17) with an underrepresentation of European countries. Thus the present study is a first exploratory attempt filling this gap and continuing a preliminary research on \u201cKoronawirus\u201d perception in Poland before disease introduction (15) representing a more general approach highlighting the role of social sciences during COVID-19 pandemic (16) in public health.\nThe aim of this article is to present some common tools useful in studying epidemic dynamics. We collected\nthe information-seeking behaviors (digital paths) and compared them with real time events. These efforts are our contribution to public health surveillance (17) by collecting and analyzing health-related information. We argue that presented tools are able to track population\u2019s behavior and monitor or even predict (local) outbreaks of diseases or abnormal behaviors (like social panic or harmful beliefs caused by fake news). Such data analytics may provide near real time outbreak information in various formats, independently from official statistics or surveys reports. We aimed to describe phases of interest of SARS-CoV-2 in Polish Internet, as well as to indicate the most important topics of social perception of the new disease.\nMETHODOLOGY\nWe primarily analyzed quantitative digital footprint data on the Internet from January 2020 to 29.04.2020,\nincluding their representativeness. The unit of our analysis is a daily interest, defined in a different form for each platform. As a main keyword in investigated platforms (14) we chose a colloquial term \u201cKoronawirus\u201d/\u201dCoronavius\u201d due to its high penetration in the society. Other related keywords in use are much less popular, except for Wikipedia, where the medical term SARS-CoV-2 was frequently chosen (16). For comparative perspective we collect data from the Polish Internet to archive the highest possible range of communication types and channels:\na) from Google a daily relative value of \u201cKoronawirus\u201d in terms of queries intensity and news picked by Google from Google Trends;\nb) from YouTube a daily relative value of \u201cKoronawirus\u201d in terms of queries intensity from Google Trends;\nc) from Twitter a daily number of Tweets with #Koronawirus hashtag using the Twitter API (the only one allowing us to measuring the active Internet usage - production and retweeting of information);\nd) from EventRegistry a daily number of news/articles with the topic \u201cKoronawirus\u201d;\ne) from Wikipedia a daily number of page visits for \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d articles.\nIt is important to underline that data can be biased e.g. due to content presenting algorithms on the media\nplatforms. For instance, technological giants Google and Twitter are supposed to implement fact verification algorithms to filter out false information and promote official information (e.g. showing widgets related to COVID19) and we can rely only on their searching engines after filtration. This may jeopardize the reproducibility of our results. In our study each considered Internet platform is described separately and has its own target audience and communication style. The main data comes from Google Trends due to the highest share of Polish Internet users. Despite some disadvantages and exploratory nature of this study, it provides us with an opportunity to analyse a huge amount of digital footprint data at low cost and in a short time.\nOur research includes further methodological limitations. First, the population structure of the Internet users\nmay lead to under/over-estimation of observed phenomena. We cover ca. 28 millions Polish language speaking residents of Poland representing over 85% of the literate population (18). The Polish Internet users are younger (especially among content creators (19)) with females prevailing (especially among content receivers (20)) as\ncompared to the average population. Our results do not describe the perception of the oldest groups, due to digital exclusions, health literacy limitations or consideration of social media as less informative (21). Moreover, we have not studied the geographical or social status variability. Although the collected data can be successfully treated as a \"digital proof\", the research on this phenomena should be considered in statu nascendi, therefore the conclusions of our analysis should be verified by in-depth triangulational studies (22).\nRESULTS: GOOGLE TRENDS\nGoogle has 95% share among Polish Internet users (around 26 Millions) with over 8 billion entries per\nmonth and is the undisputed leader on the Polish Internet market (18). Interest in novel Coronavirus on Google can be measured by the number of search queries (Fig. 1). According to own calculations based on Google Ads there were around 5 million searches of term \u201cKoronawirus\u201d in March 2020 (Google does not provide absolute search values). YouTube has a 68% share among Polish Internet users with about 700 million entries per month (18). In addition, streams from the mobile app should be taken into account, as it is the most popular app on Poles\u2019 smartphones (18). As YouTube belongs to Google corporation, it is a part of Google Trends solution and for our analysis, we selected videos on the main subject of \"Koronawirus\".\nThe topic of the \u201cKoronawirus\u201d occurred in Polish Internet first time in the middle of January. Before the\ndisease introduction to Poland three phases of interest can be distinguished. They were analyzed in our former publications (15, 16). The next three stages may be considered after the outbreak (Fig. 1):\n1. China-related phase: from the end of January and beginning of February when the epidemic was announced\nand confirmed in China. We observe a small peak around 25.01.20 (e.g. death of Liang Wudong) and around 29.01.20 (e.g. first case in Germany);\n2. Italy-related phase: from the middle of February till the end of February (when the number of infections\nrapidly increased in Italy). We see a clear peak around 27.02.20 (e.g. fake news about possible introduction of the disease to Poland (23));\n3. Waiting phase: beginning of March (waiting for introduction - decreased attention). We see a small peak on\nintroduction day (04.03.20) ;\n4. Mitigation phase: around 11/12.03 - mitigation (declaration of main restrictions) and epidemic (real-time\nR0~2.5 estimation) phase with the highest interest in \u201cKoronawirus\u201d;\n5. middle of March - \u201csocial distancing\u201d and \u201clockdown\u201d phase (real-time R0~2 estimation) with small peaks\ncorresponding to new restriction;\n6. from the end of March and the beginning of April - anticrisis act (in Polish media called \u201cAnticrisis shield\u201d)\nphase with high peaks corresponding to anticrisis shield declarations (real-time R0~1.5 estimation).\n7. Second part of April. Restrictions releasing phase (real-time R0~1.2 estimation).\nIt is important to note, that until disease introduction to Poland there were no Coronavirus related searches\nin top 25 Google queries at all. Although \u201cKoronawirus\u201d related queries were observed in top trends before the introduction of the disease to Poland, they start to dominate top trends queries only after the massive mitigation measures were taken such as school/university and border closures declarations between 09-12.03.20 (Fig. 1). After the first confirmed case in the country we can see a peak on that day (04.03.20) and substantial growth after important measures were implemented by Polish authorities (09-12.03.20).\nSearch activity for information on the infection in Poland was still much lower than in countries with higher\nglobal connectivity (24), which earlier became epidemic (Fig. 2) with some exceptions such as Sweden (a country with a significantly different approach towards COVID-19 mitigation). On the last day of the investigated period \u2013 07.04 \u2013 there were 4848 officially laboratory confirmed cumulative cases, so official prevalence in Poland was around 100 per million inhabitants, which was below the European Union average.\nRESULTS: OTHER PLATFORMS\nWikipedia traffic is another indicator of social activity. Wikipedia has an Internet coverage of 57% with\nover 350 million page visits per month among Polish Internet users (18). There is a significant overrepresentation of users with tertiary education inhabiting big cities (affinity index>120 (25)). We looked at the history of page views and discussions around the articles \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d (pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2). There were 492584 total page views on the article \u201cSARS-Cov-2\u201d (10.02-07.04.20).\nWe choose EventRegistry (eventregistry.org) as a traditional media search engine because it has a large\nrange of online news services representing a broad political spectrum. Besides, it gives priority to digital versions of other broadcasting channels, including television, radio or newspapers. During 15.01-07.04.20, 404897 representative articles were selected (the non-systematic sampling method was applied) with inclusion criteria: keyword \u2013 \u201cKoronawirus\u201d or topic \u2013 Coronavirus in an article body, and country \u2013 Poland and language \u2013 Polish. In the traditional media the weekly seasonality of articles (less articles during weekends on average) is especially prominent.\nTwitter in Poland has relatively low popularity (~3 million registered users or less than 8% of the country\npopulation) and is mainly used by expats, journalists and politicians (26). However, Twitter provides an API for data acquisition which allows us to collect 704548 tweets with #Koronawirus hashtag during 15.01-07.04.20.\nDISCUSSION: COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT PLATFORMS\nTo compare the interest on COVID-19 on different Internet platforms we visualized the available queries\nand interest measurements as time series together and marked events important to the Polish public (Fig. 4). The largest peak of interest in our analysis for all platforms on 11/12.03.20 was a day of the pandemic declaration by WHO and the declaration of massive mitigation program (27) in Poland. We see that traditional news agencies (well represented in Event Registry) as well as Google searches could precede and form more distinct and sharp peaks of\ninterests than social media platforms. Moreover, discussions on social-content media (YouTube and Wikipedia) demonstrate smoother interest trajectories (Fig. 4) than information providers (news from EventRegistry, Google).\nWe detected time lags between different platforms for given topics (e.g. traditional news media are ahead of\ncommentary media in the case of fake news on a possible disease introduction) in phases 1-4 (Fig. 5). It could imply that social media disseminate information via word-of-mouth spreading mechanisms. On the other hand, traditional media have journalists hired to search and select most interesting topics quickly (29). It leads to faster response to events by news agencies (represented by EventRegistry) than social media. The strongest lag (1 day) is observed between EventRegistry (the most ahead of) and Twitter (the most delayed) (Fig. 5).\nWe detected time lags between official SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk perception. For instance interest in protective masks ahead incidence 3 days before. On the other hand increase in incidence can be linked with decrease of \u201cKoronawirus\u201d search in Google 6 days later [Fig. 6].\nTo quantify the similarity in interest on different platforms we calculated Pearson correlations coefficients\nof the time series (Fig. 7). Additionally, the popularity of terms related to COVID-19 were also investigated. Due to limitations imposed by the Editorial Board they are presented in the APPENDIX. The majority of measured terms are positively correlated. Protective mask as a signal of fear/perception of risk is less correlated with other variables, more related to information needs. Protective mask and washing hands pair is much less correlated than protective mask and hand disinfection pair, which could mean that people search for professional solutions rather than simple and practical ones. Moreover, high amounts of search queries such as antiviral mask (there is no such medical term) implies that people are searching protection measures defined in non-professional terms (15). Official COVID-19 incidence correlates only weakly positively or even negatively (Fig. 6) with measured interest value so risk perception in Poland is significantly unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring infections, which is contradictory to the situation in some other countries (28).\n(information \u2019noise\u2019) and our task was to extract important events and features from the broad range of the Internet media in Poland. Observing the amount of the Internet queries we have to state that citizens have treated the Internet as a very important (and we assume available) source of knowledge. Our approach targeted quite a wide range of general population with relatively high coverage of Internet users with quite a significant audience variability across platforms. It\u2019s important to mention that our analysis operated on subjective populational perception and there is no direct translation between scientific evidence (e.g. the question of the effectiveness of protective masks in infection prevention) and colloquial knowledge describing infectious disease and fear of acquiring infection (30). The conclusions of our work are as follows:\n1) Retrieved and analyzed data revealed the following six phases of interest of SARS-CoV-2 in Polish\nInternet. In future we should overlap and confront them to the whole process of emergence and extinction of the pandemic. These phases could be names as: 1/ Chinese phase, 2/Italian phase, 3/ Waiting phase, 4/ Epidemic and Mitigation phase, 5/ Social distancing and Lockdown phase, 6/ Anticrisis shield, Restrictions releasing (Fig. 4).\n2) We noticed the differences in platform usage as knowledge (information) providers in the following\nphases of epidemics. Different media (platforms) have separated informative functions. Information media (Wikipedia and Google) do not display some peaks of interest (e.g. for special act against COVID-19), because probably the awareness about the virus and the knowledge on the disease has already been saturated. After the \u201cdefinition need phase 1-2\u201d people seem to be more interested mainly in the update (news information on COVID19) on Twitter, YouTube or other electronic media. This has covered the phase, which might be called \u201cnorms need phase 4-5\u201d, because in this time the most searched topics were protection measures and mitigation behaviors. That is the reason that anti-crisis shield issues gathered more interest in information related media (Google, news article) as well as on politically oriented Twitter than on other social media.\n3) Mitigation strategies have gathered the highest interest in all investigated platforms. What is important,\ndates of released declaration of measures introduction (not dates of enacting or acting in force [29]) were responsible for visible peaks of social interest. This suggests that government's decisions were instantly filtered by social networks implying a high level of social uncertainty. This might be defined as a subtle indicator of pre-panic behaviors. This raises questions about the role of the media in managing the disease and if the ordered measures were really efficient in diminishing the pandemic scale.\n4) The focus on social activity posed in this study revealed trends in common understanding of self-\nprotective measures. This lay-referral framing system of opinions and beliefs should draw attention of public health\nprofessionals to evaluate potential epidemiological risk of infection. Our analysis showed that Poles looked for professional (or quasi-professional) measures of self-protection: \u201cantiviral mask\u201d or \u201chand disinfection\u201d (instead simple \u201cwashing hands\u201d) . We were able to identify at least few misinformation, cognitive errors or fake news, which significantly impact interest on \u201cKoronawirus\u201d topic in Poland. They fall on fertile ground, due to the script mechanism of simplifying reality, where simpler explanations are more easily absorbed by people (11). Especially since epidemiologists and public health professionals do not know enough about COVID-19 yet, and recommendations and opinions of authorities such as WHO or Ministry of Health are still being updated and often being contradictory to previous opinions (e.g. effectiveness of protective mask) causing cognitive dissonance in the public. As a good example we may take the popularity of a product, which does not exist on the medical market such as an \u201cantiviral mask\u201d (see Appendix). We show that scientifically confirmed and effective infection control strategies such as keeping high hygienic standards are not popular among Internet users and pseudo-professional solutions are much more attractive until official recommendations are introduced (Fig. 7).\n5) Low interest of the general public in COVID-19 before the disease introduction could be associated with\na low epidemiological awareness of average Poles, especially when COVID-19 pandemic is massively discussed in traditional and social media by a relatively small but loud group of people (16). It\u2019s worth to mention, that a positive effect of interest in \u201cKoronawirus\u201d could be a probable increase in epidemiological and hygienic knowledge in Polish population which is probably below European average (even health literacy for non-infectious diseases does not differ significantly in comparison to other European countries (21).\n6) Last conclusion is rather an ad hoc recommendation. It seems that the Ministry of Health\u2019s Public\nRelation Team should concentrated more on traditional media and get a quick response instead of using Twitter in a wrong way (e.g. providing daily updates on COVID-19 surveillance on Twitter only without any official database, which can be automatically collected by epidemiologists). Thus, due to the known and empirically confirmed during current outbreak in Poland (31) mechanism of stability seeking in the general population, the authority of the Minister of Health could be better communicated in risk perception management (32).\nIn addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an\nimportant public health disruption event such as epidemics of infectious diseases (10, 17).\nAcknowledgments: We thank PNFN (2019-21) and FU Berlin (FU AvH: 08166500) for partial financial\nsupport.

Disease introduction marked with the vertical line.\nThe most important outcome shows the intensity of seeking the self-protective measures (Fig. A1, A2). On\nFigure A1 we can see that the amount of queries regarding protective masks reached around 50 thousand queries daily. The most interesting got: \"protective mask\". This is a very interesting fact, because before the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland (before 4.03.20) polish health minister \u0141ukasz Szumowski and other health professionals did not recommend masks as individual protection measures. The line on Figure A1 shows that Internet users seeked information before the first case of coronavirus and also when masks were recommended and stated as the condition of movement in public areas.\nFigure A2. The intensity of queries with the phrases \u201canticrisis law\u201d, \"presidential election\", \u201cspecial act on COVID19\u201d, \"antiviral mask\", \"latex gloves\" in Polish Google (15.01-29.04.20) generated using the Google Trend tool.

The most popular epidemiological queries as latex gloves reached around 100 thousands queries daily (Fig. A2) (own estimates based on Google Ads) in peak. It should be noted that professional vocabulary such as \"hand hygiene\" practically does not appear in queries (below the \u201cnoise threshold\u201d compared to other epidemiological terms (Fig. A1, A2)). Queries related to hand hygiene had a peak in late February and beginning of March. Queries related to masks had their peak of popularity at the end of February and the lack of increase in popularity in March (compared to other epidemiological queries (Fig. A1, A2)) may be due to the success of information campaigns on their alleged low effectiveness (in protecting users) or simply due to the lack of the masks on the market.\nFigure A3.

There is a controversial issue of presidential elections, which are supposed to take place on 10.05.20 (Fig. A2).

We followed each country/area for 40 days 8 after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We 9\ndefined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close 10 contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact 11 history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi 12 driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated 13 the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare 14 worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early 15 outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th 16 to 40th days of the following period). 17 Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a 18 total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most 19 cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers 20 (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers 21 (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission 22 played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). 23 Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and 24 sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to 25\nlate outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, 1 police officers, and religious professionals). 2 Conclusions: Work-related transmission is considerable in early Covid-19 3 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW. 4 Implementing preventive/surveillance strategies for high-risk working 5 populations is warranted. 6 7\nIntroduction 1\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was declared by the World Health 2 Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and its local 3 transmission has been reported in many countries [1]. The transmission 4 pathways and the related risk factors are of vital interest in efforts to control 5 the outbreak [2-4]. 6\n7 Work-related transmission is a crucial contributor to infectious disease 8 outbreaks. The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its transmission 9\npatterns could lead to high transmission rates among workers. For example, 10 cases of Covid-19 largely present with mild or no symptoms [5]. Also, some 11 studies have found similar transmissibility from asymptomatic and 12 symptomatic patients [6-8]. These characteristics could lead to a higher 13 probability of work-related transmission as people with mild symptoms could 14 continue to work, travel or otherwise conduct business and spread the 15 disease to others during work or commuting. Furthermore, the infected 16 workers can subsequently transmit the virus to other people in their 17 households and communities. Therefore, it is contingent to better understand 18 the epidemiology of work-related transmission of Covid-19 to implement 19 evidence-based prevention and protection strategies in workplaces. 20\n21 Most of the studies to date focus on occupational exposure among healthcare 22 workers (HCWs). Work-related transmission among HCWs constituted a large 23 proportion in previous coronavirus outbreaks. HCWs comprised 37-63% of 24 suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in highly affected 25\nAsian countries, and around 43.5% of Middle East respiratory syndrome 1 (MERS) cases [9-11]. There was high prevalence of infection among HCWs 2 despite the introduction of precautions against nosocomial transmission 3 [12,13]. 4\n5 In contrast, there is limited discussion on the work-related risks among 6 workers such as taxi drivers, tour guides, cleaners and janitors, and civil 7 servants, who have frequent contact with the public in their daily routines or 8 have workplaces with higher risks of virus exposure [14]. 9\n10 In this study, we aimed to identify the occupations at higher risk of Covid-19 11 transmission, and to explore the temporal distribution of work-related cases 12 among local transmission. 13\n14\nMethods 15\nStudy population selection 16 We extracted and included all locally transmitted Covid-19 confirmed cases 17 from the publicized government investigation reports from six Asian 18 countries/areas, including Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, 19 and Vietnam. These countries/areas were selected since they shared some 20 common temporo-spatial characteristics. First, they are proximal to Mainland 21 China, where the first outbreak of Covid-19 was reported. Second, the first 22 cases of these countries/areas were imported cases from Mainland China in 23 mid-January. Third, the first locally transmitted cases in these countries/areas 24 were identified around late January to early February. We followed each 25\ncountry/area for forty days since the report of the first locally transmitted case 1 and excluded the imported cases. The study population selection process is 2 presented in Fig. 1. 3\n4 Categorization of work-related cases 5 Each case report was reviewed by two occupational physicians and 6 categorized by the work-relatedness. Subsequently, the possible work-related 7 cases were grouped into two categories based on whether the transmission 8 source was known: 9 1. Category 1: had clear close contact with a confirmed case due to work, 10 such as a registered nurse having a history of directly caring for a 11 patient who is an index confirmed case; and 12"}, {"heading": "2. Category 2: unknown transmission source; no apparent contact history 13", "text": "but likely to be infected in the working environment, such as an airport 14 taxi driver without clear contact history to any confirmed case. 15\n16 The cases with occupations and contact histories were coded according to the 17 International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 (ISCO-08) [15]. We 18 defined health professionals, medical doctors, and nursing professionals as 19 healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding the high risk of infection due to the 20 work. We further grouped the occupations into drivers and transport workers, 21 services and sales workers, cleaning and domestic workers, public safety 22 workers, religious workers, construction workers, and other groups according 23 to the jobs similarity. 24 All differences between the occupation physicians were reviewed by the third 25\ninvestigator, who is a physician-epidemiologist to reach a consensus. 1\n2 Statistical analysis 3 Descriptive analysis was performed to compare the trends of daily reported 4 cases in the locally transmitted cases, work-related cases, and HCW groups. 5\n6 For each country/area, we calculated the intervals between the first reported 7 locally transmitted case and the first reported work-related case, as well as 8 the interval between the first reported locally transmitted case and the first 9\nreported HCW case. We also summarized the number of cases for each 10 occupation across country/area and stratified the cases into early and late 11 transmission periods. We defined early transmission period as the first 10 12 days from when the first locally transmitted case was reported, and late 13 transmission period as the 11th to 40th day of the study period. We enlisted the 14 most common occupations in each period and compared the distribution of 15 occupations in order to examine the temporal difference. We performed Chi-16 squared tests or Fisher exact tests to compare the proportions of work-related 17 cases and HCW cases among all local transmissions between early and late 18 transmission periods. 19\n20 We also conducted sensitivity analysis comparing the results between the six 21 countries/areas and five countries/areas excluding Japan. We excluded Japan 22 due to its different case reporting system from other countries/areas. Unlike 23 other countries/areas that have central reporting systems, Japan had cases 24 reported from each prefecture separately. Differences in reporting 25\nmechanisms and case information across prefectures could potentially bias 1 the results. The descriptive analysis was performed by R software (version 2 3.6.2). The figures were plotted by Microsoft\u00ae EXCEL\u2122. 3\n4\n5\nResults 6\nWe identified 2,002 officially confirmed Covid-19 cases within the designated 7 40-day interval among the six countries/areas. We excluded 1,312 imported 8 cases and included 690 locally transmitted cases in the final analysis. The 9\ncases included in this study were reported between January 23, 2020 and 10 March 14, 2020 (Supplement table). 11\n12 103 possible work-related cases were included for analysis (including 37 13 cases from Category 1 and 66 from Category 2), accounting for 15% of local 14 transmissions. Among the possible work-related cases, 22% were HCW. In 15 addition to HCWs, we identified other occupations that were at higher risk of 16 work-related transmission. The high-risk occupations included car, taxi and 17 van drivers (N=15), shop salesperson (N=7), domestic housekeepers (N=7), 18 religious professionals (N=6), construction laborers (N=5), tour guides (N=5), 19 and so on. In terms of occupation grouping, the groups with the most cases 20 were HCWs, drivers and transport workers, services and sales workers, 21 cleaning and domestic workers, and public safety workers. (Table 1) 22\n23\n3 ISCO-08: International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 4 * Mainly from workplace clusters without detailed occupational description of 5 each case 6\n7\nThere were 31 incident confirmed cases during early transmission period, 1 while there were 72 incident cases occurring in late transmission period. The 2 most common occupations during early transmission were shop salesperson 3 (N=6), car, taxi and van drivers (N=5), construction laborer (N=4), religious 4 professionals (N=3), tour guides (N=3), and receptionist (N=3). Meanwhile, 5 most common occupations during late transmission were health professionals 6 (N=23), car, taxi and van drivers (N=10), domestic housekeepers (N=6), 7 police officers (N=3), and religious professionals (N=3) (Table 2). 8\n11 ISCO-08: International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 12 aP-values were calculated with Fisher exact test. 13 14\n15\nNotably, there were different composition of high-risk occupations across 1 transmission periods. Car, taxi and van driver and religious professionals 2 were the most common occupations in both early and late transmission 3 periods. Retail salespersons and tour guides were predominant in the early 4 transmission period, while HCWs, domestic housekeepers, and police officers 5 were the leading high-risk occupations in the late transmission period. 6 Furthermore, while the proportion of work-related transmission decreased for 7 shop salespersons, construction laborers and receptionists, there was a 8 discernable increase in proportion of HCWs in the late period (P <0.001, 9\nTable 2) 10 11 Fig. 2A illustrates new daily confirmed local transmission, possible work-12 related transmission, and HCW cases over time in the six countries/areas. 13 While the number of daily confirmed local transmission increased, the number 14 of work-related cases reported in each day remained relatively steady 15 throughout the follow-up period. We found 48% of locally transmitted cases in 16 the early transmission period were due to possible work-related transmission, 17 compared to 11% in the late transmission period (Chi-squared statistic = 18 61.84, P <0.0001). 19\n20 In further sensitivity analysis excluding Japan because of its different case 21 reporting system, the daily confirmed local transmissions became relatively 22 constant (Fig. 2B). After excluding Japan, possible work-related cases 23 comprised 44% of the locally transmitted cases in the early period, while only 24 18% in the late period (Chi-squared statistic=18.8, P-value<0.0001). 25\n1 HCW comprised 22% of the possible work-related cases. Moreover, we found 2 the occurrence of Covid-19 transmission among the HCW was relatively late 3 compared to the non-HCW population. Fig. 2(A) and Fig. 2(B) showed a two-4 week lag of the first HCW case after the local Covid-19 outbreak (median lag: 5 15 days, IQR 13-20 days). The median time lag from the report of the first 6 possible work-related case to the first HCW case was 13.5 days (IQR: 12.3-7 14.5 days) among the study population. Furthermore, nearly all the HCWs 8 (95%) had clear and traceable contact history with a confirmed case 9\n(Category 1); while only 43.2% of the non-HCW cases could trace back the 10 infection source (P-value<0.001). 11\n12\n13 In further sensitivity analysis excluding Japan, non-HCW accounted for 93% 14 possible work-related cases. The median lag of HCW transmissions after the 15 local Covid-19 outbreak was 14 days (range: 10-32 days), and the median lag 16 from the first possible work-related case to the first HCW case was 13 days 17 (range: 10-14 days). 18\n19\nDiscussion 20\nIn this study, we identified several high-risk occupations for Covid-19 infection 21 that are rarely discussed [16]. These high-risk occupations comprised almost 22 a half of local transmission during the early period of outbreak. In terms of the 23 occupational risks of Covid-19 infection among the HCW, we found a median 24 of two-week lag of HCW case after local transmission outbreaks. Moreover, 25\nnon-HCW comprised the majority of the possible work-related cases and most 1 of the cases were not able to trace back the infection sources. 2\n3 Our results indicate the importance of work-related transmission in the local 4 Covid-19 outbreak. One novel finding of this study is that the early 5 transmissions were highly related to some occupations beyond healthcare 6 settings, including taxi driver, salesperson, tour guide, and housekeeper and 7 cleaner. Taxi drivers, salespersons and tour guides are at higher risk because 8 of frequent contact with travelers. In fact, one of the earliest locally transmitted 9\ncases in Taiwan was a taxi driver who took a passenger returning from 10 mainland China. This case led to a family cluster of Covid-19 with four more 11 locally transmitted cases [17]. Another example was an infected worker 12 involved in a reported cluster leading to three more local cases within a 13 household in Singapore [4]. On the other hand, housekeepers and cleaners 14 are more likely to be exposed to contaminated surfaces than direct contact 15 with Covid-19 patients [18]. 16\n17 In this study, the proportion of HCWs among locally transmitted cases was 18 smaller than non-HCWs in the included countries/areas, 3% versus 12% 19 respectively. The first cases HCWs appeared much later than the first non-20 HCW cases in all the study countries. The lower rate of HCW and the 21 occurrence time lags among HCWs likely reflects improved triage, screening 22 and isolation of Covid-19 patients in the healthcare setting, as well as better 23 personal protective equipment (PPE) and hygiene among HCWs once 24 knowledge and experience with outbreaks increase [19-21]. Health 25\nprofessionals are more equipped with infection control knowledge and 1 concepts, are more aware of self-hygiene and more informed regarding new 2 outbreaks compared to non-HCWs [22]. 3\n4 This study raises the importance of protecting high-risk non-HCWs for several 5 reasons. First, the work-related risks of respiratory infection, including Covid-6 19 infection, among the occupations are often neglected, and the workers are 7 less likely to have PPEs or proper infection control in their workplaces. 8 Second, it is much challenging to trace back the infection source of the non-9\nHCW cases compared to the HCW cases, indicating the urging need of 10 precautions for the high-risk population. Third, many of these occupations are 11 impossible to work remotely and the workers may not benefit from the 12 measures of worker-protection, such as government-imposed shutdown or 13 work-from-home order. Fourth, many of the high-risk workers are in relatively 14 lower socioeconomic status (SES), which is a risk factor of having Covid-19 15 infection and worse disease outcomes [23]. People from the lower ends of the 16 society are more susceptible to infectious outbreaks due to poorer living and 17 working conditions [24,25]. They are more likely to have chronic health 18 conditions which could lead to more severe consequences after being 19 infected [26]. Protecting the high-risk workers could provide an opportunity to 20 prevent the spread of the disease and to mitigate the deepening of health 21 disparities. 22\n23 The substantial contribution of non-HCW to the Covid-19 locally transmitted 24 cases emphasizes the importance of implementing effective infection control 25\nin the non-healthcare workplaces to protect the workers in this pandemic [27]. 1 Early delivery of infection control knowledge and health concepts to workers, 2 as well as providing adequate PPE are crucial in protecting workers and the 3 whole society. 4\n5 Our study has some strengths. First, the data were extracted from the 6 investigation reports published by the government of six countries/areas, 7 which should be valid [28,29], and pooling of multi-county sources prevented 8 the results from being skewed by single-country experience. Regarding the 9\ndifferent case reporting system in Japan, we did further sensitivity analysis 10 using the data from other five countries/areas and found similar temporal 11 distribution patterns, which strengthened our conclusions. Second, every 12 eligible case was reviewed by two occupational physicians and a physician 13 epidemiologist with agreements on work-relatedness after thorough inspection 14 of case reports. Moreover, we followed each country/area for 40 days, which 15 allowed us to obtain comparable data for pooled analysis and illustrate trends 16 of transmission in early stages of Covid-19 outbreak. 17\n18 Nonetheless, there are limitations of this study. First, there were 19 discrepancies in reporting and investigation across the countries/areas. Cases 20 without reported occupational history could potentially lead to underestimation 21 in the analysis. Second, the report date of a case could be different to the 22 date of getting infected and having symptoms. However, the information bias 23 should be non-differential as the official reports were not different between 24 whether a case was work-related or not. Third, the criteria of deciding whom 25\nto be tested varied between countries/areas, especially during early outbreaks 1 when testing capacities were limited. Therefore, high risk populations, 2 including high risk occupations, might tend to be tested. However, we believe 3 the bias was non-differential, as health authorities should not decide whom to 4 be tested differently based on whether the suspected case was a worker or 5 not. In fact, most of the early cases were tested because of the symptoms or 6 obvious contact histories, instead of occupations [30]. Finally, we excluded all 7 imported cases in the analysis. Travelers, however, could actually be 8 business travelers, or other workers in travel-related industries, such as flight 9 attendants, tour managers, and so on. Although workers of these occupations 10 do have frequent contact with the public and have higher probability to be 11 infected, our results could not demonstrate their risks and thus further studies 12 on business travelers are warranted. 13\n14 In conclusion, our study demonstrates that occupational infections are 15 considerable in early Covid-19 local transmission. Second, several specific 16 professional groups were at higher risk during early domestic outbreaks. We 17 urge authorities to implement preventive strategies for each of these high-risk 18 working populations. 19\n20\nReferences: 1 1. Ebrahim SH, Ahmed QA, Gozzer E, Schlagenhauf P, Memish ZA.

The novel virus, named afterward as SARS-CoV-2, belongs to highly pathogenic Coronavirus family and causes severe acute respiratory disease, COVID-19 leading even to death for some cases 1. The speed of human-to-human transmission of the pathogen is unprecedented. It has spread to most of the countries of the world within 4 months of its first known transmission to human and the number of infected people as well as the number of deaths caused by the virus is increasing every day till date. The first human case of present outbreak of Coronavirus is identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province of China, in December, 20191,2. Though the virus is spreading many countries, the speed and severity of spread vary country to country. Europe is badly affected than Asia, Africa and South America. Though South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Singapore were affected immediately after China, wide-spread infections were observed in Italy and Spain before those countries. Despite having political and economic connection and national borders with China, Myanmar and North Korea report very few cases of infection. Other European countries and USA were also hit within a very short period. Nevertheless, other Asian, African and South American countries are less affected till the beginning of April 2020. The uneven transmission mechanism to countries raises the question- what factors do influence the pathogen to spread? Is the virus attacking countries with lower temperature, or higher precipitation, or higher openness? Biological explanation can answer many questions related to transmission mechanism\nof a pathogen. Apart from biological properties, it is susceptible that few environmental, social and economic elements can act as possible catalysts for the spread of novel Coronavirus. First, connection with China is likely to be an important factor for rapid transmission of the disease at the initial stage of the pandemic. As the virus continues to spread many countries, any connection with badly effected countries may equally responsible for the transmission. In other words, level of international connection of a country is probably playing a vital role in country-tocountry transmission of the virus. International trade, alternatively economic openness can be treated as a good measure of international connection of a country. Thus, economic openness is likely to play an important role in the spread of the disease. If a country is more open, the virus will find it easier to transmit from human to human by crossing national borders. Once the virus is in, the rate of spread within a country will depend on several factors, some of which are difficult to identify, some though can be pointed out by educated guess. Population density, level of urbanization, social cohesiveness and weather conditions can be primarily identified as influential factors of human-to-human transmission of a pathogen. Viability of infectious viruses is found being affected markedly by environmental factors like temperature and humidity 3. Social, economic and environmental changes around the world are also believed to increase the occurrences of infectious diseases in the world, especially in developing countries 4. In case of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many countries responded immediately and are imposing partial or full lockdown. Measures taken by governments and response rate of citizens at the initial stage of the outbreak at any locality are likely to impact significantly on the spread 5 . Furthermore, published number of confirmed\ncases are not completely reliable for some reasons. There is some evidence that fear of economic penalties sometimes lead authorities to under-report epidemics 4. Countries of autocratic rulers are reluctant to reveal exact or approximate number of cases as it may hamper their reign adversely. Moreover, social cohesiveness is likely to be higher in free societies leading to possibilities of more infections of a highly pathogenic disease. Though, democratization does not necessarily mean social cohesiveness or integrity, it can be used as a proxy to assess how much the citizens of a society are involved in social activities. If social activities are higher, the chance of more infections are higher. Thus, the level of democratization is a possible inducer of the number of cases of infection. Underlying factors influencing the present spread mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 across countries are not well-known yet. Researchers around the world are contributing to better understand the virus that may save lives. Present study is motivated to find any possible linkage between world-wide uneven spread of COVID-19 and environmental, social and economic characteristics of countries by applying statistical methods. Though statistical relationship does not mean causation, they are at least indicative to a true relationship. We use least squares method to investigate whether the transmission of COVID-19 across countries is influenced by few environmental, social and economic variables."}, {"heading": "Trends of COVID-19 Spread", "text": "On 12 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a novel Coronavirus is infecting clusters of people in Wuhan, China from December, 2019\ncausing respiratory syndromes 1. On 13 January, a case was reported in Thailand, the first outside of China, in a woman who had arrived from Wuhan2. The second case outside of China was found on 15 January in a man in Japan who visited Wuhan. The case of infection in USA was declared on 21 January. On 24th January, the WHO notified first confirmed case of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Vietnam 2 . The WHO declared a global health emergency on January 30. Two months afterward was the time of Corona. The number of infected people was rising rapidly. Due to time variation across countries, figures on infection and death by Coronavirus on a specific day differs slightly by sources. As published on the website of ECDC, on 05 April 2020 world-wide total confirmed cases of infection reaches at 1174652 and world-wide total number of deaths reaches at 64400. The global number of infections of Coronavirus is becoming doubles just in 8 days and the number of deaths in 7 days. After China, the worst affected regions are Europe and USA. Europe is expecting a downturn after a long upward rise, while USA is supposed to experience the rise further. Many third world countries of Asia and Africa have just started experiencing of COVID-19, with huge anxiety about possible fatality that may happen. The trends of China, Europe and USA in the figure-1 indicate a similar steepness, whereas they differ in time of spread. The graph of India, another populous country, now at its early stage of infection, exhibits almost similar steepness.\nPatterns of daily new cases for Italy, Europe, USA and India are almost similar showing a very steep upward trend, though fluctuations are more obvious in case of Italy. Fluctuations in the trends of daily new cases are probably highly influenced by governments\u2019 interventions. China reached its peak on 13 February 2020 with 15141\nnew cases on that day. On 12 February number of new cases was 2028, and on 14 February the number of new cases was 4156 in China.\nThis sharp rise and down of 13 February in China are surprising and deserves better explanation. Few big spikes are also visible in cases of Italy and India.\nFigure-1: Trends in total cases of infection\n0\n200,000\n400,000\n600,000\n800,000\n1,000,000\n1,200,000\n6 13 20 27 3 10 17 24 2 9 16 23 30\nM1 M2 M3 M4\ntotal_cases_world\n0\n20,000\n40,000\n60,000\n80,000\n100,000\n6 13 20 27 3 10 17 24 2 9 16 23 30\nM1 M2 M3 M4\ntotal_cases_china\n0\n20,000\n40,000\n60,000\n80,000\n100,000\n120,000\n140,000\n6 13 20 27 3 10 17 24 2 9 16 23 30\nM1 M2 M3 M4\ntotal_cases_Italy\n0\n100,000\n200,000\n300,000\n400,000\n500,000\n600,000\n6 13 20 27 3 10 17 24 2 9 16 23 30\nM1 M2 M3 M4\ntotal_cases_europe\n0\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n200,000\n250,000\n300,000\n6 13 20 27 3 10 17 24 2 9 16 23 30\nM1 M2 M3 M4\ntotal_cases_usa\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n3,000\n6 13 20 27 3 10 17 24 2 9 16 23 30\nM1 M2 M3 M4\ntotal_cases_india\nOn 16 March Italy got new cases of 6230, whereas the number was only 90 on the previous day.

Rottier & Ince (2003) describes that transmission cycle of a pathogen depends, in general, on the pathogen itself, host and/or intermediate host, the environment and the availability of susceptible person or animal. Precipitation, humidity, temperature, and airflow can be determinants of virus infection and transmission 7. The biological and transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are not well-known yet 8 and under extensive investigation by researchers throughout the world. A very recent study claims that high temperature and high relative humidity reduce reproductive number, R0 of Coronavirus significantly and consequently lessen the transmission of the disease 9. Human-to-human transmission of SARS Coronavirus is likely to be\ninfluenced also by airflow and ventilation as indicative in a research conducted in Hong Kong 7. According to Guo et al (2020) human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs mainly through a close contact with patients of COVID-19 or incubation carriers. In a groundbreaking work, published on 30 January 2020, Riou and Althaus (2020) apprehended that the spread of the novel virus will depend on two key properties. First, the reproduction number, R0 (average number of secondary cases by an infectious index case) value of which is estimated as 2.2, greater than the threshold level, 1. Second, the dispersion parameter of secondary cases, k whose value is liable for super-spreading. A low value of k would lead a steady growth of the epidemic. Though the outbreak appears to have started from a single or multiple zoonotic transmission in Wuhan 10, the spread outside of China is clearly Human-to-human transmission. Human-to-human transmission may be direct or indirect. Direct Humanto-human transmission occurs because of close contact with a patient. However, the virus can stay in the environment for sometimes and can infect a susceptible person if get contacted. This indirect Human-to-human transmission is likely to depend on many factors including pathogenic characteristics and environmental factors. This study aims to explore the effects of few environmental, social and economic characteristics of countries on country-wise number of infection cases per one million people. We hypothesize that number of infection cases per one million people of a country depend on yearly average temperature, yearly average precipitation, economic openness, level of democracy, and on population density of the country. How long the virus can stay alive in the environment without any receptor will depend\non temperature and precipitation influencing the rate of indirect human-to-human transmission. On the other hand, number of cases of infection in a country will usually be accelerated by the number of imported cases from abroad, either from China or via other country. If more people enter a country as a vector of the pathogen, the secondary number of cases must be higher inflating the total number of cases. The number of imported infection cases is likely to increase if the country is involved in higher degree of international trade indicating economic openness as a determining factor of the ongoing pandemic. Many social conditions of a country may influence the shape of the spread. A cohesive society where people are involved in more festivals or religion gatherings is more likely to have more cases. Many other cultural issues may also have connection with the disease. We consider the level of democratization as a proxy variable for social cohesiveness. Population density is also likely to have positive association with the spread of COVID-19."}, {"heading": "Data sources and characteristics", "text": "Data on Coronavirus infection cases along with population in 2018 are collected from the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

As the sources are various in type, we cannot include all\ncountries infected by COVID-19 in our analysis due to unavailability of all data for few countries. Total 163 countries are included in this analysis. Total number of cases of Coronavirus infection by countries is time variant. The number accumulates over time. Nonetheless, total cases of infection in a specific country on a specific day (Y) is a fixed number. Thus, the variable, total cases of infection by countries has both time series and cross-section elements. We collect data on total infection cases by countries from 31 December 2019 to 03 April 2020. Total cases of infection are converted to cases per one million population to capture the population effect. Cases of infection per one million people on 03 April 2020 by countries is denoted by Y and used as the dependent variable in our experimentation. Values of this variable obviously depend on its previous values. Consequently, Y is simultaneously a cross-section and time series variable. We consider country level yearly average temperature and precipitation as environmental variables. On the other hand, the economic and social variables, viz. openness, democracy index and population density are also measured on yearly basis. Accordingly, the explanatory variables we are dealing with are static in nature."}, {"heading": "Modeling Approach", "text": "Transmission mechanism of a pathogen is mainly characterized by biological properties. Total number of cases of an infectious disease within a country and at a point of time is determined by a lot of biological and non-biological factors. Thus, we can presume that total number of confirmed cases across countries is generated by a stochastic process. However, the number that observed at a point of time is basically a\nrealization of the process through which data is generated 11. The realized value is a random selection from a range of possible values that could be generated by the interaction of all factors. Though it is not easy to reveal the true characteristics of the underlying data generation process, the realized or observed values can be utilized to draw inferences about the process. As a stochastic process the important determinant of the number of cases of a day is its own past values, implying that Yt, the number of cases on a day, depend on the past values, i.e. Yt-1, Yt-2, Yt-3 etc. Hence, an autoregressive model may be suitable to approximate the data generation process of the cases of infection on a day. Nevertheless, our aim in this study is not to find the data generation process of total number of cases of a country on a specific day. Rather, our objective is to examine data to investigate any possible linkage between country level severities of infection with few selected environmental, economic and social variables. For this purpose, we first simply regress total number of cases of infection per one million people by countries reported on a recent day (03 April 2020) on our selected explanatory variables. Specifically, we estimate the following regression-\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udeff + \ud835\udf071\ud835\udc4b1\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf072\ud835\udc4b2\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf073\ud835\udc4b3\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf074\ud835\udc4b4\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc4b5\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 (1)\nY is the total number of cases of confirmed infection per one million people in a country on a day (03 April 2020), X1 is yearly average temperature of countries, X2 is yearly average precipitation of countries, X3 is openness measured by international trade as a percentage of GDP of countries, X4 is democracy index of countries and X5 is population density of countries in 2018. We also presume that total number of cases of infection in a country on a specific day depends, apart from environmental, social and economic conditions, on the previous\nnumber of infection cases. Thus, in addition of model (1) we aim to fit a regression model of the following type-\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56 = \u221d +\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc4b1\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc4b2\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd3\ud835\udc4b3\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc4b4\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc4b5\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56(\u2212\ud835\udc57) + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56 (2)\nwhere, j means period of lag. The value of j should be selected based on best fit of the model as the timing and duration of viral shedding after SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown 12. If model (2) represents a true relationship, then it will suffer from multicollinearity as lagged Y must have high correlation with time invariant explanatory variables included in the regression equation. In the presence of multicollinearity, the estimated coefficients will be biased. To get rid of the multicollinearity problem, we first regress the lagged Y on rest of the explanatory variables and get the residual series. Henceforth, we run the following regression-\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56(\u2212\ud835\udc57) = \ud835\udeff + \ud835\udf071\ud835\udc4b1\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf072\ud835\udc4b2\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf073\ud835\udc4b3\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf074\ud835\udc4b4\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc4b5\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 (3)\nFrom the estimated values of model (3), we get-\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56(\u2212\ud835\udc57) = \ud835\udc4c?\u0302?(\u2212\ud835\udc57) + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 (4)\nwhere \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 is the residual series. Following the properties of Classical Linear Regression Model, we can deduce that \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 of the estimated model (3) is un-correlated with X's and can be used as a proxy variable of \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56(\u2212\ud835\udc57) in model (2). Consequently, model (2) has converted to the following estimable one-\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56 = \u221d +\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc4b1\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc4b2\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd3\ud835\udc4b3\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc4b4\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc4b5\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56 (5)\nThis model can be used to draw inferences about any linear relationship between Y and the X\u2019s holding the effect of past values on Y. We use Excel and STATA package for manipulation and transformation of data. For estimation purpose we use EVIEWS."}, {"heading": "Estimation Results and Discussion", "text": "We apply Least Squares method on model (1) and find that precipitation and population density have no significant effect on the number of infection cases per one million people (Y). Those variables are then excluded, and the model is re-estimated. In the re-estimated model, the variables average temperature, openness and democracy appear as highly significant. We made some experimentations with lags 1 to 9 to estimate model (5). In each case we first estimate model (3) and obtain the residuals, then estimate model (5) using the estimated residuals obtained from estimated model (3). As the number of infections are still increasing day by day in almost all countries, the estimated model fits better with lower lag. We drop density and precipitation from our experimentations as they frequently appear insignificant. In all estimated model yearly average temperature, openness and democracy appear as highly significant. Estimation results of three regression models with no lag, lag 1 and lag 9 are presented in Table-1. All the estimated coefficients in three reported models are significant with expected signs. Values of estimated coefficients of yearly average temperature, economic openness and democracy index remain same in all models pointing at high stability of estimation results. The sign of temperature appears negative implying that warmer countries are less infected by the Coronavirus. This is an indication of a relationship between environmental factors and the transmission mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, only clinical experiments can confirm the relationship. We did not find any relationship of Coronavirus infection with yearly average precipitation.\nPositive sign of openness suggests that the more a country is involved in international trade, i.e. export and import, the more it is vulnerable to Coronavirus infection. This finding is plausible as more international trade bring forth more interaction with overseas people and pave the way for the viral infection.\nIn the same manner, the positive sign of democracy index indicates that more democratic countries are affected more by the disease. This is may be the result of the fact that the democracy index may imply social cohesiveness or social integration. People are likely to be more involved in social activities and festivals in a country which is more democratic than a country ruled by an autocrat. Moreover, autocratic rulers are generally reluctant to publish the actual figure of fatalities and try to undermine it in any crisis.\nThe estimated models are not free from any misspecifications. As the diagnostic tests indicate, the estimated models are suffering from heteroscedasticity and violate the normality assumption. However, the models are free from autocorrelation (except model 1) as indicated by Breusch-Godfrey LM test statistic and high multicollinearity as indicated by high ?\u0305?2 and significant t-ratios for all explanatory variables. Consequently, the estimated coefficients are unbiased, though do not possess minimum variances. Despite some deficiency, the estimated models admit that COVID-19 is likely to spread more countries with low yearly average temperature, higher international trade and higher level of democracy."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study we employ Least Squares method and provide statistical evidences that yearly average temperature, economic openness and political democracy level of countries have significant effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across countries. Data on 163 infected countries is analyzed latest on 03 April 2020 which reveals that countries with higher average temperature, lower international trade and weaker democracy tend to experience comparatively smaller number of cases of infection per one million people. Inclusion of more social and economic variables, for instance, level of urbanization, level of globalization, trade share with China etc. in the regression model may increase model validity. As the number of cases of infection accumulates over time for each country, panel data analysis including more time variant relevant variables may produce interesting outcomes. Government interventions are likely to influence the spread mechanism of Coronavirus and thus success of those interventions should be explored by further research.\nThe results of this analysis should be interpreted cautiously keeping in mind the fact that statistical relations do not necessarily imply causation.

Such measures have been applied during prior pandemics, with moderate success (2-4), and are predicted to prevent a rapid, overwhelming epidemic in modeling studies (5). However, the extent to which social distancing measures have influenced the course of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been established. Because of the economic and social costs associated with social distancing measures (7, 8), there is immense value in quantifying the extent to which they have benefits for epidemic control.

The most widely enacted measures on the first date of implementation were cancellations of public events (34/51 [67%]) and closures of schools (26/51 [51%]). The first social distancing measures were implemented when the median epidemic size was 36 cases (interquartile range [IQR], 17-72).\nFigure 1A shows the mean COVID-19 daily case growth rate mapped against the date of the\nfirst statewide distancing measures. At the date of implementation of the first social distancing measure, states had a mean daily case growth rate of 30.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.6- 32.7; Table 1), corresponding to a doubling of total cases every 3.3 days. From fourteen days prior, through three days after, implementation of the first social distancing measure, the mean daily case growth rate did not change (-0.2% per day; 95% CI, -0.7% to 0.4%; P=0.52).

Our estimates imply that the number of days to double the cumulative case count increased from 3.3 days to 5.0 days in the 14 days following the implementation of social distancing measures. Assuming a cumulative epidemic size of 4,171 cases (equivalent to the cumulative number of cases in the U.S. at the time of implementation in each state), the reduction in growth rate we estimated corresponds with a reduction in total cases from 26,356 to 23,266 at 7 days, and from 156,360 to 88,105 at 14 days\nafter implementation. Stated differently, our model implies that social distancing reduced the total number of COVID-19 cases by approximately 3,000 cases at 7 days after implementation, and by 68,000 cases at 14 days. These results are consistent with both the theoretical effect of social distancing on epidemic spread (5) and the historical benefit observed implementing such interventions during prior epidemics of communicable diseases (11).\nOur findings should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. Our estimates would\nbe biased toward the null if: 1) state and local governments had intensified social distancing measures in response to a worsening epidemic, 2) there were significant violations of the stable unit treatment value assumption (e.g., workplace closures of large employers that had spillover effects across state lines), or 3) surveillance and testing intensified during the study period (thereby resulting in increased case reporting). Moreover, statewide restrictions on internal movement were often implemented after other social distancing measures had already been applied, further biasing our estimate toward the null. Our study was also limited by little observation time after statewide restrictions on internal movement were implemented. Finally, our estimated effects of social distancing in terms of mean daily case growth rates cannot be extrapolated linearly beyond the study period, nor can they answer questions about the appropriate timing of rescinding such measures.\nIn summary we demonstrate that the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth rate declined within\napproximately one incubation period following the initiation of statewide social distancing measures.\nREFERENCES\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, an infectious disease with unknown aetiology characterised with acute pneumonia has been recognized in Wuhan, China, named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (Wang et al., 2020). The causative microorganism has been identified as a new RNA virus from the beta-coronavirus family, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Guan et al., 2020). The respiratory illness caused by the COVID-19 is highly contagious, therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has categorised it as a pandemic infection (WHO, 2020). COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact, making a huge number of the population at risk of getting infected. The widespread of COVID-19 mainly in Wuhan, China and worldwide has attracted attention all over the world. As of April 06, 2020, a total of 1,254,969 persons were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 68,825 died of this life-threating infectious disease (Channel news Asia, 2020). In Jordan, a total of 345 cases were confirmed and 110 patients recovered with five deaths reported (Channel news Asia, 2020; World Stats, 2020). Due to duty calls, healthcare professionals (HCP) are more likely to come in contact with COVID-19 carriers putting them at a greater risk of contracting the infection and spreading it to others, including their loved ones. A recent study in China reported that a total of 2,055 HCPs were diagnosed with COVID-19 (National Health Commission, 2020). In response to COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan government took extremely proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus where the state of emergency was declared on March 20, 2020. The country witnessed a complete lockdown, banning people from leaving their homes except for a few specific reasons. Individual violating these orders were subject to three years in prison, a $4,200 fine, or both. The government also implemented an extensive public health awareness campaign utilizing all available media channels (The Jordan Times, 2020). The exponential increase in the number of cases and deaths in betterequipped countries, the spread of COVID-19 misinformation, the lack of medical treatment, and the shortage of properly equipped units to care for patients all could contribute to provoking public fear, anxiety and/or depression, which is usually neglected during crisis and pandemic management (Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Downes, 2015; Huang & Zhao, 2020; Zhai & Du, 2020).\nPsychological wellbeing has an important impact on individuals\u2019 performance. This impact is well documented among different populations including HCPs (Ramirez, Graham, Richards, Gregory, & Cull, 1996; Schafheutle, Seston, & Hassell, 2011; Wallace, Lemaire, & Ghali, 2009), general population (GP) (Burt, Zembar, & Niederehe, 1995), and university students (US) (Andrews & Wilding, 2004; Bruffaerts et al., 2018; Campos, Oliveira, Mello, & Dantas, 2017; O'Malley, Voight, Renshaw, & Eklund, 2015). Therefore, the study of the psychological wellbeing of these populations during COVID-19 pandemic is of paramount importance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID19 outbreak, and identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention.\n2. METHODS\n2.1. Study design and study population\nA cross-sectional study by means of online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the GP, HCPs, and USs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The data collection period was restricted to one week as longer period may influence the mentalhealth status of the study populations.\n2.1.1. Sampling strategy\nA convenience sample of eligible participants was invited to participate in the study. The GP, HCPs, and USs were invited to participate in this study through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). Each study population was invited using a specific survey-link as each population has specific demographic questions. All participants voluntarily participated in the study and were thus considered exempt from written informed consent. Study aim and objectives were clearly explained at the beginning of the survey. The inclusion criteria were: a) participants aged 18 years and above and living currently in Jordan; and b) participants who had no apparent cognitive deficit. Participants were excluded if they were: a) below 18 years of age; b) unable to understand Arabic language; and c) unable to participate due to physical or emotional distress.\n2.1.2. Depression and anxiety assessment scales\nPreviously validated assessment scales, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. These screening instruments were frequently used and validated as brief screening tools among various populations for depression and anxiety (Levis, Benedetti, Thombs, & Collaboration., 2019; L\u00f6we et al., 2008; Martin, Rief, Klaiberg, & Braehler, 2006; Maurer, Raymond, & Davis, 2018; S. Yoon et al., 2014). In addition, the following information were collected: participants\u2019 demographics (age, gender, income, and marital status). Furthermore, all participants were asked whether they were worried about being infected with COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members (yes/no question). The GP and USs were asked whether they had underlying chronic conditions (yes/no question). The GP were also asked about their education level and employment status. HCPs were asked about their specialities and exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or providing medical care for COVID-19 patients during this pandemic. USs were asked about their field of study and year level. The PHQ-9 scale is a 9-questions instrument given to participants to screen for the presence and severity of depression (Hartung et al., 2017; Hinz et al., 2016). The GAD-7 instrument was used to screen for anxiety (Esser et al., 2018). The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 instruments asked the participants about the degree of applicability of each item (question), using a 4-point Likert scale. Participants\u2019 response ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 means \u201cNot at all\u201d and 3 means \u201cNearly every day\u201d. The PHQ-9 instrument includes 9 items. Items are scored from 0 to 3 generating a total score ranging from 0 to 27. A total score of 0\u20134 indicates minimal depression, 5\u20139 mild depression, 10\u201314 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20\u201327 severe depression (Schwenk et al., 2011). The GAD-7 instrument includes 7 items. Items are scored from 0 to 3 generating a total score ranging from 0 to 21. A total score of 5\u20139 indicates mild anxiety, 10\u201314 moderate anxiety, and 15\u201321 severe anxiety (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & L\u00f6we, 2006).\n2.1.3. Estimate of prevalence and classification of depression and anxiety.\nPrevalence rates of depression and anxiety were determined using a cut-off point as recommended by the authors of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scale. In this study, depression was defined as a total score of (\u2265 15) in the PHQ-9 instrument indicating a case with moderately severe or severe depression. Anxiety was defined using the GAD-7 instrument with a total score of (\u2265 15) indicating a case with severe anxiety. The higher the score the more severe the case identified by any scale. The prevalence rate of depression was estimated by dividing the number of participants who exceeded the borderline score (\u2265 15) by the total number of the participants in the same population. Prevalence rate of anxiety was calculated using the same procedure.\n2.1.4. Sample size\nThe target sample size was estimated based on the WHO recommendations for the minimal sample size needed for a prevalence study (Lwanga & Lemeshow, 1991). Using a confidence interval of 95%, a standard deviation of 0.5, a margin of error of 5%, the required sample size was 385 participants from each study population.\n2.1.5. Ethical approval\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Faculty of Pharmacy in Isra University, Amman, Jordan. As participation in the study was voluntary, the Research Ethics Committee approved consent waiver.\n2.2. Statistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe participants\u2019 demographic characteristics. Continuous data were reported as mean \u00b1 SD for normally distributed variables and median (interquartile range (IQR)) for nonnormally distributed variables. Categorical data were reported as percentages (frequencies). The Mann-Whitney U test/Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the median scores between different demographic groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for anxiety or depression. Logistic regression models were carried out using anxiety or depression scores above the cut-off points highlighted above. A two-sided p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (version 25).\n3. Results\n3.1. Participants characteristics\nA total of 4,126 individuals participated in the study (GP=1,798, HCPs=1,163, and USs=1,165). Table 1 details the baseline characteristics of the participants in the three populations. The majority of participants (n=2,436, 59.0%) were females, aged between 18\u201329 years (n=2,287, 55.4%), single (n=2,225, 53.9%), and with an income of 500 JD or below (n=2,152, 52.2%). Around half of the GP were employed (n=927, 51.6%), with the majority (n=1,190, 66.2%) completed their bachelor\u2019s degree. The largest proportion of the participating HCPs were physicians (n=560, 48.2%). More than half of the participating USs (n=621, 53.3%) were studying nonmedical sciences. Around 15.8% (n= 284) and 6.0% (n=70) of the GP and the USs respectively reported that they have a history of chronic disease. The vast majority (n=3,124, 75.7%) of the participants from all populations reported that they were concerned about contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members. When participants were\nasked if they have identified any problems over the past two weeks, to what extent have these problems prevented them from doing their work, looking after their household affairs or dealing with people, 59.0% (n=2,436) reported that they faced difficulties.\n3.2. Prevalence of mental health problems\nThe prevalence of depression (participants with a total score of 15 and above; cases with moderately severe and severe depression) among the entire study participants was 23.8% (n=980). Depression was most prevalent across USs (n=449, 38.6%), followed by HCPs (n=247, 21.2%) and GP (n=284, 15.8%). The proportions of minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression were 24.3%, 31.8%, 20.2%, 13.4%, and 10.3% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety (participants with a total score of 15 and above; cases with severe anxiety) from the entire study participants was 13.1% (n=539). Similarly, anxiety was most prevalent across USs (n=250, 21.5%), followed by HCPs (n=131, 11.3%) and GP (n=158, 8.8%). The proportions of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety were 35.6%, 19.0%, and 13.1% respectively. Table 2 details the prevalence of depression and anxiety among participants stratified by severity.\n3.3. Participant demographics and mental health problems\nTable 3 presents participant demographics data and their median depression and anxiety scores. Depression median score significantly differed across participants from different demographical characteristics (p<0.05), except for the year level (for USs population). Anxiety median score significantly differed across participants from different demographical characteristics (p<0.01), except for educational level (for the GP), year level and field of study (for USs population). University students, females, younger population (18\u201329 years), single and divorced, participants who completed their bachelor degree (from the GP), with lower-income category (500 JD and below), pulmonologist and ENT specialists (for HCPs), participants with no history of chronic diseases (for the GP and USs) tend to have higher depression and anxiety median scores compared to others. The logistic regression analysis identified the following group to be at a higher risk of depression: a) females among HCPs and USs, b) divorced HCPs, c) pulmonologist, and d) USs with chronic disease history. On the other hand, the following groups were at a lower risk of depression: a) elderly, married, and high income (1500 JD and above) participants among the GP and HCPs, b) students at their fifth year of study, and c) retried participants from the GP. In addition, logistic regression analysis showed that the following groups were at a higher risk of anxiety: a) females across the three study populations, b) divorced participants among the GP, and c) USs with chronic disease history and who are with high income (1500 JD and above). On the other hand, the following groups were at a lower risk of anxiety: a) elderly and married participants among the GP, b) HCPs with high income (1500 JD and above) Table 4.\n4. Discussion\nEmerging COVID-19 is a recent pandemic the has exhausted the world\u2019s resources including the lives of many. Therefore, studies that investigated the impact of this novel pandemic on mental health are limited. A recent study in China investigated the effect of COVID-19 on public psychological status, and reported that females were three-times at a higher risk of developing anxiety. On the other hand, higher education level was associated\nwith a lower risk of developing depression by 0.39 time, these results are in-line with our study findings (Wang, Di, Ye, & Wei, 2020). Another study with 52,730 participants revealed that 35.0% of respondents experienced psychological distress during the epidemic with female respondents showing a higher risk of psychological distress when compared to males. Similarly, our results showed that females demonstrated a higher risk of anxiety and depression (p<0.05) which is in-line with reported data during epidemics, where women, particularly those working in healthcare, were prone to developing depression and anxiety (Lai et al., 2020; Li L, 2003). These gender differences in psychological distress including depression and anxiety have been described previously. Several studies have demonstrated that female gender is a risk factor for developing mental illness where women have been reported to have 1.6 greater incidence of depression compared to men. This could be attributed to increased frequency of hormonal fluctuation in women compared to men (Albert, 2015; Bartels, Cacioppo, van Beijsterveldt, & Boomsma, 2013). In this study, a significant proportion of all participants (75.7%) emphasized their concerns about contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members. Interestingly, although elderly are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 complications, our findings demonstrated that elderly participants (\u226550 years) within the GP group had a significant lower risk of developing depression (OR for >50 years = 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 \u2013 0.41, p<0.000) and anxiety (OR for >50 years = 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 \u2013 0.7, p<0.01) compared to younger population. Possible explanation for these findings include lack of knowledge about possible complications, faith, or submission to mortality. On the other hand, mental problems were most prevalent among USs showing 38.5%, 21.5% for depression and anxiety, respectively, followed by HCPs (21.2%, 11.3% respectively). The percentage of students suffering from depression and anxiety is alarming. This high prevalence rate could be primarily attributed to the mandatory switch to distance education despite the limited resources and skillsets. Therefore, students had major concerns regarding the impact of this emergency situation on their education and overall school performance. Interestingly, when students\u2019 category was stratified according to year level, there was a slightly higher depression and anxiety score among first- and second-year students, however, it was statistically non-significant (p>0.05). This result tallied with the findings that a statistically significant higher prevalence rate of depression and anxiety was among young adults (18\u201329 years, p<0.05). Several studies have investigated the association between healthcare job-related stress with depression and anxiety (Gao et al., 2012; Mann & Cowburn, 2005; Smolders et al., 2009; S. L. Yoon & Kim, 2013) and such association appears more pronounced during a highly transmissible global pandemic such as COVID-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Our findings demonstrated that HCPs have a higher risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes particularly depression and anxiety. As we anticipated, pulmonologists and ENT physicians scored the highest in comparison to other HCPs. Potential factors that has contributed to these findings include pulmonologists and ENT physicians being in the front-line in treating COVID-19 patients, physician burnout, isolation form family, and feeling helpless due to the nature\nof this disease. Similar findings are reported by Wong and colleagues (2007) during SARS outbreak where ER\nphysicians were found to have feeling of vulnerability, loss of control, fear of being infected or spreading the virus to family members and others (Wong et al., 2007). The unclear dynamics of COVID-19 transmission coupled with the high morbidity and mortality may exaggerate the perception of individual danger and provoke depression and anxiety (W. Wang, Tang, & Wei, 2020). Although ENT physician score for depression and anxiety were statistically non-significant, which could be attributed to small sample size, we strongly believe that they are clinically important and should not be ignored.\n(p>0.05). Furthermore, foreseeable shortages of medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the increasing number of both suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and anxiety for HCPs (Chan-Yeung, 2004). In comparison to USs and HCPs, the GP exhibited a lower prevalence rate of depression and anxiety. Possible contributor to these findings include the faith that Jordanians have in government. A study conducted by Analyseize Research demonstrated that 95.0% of Jordanians have full faith in government emergency measures to combat COVID-19 outbreak (Analyseize Research, 2020). Of note, married individuals were found to be at a lower risk of developing depression; GPs (OR= 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55) and HCPs (OR= 0.75, 95% CI 0.56- 0.99). Previous research reported that married couples have less tendency to develop depression and anxiety compared with divorced individuals which could be attributed to the impact of marriage on wellbeing and partner support (Kalmijn & Monden, 2006). Furthermore, our results showed that retired individuals among the GP tend to have a lower risk of developing depression (OR= 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.72. p<0.01) when compared to employed or unemployed individuals, which is consistent with previous studies. On one research conducted by Buffel and co-worker, they reported that retired individuals tend to have a lower score of depression during crisis when compared to employed and unemployed persons (Buffel, Van de Velde, & Bracke, 2015). During crisis there is a reported increase in unemployment rate which is positively correlated with depression rate (Choudhry, Enrico, & Marcello, 2012; Choudhry, Marelli, & Signorelli, 2010).\nThe findings of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on psychological well-being of individuals, particularly HCPs and USs. It is our hope that these findings raise awareness amongst policy makers and mental health providers in order to take the necessary measures to attend to psychological wellbeing of individuals during global pandemic. Further studies to investigate the impact of time on mental health are needed.\nStrengths and limitations\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first and largest (4,126 participants, including 1,163 HCP) study in the Middle East that investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. The large sample size increased the generalisability of these findings. Additionally, the use of previously validated assessment tools is another strength of the study. However, there are some limitations. There are limited studies that explored the prevalence of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and in the Middle East specifically, a fact that limited our ability to compare our findings with similar healthcare environment and culture. The sample size of ENT physicians\u2019 subgroup was small due to small population in this category nationwide. The impact of time on mental health was not captured here due to the nature of this study and further studies are necessary. It would be useful to repeat the study after the COVID-19 pandemic reach a peak to determine the effect of time on the results. Although depression and anxiety are closely related, depression is almost related to disparate life events, and needs a longer duration in time than the 2-weeks, that are monitored by the PHQ-9 instrument. However, this remark is not valid for anxiety and GAD-7 is relevant to the subject. The above-mentioned remarks may explain the surprising conclusion that USs are more affected and have higher depression and anxiety rates compared to HCPs who are in the centre of the risk and seriously affected by this pandemic disease. Finally, we used an online survey for data collection and therefore, we may have missed some of the targeted population.\nHowever, we tackled this by distributing the survey among three different populations and widely used social media.\n5. Conclusion\nDepression and anxiety are prevalent mental problems during COVID-19 pandemic. These mental problems impact the psychological wellbeing of individuals from the entire community including university students, healthcare professionals, and the general population. Females, university students, divorced individuals, healthcare professionals at front-line, and those who are with underlying chronic conditions are at a higher risk. Policymakers and mental care health providers are advised to attend to and provide mental support as needed to vulnerable groups during this pandemic."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This study was supported by Isra University (Amman, Jordan)."}, {"heading": "Conflict of interests", "text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, {"heading": "Author contributions", "text": "AN conceived the study, wrote the methods, conducted the formal analysis, and coordinated the study.

Our results rank six common social distancing policies based on the magnitude and significance of their impact, beyond what has already been achieved through voluntary actions.

These attempts are made, largely to keep the peak level below the resource capacity of healthcare systems and buy time for possible drug and vaccine development.\nReduction in social contact rate during pandemic outbreaks is driven by a combination of awareness-driven voluntary actions by individuals and businesses, and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) implemented\nat the national, state, or local level. Research on the 1918 influenza pandemic in different cities in the US point to the role of both these mechanisms in lowering the mortality rate3.\nThere is strong evidence that social distancing has played a significant role in containing the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak in China4\u20136 and the latest evidence indicates their effectiveness in Italy and Spain at the end of the first week of April 2020. However, the relative impact of social-awareness versus policy interventions is yet to be determined for the existing outbreak. In addition, several complementary policies were adopted to increase social distancing, some of which might have unintended consequences. Therefore, identifying effective policies could help policymakers respond efficiently to the outbreak. In most cases, decoupling these factors is challenging, since, in most countries, the timing and strength of NPI are highly correlated with public awareness. Moreover, it is crucial to determine which interventions have a significant impact on lowering the contact rate beyond what can be achieved via awareness mechanisms. Furthermore, the evaluation of these policies could provide valuable lessons, especially for the states that have not yet adopted these policies.\nWhile most countries follow a central policy scheme in the current pandemic, the federal nature of the United States creates a suitable natural experiment setting to tackle these questions. In the United States and as of this writing, the federal government has left NPI decisions to individual states, creating a high level of variation in the type and timing of such policies7 (See Figure 1 in the Data Section). While there are strong evidences for reduced social contact in the US, not all these reductions can be attributed to NPIs. In fact, mobility data show that people in most states had already started to reduce the time they spend outside of home before any NPI was implemented (See Figure AP.1 in the appendix).In fact, for some states such as Idaho, Missouri, Wyoming and the District of Columbia, people\u2019s presence at home had already increased close to a level of saturation before any social distancing policy went into effect. These pieces of evidence suggest that attributing current reductions in social interaction to policy measures can be misleading and further underscore the need for a formal study to disentangle the direct impact of NPIs from other factors such as awareness and spillover effects.\nThis study utilizes the daily state-level variations in the adoption of six different intervention policies \u2013 statewide stay-home order, more limited stay-home orders, non-essential business closure, large gathering ban, school closure mandate, and restaurant and bar limits \u2013 to investigate their causal effect on different indicators of social distancing. We use Google-released daily human mobility indicators in different categories of places such as residential areas, groceries and pharmacies, parks, retails and recreations, transit stations, and workplaces. The studied intervention policies are each employed in a subgroup of the US states and at different times during March 2020, making them suitable for quasi-experimental methods. We employ a difference-in-differences approach, which is commonly used to evaluate the effect of policies. Interestingly, the difference-in-difference method was first developed in a simple form by John Snow in 18498 to study the cause of the Cholera outbreak in London and resulted in policy adoptions that effectively ended the outbreak.\n2/15\nOur results give a clear picture of the causal impact and effectiveness of different NPIs on location-specific human mobility at the early stage of the pandemic. At this stage, where changes in behavior are driven by a combination of policy forces and voluntary actions, our results help us rank NPIs based on the strength and significance of their impact, beyond what has already been achieved through voluntary actions. Specifically, our results show that the tendency to remain at home is driven strongly by the statewide stay-home order and moderately by non-essential business closure and policies related to restaurant and bar limits. Other policies such as school closure mandate, large gatherings bans, and more limited stay-home orders do not show any significant impact on keeping people at home. Furthermore, statewide stay-home orders have a strong and significant impact on reducing mobility in all outside home place categories. The effectiveness of non-essential business closure and restaurant/bar limits are also significant on most (but not all) place categories. Limited stay-home orders and large gathering ban do not show any impact on increasing presence at home or reducing mobility in other place categories. If anything, in the absence of other policies, a large gathering ban results in a moderate increase in mobility in transit stations. School closure mandate gives us a mixed picture, with no significant impact on presence at home and moderate, but significant impact on mobility in retail locations and transit stations. Finally, our Event study analysis further makes a stronger case for the causal nature of these findings.\nThese results show that at the early stages of the pandemic much of the expected impact of some more lenient NPIs are reaped from other factors such as voluntary actions and awareness driven mechanisms. Thus, in order to achieve social distancing beyond what is gained through those mechanisms, states need to adopt strong interventions such as statewide stay-home order."}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "Mobility Trend Data We use Google-released aggregated, anonymized daily location data on movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places for the month of March 20209. The data are gathered by Google from users who have enabled the Location History setting on their accounts and are the same data used by Google Maps to track human traffic at various restaurants and other locations. The data include mobility trends for six location categories including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. These data were publicly released on April 2, 2020, in a form of charts that plot country-specific mobility trends and the percentage of changes with respect to a baseline in the period of Feb 16 to March 29. The US data also include mobility trends at the level of states and counties. Given that most intervention policies are implemented state-wide, we base our analysis at the state level. Each movement trend includes multiple data points per day. We aggregated these points to get a single mobility index per day for each trend chart. We should note that these data do not include people without phones, people not carrying their phones to places, etc. However, it is unlikely that the COVID-19 policies affect changes in recorded behavior. Overall, in most cases we have data on\n3/15\n4/15\nmovements for 50 states and the District of Columbia for 29 days, providing us with 1479 observations. However, for some measures, we were not able to restore up to two observations for a couple of states.\nThe success of social distancing policies can be evaluated on two fronts. A primary goal of these policies is to decrease the time people spend outside of their homes. In this study, we use the time people spend at residential locations (referred here as presence at home as a proxy to measure the success level of this goal1. Besides encouraging people to stay at home, social distancing policies also intend on keeping people away from crowded locations and large gatherings, even when they go out. We use the impact of policies on the changes in the remaining five location categories (i.e. retail, transit stations, parks ,and work places). Given that these categories do not cover all possible gathering places (e.g. places of worship), we base our findings mainly on the impact of policies on presence at home, but discuss all other categories, acknowledging this limitation.\nState Policy Data We collected all COVID-19 related policies, their issue and effective dates for all 50 states and the District of Columbia since the report of the first positive case in the United States. Since there are some discrepancies in policy start dates among datasets available on third party sources, we used the original documents issued by the state governments, collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation10 to determine the type and date of each state policy. We considered the effective date as the first day in which the policy in question has been in full effect, acknowledging that this decision creates potential biases since some states had policies that went into effect immediately, resulting in fractions of a day of policy that are missed in our data. This, however, does not substantially change the magnitude and significance of our results.\nWe performed this study on those policies that aim at social distancing, which we divide into six categories: statewide stay-home order, other stay-home orders, non-essential business closure, large gatherings ban, school closure mandate, and restaurant and bar limits. Other stay-home orders incorporates stay-at-home orders for the senior population as well as those targeting specific cities or counties within a given state. Besides these policies, some states have implemented other COVID-19 policies such as cost-sharing waivers for testing or treatment or mandatory quarantine for travelers that we do not consider in this study. Figure 1 summarizes the policy adoption timeline for each policy by showing the number of states who have each policy in effect on any given day during March 2020, suggesting a wide heterogeneity in both the type and the adoption date of each policy during this period.\nTemperature Data To control for the impact of temperature variation on human mobility, we construct daily temperature for each state by taking web scraping daily temperature data for the top 5 biggest cities in each state from the Weather Underground, a commercial weather service that provides real-time weather information. We calculated an aggregate daily temperature for each state by taking the average of daily temperatures of top 5 cities weighted by their populations. Table 1 shows the summary statistics for these three categories of data.\n1Here we assume that large indoor gathering at residential places has not increased substantially since the start of the outbreak.\n5/15"}, {"heading": "Method and Results", "text": "We employ difference-in-differences, a quasi-experimental approach commonly used in social sciences to evaluate the effect of policies. In particular, we compare the daily changes in visits from various locations in states that adopt various COVID 19-related policies with those that have not (yet) done so, before and after these policies take effect (See Appendix B for the regression equation and more details). For each policy, we define a binary variable, set to one if a given state adopts that policy after a certain day during the sample period, and otherwise zero. Since changes in visits are serially correlated within the same state over time, we cluster standard errors at the state level11. Note that the validity of this approach hinges on the assumption of parallel trends in changes in visits absent the policies, an assumption which we empirically test using an event study approach. In the event study specification, we replace each policy indicator variable (one at a time) with 15 binary variables, which estimate the effect of that particular policy seven or more days, six days, five days, four days, three days, two days, and one day before and one day, two-to-six days (four binary variables), and seven days and more after the implementation of the policy (See Appendix B for the regression equation and more details). These variables are all zero for states without those policies. We normalize the coefficient for the day before the implementation to zero.\nTable 2 reports the results for the effect of policies introduced above on changes in daily visits from various places. As explained in the Data section, our main focus is on presence at home for which we report the results in column (1). Results indicate that statewide stay-home orders significantly increase the measure associated with presence at home by about six fold (relative to states without such a policy) while more limited stay-home orders have a small and statistically insignificant effect. Non-essential business closure and restaurant and bar limits are other policies that have a positive and statistically significant impact on presence at home, although their effect sizes are around half of what is observed for statewide stay-home orders. The rest of the table presents results on changes in visits from out-of-home places. Interestingly, they suggest a decline in all of these measures which provide evidence that the results obtained for presence at home are not spurious. Among all of the statistically significant estimated coefficients in Table 2, those related to statewide stay-home orders are the most pronounced ones, which strongly suggests that this particular policy is likely the most effective policy in promoting social distancing. On the other hand, policies such as large gatherings ban seems to have a limited and statistically insignificant effect on keeping people at home. Table AP.1 provides estimates by adding state-specific day-of-week to each model.

Effect of COVID-19 policies on community mobility\nflat trends before the policy took effect on day zero. Consistent with results in Table 2, we observe the largest effect on presence at home through statewide stay-home order, although the magnitude of the effect declines after a week. The effects of other stay-home orders and non-essential business closure are noisy. large gatherings ban illustrates flat trends before and after the implementation suggesting that this policy is ineffective in changing individuals\u2019 behavior towards staying at home. Finally, both school closure and restaurant and bar limits seem to positively affect presence at home. However, their effects are either weak and marginally significant or there are some evidence of upward trends before the policy implementation.\nThe preexisting trends in the outcome in states that adopt other stay-home orders and non-essential business closure provide further evidence supporting the role of public awareness in changing home-stay behavior. It is worth\n7/15\nnoting that we considered the start date of each policy as the first day in which the policy was in effect for 24 hours. This assumption can impact what we see on the last day before the policy in the event study graphs. Therefore, changes immediately before the policy date must be interpreted keeping this in mind.\nGiven that the COVID-19 spread in the US started from the State of Washington, California, and New York and these states experienced a higher volume of positive cases and deaths, there is always a concern that the estimated policy effects are driven by these states. We provide a version of a permutation test in which we drop each state from the sample one at a time and estimate the effect of policies. The estimated coefficients were consistent when dropping each state, suggesting the effects are not driven by a particular group of states. Results presented in Appendix D support this hypothesis.\n8/15"}, {"heading": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "Our findings show the effectiveness of different social distancing policies on reducing out of home social interaction during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that reductions in out-of-home social interactions are driven by a combination of policy and voluntary measures and point to the strong causal impact of state-wide stay at home and more moderate impact of non-essential business closures and bar/restaurant limits. At this stage of the outbreak and for the US, other policy measures such as school closure mandates or large gathering bans seem to have had no significant causal impact on keeping people at home. We need to be cautious when generalizing the results of this early stage of the pandemic to the later stages and to the possible future waves of the outbreak. Specifically, we need to emphasize that our results do not claim that more lenient social distancing policies such as school closure or large gathering bans are always causally inefficient in reducing social interaction. While it is evident that most of the social distancing capacity of such measures are already absorbed in non-policy driven changes \u2013possibly caused by social awareness \u2013, it is expected that as the pandemic lasts longer, voluntary social distancing measures start to wane, making such policies and a combination of them more effective in later stages of the pandemic12.\nOur study has a number of limitations. First, The Google database is not based on the universe of all cellphone users and it only includes those individuals who have enabled the Location History setting on their account. However, given that around 90 percent of users keep their location services on13 our estimates should not be largely affected. Besides, the data are imperfect since they don\u2019t include people without smartphones and those not carrying their phones to places. However, this should not affect changes in recorded behavior and is expected to have little impact on our results.\nFinally, this study provides a partial picture of the effectiveness of social distancing policies, by focusing on the first stage, i.e. success of such mechanisms in achieving a lower level of out-of-home social interaction. The more crucial question is how and to what extent such reductions in different forms of social interaction impact the infection rate and disease mortality. This is especially important since the relationship between social interaction and the infection rate is not fully understood and is expected to be highly nonlinear with strong dependencies on the location in which such interactions take place (e.g. parks vs. retail stores). Tackling these questions based on positive cases require more reliable data on the number, location, and policies for infection testing, something that is not widely available in most US states at the time of this writing. This problem can be in part mitigated by analyzing the policy effect on the death cases. Given that the median time from infection to death is reported to be close to 17 days, and since many states have issued their stronger policies in the last week of March, this study needs to wait for now until enough reliable data are collected.\n9/15"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "The authors would like to thank two Northeastern University PhD students Soumyakant Padhee and Amir Abodollahi for their valuable assistance with data collection in this study.

Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.\n3\nIntroduction The current pandemic of COVID-19 began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since\nthen, it has rapidly spread across the globe. Currently, there is no end in sight. The present work is motivated by prior evidence that Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination (typically given at birth and/or during childhood) offers a long-lasting protective effect not only against tuberculosis (the intended target of BCG), but also against various other infectious diseases (1\u2013 3). We tested whether the curves for the spread of COVID-19 might be flattened in countries with mandated BCG policies, compared to those that do not. The BCG vaccine is used primarily against tuberculosis (4). One review has found that BCG vaccination reduces the risk of tuberculosis by 50% (5). A follow-up of an earlier BCG clinical trial performed on native Americans show that BCG protects people from both tuberculosis and lung cancer for up to several decades, throughout each person\u2019s life (2, 3). A more recent meta-analysis of a broader range of observational studies and clinical trials (1) suggests that the effectiveness of BCG could extend to all-cause mortality. Several controlled trials provide consistent results, showing that the reduced mortality is attributable to protection against respiratory infections, as well as neonatal sepsis (6\u20138). Altogether, the available evidence suggests that BCG has beneficial effects on immunity against a range of lung-related infections that go beyond tuberculosis, which makes it a promising candidate for defending against COVID-19. As for mechanisms, recent experimental work (9) finds that BCG vaccination causes genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming of human monocytes, which in turn predicts protection against experimental viral infection. Over the last century, many countries adopted universal policies of mandatory BCG vaccination to fight against tuberculosis, which was then a major threat. Since then, many countries maintained such a policy at least until very recently (e.g., China, Ireland, Finland, and France). Some other countries terminated the policies as tuberculosis ceased to be a threat (e.g., Australia, Spain, Ecuador). Of note, some countries never mandated BCG vaccination (e.g., U.S., Italy, and Lebanon). Therefore, there is sufficient variability in the presence or absence of such policies distributed across different regions of the world, which makes it possible to draw a systematic comparison. A cross-national analysis, however, is inherently challenging. Among others, in this particular case, different countries have varying onsets in the current pandemic, which makes it problematic to test the absolute number of confirmed cases or deaths (as in, for example, (10, 11)). To overcome this challenge, we examined day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries with mandated BCG policies versus those without. The growth curves illuminate the process of the viral spread in each country, which in turn shapes the total number of cases or deaths. The start of the growth curves was set to be equal across countries. Following prior work, we focused on a time period either after the first 100 confirmed cases (as in (12)) or after one confirmed COVID-caused death. Of note, we limited our analysis to the first 30 days of the onset of country-wise outbreaks. This will enable us to capture the initial, exponential spread of the virus, while minimizing any effects of countrydependent coping actions (e.g., stay-home mandates by the state). Since vaccination may become effective at the population level only when a vast majority is made resistant against a target virus(es), a phenomenon known as \u201cherd immunity\u201d (13), we first tested whether the growth curves would be significantly less steep in countries that have continued to mandate BCG vaccination at least until very recently, as compared to countries that do not currently require it. We then explored whether there might be any difference between those that never had such a policy and those that had one during the 20th century but have since terminated the policy for at least a few decades. Lastly, we tested whether the groups of the countries that vary in the BCG policy status might vary on various\n4\ncultural dimensions, such as individualism vs. collectivism (13, 14) and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms (14). Results"}, {"heading": "Confirmed Cases", "text": "All countries that had reported at least 15 days of at least 100 total confirmed cases, and that had available data on BCG policy and covariates (median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and geographical region) were included (52 countries in total). For each country, day 1 was set to be the first day of at least 100 confirmed cases. See Column 2 of Table S1 for the date of day 1 for each included country. To model exponential growth of confirmed cases, we estimated a linear mixed model of the natural log-transformed number of confirmed cases. We entered two contrast-coded variables designating BCG policy status (current vs. [past and none] combined and past vs. none). The effect of BCG policy status on growth rate is reflected by the interactions between day and each BCG policy status contrast. . As shown in Table 1-A., we found a significant main effect of day, b = 0.190, p < .001, reflecting an exponential increase in cases over time. This increase was qualified by a significant interaction between day and BCG policy status. Specifically, the growth rate of COVID-19 cases was significantly slower in countries with mandated BCG vaccinations, compared to countries without mandated BCG vaccinations, b = -0.025, p = .020 (see Fig. 1-A and B).1 This effect was not accounted for by the cultural dimensions of individualism vs.\ncollectivism, power distance, and tightness/looseness (see Supplementary Results 1-A). Countries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were not significantly different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG vaccinations, b = - 0.019, p = .143. Fig. 2-A shows the distribution of the country-wise regression coefficients. There is a substantial variation in the mandatory BCG group. See Supplementary Results 2-A and 3-A for the effects of the control variables and a robustness check, respectively. Deaths All countries that had reported at least 15 days of at least 1 total death from COVID-19, and that had available data on BCG policy and covariates (54 countries in total) were included in this analysis. For each country, day 1 was set to be the first day of at least 1 confirmed death. See column 3 of Table S1 for the date of day 1 for each included country. We estimated a linear mixed model of the natural log-transformed number of deaths, controlling for the same control variables as above. As in the analysis on confirmed cases, we found a significant main effect of day, b = 0.211, p < .001, reflecting an exponential increase in deaths over time (Table 1-B). This increase was qualified by a significant interaction between day and BCG policy status. Specifically, the growth rate of COVID-19 related deaths was significantly less in countries with mandated BCG vaccinations, compared to countries without mandated BCG vaccinations, b = -0.078, p < .001 (Fig. 1-C and D). This effect was independent of the cultural dimensions mentioned above (Supplementary Results 1-B). Countries that once had such policies but terminated them before 2000 were no different in growth rate from those that never instituted mandatory BCG, b < 0.001, p = .993. Fig. 2-B shows the distribution of the country-wise regression coefficients. See Supplementary Results 2-B and 3-B for the effects of the control variables and a robustness check, respectively.\n1 The main effect of the current BCG policy contrast in each analysis shows that there are fewer\ntotal cases and deaths in BCG-mandated countries, compared to those that do not currently mandate BCG vaccination. However, this is a necessary consequence of the rate of increase being more gradual in the former than in the latter.\n5\nDiscussion Our analysis provides the first conclusive evidence that mandatory BCG vaccination predicts a flattening of the curve in the spread of COVID-19. The effect we demonstrate is quite substantial. For example, the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the US as of March 29, 2020 would have been 94\u20144% of the actual figure (2467)\u2014if the US had instituted the mandatory BCG vaccination several decades earlier (see Supplementary Results 5). Notably, the growth curves were as steep in countries that mandated BCG policies only during the 20th century as in those that never mandated the vaccine. BCG vaccination may become effective only when a substantial proportion of the population is made resistant to a virus. That is to say, the spread of the virus may be slowed only when there is \u201cherd immunity\u201d that prevents the virus from spreading easily across the population (see a simulation in (15)). Note that as long as others receive vaccination, any single individual will be protected without vaccination, leading to a temptation for free-riding (i.e., not getting vaccinated). Hence, in the absence of state-imposed mandatory vaccination, cultural norms emphasizing prosocial interdependent orientations (16, 17) may prove to be crucial for the success of BCG in preventing future outbreaks of COVID-19 (15, 18).\nSome limitations of our effort are warranted. First, one can raise questions about the quality of the data, especially the number of confirmed cases, as some countries may distort the number of cases for a variety of reasons. For example, diagnostic tests of COVID-19 were not widely available especially during early periods of the pandemic. Nevertheless, these biases are likely constant across the 30-day period within any given country. Further, the number of deaths is much more difficult to distort whether intentionally or otherwise. Second, in all national policies, BCG is given early in life, typically at birth. It remains unclear whether BCG vaccination might be effective when given to adults. Nor is it known how long BCG vaccination might provide immunity to COVID-19 although it is effective against tuberculosis and lung cancer for several decades (2, 3). Moreover, it is uncertain whether BCG might have any adverse effects when given to those already infected with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for randomized clinical trials. Third, our analysis focused on the first 30 days of an initial outbreak in each of the countries (see also Supplementary Results 3-A and B). This analytic strategy is taken so as to minimize any potential effects of state-based coping actions (e.g., stay-home orders), thereby making the countries as comparable as possible. It also helped us to include a maximal number of countries. Nevertheless, future work must test the effect of BCG policy status under different conditions during the world-wide spread of the disease. Last, but not least, the rates of exponential growth showed substantial variability across countries that have mandated BCG vaccination (Fig. 2-A and B). Hence, BCG is by no means a magic bullet that assures safety against COVID-19. In all likelihood, there are some societal variables that moderate this effect. For example, mandatory BCG may have to be combined with cultural norms sanctioning social distancing (19). Future work must identify the conditions in which the formation of \u201cherd immunity\u201d is facilitated by nationally mandated BCG vaccination. All these limitations notwithstanding, the current evidence is sufficient to warrant a thorough investigation of the merit of the mandatory BCG vaccination in the fight against COVID-19.\n6\nReferences 1.

During these periods of and precautionary isolation, Purssell et al.10 and Sharma et al.11 reported negative psychological effects (i.e., increased levels of anxiety and depression). Social impacts have also been reported, including engendered limited visiting, lesser interaction with providers, and social exclusion.12\n.

In this context, mental health initiatives focused on (i) educating public and health care workers on how to properly deal with the immense pressure and anxiety, (ii) providing targeted mental health surveillance followed by effective interventions for at-risk populations (e.g., patients with prior mental health diagnosis, the elderly, people in total home confinement), and (iii) proactively establishing mental health programs specifically designed to manage the pandemic\u2019s aftermath, have been recently suggested as urgent measures of preventive and early intervention (WHO, 2020b; Galea et al. 2020, Usher et al. 2020).3,13,14 The psychosocial needs of at-risk individuals, including those in quarantine and/or home confinement, are suggested to be unique.14 Preventive, early and rehabilitation-focused interventions to promote mental wellbeing should be designed to be \u201ccrisisoriented\u201d and should be informed by outcomes from scientific research, as opposed to hypothetical and speculative suggestions. Consistent with this standpoint, a recent \u201cpaper advises\u201d article highlighted the urgent need of research to help improve understanding of the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the public.15 Therefore, to provide scientific data to help characterise the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis, our ECLB-COVID19 research group recently launched a multiple-language and multi-country anonymous survey to assess the effects of home confinement on psychosocial health status and multiple lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19).\nAn accurate understanding of behavioural changes accompanying the COVID-19 lockdowns\nis a necessary step toward a crisis-oriented based-research intervention to foster healthy lifestyle and physical and mental wellbeing.

During similar pandemic crises (2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak), previous research revealed several negative effects of quarantine measures on mental health and were associated with psychological and emotional problems such as depression and anxiety.22, 23 These negative effects (i.e., increased levels of anxiety and depression) have also been reported in two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted by Purssell et al.10 and Sharma et al.11 assessing the impact of isolation precaution on quality of life. Similarly, in their recent review of the evidence, Brooks et al.9 reported several psychological perturbations and emotional/ mood disturbances such as numbness, depression, irritability, stress, anger, nervousness, guilt, sadness, fear, vigilant handwashing, and avoidance of crowds in infected patients (SARS, MERS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and Equine influenza) during quarantine periods.

Main findings showed the negative psycho-emotional effect of COVID-19 home confinement was accompanied with a negative effect on the majority of assessed lifestyle behaviours with more (i) physically inactive peoples (+15.2), (ii) socially isolated peoples (+71.15%), (iii) unemployed peoples (+6%), (iv) more peoples experiencing poor sleep quality (+12.8%), and (v) unhealthy diet behaviours (+10%) compared to \u201cbefore\u201d the confinement period. Likewise, there are increased number of peoples (+15%) who are \u201cAll times\u201d using technology.\nThese preliminary findings confirm our hypotheses related to the lifestyle behaviours. To better understand the behavioural changes recognized as risk factors of declined psychosocial wellbeing during the confinement period, a correlation analysis between the \u0394 change in total scores of all assessed variables from \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cduring\u201d confinement was performed. Main findings indicate changes in mental wellbeing, mood and feeling and life satisfaction were significantly correlated to changes in lifestyle behaviours, including social participation, physical activity, diet, and sleep. These results suggest low mental wellbeing and life dissatisfaction and high level of depressive symptoms are related to social isolation, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet behaviour and poor sleep quality.\n.

This intervention should focus on enhancing social participation and promoting physical activity (e.g., the German example: allowing people to do outdoor physical activity in the large public garden with respecting distancing and hygiene precautions), healthy food, and sleep quality.\nSince participants demonstrated a higher acceptance rate (21.8% vs. 36.8%) toward the use of technology solutions, it seems interesting to foster social communication, and physical and mental wellbeing through technology facilities (e.g., social platform, gamification, mhealth, interactive coach etc.). Indeed, such ICT-based solutions would facilitate the delivery of COVID19-related health services, as well as preventive and rehabilitation crisis-oriented intervention in the communities with a specific challenge to reach risk populations. To expand the target group, WHO and the national authorities are encouraged to implement, during lockdowns crises, a \u201cTechnology-use\u201d support system including factors such as reducing internet fee, providing free based-ICT social inclusion platforms, promoting Gamification, Communication and interactive coaching technologies, tracking contacts and symptoms, switching from 4G to 5G network, to name a few.

Preliminary findings from this study offers some important insights into the effect of home confinement on mental wellbeing, emotional health status and the associated multidimension behavioural change in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Conclusion The preliminary results of the survey reveal a considerable burden for mental wellbeing combined with an unhealthy lifestyle during, compared to before, the confinement enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, social and physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet and poor sleep quality were associated with lower mental and emotional wellbeing (i.e., depressive and dissatisfaction feelings) were triggered by the enforced home confinement. These multidimensional negative effects underscore the importance to stakeholders and policy makers to develop, implement and publicise interdisciplinary interventions to mitigate the physical and psychosocial strain evoked by this pandemic. Promoting wellbeing by encouraging individuals to engage in indoor and/or outdoor physical activity in large public parks, whilst conforming with distancing and hygiene recommendations, can be suggested as preliminary measure with evidence for physical and mental benefits. Moreover, since participants have demonstrated a higher acceptance of the use of technology solutions during the confinement period, fostering an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL) via an ICT-based approach can be implemented. A proposed psychosocial strain mitigation strategy from ECLB-COVID19 consortium can be found in the supplementary file 2.

This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors.\nMethods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nFindings: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would \u2018somewhat\u2019 affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84\u00b79% had performed \u22651 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93\u00b74% performed \u22651 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month.

However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.\n3\nFunding: None\n4"}, {"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the course of four months, since the first reports about a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerging in December 2019, countries around the world have introduced a range of community mitigation strategies with the aim to lower the trajectory of this pandemic by reducing transmission, and avoid overwhelming health services. Community mitigation strategies refer to measures that people, and communities can take to slow the spread of infection during a period when vaccines and/or medical treatments that are not available [1]. They include the use of personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e.g., maintaining a physical distance of 1\u00b75-2\u00b70 meters between people, staying at home and postponing or cancelling gatherings); and environmental measures (e.g., routinely disinfecting surfaces). In some settings these strategies are voluntary, whereas in others they are now enforced (such as, via fines and/or jail time).\nGovernments are implementing strategies at large-scale that have previously been used in limited ways and for limited time periods i.e. during Ebola, avian influenza outbreaks and SARS. This means a large proportion of the population do not have prior experience undertaking these strategies. People\u2019s ability to comply with recommendations during emergency situations is influenced by a range of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors including: (1) what people perceive their susceptibility to infection to be[2]; (2) whether they perceive the infection to be serious, if acquired; (3) whether they have the necessary capacity, confidence and resources to comply with the strategies[3]; and (4) their sociodemographic status [4]. Effective control of this pandemic requires an understanding of people\u2019s perceptions about their willingness, motivation and ability/capacity to adopt strategies and how this relates to their perceived risk [5]. Perceived costs, perceptions about the benefits of\n5\nthe behaviors and the perceived impact of an individual's behavior on another\u2019s health will also influence engagement with these behaviors [6, 7].\nIn Australia, the government has recommended specific behaviors that can be classed as hygiene-related and avoidance related. To engage in these behaviors, people will weigh up the perceived costs and benefits related to themselves and others. It is therefore important to understand community perceptions and behaviors in order to develop effective messages. Accordingly, we carried out a cross sectional online survey of a large, demographically representative sample of the population of Australia in March 2020."}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "Cross sectional online survey\nWe conducted an online survey of Australian residents via a market research company (Quality Online Research (QOR)) between 18 and 24 March 2020.

Two items measuring participants\u2019 level of worry about current Covid-19 were used on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 for strongly disagree to 5 for strongly agree, these were combined and changed into a dichotomous scale of high and low.\nRespondents were asked to rate the perceived level of effectiveness of 13 items in reducing the risk from COVID-19 on a 5-point scale These items included those promoted by the government and those that were not (mask use when not symptomatic, taking antibiotics). The strategies were grouped into: (1) hygiene related behaviors (hand washing/sanitizing, cleaning surfaces) and (2) avoidance-related behaviors (avoiding crowds, public transport, and complying with quarantine restrictions). Given the relative novelty of social distancing for the Australian community, we also included a question that assessed the respondent\u2019s ability to adopt 6 different social distancing strategies (working from home, keeping children home from school, avoiding travelling, avoiding large crowds, quarantine if exposed, and isolation if symptomatic) with possible response options scored as 1 for very high and 5 for very low.

Whereas, only 525 (37%) thought that shutting the restaurants/bars after 6pm would have a high/very high effect and 696 (49%) stated that wearing a mask (when not symptomatic) would be effective. Taking antibiotics was considered to have low to very low effectiveness by most (n=908, 64%). Beyond perceived effectiveness, respondents were asked to comment on their ability (self-efficacy) to carry out social distancing strategies, 596 (42%) respondents rated their ability to work from home as high/very high. Practice of recommended measures/behavior\nThe most common hygiene-related behavior adopted was washing hands with soap and water (n=1087, 76\u00b76%), whereas keeping away from crowded places generally was the most common avoidance behavior (n=947, 66\u00b77%). Overall, 1205 (84\u00b79%) respondents reported undertaking \u2265 1 of three hygiene-related behaviors and 1326 (93\u00b74%) performed \u22651 of six\n9\navoidance-related behaviors (Table 1). Table 2 shows association between demographic characteristics and reported behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic. Five hundred and five (36\u00b73%) respondents considered the hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors as \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 as their main motivation to comply. Close to 80% of respondents (n=1127) who reported being worried about COVID-19 (high-very high) were found to have higher engagement with hygiene-related behaviors (OR 3\u00b78, 95% CI: 2\u00b78-5\u00b72) and avoidance-related behaviors (OR 3\u00b71, 95% CI: 2\u00b70-4\u00b78).\nControlling for demographic and worry variables, there was a higher association between performance of hygiene-related behaviors and trust in government/authorities (aOR: 2\u00b76, 95% CI 1\u00b76-4\u00b74), perceived high severity if infected (aOR: 1\u00b78, 95% CI 1\u00b72-2\u00b77), higher levels of belief in the effectiveness of behaviors (aOR 3\u00b74, 95% CI: 2\u00b75-4\u00b78), higher ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8,95% CI 1\u00b71-2\u00b71), low levels of concern if selfisolated (aOR: 2\u00b78 95% CI: 1\u00b76-4\u00b78), intermediate to higher level of risk perception (aOR: 2\u00b71, 95% CI: 1\u00b75-2\u00b79, aOR: 3\u00b71, 95% CI: 1\u00b79-4\u00b79) and serious or extreme perceived impact on health (aOR: 1\u00b77, 95% CI: 1\u00b72-2\u00b74) led to performance of recommended behaviors.

The majority (n=1349, 95%) agreed that they could self-isolate if necessary and that they had a family member or friend who could assist them in the event of isolation (n=1178, 83%). However, respondents did have concerns (high/very high) about not being able to access shops for food/supplies (n=681, 48%) and not being able to access a primary care provider (n=553, 39%). Amongst those who felt they\n10\ncould not manage self-isolation at home (n=122, 8%), the main concerns were centered around carers responsibilities for children, elderly parents and disabled family members.\n11"}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our results suggest that a large proportion of respondents have adopted one or more of either the hygiene-related and/or avoidance-related behaviors that had been recommended by the Australian Government. Considering the intense media coverage and government information, it is not surprising that there was a gravitation towards actual (or willingness for) adoption of hygiene strategies including hand washing/sanitizing. While anxiety levels were moderate, concerns were raised about accessing food and medical supplies if placed into selfisolation. Given the limited community behavioral COVID-19 studies published, we have compared our findings to two ongoing community surveys. Firstly, results from an online poll of 14,000 respondents from 14 countries (conducted at the same time point as our study), reported that their respondents in 8/14 countries expressed a belief that social distancing measures such as travel bans, and self-isolation would not prevent the spread of the virus, including participants from Australia (52%) [10]. Secondly, a German survey (conducted a week earlier then our study) identified that respondents had high levels of knowledge, but adoption of important protection behaviors was very low, and risk perceptions were especially low among the elderly [11].\nAmongst our participants, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 was at an intermediate level. There may be several factors at play here that account for the perceived level of risk. Firstly, people may be unaware of true risk since little reporting has focused on attack rates during the time of the study. Secondly, people may be subject to optimism bias \u2013 a phenomenon where people downplay their own risk of an outcome[12]. Thirdly, it is likely that some people assess their risk as being low due to already factoring in a change towards anticipated or already accomplished protective behavior [13]. During events that people deem \u2018familiar\u2019, we often see unrealistic optimism because the risk is perceived to be under control, as was the case in 2009 with the influenza pandemic, when adoption of precautions was low and there\n12\nwas a sense of personal security [2]. However, COVID-19 presents as an unfamiliar risk (for the large majority of the population had not experienced outbreaks of SARS or MERS) making the risk less tolerable for those who perceive the situation as uncontrollable [14]. When it comes to perceptions of risk, there are numerous studies documenting how they are associated with the uptake of preventive and/or avoidant behaviors. Studies conducted during/after the 2003 SARS outbreak reported that higher levels of perceived risk/susceptibility of SARS was associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors and also avoidance behaviors [15-18].\nWhile understanding a person\u2019s perception of risk is important, it is not the only condition needed for engagement. Higher risk perceptions may only predict protective behavior when people believe that effective protective actions are available (response efficacy) and when they are confident that they can engage in such protective actions (self-efficacy) [19]. According to Bandura social cognitive theory, an individual\u2019s self-efficacy plays a crucial role on the individual\u2019s likelihood to engage in a desired behavior. If an individual does not believe that he/she can carry out the behavior (i.e. physically distance themselves), there is little motivation to engage [20]. Three-quarters of the study respondents agreed that they could adopt the avoidance-related strategies, with lower scores for working from home and self-isolation at home. When asked whether they had adopted any of the hygiene related strategies, washing or sanitizing hands were the most common responses. These represent more readily adoptable strategies, as people in the community understand how to engage in them, believe that the strategy will protect them, and usually have the resources to carry them out. These easy to adopt actions have also been a focus of government mass media messages.\nWhen it came to avoidance behaviors, our respondents were less inclined to rate them as being effective or to have adopted them, in comparison to the preventive behaviors listed above. Perceptions regarding the efficacy of the strategy (as opposed to self-efficacy) have\n13\nalso been found to impact on intentions/likelihood to adopt or actual uptake [17, 21]. It is not surprising that some strategies including social distancing, scored low as people may not understand what the strategy entails, the rationale for its use, or what impact it may have on one\u2019s health. It should also be noted that individuals may not have the capacity or resources to comply with physical distancing measures because they: (1) have extended families living in their households; (2) they have a responsibility to provide care for someone outside of their home; (3) they may reside in share accommodation; (4) may not have access to internet/computer in the home setting or (5) because of the type of job they have they cannot simply shift to working from home. In these settings, providing mass media education is not going to suffice. What is needed is pragmatic solutions that support people financially and socially to participate. Examples including increases in social support and charities to assist with delivery of groceries and meals, home delivery from chemists, telehealth consultations bulk billed, drive through vaccine clinics etc.\nIt has been suggested that we start to prime people about what additional strategies may still need to be introduced [22]. This would entail talking with them about why the strategy would be implemented; the end-goal of implementing it; what could be the potential impacts; how members of the public engage; and the criteria for its de-escalation. In order to promote cooperation with social (physical distancing) strategies, governments may need to use realistic portrayals (community stories) and role modelling by influential actors in social networks. Observing competent role models perform actions that result in success conveys information to observers about the sequence of actions to use to be successful [23]. Motivation may be helped by creating media campaigns that foster awareness of the recommended behaviors and encourage people to share their strategies for complying with self-isolation and working from home.\n14\nAmongst our respondents, older age was associated with the adoption of precautionary behaviors, which aligns with the findings from Singapore and Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS outbreak [5, 17] and some studies during the 2009 H1N1/A pandemic [24, 25]. However, the pattern of age is not straight forward. In contrast to the above studies, others have reported higher levels of adoption of preventive behaviors amongst younger people (18- 24 years) in the context of the 2009 influenza pandemic. When it comes to gender, we found that females were more likely to report uptake of both preventive and avoidance behaviors, consistent with studies during SARS and H1N1 pandemic influenza [2, 5, 17, 26]. Earlier studies have indicated that women are more likely to perceive themselves to be susceptible and hence adopt the behaviors [15, 27]. When it comes to country of birth, we found that people born outside of Australia were less likely to adopt behaviors. This finding may relate to the capacity to access information, which at the time, was being disseminated in English and largely through mainstream media conferences and health department websites rather than community and language groups. Further work is needed to explore the associations between country of birth and pandemic-related behaviors.\nWhen asked what would motivate respondents to comply with a social distancing strategy, they nominated \u2018I believe it is the right thing to do\u2019 as the primary response. While this answer did not have any significant relationship with the outcome measures reviewed, it is still relevant when it comes to planning communication messages. It suggests that respondents may be influenced by a desire for social approval from others, an idea linked to the model of moral motivation. The model, developed by Brekke et al. (2003), assumes that individuals have preferences for achieving and maintaining a self-image as a socially responsible person [28]. In Brekke et al.'s model, self-image improves when the individual's actual behavior gets closer to her/his view of the \u201cmorally ideal\u201d behavior (i.e. the behavior that would maximize social welfare if chosen by every member of society). However,\n15\nindividual\u2019s participation can be conditional on whether they think others are also contributing [29]. Mass media campaigns that frame their messages around a social collective action/power or the inclusion of the general public within a team to assist the community response may be effective. The promotion of prosocial behaviors has been shown to be effective in vaccination uptake and could be adapted in promoting COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, such as how one\u2019s actions can contribute to protecting their grandparents [30]. This idea has been picked up by celebrities and the wider community on twitter under the #LockDownForLove, with people nominating who they are social distancing for. Whether these strategies work, needs to be further examined.\nEarly results from a study conducted across the US, UK and Germany has suggested that inducing empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to physical distancing [31]. The use of empathy in messaging is not a new concept and has been applied in a range of ways from the promotion of testing/treatment for STIs, through to increasing our acceptance of robots [32, 33]. Empathy is a skill which enables understanding of another person\u2019s experience. Here, people could be asked to imagine the perceptions, needs and impact (health, financial, social) of pandemic COVID-19 amongst our family members/friends.\nOur study includes a large, representative cross-section of the adult Australian population. People who could not communicate in English were excluded from the sample, which may have affected representation of ethnic minorities. We also had under-representation of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders and from those in remote settings. Secondly, as participation in our study was on a voluntary basis, this study has potential for self-selection bias by community members who are particularly concerned about this pandemic. In addition, we relied on self-reports of behaviors which may have led to over-\n16\nreported (social desirability bias). However, this may have minimized as the survey was selfcomplete and anonymous.\nBased on the available data, it appears that older individuals (aged >60 years) and people with chronic underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to severe disease. This presents a challenging situation. In the media there is reporting that \u2018COVID-19 is causing mild illness\u2019 in the majority but it\u2019s in the best interest of the country to stay home in order to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019. This will cause two responses \u2013 those who continue with their normal practice (not adopting or complying with the recommendations around social distancing/mitigation strategies) as identified in a proportion of our respondents. Motivating this group (especially those less likely to be at risk or suffer the health impact of COVID-19) to adopt behaviors that require marked change in their routines, beyond those related to personal hygiene. It may prove difficult unless people understand the required behavior, the rationale for it, are given clear and sufficient information about how to comply, and they believe the strategy will have an impact and are motivated to act [7, 17, 34]. They also need to have capacity and opportunity to comply with new behaviors for another 4 to 6 months. In order to engage a community, they need to feel like they are a valued part of a team, and that their contributions are valued and key to the response. Lastly, it is essential that governments ensure that resources, legalization and support measures are in place in order to facilitate community participation in community mitigation strategies.\n17"}, {"heading": "DECLARATIONS", "text": "Competing interests: Dr Holly Seale has previously received funding from drug companies for investigator driven research and consulting fees to present at conferences/workshops and develop resources (bio-CSL/Sequiris, GSK and Sanofi Pasteur).

Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city- and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. Moreover, we reinforce that social distancing protocols are fundamental to avoid critical scenarios and the collapse of healthcare systems. We also predict that economicinduced decisions for relaxing social distancing might have catastrophic consequences, especially in large cities.\nKeywords: SARS-CoV-2, social isolation, climate, spatial analysis"}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "In late December, 2019, the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nemerged in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in great China (Zhu et al., 2020). At the beginning of the infection outbreak, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been suggested to be of bat origin (Cheng et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and might have been transmitted to humans through intermediate mammals (Andersen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The initial diffusion of the virus suddenly became exponential, increasing the number of infected cases and deaths in Wuhan (Kraemer et al., 2020). In the next few weeks, it has become clear that the high virulence of the new coronavirus posed a considerable health threat on a global scale, quickly spreading to Asia, Europe, North America, and, more recently, South America and Africa.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the\ncoronavirus as a global pandemic. The declaration reflected the concern by WHO that countries were unable to control the dissemination of the virus (Li et al., 2020). The novel coronavirus is still spreading rapidly worldwide, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands deaths addressed to COVID-19, most of them concentrated in the United States and Europe.\nCommon symptoms of COVID-19 infections include fever, dry cough, and\ndyspnea but the most serious clinical case is lung failure associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Yang et al., 2020). From all infected patients, about 30% require mechanical ventilation and 2-5% die, with higher death rates in elderly people and those with comorbidities (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). Fortunately, most people have very mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic (Yang et al., 2020). Conventionally, laboratory testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nand quick antigen tests have been conducted prioritizing symptomatic or high-risk groups (Mizumoto et al., 2020). However, a recent study showed that substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of the novel coronavirus (R. Li et al., 2020), which forced the WHO to recommend that policymakers should mobilize mass testing in an attempt to retain initial local outbreaks effectively (Balilla, 2020).\nWith clinical symptoms that are indicative of many ordinary conditions, the new\ncoronavirus is the largest concern for human populations because it may cause severe clinical conditions that can readily overcome the carrying capacity of healthcare facilities. Although vaccines and immunotherapy protocols have been conducted in a rate never seen before, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19 yet (Lurie et al., 2020). The available interventions include rapid diagnosis and isolation of confirmed cases, and restrictions on mobility (Kraemer et al., 2020). Especially for in-development countries, social isolation has been listed as the most effective strategy to deal with COVID-19 and mitigate the risk for public health and economy (Coelho et al., 2020). However, understanding how other environmental and social factors are associated with human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 are fundamental for the decisionmaking process at a country-level.\nBuilding on evidence about the role of environmental factors such as\ntemperature and humidity on the survival of viruses, some studies forecasted the near future of the current outbreak (Sajadi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). For instance, Ara\u00fajo and Naimi (2020) built a global ensemble to model the monthly spread of COVID-19 under the prediction of temperature and humidity, although with some later criticism (Chipperfield, 2020). While these variables are known to interfere with the spread and survival of other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; Gaunt et\nal., 2010; Chan et al., 2011; Cauchemez et al., 2014), considering only the environment and ignoring social and behavioral factors might be inadequate to determine effective restraint strategies in the near future (Pybus et al., 2015).\nConsidering socioeconomic aspects, countries and regions across the world have\na very skewed distribution of income and wealth (Dabla-Norris et al., 2015; Davies et al., 2017). Even within countries, there are clear spatial distribution patterns of economic development, as it is explicit within Brazil (Skidmore, 2004). In terms of healthcare, socioeconomic indicators can be considered as a proxy for the ability of each city to identify and treat people with COVID-19 effectively (Coelho et al., 2020). Additionally, the dispersal of viruses among hosts follows a geographic pattern (Holmes, 2004). Thus, the physical distance among cities (and people) is certainly crucial for how the actual pandemic state will evolve (Chipperfield, 2020). In an attempt to investigate these factors, Coelho et al. (2020) found evidence that the air transportation of people across the word overcame environmental and socioeconomic factors, posing a strong argument towards social distancing and traveling restraint.\nThus, here we extended the investigation on which factors could be related to\nthe spread of the new coronavirus in Brazil, considering all cities on a nation-wide scale. We studied the exponential growth of time series data for over 460 cities with reported cases of infections by the new coronavirus, considering the effect of the environment, socioeconomic indicators, movement of people across the country, and social distancing. We demonstrate that the growth of COVID-19 in different cities is mostly determined by population size, transportation among cities, and the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols. This evidence points towards social distancing and mobility restriction as the main actions necessary to reduce the spreading of the pandemic and avoid its worst consequences."}, {"heading": "2. Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Dataset and exponential growth model", "text": "We obtained data on the daily number of people manifesting the COVID-19 in\nBrazil, available at the digital panel from the Ministry of Health (http://www.covid.saude.gov.br). This dataset comprises real-time information on disease cases that were confirmed through laboratory analysis and quick tests for every city. Our most recent data retrieval was conducted on April 20, 2020, which comprised information of 40,581 cases and time series data for 1,456 cities with at least one confirmed case, since the first recorded case in Brazil on February, 25, 2020. We chose April 20 as the last day because several cities have gradually relaxed their quarantine protocols and allowed many working activities to restore their functioning since then. In our analyses, we used only the exponential part of each time series by excluding previous days before the first confirmed cases in each city, and no time series had reached stabilization or decrease in the total number of confirmed records yet.\nWe fitted exponential growth models to the time series of each city and\ncalculated the intrinsic growth rate (r), as well as the slope coefficient (b) of the loggrowth model. Because our focus was on the overall growth of the number of confirmed cases, these two parameters were candidates to be used as response variables in our approach. However, some convergence failures for exponential models applied on short time series and the high goodness-of-fit of log-transformed models (average R\u00b2 = 0.84) led us to use the log-growth slope in our subsequent analysis."}, {"heading": "2.2 Predictor variables", "text": "In order to explore potential correlates of the early increase in the number of\ncases, we used climatic and socioeconomic data. Climatic variables included average\ntemperature (\u00baC) and precipitation (mm), retrieved from the most recent year available at the WorldClim online database (http://www.worldclim.org; Fick & Hijmans, 2017). This database comprises monthly information on these climatic variables. We downloaded temperature and precipitation values between February and April, which coincided with the time series of COVID-19 cases in Brazil and with the late summer season of the Southern Hemisphere, matching the world outbreak of the virus. From these data, we extracted values for each city according to their geographic coordinates, using the QGIS 3.12.1 software (QGIS Development Team, 2020).\nFor each city, we also extracted information on total population, Human\nDevelopment Index (HDI), and average income. These demographic data were obtained from the digital platform maintained by the Institute of Applied Economic Research, under the \u2018Atlas do Desenvolvimento Humano no Brasil\u2019 project (http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/). This initiative encompasses data about more than 5,500 municipalities in all 27 Brazilian federal units, with several socioeconomic descriptors derived from the 2010 national census.\nAs an additional correlate to the increase of the infestation by the new virus, we\nalso considered information on transportation of people across the country. First, we obtained data on air transportation available at the OpenFlights database (http://openflights.org/data.html), which included information on 122 airports within Brazil, and whether there is a direct flight connecting each pair of them (1,193 flights). To match the information on the spread of the virus across cities, we filtered these airport records to consider only those cities that had at least one confirmed infection, which yielded us a database containing 100 cities with 1,164 registered flights (Fig 1). We then used these cities and flights to construct an oriented graph with cities assigned as notes and flight routes as edges (West, 2001). From this network, we extracted a\nvariable that weighted the importance of each city to the country-level network: the Eigenvector Centrality (Bonacich, 1987). This metric quantifies both how surrounding cities are connected to a focal city and its connection to the whole network, directly and indirectly. Second, many cities with confirmed cases are not large enough to carry airports with commercial flights. In these cases, we used the geographic coordinates to calculate the proximity to the nearest airport (1 - standardized Euclidean distances), which was then multiplied by the centrality of their respective nearest airport. These two procedures yielded connectivity, a variable that represented the direct and indirect movement of people among large cities, based on their centrality, as well as their potential exchange of people with smaller municipalities nearby, described by the proximity-weighted centrality.\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of social distancing on the early spread of the\nnew coronavirus in Brazilian cities, we used State-level data on mobility of citizens (https://mapabrasileirodacovid.inloco.com.br/), which comes from a monitoring program that was exclusively implemented to be useful against the new coronavirus. This database comprises the percentage of people performing social distancing for each state on a daily basis. The index is based on information provided by telephone companies about the location of electronic devices (e.g., cellphones and tablets), which are tracked through their physical displacement under Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS connections. In practice, whenever an electronic device leaves a radius of ~200 m from what it is considered as \u2018home\u2019, the system records the event as a movement. Therefore, this protocol ensures the privacy and preserves the identity of citizens by focusing on the binary record of movement, rather than on the destination or specific routes of each citizen. This information yielded us a database with the time series of social distancing for each state. To obtain city-level data, we averaged the percentages between the first day of COVID-19 record in Brazil and the day where the thresholds of the minimum number of cases was achieved at each city (see below). See Supplementary Material Fig. S1 for more details on the names and locations of each Brazilian state. Time series of percentages of people respecting social distancing protocols at each Brazilian state are given in Fig. S2."}, {"heading": "2.3 Data analysis", "text": "We investigated whether the city-level growth rate of COVID-19 was related to\nthe climatic, socioeconomic, connectivity, and social distancing predictors using multiple linear regression models. Models were fitted using sequential subsets of the 465 cities considering increasing thresholds of the minimum number of confirmed\ncases: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160. This sequential sub-modelling approach intended to assess whether and how the COVID-19 outbreak across Brazil was related to each one of our predictors along the early spread of the disease, considering cities at different stages of the dissemination wave. All predictors were checked and only total population required log transformation to approximate a normal distribution. Before statistical analyses, we checked the multicollinearity of predictors, by computing the variance inflation factors (VIF), and removed those that the variance of a regression coefficient was inflated in the presence of other explanatory variables (i.e. VIF > 5; (Borcard et al., 2018)). In this case, HDI and average income showed collinearity, so we kept the later in our analyses because of its larger variation. In addition, we used Moran\u2019s I correlograms (Legendre and Legendre, 2012) to check if the control for spatial autocorrelation bias was required, which could somehow inflate the significance of each predictor. A summary of all the predictors used to fit the regression models is provided in Fig 2.\nFinally, we fitted independent linear models to each State to investigate potential\nregional trends in the COVID-19 growth, using the most important predictors identified in the previous steps, separately. For this procedure, we used only those states that had at least five cities with at least five confirmed cases. For inference, we then plotted the log-transformed total number of confirmed cases against the standardized slopes of the models, which portrays the state-dependent context of growth in COVID-19 cases. All analyses were performed in the R Environment (R Core Team, 2019) using packages ape (Paradis and Schliep, 2019), car (Fox and Weisberg., 2019), and igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006)."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "The overall performance of models fitted to the exponential growth of COVID-\n19 in each city was particularly good. The average variance explained by our predictors (R\u00b2) were 0.51 (>= 5 cases; 465 cities), 0.60 (>= 10 cases; 252 cities), 0.61 (>= 20 cases; 158 cities), 0.64 (>= 40 cases; 104 cities), 0.56 (>= 80 cases; 62 cities), and 0.67 (>= 160 cases; 33 cities). Considering the effect of each predictor on the exponential growth across all sub-models, social distancing had significant relationships in all cases, with an average standardized coefficient of -0.15 (Table 1, Fig 3). This variable was also the only with negative significant slope coefficients. Most importantly, social distancing had an intensifying trend in its negative coefficient across sub-models, showing an enhanced effect as the number of confirmed cases evolved. In addition, total population and connectivity of each city had significant relationships in five out of six sub-models, with average standardized coefficients of 0.14 and 0.07, respectively. Another predictor that played a secondary role was precipitation, which was significant in the first four sub-models, although with a considerably weak average standardized coefficients (0.05). Average income was only significant for the first sub-model, whereas temperature was not significant in any sub-model. None of the six sub-models presented bias related to spatial autocorrelation structures according to Moran's I correlograms.\nComparatively, the variable with the clearest effect on the exponential growth\nduring the COVID-19 early outbreak was social distancing (Table 1; Fig 3e). In practice, this result suggest that the more frequent people circulated within cities (lower\nsocial distancing), the faster the early spread of the new coronavirus (a result that was consistent across all sub-models). The results also reveal that the log-growth of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus increased with the total population of cities (Fig 3). Thus, larger population sizes led to faster spread of the new coronavirus. The third most important variable, connectivity (Fig 3d), had a similar trend but with considerably lower standardized coefficients (at least two times lower than total population, Table 1). In contrast, we observed that precipitation (Fig 3a) showed trends that were more important during the initial days in each city, with positive but very low coefficients (Table 1).\nWhen we built one independent model for each State, considering total\npopulation, connectivity, and social distancing (i.e., the three most important predictors), there was a high variation in the results depending on the focal State (Fig 4). Notably, the rate of increase in the number of COVID-19 cases was mostly determined by respecting social distancing protocols (i.e., higher R\u00b2; Fig 4c), followed by population size (Fig 4a). Although not with the same intensity, connectivity also had an important role on the observed growth patterns (Figure 4b).\nThe overall trend was that those states where people were performing social\ndistancing less effectively (leftward circles in Fig 4c) coincided with those states under the most positive effect of total population and connectivity (rightward circles in Figures 4a,b, respectively) on the spread of COVID-19. These examples include Amazonas (AM), Maranh\u00e3o (MA), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), and Rio de Janeiro (RJ). Moreover, total population and social distancing shared similar slices of explained variance (i.e., similar color in Figures 4a,c), such as in Amazonas (AM) and Maranh\u00e3o (MA). Where the number of cases were the highest in Brazil, such as S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Cear\u00e1 (CE), and Pernambuco (PE), both population size and social distancing shared nearly similar contributions for their observed condition of the spread of COVID-19. Particularly, the situation of Pernambuco (PE) can be considered as the fairest tradeoff between population size and distance of citizens (i.e., similar circle colors). By contrast, those states where the social distancing and the effect of total population were combined to produce the mildest scenarios of COVID-19 spread were Esp\u00edrito Santo (ES), Goi\u00e1s (GO), Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Paran\u00e1 (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC), compared to other federal units."}, {"heading": "4. Discussion", "text": "In addition to the pandemic state and the thousands of deaths caused by COVID-\n19 worldwide, some government boards and leaders manifest that their foremost concern regards the economic retraction, which is expected to last longer than the harmful effects of the COVID-19 outbreak themselves. In fact, they are not completely controversial from their perspective. While in-development countries\u2019 systems depend on economic income (e.g., sales of commodities), further projections are certainly contingent upon the creation and offer of jobs to remain sustainable. However, the\ntransmission of the virus and the complications arising from severe illness conditions may never rest on the bottom of the country-level priorities of one\u2019s management actions. By contrast, decision-makers should provide raw information to fuel research and development of effective containment and treatment of diseases. Hereafter we discuss our results in light of the situations that other countries and cities around the world have experienced.\nOur results show that the early spread of the new coronavirus in Brazil was\nmitigated by social distancing in some regions, but was also positively related to the size of the population of cities and how people moved across them. These outcomes underline that the direct and indirect contact among individuals was the most responsible for the rapid spread of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Brazil. Contrary to initial perspectives, the ability of COVID-19 to spread, estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) statistic, seems to be higher than the WHO estimated (Liu et al., 2020). Moreover, substantial transmission before symptom onset facilitates the rapid dissemination of the novel coronavirus (Hellewell et al., 2020). As diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people, social distancing certainly reduce transmission rates (Anderson et al., 2020). For this reason, keeping people apart from each other, whenever feasible, should be the primary goal of public health programs to prevent human-to-human transmission. We found evidences that the tools adopted by states and municipalities, including the closure of schools and commercial buildings, lock down of restaurants and malls, and prohibitions of mass gatherings had a negative impact on the expansion of COVID-19 in Brazil. Most importantly, this result somehow evidences that the combination of ignoring social distance especially in large and well connected cities will have catastrophic consequences.\nIn Great China, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak expanded fast throughout the\ncountry and the majority of early cases reported outside of its origin had admitted recent travels to Wuhan, the core of the disease spread (Chinazzi et al., 2020). Because of the association between both international and domestic air travel and the dissemination of COVID-19 (Bogoch et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020), one of the initial plans for the contagious control was to prevent people from flying around when the outbreak emerged (Kraemer et al., 2020). Actions such as reducing human mobility by restricting travels and declaring quarantine were fundamental to reduce the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 within and outside Wuhan, highlighting the importance of mobility restrictions in cities where there is a clear potential for spread of the new coronavirus (Fang et al., 2020). Fortunately, in China, the government-level positions were declared when contagious boundaries were relatively discrete (Kraemer et al., 2020).\nComparatively, this was not the case in Brazil, where the number of confirmed\ncases of COVID-19 are still growing exponentially (Crokidakis, 2020). The first case in Brazil was registered on February 25, 2020, in S\u00e3o Paulo City (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020). It was a man with recent travel to the Italy, precisely for the Lombardy region. Contrary to China, Italy did not conduct a fast protocol of social isolation and already had a high number of cases and deaths. Similarly to the observed in the United States, until the establishment of local transmission in Brazil, all reported cases had returned from recent travels abroad. Among them, it is noteworthy that 23 members of the delegation that accompanied the Brazilian President on a visit to the United States in March had since tested positive for COVID-19. Indeed, the proportion of estimated imported cases by airport of destination is highly correlated with the proportion of detected imported cases (Candido et al., 2020). For this reason, the Brazilian government announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers by March 31, 2020.\nMoreover, most State governors have imposed quarantines to contain the spread of the virus, but with no support from the federal government. A recent study suggests that more than 40% of social isolation in Brazil is necessary to flatten the epidemic curve of the new coronavirus and to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system (Croda et al., 2020). We defend that the only feasible way to achieve this target is to keep on with social distancing and avoid gatherings of people.\nDespite the aforementioned efforts, most of them being contemporaneous\namong many countries, the effective containment of COVID-19 is still a delicate task because of the characteristic mild symptoms and the transmission before the full onset of the disease (Fraser et al., 2004; R. Li et al., 2020). However, the example of the sanitary action conducted in Great China was fundamental when the contagious boundaries were discrete. In Brazil\u2019s context, there are cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other capitals such as Fortaleza and Manaus that likely act as superspreaders of SARS-CoV-2. In a network context, these cities maximize their influence on COVID-19 spread by exporting many cases to cities nearby (Madotto and Liu, 2016). This fact highlights that these centers should be of foremost concern, especially because some of them are near (e.g. Cear\u00e1 and Rio de Janeiro) or have already saturated (e.g., Manaus) their health system carrying capacity, given that the number of cases is growing very fast (Crokidakis, 2020). Therefore, the multiple potential Wuhan-alike regions in Brazil require government-level actions towards the necessity of multiplicative movement restrictions and social distancing. Moreover, there are speculations that the number of documented Brazilian cases is likely more than ten times lower than the real number (Bastos and Cajueiro, 2020), considering that tests are being conducted mostly only in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As an alternative to contour this situation, especially in those countries where several\nundocumented cases are expected (e.g., in Brazil), decision-makers could base their actions on the recent increase in number of SARS-related hospital records as a surrogate to the real amount of COVID-19 cases.\nIn addition to social distancing and restrictions on mobility, interventions\navailable include rapid diagnosis and isolation of confirmed cases (Kraemer et al., 2020). However, in Brazil, the diagnosis is completely biased towards people already at advanced clinical stages, in contrast to other countries such as China, Singapore, Germany, and the United States. Clearly, the growth rates of infections by the new coronavirus differ across countries (Coelho et al., 2020; Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020). As the rate differs, the factors determining the expansion of the infection within populations inevitably result from the policies adopted by each country. Our results reveal that this variation also occurs within Brazil. We believe that the reasons for this can be addressed to the continental-wide nature of our country, or the non-uniform demographic distribution across regions (Reis-Santos et al., 2013). Thus, the responsibility for the local spread of COVID-19 is directly dependent on Mayors\u2019 and Governors\u2019 positions.\nSeveral studies have shown that environmental factors such as local temperature\nand precipitation may affect the SARS-CoV-2 virus survival and transmission, with significant consequences for the seasonal and geographic patterns of outbreaks (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020; Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020; Ma et al., 2020). The mechanism underlying these patterns of climate determination is likely linked with the ability of the virus to survive external environmental conditions prior to reaching a host (Harmooshi et al., n.d.). A recent study showed that COVID-19 is more viable at lower temperatures (5-11\u00b0C) and was inversely related to humidity (Sajadi et al., 2020). However, our results indicate that climate variables had secondary roles in explaining the COVID-19\ngrowth rate in Brazil. This weak relationship suggests that seasonal climatic variation plays a minor role in the spatial spread and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks, as observed in recent studies on other regions (Baker et al., 2020; Coelho et al., 2020).\nFor instance, Manaus, the largest metropolitan city in North Brazil, is located at\nthe core world's largest rainforest, the Amazon, and is characterized by extremely high rainfall and temperatures throughout all over the year. This city registered more than one thousand confirmed cases and, recently, the state health department is suffering from the collapse of the health network due to the excessive cases of COVID-19. Among these, over 85 cases have been recorded in indigenous peoples and four deaths have been confirmed, including young people. Historically, due to the absence of antibodies, indigenous people are likely more susceptible to diseases such as flu, measles, rubella, and tuberculosis, which caused dramatic epidemic cases with the arrival of Europeans on the South American continent (Montenegro and Stephens, 2006). According to the latest census, more than 300 thousand of indigenous people currently live in the Amazon region, which is home to more than 100 tribes that are still isolated. The advance of illegal mining is a major threat to these peoples. Furthermore, instead of allowing religious missionaries to get in contact with isolated Indigenous groups, all means of transportation to these areas should be restricted (Ferrante and Fearnside, 2020). Therefore, the thoughtlessness by the federal government about COVID-19 potentially leads to a dramatic scenario for indigenous people.\nIt is important to highlight that the low predictability of climatic variables in\nexplaining the virus outbreaks patterns may be explained by the climatic peculiarities of Brazil during the summer that matched with the arrival and spread of the virus. Among all cities with confirmed cases, the average temperature was 24\u00b0C and the lowest temperature was 18\u00b0C, which is still far from what was indicated as ideal for the\nsurvival of the virus (Sajadi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). We found a positive relationship between temperature and precipitation variables and the growth in the number of COVID-19 cases, which is in line with previous findings in Brazil (Auler et al., 2020), but contrary to a global tendency. Although the coefficients were quite weak, this suggests that high temperatures and precipitation are not limiting factors for the spread of the virus. Conversely, a scenario of extreme concern is emerging, since the Winter season approaches, so temperatures will drop dramatically across many areas, especially in the South region. Therefore, at this early outbreak, any generalization is hasty and results have to be considered with extreme caution. Most importantly, the climate must not be used as an easing argument as particularly declared by the Brazilian President.\nThe actual emergence of the novel infectious agent has revealed the\nvulnerability of societies to new health threats (Morse et al., 2012). Brazil has recently experienced other public health emergencies under polio, smallpox, cholera, H1N1 (Influenza A), avian flu, yellow fever, dengue and zika (Croda et al., 2020). Along with the current COVID-19 outbreak, we judge that all these examples constitute an important legacy on the role of scientific research on dealing with epidemics. Thus, we may now face the most important event, in the recent decades, to learn on how to respond to emergencies effectively (Croda et al., 2020).\nWe need to assume that this study does not intend to serve as specific guidelines\nfor any decision-making process within any specific administrative council. Nevertheless, at a country-scale, we disapprove any government declaration or exposure that confronts the statements and protocols from the World Health Organization (WHO) or the United Nations (UN), which are international institutions that are presumed to be sovereign in their actions and recommendations since their utmost concern is the health\nand human wellbeing on a global scale. If eventually confronted, the arguments for doing so should be based on clear and strong scientific evidence, although it is very unlikely that these organizations have ignored such information while developing their protocols.\nIt is now clear that the most likely determinant of the virus spread is the vicinity\nof infected peoples and cities. While evacuating cities is not reasonable at this point, the easiest and the most feasible way to decelerate the COVID-19 spread is to avoid people transportation among them. This is fundamental within cities. While the virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is remarkably high and we are not able to tear houses or buildings apart, the only way to allow for the healthcare systems to treat ill people effectively is performing social distancing. In the absence of any effective treatment and vaccine, we support that social distancing is still the only feasible way to avoid the collapse of our national health system. Specially in Brazil, a \u20183rd world country\u2019, we have few hospitals and clinics with beds and respirators that are autonomous for treating SARS, which means that if we allow it to grow fast by not maintaining restrictions in movement between cities/states and social distancing within cities, we may certainly hope for the best but expect for the worst. We assume that the indicator for the efficiency of social distancing is a conundrum because the response about its effectiveness might come only weeks after the execution of any plans. In fact, people tend to underrate social isolation because the more effective it is, the less needed it seems to be. We also admit that any delayed action can be catastrophic, both for the health and economy of any country. Nevertheless, the expeditious suspension of social distancing under the coating of restoring the economic trades and jobs likely has even more dangerous side effects than COVID-19 itself."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This study was developed as a contribution to the Brazilian Ministry of Health\nabout the overall evaluation of collected data on COVID-19.

At the same time, during the early days of the pandemic, health systems have also seen a decrease in the number of patients presenting for acute care unrelated to COVID-191. Given public health recommendations to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many patients are not seeking and receiving care for acute conditions which may put them at significant risk for preventable morbidity and mortality in the future. The characteristics of those patients who are and are not presenting to emergency departments as a result of stay at home orders during the early days of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have not yet been substantially examined in the medical literature. We report changes in the characteristics of patients and presentations to the emergency department (ED) of an urban Level-1 Trauma Center before and after the statewide announcement of \u201cpeacetime emergency\u201d public health measures to respond to the pandemic on March 13, 20202."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "We conducted an observational study of visits to the ED from February 15 to April 10, 2020, a period of 28 days before through 28 days after the state\u2019s announcement.

This represents a decline of 35.2% in ED visits overall, or a daily decline of 4 visits, with respect to 2019. When we looked at billing, there was a 23% reduction in ED charges (95% CI 19-27%) and a 13% reduction in related hospital charges (9-17%) with respect to 2019 when adjusted for inflation.\nWe found significant changes in the distribution of patient demographics and visit characteristics after the state declaration, particularly in patient age, gender, race, insurance, arrival mode, and disposition. There were notable decreases in ED visits by patients under age 18 (-60.1%, 95% CI -68.0 to -50.2%, p<0.001) and over age 65 (-41.3%, -33.7 to -48.0%, p<0.001), women (-40.2%, -44.4 to -35.8%, p<0.001), African American and white patients (-37.0%, -42.6 to -30.7%; - 37.0%, -42.6 to -30.7%, p<0.001), Medicare recipients (-40.8%, -47.8 to -32.7%, p<0.001) and those with other insurances (e.g. liability, no-fault, workman\u2019s compensation, -74.1%, -80.0 to - 66.5%, p<0.001), ambulatory patients (-38.1%, -41.8 to -34.3%, p=0.021), and those who left prior to evaluation or discharge (-75.6%, -82.5 to -66.0%, p=0.021).\n5\nWhen we examined diagnoses, we noted significantly disproportionate decreases in patients presenting with syncope (-70.5%, -53.4 to -81.3%, p<0.001), cerebrovascular accidents (-58.3%, -73.3 to -34.9% p=0.049), abdominal pain (-43.3%, -50.8 to -34.8%, p=0.045), urolithiasis (- 70.0%, -84.0 to -43.6%, p=0.014), and back pain (-50.7, -61.1 to -37.4%, p=0.022).

Of note, proportional increases were also seen for all of the mental health and substance-use diagnoses we examined, though these were not significantly disproportionate. For all other conditions, the declines in presentations were proportionate to the overall change in ED visits."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Paralleling anecdotal reports, we noted a significant temporal association between our state\u2019s emergency declaration and an overall decline in daily ED visits. We found significant changes in ED patient demographics. The significant proportional decreases in visits by the overlapping populations of patients over 65 and Medicare recipients are likely a product of the extra prudence of higher risk individuals who are social distancing and staying at home. The significant proportional declines in visits by pediatric, ambulatory, and other patients likely reflect concerns about contracting COVID-19 in health care settings, overburdening the health care system with unrelated complaints, and adhering to public health recommendations. The decrease in number of patients who left prior to evaluation or discharge is likely due at least in part to the substantial operational changes made in response to the pandemic which have further streamlined patient triage, rooming, and evaluation.\n6\nThe most alarming finding of this report, however, is simply the overall decline in care-seeking for acute and potentially life-threatening conditions unrelated to COVID-191. Societal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to multiple phenomena, including diminished air pollution, traffic, and infectious disease transmission, which could all potentially contribute to improved population health over the long term1. These phenomena may well influence exacerbations of respiratory conditions as well as COVID-19 infections and outcomes over the short term3, but most of the conditions seen and managed in the emergency department would not be expected to suddenly decrease in incidence. Variable disease severity could play a role, as patients with less acute conditions might be able to delay or defer seeking care. Though we did not examine low acuity presentations that might also be managed in other outpatient settings, we did find a disproportionate decrease in presentations of back pain and other non-specific pains. However, we also found unexpectedly disproportionate declines in visits for conditions of significantly higher acuity like syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, and urolithiasis, similar to those noted elsewhere for presentations of myocardial infarction4,5. Additionally, we saw increases in ED visits for upper respiratory infections, chest pain, or shortness of breath, symptoms that might bring patients to the ED with concerns for COVID-19 infection. Similar trends in patient presentations have been seen around the world6, during prior disease outbreaks8, and in the outpatient setting8.\nThese are early days, and the timeline for the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes in patterns of ED utilization promise to be much longer than that covered in our preliminary study. This study is limited by its single center and cross-sectional nature, the short study time frame,\n7\nand lack of adjustment for multiple potentially confounding factors related to patients and their presentations to the ED, including disease severity, comorbidities, and COVID-19 risk factors. In spite of those limitations, we have found notable differential changes in the demographic factors, visits characteristics, and diagnoses of presentations to the ED unrelated to COVID-19. These will no doubt change along with the burdens of care as the pandemic progresses. Further efforts should and are being made to reassure and affirm the appropriateness of seeking emergency care9, particularly for the groups and disease processes that have been highlighted here and elsewhere4,5. Further research will also be needed to examine these and other factors contributing to delayed or deferred care and to monitor for the morbidity and mortality that is likely to result5,8 and which may already be occurring10.\n8\nAcknowledgement: We would like to thank Hrafn P.

Such restrictions impose a burden on the health in the population by potentially compromising physical fitness, which is positively associated with the ability to cope with an infection, and the immunologic and cardiopulmonary complications of more severe outcomes.2,3\nPhysical inactivity and poor mental health are among the most important risk factors for major disease morbidity, both in Western societies and globally.4 This holds true not only for the general population, but also for older adults and chronically ill patient populations who are at heightened risk of COVID-19-inducd ill health and mortality. For children and youth, physical activity is closely coupled to school-related activities, active transport and sport participation.5 Since schools have been closed during the COVID-19 pandemic this will also compromise physical activity in this population and might also risk longer-term sedentary behaviours.\nIn addition to the challenged to engage in PA, the closure of food suppliers has placed a burden on normal food-related behaviour.6 This is noteworthy since good nutrition is important for health and well-being, particularly when the immune system is challenged7 and limited access to fresh food could negatively affect overall physical and mental health.8 Anxiety and boredom evoked by quarantine are considered risk factors for consuming more food and food of a poorer quality\ncompared to standard living conditions.9 Combined with the potential for lower levels of PA, consuming a high volume of poorer quality food would lead to a more positive energy balance.10\nCurrently, there is limited evidence to evaluate the effect of confinement on PA and diet behaviours. It is important to investigate how PA and eating behaviour can be affected by lengthy restrictions to establish a fundamental knowledge basis from which to inform appropriate recommendations, including lifestyle modifications during this time. Thus, the main research questions are: (1) To what extent is physical activity and eating behaviours changed during lengthy restrictions? (2) Are there changes in mental state, mood and sleep during lengthy restrictions? (3) Which demographic, cultural and lifestyle factors should be considered as moderators of these effects?\nThe present paper presents preliminary data on physical activity and nutrition responses before and during home confinement, collected by an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19, link).

There were 1047 replies (54% women) from Western Asia (36%), North Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) which revealed that the COVID-19 home confinement has had a negative effect on all levels of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall) and an increase in daily sitting time by more than 28%. Additionally, a more\nunhealthy pattern of food consumption (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals and number of meals) was exhibited. Only alcohol binge drinking decreased significantly.\nDespite the recommendation that home confinement should not hinder people from being physically active,19 our results show that there is a decline in all PA levels during the home confinement enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the effect size is small to medium for most parameters, the 35% reduction in numbers of days per week walking is medium to large. In fact, 2.45 days is a serious change, independent from the number of walking days before confinement. However, the most prominent change was in sitting behaviour, which increased more than a full standard deviation (very large effect size: d=1.13), most likely due to the increased time that people were required to stay within the home in the quarantine. Indeed, 29% of the sample report to sit for 6-8 hours a day during confinement (vs. 24% before), a threshold area for which Patterson et al.20 assign increased disease and mortality risks. Far more serious was the proportion of individuals who sat for more than 8 hours a day, which increased from 16% before to 40% during confinement. Preliminary data indicate that 41% of the sample increased their sitting behaviour by only 1 hour or less, but this increased by five hours and more for 27% of the sample.\nThe results of this survey concur with recent studies demonstrating that the current COVID-19 home confinement could dramatically impact lifestyle activities globally, including participation in sports and PA engagement.21 The restrictions have reduced overall PA (number of days and number of hours) and access to exercise. In spite of an increased offering of PA guidance and classes available on social media, our results indicate that it has not been possible for individuals to adequately maintain their normal PA patterns with home activities. The decline in PA was accompanied by increased sedentary (sitting) behavior. However, the extent to which PA participation is impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic will be linked to the stringency of\nthe local government confinement policy. It is already been shown in China that different regional policies and socio-economic factors were associated with differences in PA.1 These factors need to be considered when design and promoting PA interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe results of this survey also found that, in contrast to the guidance, people changed their eating behaviors, with increased consumption of unhealthy food, eating out of control, more snacking between meals and an overall higher number of main meals.22 Regarding dietary behaviours, there seems to be no single behavioural problem. While a medium effect size (d=0.5) was recorded for the total score, a small effect sizes was registered for the type of food, number of meals and easting out of control. The effect size for snacks between meals was medium. Binge drinking alcohol showed the largest effect size (d=0.58), but, fortunately into the healthy direction, possibly because of social isolation. In particular, younger individuals are less likely to be surrounded by other drinking peers.23\nThe negative changes in the majority of eating behaviours could be attributed to eating out of anxiety or boredom,9 a dip in motivation to participate in PA or maintain healthy eating24 or an increase in anxiety or mood driven eating.9 Alternative support for motivation during home confinement may be sourced from assistive technologies such as apps, streaming services and social media. To counteract poor dietary behaviours, meal planning and opting for healthy alternatives is the best approach to combating unhealthy eating habits while in confinement.9\nThe results reported in this report should be utilised for further research and development in public health promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Motivating people to stand up can be a first step of health promotion against sedentary behaviour and its risks. In this regard, experiences from occupational \u201cwhite collar\u201d health may be translated into the isolation situation at home. Further research should address (1) insight into sub-populations, for the development of bespoke\ninterventions to address their needs; (2) interference of diet and PA behaviours, for improving interventions, and (3) identification of conditions for successfully maintaining a healthy lifestyle before as well as during isolation.\nAlthough many ideas and recommendations already exist,21,25,26 individuals seem to need more support to effectively use the services offered and to understand the consequences of inaction. Technology and social media allow for innovative health behaviour support via fitness applications and video streaming, motivation and gamification support, and also adding the beneficial social aspect which is very important to encourage maintenance of physical activity behaviour."}, {"heading": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "The strengths of this research project include a survey provided in multiple languages, and which has been widely distributed in several continents.

Specifically, political conservatism inversely predicted compliance with behaviors aimed at preventing the spread of the COVID-19. Differences in reported social distancing were mediated by divergent perceptions of the health risk posed by COVID-19 (Studies 1 and 2), which were explained by differences in self-reported knowledge of COVID-19 (Study 1) and perceived media accuracy in covering the pandemic (Studies 1 and 2). The politicization of COVID-19 may have prompted conservatives to discount mainstream media reports of the severity of the virus, leading them to downplay its health risks and consequently adherence less to social distancing protocols. These effects hold when controlling for key demographic characteristics as well as psychological variables, including belief in science and COVID-19-related anxiety. Thus, political ideology may uniquely explain COVID-19 behavior.\nKeywords: COVID-19, political ideology, social distancing, media bias, motivated\nreasoning\nPoliticizing the COVID-19 Pandemic:\nIdeological Differences in Adherence to Social Distancing\nBeyond medical treatment and hygiene maintenance, the primary intervention to combat\nthe deadly transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States involves social distancing\u2014a behavioral guideline discouraging close physical contact between individuals. Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of individual behavior in mitigating its impact, it is critical to better understand individual differences in adherence to social distancing guidelines. Although a few contemporaries examine personality factors underlying compliance (Blagov, 2020; Bogg & Milad, 2020; Zettler, Schild, Lillehot, & Bohm, 2020), our focus here is on psychosocial and psychopolitical factors influencing who may be most reluctant to embrace these calls for behavioral change and why. Unearthing the antecedents of compliance can help identify at-risk groups and enable the development of strategies to curtail the spread of the virus.\nAs illustrated by infamous images of American beaches heavily populated with\npartygoers during the pandemic, it is difficult to persuade people to change ingrained habits of face-to-face social interactions that are ordinarily construed as pro-social and personally satisfying. To motivate such drastic behavioral change, we assert, requires the following sequence: (1) people must be exposed to information that helps them understand the importance of changing their behavior and perceive danger in not changing their behavior (knowledge); (2) they must trust that information and find it credible (perceived media accuracy); which would then lead them to (3) perceive a collective health risk posed by the condition that demands behavioral change (perceived health risk); (4) ultimately leading them to engage in behavioral change (social distancing). Our emphasis on perceived risk/threat has some overlap with the\nHealth Belief Model (HBM; Rosenstock, 1974); unlike the HBM, however, we do not examine belief in the effectiveness of the recommended health behavior, as this seems self-evident given that the virus is spread through personal contact. Thus, we focus primarily on perceived health risk, and its hypothesized antecedents of knowledge and perceived credibility of that knowledge, in predicting compliance with social distancing measures.\nPolitical Ideology\nUnlike the phenomena typically addressed by researchers applying the HBM (e.g., cancer\nscreening, adherence to medical regiments, etc.), COVID-19 has become a highly politicized issue in the U.S. Prominent conservatives have generally expressed more skepticism and indifference toward the impact of the pandemic than have liberals. President Trump referred to the virus as a hoax on Feb. 28, 2020 and exaggerated the extent to which the U.S. had diminished its proliferation (Franck, 2020). Fox News host Sean Hannity referred to COVID-19 as a \u201cfraud\u201d (Rupar, 2020) and the network\u2019s Trish Regan accused Democrats of using the virus to \u201cdestroy and demonize the president\u201d (Washington Post, 2020). Additionally, Republican governors have generally been slow to stymie viral transmission, with the last eight states to issue stay-at-home orders all having Republican leaders (Masket, 2020); some elected Republican officials encouraged their constituents to patronize restaurants and bars precisely when federal health officials urged the opposite (Padilla & Montague, 2020). Even when reality constraints emerged about the danger of the pandemic, conservatives framed the debate as needing to balance human loss against economic destruction (Glickman, 2020).\nThe transformation of COVID-19 to a divisive issue imbued with political meaning and\nimplications suggests that how individuals conceptualize virus threat may be shaped by their own political ideology. Political ideology not only represents shared beliefs, opinions, and\nvalues held by an identifiable group or constituency (Freeden, 2001; Knight, 2006), but also endeavors to describe and interpret the world and envision the world as it should be (Jost, Federico, & Napier, 2009). Thus, ideology has the potential to impact perceptions of how the media is covering and ought to cover the virus, the collective health risk posed by COVID-19, and what actions are seen as appropriate in response. A pathway through which ideology may do so is motivated reasoning.\nMotivated Political Reasoning\nIndividuals trying to discern the truth about COVID-19 are likely to rely on elected\nofficials and news figures they trust. Fiorini and Abrams (2008) and Layman, Carsey, & Horowitz (2006) suggest that the evaluation of policy positions is driven from the top-down with party elites signaling appropriate views and individuals following those cues consistent with their prior ideology (Malka & Lelkes, 2010). Research consistent with the cultural cognition theory suggests that individuals are more persuaded by policy experts perceived to hold similar values to their own (Kahan, Braman, Cohen, Gastil, & Slovic, 2010). Based on the recent American political context, we argue that opinions about COVID-19 have become an important identity marker differentiating liberals from conservatives; the liberal view emphasizes the threat posed by the virus and the urgency in containing its spread, while the conservative view emphasizes overreaction to an exaggerated threat.\nOnce perceptions of COVID-19 severity became linked to political identities, individuals\nmay have begun to process subsequent information through an ideological lens (Goidel, Shields, & Peffley, 1997), making objectivity more difficult. This motivational desire to arrive at a particular conclusion has been referred to in various terms including directional motivation (Bolsen, Druckman & Cook, 2014; Druckman & McGrath, 2014; Taber & Lodge, 2006),\npartisan motivated reasoning (Bolsen et al., 2014), and ideologically motivated cognition (Kahan, 2012), all political applications of the more general motivated reasoning phenomenon (Kunda, 1990). Speaking to its impact, ideology has been shown to affect the processing of information and subsequent judgments of that information in a number of policy domains including embryonic stem cell research, capital punishment, HPV vaccinations, climate change, energy policy, affirmative action, and gun control (Bolsen & Druckman, 2018; Bolsen et al., 2014; Campbell & Kay, 2014; Hart & Nisbet, 2012; Kahan, 2012; Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Taber & Lodge, 2006).\nLodge and Taber (2013) implicate three mechanisms in directional reasoning:\nconfirmation bias, where people seek out information supporting their prior belief; prior attitude effect, where new information more discrepant from an individual\u2019s prior belief is devalued (and congruent information is perceived as stronger); and disconfirmation bias, where information contrary to one\u2019s beliefs receives greater scrutiny and counter argumentation. In this way, a highly identified conservative would likely disproportionately expose themselves to media depicting COVID-19 as an exaggerated threat while discrediting contradictory media. These processes help explain why persuasive messages can boomerang and increase predispositions to do and think the opposite (Byrne & Hart, 2009; Wolburg, 2006) and how the politicization of an issue may amplify group differences and lead to even more polarization (Druckman & McGrath, 2019; Taber & Lodge, 2012).\nPerceived Media Bias\nMotivated political reasoning and its effect on information processing can also be\ncontextualized in the unique relationship between partisans and contemporary media. That is, the source of COVID-19 information also likely affects subsequent processing of it. Partisans\nperceive neutral news content as biased against their views, a phenomenon known as the hostile media effect (HME; e.g., Gunther, Edgerly, Akin, & Broesch, 2012). Conservatives in particular are more likely to distrust the news media (Lee, 2005; 2010) and show the HME (Eveland & Shah, 2003; Vraga & Tully, 2015). This may help explain why conservatives are most likely to display partisan selective exposure (Rodriguez, Moskowitz, Salem, & Ditto, 2017), increasing the chances that their skeptical views on COVID-19 severity are formed though isolated echo chambers. There is further evidence that these conservative information silos are more likely to contain fake news than their liberal counterparts (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Guess, Nyhan, & Reifler, 2018), distortions potentially magnified by findings that conservatives are less discerning of the truth in news media than are liberals (Pennycook & Rand, 2019). Being lower in trust of science (Gauchat, 2012), especially to use scientific knowledge in policy pursuit, may also make conservatives less trustful of the scientific experts influencing COVID-19 policy. As such, conservatives may be inclined to (a) believe the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of COVID19 to be inaccurate, (b) consume biased, erroneous information about COVID-19 downplaying its risks, and (c) fail to recognize the inaccuracies in these news accounts, thus promoting conservatives to underestimate the health risks of the virus.\nBecause of the confluence of these factors related to motivated political reasoning, we\nproposed the following hypotheses, H1 stating the effect and H2-3 implicating mediators of the effect:\nHypothesis 1: More conservative participants would be less likely to follow social\ndistancing guidelines.\nHypothesis 2: The behavioral differences in H1 would be explained by more conservative\nparticipants perceiving the virus as presenting less of a health risk.\nHypothesis 3: How well-informed participants are about COVID-19 and beliefs about the\naccuracy of the mainstream\u2019s media coverage of the virus would mediate the relationship between conservatism and perceived health risk.\nThe Present Research\nOur predictions stand on a solid data-driven basis in addition to their grounding in theory.\nPublic opinion polls conducted in the U.S. during March 2020 (e.g., Civiqs, 2020; Gallup, 2020; Marist, 2020; NBC News/Wall Street Journal, 2020; NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist, 2020; Pew, 2020; You Gov Blue, 2020) indicate that Democrats are more likely to report trusting information about the virus from the media, fear becoming infected with the virus, evaluate COVID-19 as a major threat to the U.S. population, and be concerned about its spread to their community. These greater concerns about the virus among Democrats translate in polling into greater willingness to report practicing social distancing, including refraining from eating out, travelling, or attending social gatherings.\nSeveral recent empirical studies have examined ideology as a factor in COVID-19-related\nperceptions and behaviors, with contrary results. The majority of studies have reported small but significant correlations (r values ranging from -.11 to -.26) between conservative ideology and (a) preventive behavior (e.g., Jordan, Yoeli & Rand, 2020; Oosterhoff & Palmer, 2020; Pfattheicher, Nockur, Bohm, Sassenrath, & Petersen, 2020; Plohl & Musil, 2020; but see Harper, Satchell, Fido, & Latzman, 2020) and (b) perceived threat (Oosterhoff & Palmer, 2020; Plohl & Musil, 2020; but see Kackanoff, Bigman, Kapsaskis, & Gray, 2020).\nIn short, there is tentative, but not unequivocal evidence, to support our contentions about\nthe role of ideology. However, a critical limitation is that none of these existing studies primarily set out to assess the impact of ideology on social distancing behavior and potential mediators of\nthis effect. Because our predictions were rooted in how COVID-19 became politicized uniquely in a U.S. context, we tested our mediation model in an exclusively U.S. sample. Extending knowledge beyond that generated by public opinion polls, the current research assessed constructs with multiple items typically continuously measured, tested mediational pathways, controlled for demographic variables, and measured political ideology as an individual continuous predictor rather than a categorical variable of party affiliation. In addition to measuring our predictor, outcome, and hypothesized mediators, we also assessed other potentially relevant variables, including perceived threat of the virus to self/known others, belief in science, and COVID-19-induced anxiety.\nStudy 1"}, {"heading": "Method & Results", "text": "Participants. Six-hundred twenty-four U.S. adults with an Amazon Mechanical Turk\n(AMT) approval rating exceeding 96% participated in this study on AMT for monetary compensation (US $0.40) on April 1, 2020. Twelve participants were excluded for failing an attention check, as were thirty-five participants who reported being diagnosed with COVID-19; thus, data were analyzed with the remaining 573 individuals (Mage = 39.43 years old, SD = 12.61, age range = [18-78], 338 males, 235 females). This sample provided 80% power to detect a small effect size of r = .12. This study received Institutional Review Board approval.\nMeasures and Data Analysis. Composite scores for the outcome variable social\ndistancing and hypothesized predictive variables conservatism, perceived health risk, belief in media accuracy, how well-informed, and the covariates age, likelihood infected, likelihood others infected, belief in science, and anxiety were computed by arithmetic average of the individual questionnaire item ratings (see Appendix). Descriptive statistics for all original scales\nare presented in Table 1 including their internal consistency, all a\u2019s > .83. A strong negative skew was noted for social distancing (-2.05) and health risk (-1.43) and well-informed (-1.35). Because the kurtosis for these was also high and positive, a base-10 logarithmic transformation on reflection scores was performed on each, reducing the skewness in social distancing scores (1.41), health risk (.85), and well-informed (.77). The following analyses included parameters that estimated the proximal effects of conservatism on hypothesized mediators and the indirect effects of conservatism on social distancing through hypothesized mediators in a single model. Results\nThe data for this research is available at OSF, osf.io/su27g/files; no coding is available.\nThe analytic strategy began with inspecting the correlations among the measures (see Table 2). Conservatism was significantly negatively associated with social distancing, media accuracy, well-informed, likelihood infected (and others infected), belief in science, anxiety, and positively associated with age. Importantly for the present hypotheses, these particular variables were reliable individual predictors of reported social distancing: media accuracy (r = .44), how well-informed (r = .56), and perception of health risk (r = .59); the covariates were positively related to social distancing, except likelihood infected.\nAll measures were entered into an ordinary least squares multiple regression analysis to\nevaluate their ability to predict social distancing. The full model predicted social distancing, F(9,563) = 48.46, p < .001, R2 = .437, with five of the nine scales resulting in significant model coefficients (see Table 1). To model the causal pathway from conservatism to reported social distancing, multiple regression analyses provided model parameter estimates for indirect effects through the three hypothesized correlates\u2014health risk, media accuracy, and well-informed\u2014with the variability in social distancing attributable to significant correlates of the outcome variable controlled. The first regression revealed a significant total effect of conservatism on social distancing (B = -.20, p < .001), supporting Hypothesis 1 that compliance with social distancing guidelines is inversely related to conservatism. The scores for health risk were then regressed onto conservatism, revealing a significant inverse relationship (B = -.23, p < .001). Next, health risk was entered with conservatism as predictors of social distancing, resulting in significant relationships: health risk (B = .52, p < .001) and conservatism (B = -.08, p = .046). In support of Hypothesis 2, the conservative Sobel test (MacKinnon, Warsi, & Dwyer, 1995) indicated significant mediation of the relationship by health risk scores, z = -5.14, p < .001, 95% CI (-.02, - .01). Regression analyses also provided parameter estimates to rule out mediation by each covariate, resulting in no significant indirect effects of age, likelihood infected, others infected, belief in science, and anxiety: all 95% confidence intervals for indirect effects included zero.\nTo address Hypothesis 3, the two related factors well-informed and media accuracy were\nassessed as potential mediators of perceived health risk as an outcome variable. That is, a further decomposition of the indirect effect of conservatism on social distancing examined the effect of conservatism on health risk through media accuracy and well-informed. Conservatism was first regressed on the two mediators, resulting in significant relationships for both media accuracy (B\n= -.45, p < .001) and well-informed (B = -.10, p = .022). Next, these mediators were entered with conservatism as predictors of perceived health risk, resulting in significant relationships for both media accuracy (B = .43, p < .001) and well-informed (B = .38, p < .001) but a null effect of conservatism (B = -.06, p = .145). Together, the media accuracy and well-informed significantly mediated the inverse effect of conservatism on likelihood of perceiving a risk to community health, z = -6.94, p = .002, 95% CI (-.04, -.02). Each mediator explained unique variance: media accuracy, z = -7.78, p < .001, 95% CI (-.03, -.02) and well-informed, z = -2.35, p = .019, 95% CI (-.01, -.001). The resulting pathway model is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Political ideology predicted differences in perceptions and behavior related to COVID-19\nfor all the variables measured in Study 1. Conservatives were less likely to report being informed about the virus, believe in the accuracy of the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of the epidemic, perceive the virus to pose a health risk, believe in science, be anxious because of COVID-19, believe they or someone they knew would become infected, or practice social distancing. The data supported hypotheses II and III: Social distancing was mediated by belief that COVID-19 presents a societal health risk, which in turn was mediated by how informed of the virus individuals rated themselves to be and the accuracy they ascribed to mainstream media accounts of the disease. Thus, results support our theorizing grounded in motivated political reasoning that ideology affects knowledge, which shapes overall risk perception, which then shapes behavior. Interestingly, none of the other variables mediated the ideology-behavior link, including belief in science.\nSeveral demographic explanations may also account for these results. Conservatives live\nin more sparsely populated areas hit less hard by COVID-19. Relative to liberals, they face the weakest incentives to follow social distancing. Accordingly, in Study 2, we examined whether Study 1\u2019s effects would hold when controlling for population density of participants\u2019 residences, income, and education level, as these may impact social distancing and differ based on ideology. We also assessed whether ideology would still predict social distancing as the pandemic increased in severity. Wise, Zbozinek, Michelini, & Mobbs (2020) in samples from March 11 and March 16 found growing awareness of risk and reported that individuals were increasingly engaging in protective behavior. In the U.S., from sample 1 (April 1) to sample 2 (April 4), the number of states issuing lockdown orders increased from 34 to 40 (Mervosh, Lu, & Swales,\n2020). Total U.S. cases increased 40% during the three-day period, and total deaths increased 105% (W.H.O., 2020). Thus, we tested whether changes in the reality of the epidemic would attenuate the ideological effects we obtained in Study 1.\nStudy 2"}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "The method of data collection was analogous to Study 1. Six-hundred thirty U.S. adults\nwith an approval rating exceeding 96% participated in this study on AMT for monetary compensation (US $0.40) on April 4, 2020. Eight participants were excluded for failing an attention check, as were fifty-two participants who reported being diagnosed with COVID-19; thus, data were analyzed with the remaining 580 individuals (Mage = 39.12 years old, SD = 12.85, age range = [19-79], 310 males, 270 females). This sample provided 80% power to detect a small effect size of r = .12.\nComposite scores for the variables (including population size, education, and income)\nwere computed by arithmetic average of the individual questionnaire item ratings (see Appendix). Descriptive statistics for all original scales are presented in Table 3 including their internal consistency, all a\u2019s > .79. A base-10 logarithmic transformation was again performed to reduce negative skew in social distancing scores, health risk, and well-informed. Results\nThe same analyses were performed to model the causal pathway from conservatism to\nreported social distancing compliance. The correlation matrix of data from Study 2 (see Table 4) revealed the same pattern of relationships as found in study 1, with one main exception: wellinformed was no longer related to conservatism. When all measured scales were entered into multiple regression analysis, the combination of all factors predicted social distancing, F(12, 567)\n= 22.49, p < .001, R2 = .322, resulting in the same five predictors as significant model coefficients (see Table 3). The first regression for the model revealed a significant total effect of conservatism on social distancing (B = -.11, p = .012), replicating the negative relationship of social distancing and conservativism. Regressing the scores for health risk onto conservatism again resulted in a significant inverse relationship (B = -.13, p = .003) and when health risk was entered with conservatism as predictors of social distancing, a significant relationship was obtained for health risk (B = .47, p < .001) but not for conservatism (B = -.05, p = .206). Evidence of the significant indirect effect through health risk was provided by Sobel test, z = -2.76, p = .002, 95% CI (-.01, - .001). Performing similar regressions to assess any mediation by covariates in Study 2 resulted in no evidence of significant mediation.\nThe replication of analysis for the two related factors well-informed and media accuracy\nas mediators of perceived health risk as an outcome variable revealed a similar significant relationship between conservatism with media accuracy (B = -.38, p < .001) but not with wellinformed (B = .01, p = .841). When these mediators were entered with conservatism as predictors of perceived health risk, significant relationships were found for both media accuracy (B = .49, p < .001) and well-informed (B = .39, p < .001) but not with conservatism (B = .03, p = .482). Together the measures significantly mediated the decreasing likelihood of perceiving health risk with increasing conservatism, z = -2.36, p < .001, 95% CI = (-.14, -.03). Finally, although media accuracy was again a significant individual mediator of the effect of conservatism on perceived health risk, z = -8.04, p < .001, 95% CI = (-.06, -.04), well-formed scores did not mediate the effect, p = .842. The resulting pathway model is shown in Figure 2.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________ Others Health Well- Media Belief Age Conserv Infected Infected Risk Informed Accuracy in Sci Anxiety _____________________________________________________________________________________ Social Distancing .105* -.120** .081 .189** .538** .428** .376** .093* .106* Age .177** -.107* -.086* .014 .113** -.015 -.131** -.174** Conservatism -.148** -.182** -.202** -.036 -.476** -.374** -.253** Infected .726** .328** .089* .154** .079 .345** Others Infected .402** .205** .228** .073 .325** Health Risk .401** .521** .140** .292** Well-informed .337** .110** .080 Media Accuracy .232** .210** Belief in Science .085* Anxiety Population Education _____________________________________________________________________________________\n(Table continues)\nOverall, Study 2 yielded similar results to Study 1 (which occurred three days earlier),\neven after controlling for residential population density, education, income, and age. Consistent with predictions, conservatism inversely predicted social distancing adherence, an effect that was mediated by conservatives perceiving COVID-19 as less of a societal health risk. The lowered perceived health risk among conservatives was itself mediated by beliefs that the mainstream media is inaccurately exaggerating virus severity. Unlike Study 1, reported knowledge did not\nmediate the link between conservatism and perceived health risk. Here, the time elapsed between the two studies may have been impactful. As the reality of the lockdowns became more realized and the disruptive effects of the pandemic became harder to ignore, conservatives came to believe themselves as informed about the virus as liberals. With the knowledge gap erased, the more enduring beliefs about media bias remained to influence perceptions of the health threat posed by the virus. Thus, results are still largely consistent with the mechanisms we propose while contradicting alternative accounts.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present research complements a growing literature on what motivates behavioral\nchange in pandemics. While prior research has shown that demographic characteristics such as age, income, and geography are important determinants of the adoption of recommended public health behaviors (Ibuka et al. 2010; Bults et al. 2011), we found that those factors were relatively trivial compared to ideological differences in predicting reported social distancing adherence for COVID-19. Our findings corroborate recent public opinion polls and replicates empirical results (Jordan et al., 2020; Oosterhoff & Palmer, 2020; Pfattheicher et al., 2020; Plohl & Musil, 2020) while extending them by uniquely testing processes by which conservatism predicts less social distancing. Although conservatives were less likely to report believing in science, to believe they would personally become and know someone who would become infected with the virus, and to feel less anxiety related to the virus, none of these factors explained their lower reported social distancing. Explanations that conservatives rebuke the behavior guidelines because they live in more unaffected rural areas, or are lower in education or income did not account for differences in social distancing. Rather, consistent with predictions derived from a motivated political reasoning account, we found that ideological effects were explained by differences in\nreported knowledge of COVID-19 (Study 1), perceived mainstream media accuracy (Studies 1 and 2), and perceived COVID-19 societal health risk (Studies 1 and 2). Our data suggest that conservatives believe less in mainstream media stories about the virus, interpreting sources through an ideological lens, in turn prompting them to discount the threat of the pandemic to society. This skewing of risk perception is not inevitable but seems to depend on the extent health behavior becomes politicized: In the case of the less politicized (H1N1) pandemic influenza, for instance, individuals\u2019 perceived likelihood of infection tracked fairly closely to objective risk (Ibulka, Chapman, Meyers, Li., & Galvani, 2010).\nAlthough some behavioral differences may arise from greater liberal sensitivity to\nsuffering and heightened moral emphasis on care/harm (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009), the present results suggest that at a basic level, liberals and conservatives do not agree on the facts of the pandemic. Epistemic disagreements are nothing new in politics, but here the consequences of believing the wrong truth and acting on it are potentially immediate, tangible, and lethal. That ideology shapes behavior even when the stakes could not be greater highlights the power of what has been called tribal epistemology (Roberts, 2017): Information is evaluated based on whether it supports the political ingroup\u2019s values and goals and meets leader approval rather than on its conformity to customary standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world. It appears that the conservative movement\u2019s efforts to undermine trust in journalism among its supporters, building and reinforcing Republican reliance on alternative ideological information sources (Grossman & Hopkins, 2018), is not a switch easily disconnected even when confronted with an issue evoking drastic personal consequences. The resulting lower compliance, then, is a potentially fatal byproduct of politicizing the pandemic.\nAnother harmful outcome in linking health to political agendas is that when policy\nsuccess depends on participation, leaders are incentivized to ignite negative policy attitudes to undermine the policy (Trachtman, 2019). To some degree, this dynamic is already unfolding at the time of writing. President Trump and Republican leaders have called to \u201creopen\u201d the economy and end social distancing while liberals urge the health danger inherent in doing so. Given epistemic disagreement, we expect the two major parties to continue framing the disease in a way consistent with their unique understanding of the facts. A growing part of the conservative narrative seems to emphasize the economic costs of social distancing whereas for liberals, the emphasis is on the potential costs of not social distancing. Certainly, the solutions to the pandemic may be distasteful to conservative cultural values emphasizing freedom, economic growth, and weak central government (see Campbell & Kay, 2014; Kahan et al., 2010), motivating conservatives further to discredit information on its risk. Operating with a different set of facts likely lowers the criterion for conservatives to be persuaded by the negative consequences of social distancing (and does the opposite for liberals). Because conservatives believe the virus poses less of a health risk to society, they may be willing to tolerate less economic harm than are liberals, who believe more strongly in the societal health risk raised by the pandemic. We would, therefore, expect conservatives to report less willingness to endure social distancing for an indeterminant timeframe and this to be mediated by greater sensitivity to the immediate economic costs of social distancing.\nIt does not seem inevitable that conservatives take a more relaxed approach to disease\nand epidemics. In 2014, with President Obama in power and conservative trust in government lowered, Republicans were more worried about the Ebola outbreak than were Democrats. In some ways, our findings contradict what may be expected from moral foundations theory\n(Graham et al., 2009), which has found conservatives to be more sensitive to purity, disgust, and the risk posed by pathogens than are liberals. Excluding the potential pull of the care/harm foundation for liberals, COVID-19 may be a case where politicization overrides the impulses of these moral instincts. Future research should examine ideological effects in cultural contexts where social distancing has not been as politically divisive; it may be noteworthy that a study done with a predominately English sample found no ideological effects on social distancing adherence (Harper, Satchell, Fido, & Latzman, 2020).\nWe should also note that the present research did not actually measure compliance with\nsocial distancing but rather the self-reporting of it. We are encouraged by a Danish study suggesting that estimates of compliance with COVID-19 regulations do not suffer from social desirability tendencies (Larsen, Petersen, & Nyrup, 2020). Nonetheless, it would be interesting, for example, to examine cell phone data at the county level and determine (a) how much it can be predicted by partisan composition; and (b) how much a given individual\u2019s reported deviation from the aggregate behavior of their locality can be explained by ideology.\nFinally, the question emerges of how to intervene to prevent the potential loss of life\nincurred by politically motivated reasoning. One approach may be suggested by Jordan et al. (2020) who found that messaging that frames prevention efforts as public goods \u2013 emphasizing the benefits of such behaviors for other people\u2019s health (\u201cdon\u2019t spread it\u201d) \u2013 is more effective for increasing prevention intentions than messaging focused on the benefits for the individual (\u201cdon\u2019t get it\u201d). This approach could be combined with promoting empathy for the most vulnerable, which enhances the motivation for social distancing (Pfattheicher et al., 2020). Whether such interventions would provide push to break through the ideological pull remains a question ripe for investigation.\nReferences\nAllcott, H., & Gentzkow, M. (2017).

While crucial to limiting the spread of the virus, \u201csocial distancing\u201d may lead to severe psychological consequences, especially in lonely individuals. We used crosssectional (n=380) and longitudinal (n=74) designs to investigate the links between loneliness, mental health symptoms (MHS) and COVID-19 risk perception and affective response in young adults who implemented social distancing during the first two weeks of the state of epidemic threat in Poland. Loneliness was correlated with MHS and with affective response to COVID19\u2019s threat to health. However, increased worry about the social isolation and heightened risk perception for financial problems was observed in lonelier individuals. The cross-lagged influence of the initial affective response to COVID-19 on subsequent levels of loneliness was also found. Thus, the reciprocal connections between loneliness and COVID-19 response may be of crucial importance for MHS during COVID-19 crisis.\nKeywords: loneliness, mental well-being, mental health, COVID-19, preventive strategies"}, {"heading": "Data availability statement:", "text": "Data from the current study can be accessed via https://osf.io/ec3mb/"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Within three months-time since the first case of the novel coronavirus originating from\nWuhan (Hubei, China) has been officially reported, COVID-19 has spread to 210 countries and territories affecting over 1602 thousand individuals and causing 95735 deaths as of 10th April (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). The characteristics of the virus, including high variance in presentation of symptoms, high transmission rates, a relatively long incubation period, and heightened mortality rates in elderly and individuals with pre-existing conditions (WHO-China Joint Mission, 2020) has led governments worldwide to implement unprecedented strategies to counteract its further spread. The outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11th, and as of early April the largest increase in the daily number of cases has been observed in Europe and the USA (World Health Organisation, 2020). Due to the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases observed across most EU countries, strategies aimed at \u2018flattening the curve\u2019 by decreasing the number of simultaneous severe COVID-19 cases to a level that is manageable by the healthcare system were implemented at various paces by all of EU countries. This includes Poland, which started introducing lockdown-type measures soon after the first death from COVID-19 in Poland on March 12th (Hirsch, 2020). On March 13th the Polish government declared a state of epidemic threat and reinstated border controls, restricted the operation of shopping malls, restaurants, bars and pubs, closed schools and universities, and banned public gatherings exceeding 50 individuals (Hirsch, 2020). Furthermore, citizens were recommended to work remotely if possible, engage in social distancing, and avoid leaving home unless necessary. Timeline of COVID-19 actions is visualized in Figure 1. At the same time, no general lockdown was implemented at that point, and thus voluntary compliance from citizens was the driving factor for the effectiveness of the implemented strategy. Social distancing was sanctioned by law on March 24th, when gatherings of more than two people and non-essential travel were prohibited by law.\nWhile crucial to limiting the spread of the virus, self-isolation may lead to severe\npsychological consequences (Brooks et al., 2020). Implementing necessary precautions to fight the pandemic inevitably results in a drastic suppression of direct interactions and a potential erosion of social bonds. Perceived social isolation (i.e. \u2018loneliness\u2019) may be among the factors impacting one\u2019s response and compliance to such a strategy. As posited by the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness (ELT; (Cacioppo et al., 2006), individuals bereft of reliable connections withdraw from their social environment in order to avoid potential aggression or abuse. This self-preservation bias and implicit vigilance towards threats may in turn result in further disconnection from others and, in the longer term, may have a deleterious impact on mental and physical health (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, Baker, Harris, & Stephenson, 2015). Loneliness also was found to predict higher stress appraisals (Hawkley, Burleson, Berntson, & Cacioppo, 2003) and increased threat perception (Qualter et al., 2013), making it plausible that lonely individuals may appraise the current outbreak situation more negatively and suffer from higher levels of distress.\nFurthermore, the relationship between loneliness and the preventive strategies used in\nresponse to this epidemiological emergency is unclear. This issue is of particular importance during times of epidemiological emergency, when individual actions can have a critical effect on collective safety. While cognitive processes biased toward self-preservation (Spithoven, Bijttebier, & Goossens, 2017) may be suboptimal during normal circumstances, the increased susceptibility to threatening aspects of the environment may contribute to implementing enhanced precautions against potential danger during a pandemic. At the same time, lonely individuals have been also shown to engage to lesser extent in health behaviors (Segrin & Passalacqua, 2010) and were found to exhibit less prosocial behavior (Twenge, Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, & Bartels, 2007), and thus may be less willing to commit to self-imposed quarantine, especially in the absence of symptoms.\nStudies on Ebola (Yang, 2016), H1N1 (Prati, Pietrantoni, & Zani, 2011b) and SARS (de\nZwart et al., 2009) showed that the perception of risks associated with each of the viral agents was one of the key factors driving societal response to their outbreaks. At the same time, it has been shown that affective response to a specific disease rather than cognitive evaluations of risks associated with it is crucial for one\u2019s response to pandemic crisis (Prati et al., 2011b). Psychological characteristics, e.g. personality traits (Commodari, 2017), were found to shape individuals\u2019 affective response to epidemics. Given, the multitude of possible pathways linking loneliness and cognitive and affective factors associated with response to COVID-19 and selfisolation restrictions, loneliness may be among such characteristics. Thus, the current study aims at examining both cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between loneliness, mental health symptoms and appraisals and situational response to COVID-19 outbreak."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Participants and procedure: The initial (Wave 1; W1) online survey was performed via Qualtrics with an opportunity sample of individuals aged 18-35, who completed the survey within a 36-hour period starting at 9 PM on the 15th of March. The time constricted nature of the survey was utilized to grasp the immediate response to the restrictions introduced due to the state of epidemic threat, which had been declared 48-hours prior to the start of the survey. We focused on young adults, as it is believed that this group, while largely asymptomatic, may disregard restrictions and spread the virus (Kelly, 2020). Furthermore, this group is the least likely to perceive COVID-19 as a threat; a survey on a representative sample of adult Poles performed between March 5th and March 15th showed that almost 48% of respondents overall and more than half (58%) of participants aged 24-35 perceived the COVID-19 outbreak as \u201cnot special and was overblown by the media\u201d (Pankowski, 2020). The final sample consisted of\n511 individuals (19% males, mean age: 23.3 +/- 3.7) who were mostly students (77%) living in a large city (74%). Detailed demographic information is shown in Figure S1. A follow-up survey was performed after a 14-day delay and started at 9 PM on March 29th. A group of 245 individuals who consented to be contacted again were invited to complete a follow-up survey via e-mail. One-hundred ten participants who completed the follow-up until new restrictions were declared at 12 PM on 31st of March were included as Wave 2 (W2). Both surveys included Polish versions of standardized questionnaires measuring loneliness and mental health symptoms, as well as specific questions linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, which are described in detail below. The protocol of the study was accepted by the Ethics Committee at the Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences. Participants were not reimbursed for participation in the study.\nFigure S1. Basic demographic characteristics of the initial cohort of participants (n = 511).\nLoneliness and mental health symptoms The 20-item Polish version of the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA; Kwiatkowska, Rogoza, & Kwiatkowska, 2015) was used to measure loneliness. This adaptation of the R-\nUCLA consists of 20 items in the form of declarative sentences reflecting satisfaction and dissatisfaction with interpersonal relationships, and was shown to have good-test-retest reliability and external validity. Mental well-being was examined with the 30-item version of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ: (Frydecka, Ma\u0142yszczak, Chachaj, & Kiejna, 2010). The Polish version of the GHQ-30 has excellent reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.97) and was shown to have a three-dimensional structure. However, as items from the GHQ Social Relationships factor overlap thematically with the R-UCLA, and some of the GHQ General Functioning items could have been affected by objective restrictions (e.g. \u201cDo you leave home as often as usual?\u201d), we decided to utilize only the Anxiety and Depression subscale as the primary mental health symptoms (MHS) outcome."}, {"heading": "COVID-19 items", "text": "The survey included specific questions about the level of impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on one\u2019s daily functioning and professional activity, social context of self-isolation and adherence to recommended preventive strategies. Furthermore, participants were asked to rate the perceived probability of various events associated with the COVID-19 outbreak (ranging from contact with a virus carrier to developing severe symptoms) and level of worry for ten COVID-19 related issues on 7-point Likert scales from (1) definitely not to (7) definitely yes. To avoid using single item responses for further analysis, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed on the scores of 511 participants separately for each variable. For the risk perception items, three factors with eigenvalues greater than one were obtained and explained overall 84% of response variance. Three subscales were created by choosing the items with loadings greater than .50 on each scale [Contact Risk (48%): (a) contact with somebody with COVID-19; (b) contracting the virus; (c) developing mild symptoms; Severe Symptoms Risk (21%): (a) developing severe symptoms; (b) hospitalization; Financial Problems Risk (15%): (a) losing job; (b) losing income]. In the same manner, affective response items were factored in four subscales explaining overall 69% of response variance [Healthcare Collapse Worry (29%), Isolation Worry (18%); Financial Stability Worry (11%); Personal Health Worry (11%)]. Healthcare Collapse Worry reflected the level to which participants were concerned about the healthcare system\u2019s ability to provide care to them and the population in general. Isolation Worry measured the level to which participants worried about the long-term impact of self-isolation on their social and psychological well-being. Financial Stability Worry was linked to the long-term COVID-19 impact on one\u2019s financial stability, access to resources, and economy in general. Finally, Personal Health Worry reflected concern about COVID-19 as a threat to personal health and the health of close ones. One item examining inability to access\nreliable information about the COVID-19 was not included in any affective subscale; however, as the scale as a whole showed a high level of reliability, the item was not excluded from the overall score.\nDuring W2 the participants were additionally asked to rate their subjective complaints\non 12 different issues associated with self-isolation. Items were factored into three subscales, which explained 64% of response variance [Social Isolation Complaints (SIC: 44%): (a) change of normal daily activity; (b) inability to meet with family; (c) inability to meet with friends; (d) restricted contact with other people; (e) loneliness; (f) boredom; Lack of Control Complaints (LCC: 11%): (a) being overwhelmed with COVID-19 news; (b) uncertainty; (c) lack of sense of control and Nonsocial Deprivation Complaints (NDC: 9%): (a) lack of reliable information about COVID-19; (b) inability to access goods and services; (c) restricted freedom of movement]. One item (restricted freedom of movement) had loadings over 0.5 for two subscales, and thus it was included in both SIC and in NDC.

Initially, we intended to use the level of adherence with COVID-19 preventive strategies during W1 and W2 as outcome variables in a path analysis. However, due to the extremely non-normal distribution of the strategies used (kurtosis: 3.68 (W1)/ 11.15 (W2)), it could not have been included in path models. However, to address the issue of preventive strategy use, we compared COVID-19 risk perception (W1), affective response (W1) and subjective complaints (W2) in participants who either complied (SDC) or did not fully comply (NSDC) with social distancing recommendation. SDC were defined as individuals who declared (1) avoiding direct social contact with others and (2) avoiding leaving the house unless necessary. Out of our initial sample of 511 individuals 380 declared both, which, after exclusion of outliers (individuals with values over 1.5 interquartile range from first and third quartile of any of the variables included in the path model), left 366 SDC participants for path analysis. For W2 analysis, we included only participants who declared social distancing during both W1 and W2 (74 individuals), which left 69 SDC for our cross-lagged analysis after exclusion of outliers. SDC participants did not differ from NSDC (W1: n = 123; W2: n = 36): in terms of age, sex, education, work status or place of residency. To examine W1 variables, we conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA with group (SDC vs NSDC) as a between-subject factor and risk perception (3 levels) or affective response (4 levels) subscales as within subject factors. As SIC had twice as many items as the remaining two complaints subscales, separate between-group (SDC vs NSDC) t-tests were performed for each of the Complaints subscales. W1 model: Sequential mediation was tested by entering loneliness, mental health symptoms, risk perception and affective response to COVID-19 to a path model in AMOS 25. Initial model was just identified, thus after the initial step of the analysis the non-significant paths were trimmed from them to enable examination of the model fit. Model fit was ascertained by using the chi-square statistic to examine the hypothesis that the matrix of the model parameters fits the observed covariance matrix. Additionally, goodness of fit was assessed by using the comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The significance of specific indirect pathways was examined by establishing whether 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals for each indirect effect contained the zero value.\nW2 model: The cross-lagged effects between variables were investigated using a two-wave autoregressive cross-lagged panel model (CLPM), which allows to examine directional effects of one variable on another over the time, while accounting for the stability of each variable and their correlations at each time point. The longitudinal model was constructed on the basis of cross-sectional model W1, by including loneliness, mental health symptoms, and COVID-19 affective response and risk perception observed during both waves in the CLPM. However, as no cross-lagged effects were observed for COVID-19 risk-perception, it was removed from the model, thus leaving the three-variable CLPM. As two-wave cross-lagged models are just identified, testing of the model fit was not performed. Only SDC were included in W1 and W2 path analysis. W1 and W2 models included three independent variables. Thus, the sample size required to detect minimum R2 values of 0.25 with 80% power at p = .01 would be n = 53 (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2016). Therefore, sample size of 366 and 69 should allow to detect relationships between variables. Results:"}, {"heading": "The impact of COVID-19 on functioning:", "text": "Most of the participants considered their daily functioning (59%) and professional\nactivity (80%) to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The median predicted length of restrictions at the time of W1 was 31 days. Only 6% of participants reported spending the two weeks following W1 alone. The majority of the participants (86%) declared not being in a group particularly affected by COVID-19 (e.g. due to preexisting conditions); however, 75% of participants were directly linked to someone with increased risk to severe COVID-19 complications. The prevalent majority of participants declared using all of the recommended preventive strategies at W1 and W2 (washing hands and increased personal hygiene: 93% (W1)/ 93% (W2); avoidance of public places: 87%/92%; avoidance of public transportation: 77%/92%; social distancing: 79%/91%; leaving house only if necessary: 88%/94%). Social distancing become mandatory at the time of W2, which may partially explain the increase in strategy use. The only exception from high compliance was linked to wearing a mask, for which no clear recommendation was issued at either time point (9%/35%). Use of preventive strategies was correlated with both loneliness (W1: rho = -.20, p < .001) and COVID-19 affective response (W1: rho = .12, p = .007; W2: rho = .27, p = .005).

Overall, significant differences were observed in the perceived probability of the issues listed\nin each domain (F(2 , 486) = 249.82, p < .001 \u03b7p2 = .339). Participants perceived Contact Risk as rather likely (4.40 +/- 1.34) and higher than Severe Symptoms Risk (3.07 +/- 1.42; p < .001) and Financial Problems Risk (2.32 +/- 1.56; p<.001). Severe Symptoms Risk was also deemed as more probable than Financial Problems Risk (p < .001).\nNo group differences were found in overall level of affective response to COVID-19\n(F(1, 487) = 3.01, p = .083, \u03b7p2 = .006). Specific issues elicited various levels of affective response (F(3, 485) = 122.3, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .201). Participants were more concerned about Healthcare Collapse (5.62 +/- 1.36) than of any other issue, while Isolation Worry elicited less affective response (3.60 +/- 1.96) than other issues. With the exception of the difference between Financial Stability Worry (4.32 +/- 1.26) and Personal Health Worry (4.56 +/- 1.36), all of the remaining contrasts between categories were significant. An interaction between group and issue was also observed (F(3, 485) = 4.34, p = .009, \u03b7p2 = .009): A higher level of Personal Health Worry was reported by SDC (4.71 +/- 1.32) than by NSDC (4.11 +/- 1.36, t(487) = 4.33, p < .001) participants, while no between-group differences were observed with regard to the remaining issues (Figure 2)."}, {"heading": "Cross-sectional model (W1):", "text": "Prior to examining the path model, we examined zero-order correlations between\nloneliness, MHS and COVID-19 risk perception and affective response in SDC (n = 366), both in general and in specific domains [Table 2]. The final model, which is shown in Figure 3, had good fit to the data (\u03c72 (2) = 4.42, p = .11, RMSEA = .058, CFI = .986) and accounted for 28% of MHS variance. Similar effects of loneliness (\u03b2 = .329, p < .001) and COVID-19 affective response (\u03b2 = .335, p < .001) on MHS were found. COVID-19 risk perception was also a significant predictor of MHS (\u03b2 = .152, p = .001). Furthermore, higher COVID-19 risk perception predicted a larger affective response to COVID-19 (\u03b2 = .358, p < .001); thus, the total effect of COVID-19 risk perception on MHS (\u03b2 = .270, 95% CI = .176 to .355, p = .001) was a sum of the direct effect (\u03b2 = .152, p = .001) and indirect effect (\u03b2 = .118, 95% CI = .073 to .175, p = .001) mediated through COVID-19 affective response.\nAs no association between loneliness and general domains was observed, we also\ninvestigated the model that included specific domains, which have shown association with loneliness. The initial model included paths linking loneliness with MHS through Isolation Worry, Financial Stability Worry, Personal Health Worry, and Financial Problems Risk. Financial Problems Risk was also entered as a potential predictor of each affective subscale.\nUpon initial examination Financial Stability Worry did not predict MHS, and was excluded from the model. The new model had good fit (\u03c7 2 (2) = 1.22, p = .54, RMSEA < .001, CFI = 1) and accounted for 29% of MHS. Loneliness predicted higher Financial Problems Risk (\u03b2 = .152, p = .003) and Isolation Worry (\u03b2 = .118, p = .023), and lower Personal Health Worry (\u03b2 = -.133, p = .011). Each of the COVID-19 subscales also showed a significant relationship with MHS (\u03b2s ranging from .175 (Financial Problems Risk) to .267 (Personal Health Worry). Higher Financial Problems Risk also predicted larger Personal Health Worry (\u03b2 = .128, p = .015).\nThe total effect of loneliness on MHS (\u03b2 = .368) could be broken into the significant\ndirect effect on MHS (\u03b2 = .349 p < .001) and nonsignificant total indirect effects mediated by COVID-19 variables (\u03b2 = .019, 95% CI = -.024 to .070, p = .39). Interestingly, investigation of specific paths linking loneliness with MHS through COVID-19 variables revealed four significant indirect pathways. Positive mediations through Financial Problems Risk (\u03b2 = .027, 95% CI = .007 to .057, p = .003) and Isolation Worry (\u03b2 = .023, 95% CI = .003 to .052, p = .020) and double mediation through Financial Problems Risk and Personal Health Worry (\u03b2 = .005, 95% CI = .001 to .014, p = .010) were found. However, a negative mediation of loneliness on MHS through Personal Health Worry was found (\u03b2 = -.035, 95% CI = -.070 to -.011, p = .010), which nullified the total indirect effect of loneliness on MHS."}, {"heading": "Subjective complaints (W2):", "text": "Overall, each domain was seen as troubling (SIC: 4.30 +/- 1.48; LCC: 4.62 +/- 1.59;\nNDC: 4.50 +/- 1.44).

However, no significant differences were observed in the remaining subscales (LCC: t(102) = .1.84, p = .068; NDC: t(103) = .26, p = .80). W2 loneliness was significantly correlated with SIC (r = .302, p = .012) and NDC (r = .253, p = .036) in SDC participants, but not in NSDC (SI: r = .173, p = .314; NDC: r = .052, p = .764)."}, {"heading": "Longitudinal model (W2):", "text": "All of the auto-regressive effects were significant, with the most stable effects observed\nfor loneliness (\u03b2 = .726, p < .001) compared to MHS (\u03b2 = .468, p < .001) and COVID-19 affective response (\u03b2 = .516, p < .001). All of the correlations between W1 variables were significant (coefficients from .384 to .487, ps < .01). For the W2 variables, after controlling for their autoregressive and cross-lagged effects, only MHS remained significantly correlated with loneliness and COVID-19 affective response (coefficients of .432 and .385 respectively; ps < .01).\nAfter controlling for the stability of the effects, no cross-lagged effect of loneliness on\nMHS or vice versa was found. Bidirectional cross-lagged effects between MHS and COVID19 affective response were found, with higher MHS during W1 predicting larger COVID-19 affective response during W2 (\u03b2 = .306, p = .004). However, a larger initial COVID-19 affective response also predicted higher MHS (\u03b2 = .241, p = .031). Finally, the crossed-lagged effect of the initial COVID-19 affective response on loneliness levels during W2 (\u03b2 = .251, p = .002) was found. The opposite cross-lagged effect of the initial level of loneliness on the COVID-19 affective response during W2 (\u03b2 = -.147 p = .156) was not significant, suggesting that the temporal effect of affective response to COVID-19 on loneliness is more robust than that of loneliness on COVID-19 response. The full CLPM model is shown in Figure 4."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Investigation of the factors shaping one\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic may be\nof crucial importance for developing response strategies aimed at mitigating the burden of prolonged self-isolation on well-being and mental health. Our study provides some initial insights into multiple possible links between loneliness, mental health symptoms and response to the crisis. Importantly, only 6% of our participants declared spending their self-isolation period alone; thus, the observed mechanisms stem from the subjective appraisal of one\u2019s social relationships, rather than objective social isolation per se.\nFirstly, as observed in our path analysis, loneliness may increase affective response to\nspecific COVID-19 aspects while simultaneously decreasing response to its other aspects. A similar magnitude of negative impact on mental health symptoms was found for loneliness and COVID-19 affective response in participants. Furthermore, COVID-19 risk perception increased the mental health symptoms of our participants both directly and by increasing their affective response to the situation, with both effects having a similar strength. Interestingly, no indirect effects of loneliness on mental health symptoms were found at the level of general indicators of COVID-19 affective response and risk perception. However, when specific issues were taken into consideration, loneliness predicted decreased affective response to COVID-19 as a threat to the personal health of our participants and of their close ones, increased the affective response to potential detrimental effects of social isolation on social and psychological\nwell-being, and increased risk perception of financial problems. However, when taken together, the specific trajectories (which were of opposite directions) cancelled each other, which may explain the lack of indirect effects observed at the level of general indicators of COVID-19 response.\nThe fact that loneliness mitigated affective response to COVID-19 as a health threat\nmay be linked to previous observations showing a negative association between loneliness and engagement in health behaviors (Segrin & Passalacqua, 2010), as many such behaviors are reinforced mostly by social support, participation or inclusion, which lonely people are deprived of (Hawkley, Thisted, & Cacioppo, 2009; Shankar, McMunn, Banks, & Steptoe, 2011). Furthermore, the characteristics of our sample, with the majority of the participants not being in a special risk group (86%) but having someone from special groups among close ones (75%), suggest that this effect may be linked to reduced empathetic response to the potential health threat to others. Concern about COVID-19 health threats tends to increase together with perceived susceptibility of one\u2019s family and friends (Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that both trait loneliness (Beadle, Brown, Keady, Tranel, & Paradiso, 2012) and situational induction of loneliness (DeWall & Baumeister, 2006) are linked to decreased empathetic responding, which may have mitigated the affective response of a potential threat to the health of one\u2019s close ones.\nAt the same time, loneliness was a predictor of response to secondary outcomes of the\nCOVID-19 crisis, i.e. perception of risk of potential financial problems and stronger affective response to the impact of long-term isolation on psychological and social well-being. Previous research has shown that a proclivity for attaching high importance to money is higher in lonelier individuals, which has been suggested to be a safeguard against socioeconomic risks (Engelberg & Sj\u00f6berg, 2007). Similarly, self-imposed quarantine can result in frustration, a deepening feeling of isolation, and boredom (Brooks et al., 2020). Thus, it is plausible that threats to economic and psychosocial well-being are more distressful for lonelier individuals than the direct impact of COVID-19 on physical health, as individuals already affected by the negative consequences of loneliness might experience the possibility of further disconnection as more distressing. This notion is supported by the observation that loneliness is correlated with complaints of social isolation in participants who complied to social distancing guidelines for two weeks between W1 and W2. This was not the case in non-compliers.\nInterestingly, we did not observe cross-lagged links between loneliness and mental\nhealth symptoms, which would be expected on the basis of previous literature that observed reciprocal relationships between changes in loneliness and depressive symptomatology over\nfive (Cacioppo, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2010) or fourteen year periods (Hsueh, Chen, Hsiao, & Lin, 2019). However, as we found a stable relationship between mental health symptoms and loneliness measured at both time points, it is plausible that the time scale of the current study (2 weeks) was not suited for observation of longitudinal relationships between loneliness and mental health symptoms, which are observed with less time-constricted designs. Surprisingly, we observed the cross-lagged influence of initial COVID-19 response on subsequent levels of loneliness in social distancing individuals. While we rather expected to find the opposite relationship, this observation may be seen as a preliminary indicator of the deterioration of perceived social support due to disaster-related distress, which has been documented in studies on the psychological mechanisms observed in individuals suffering from disasters caused by natural hazards (Kaniasty, 2019; Lai, Osborne, Piscitello, Self-Brown, & Kelley, 2018). At the same time, bidirectional cross-lagged relationships between affective response to COVID-19 and mental health symptoms were found. Longitudinal analyses have shown that pre-event depressive symptomatology predicts post-event PTSD symptomatology in survivors of natural disasters (Ying, Wu, & Lin, 2012). Thus, findings of the current study suggest that a similar reciprocal coupling between mental health symptoms and situational response to COVID-19 may be found even at the initial stages of response to COVID-19 pandemic.\nFinally, we tentatively observed a negative link between loneliness and use of the\nrecommended COVID-19 preventive strategies. The literature on people\u2019s responses to public threat provides evidence that the feeling of belonging and affiliation is an important factor in shaping prosocial attitudes and behaviors (Lunn, Belton, Lavin, McGowan, & Timmons, 2020). Previous research demonstrated that empathic responders to the previous SARS outbreak were more likely to adapt effective and recommended precautions (Lee-Baggley, DeLongis, Voorhoeave, & Greenglass, 2004; Puterman, DeLongis, Lee-Baggley, & Greenglass, 2009). Furthermore, the anxiety levels of family members and friends are related to affective response and implementing recommended behaviors (Prati, Pietrantoni, & Zani, 2011a). Lack of important social bonds can therefore reduce one\u2019s motivation to minimize the disease-related risk. In line with this notion, we found increased affective response to COVID-19 as a threat to health in individuals who voluntarily engaged in social distancing, before it was mandated by law (March 25th). Taking into consideration its significant negative association with loneliness, affective response to COVID-19\u2019s threat to health may be a plausible mechanism mediating the relationship between loneliness and compliance with social distancing.\nWhile informative, our study was largely preliminary and opportunistic given the\nunpredictable time-course of COVID-19 restrictions. Due to the use of computer assisted web\ninterviews, its population was limited to young adults, and could not target elderly populations particularly prone to COVID-19. However, given the nature of the current crisis, a focus on young adults may be seen as both the limitation and strength of the study. Similarly, the time course of the study was correlated with the Polish timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and thus the presented mechanism may vary depending of the pace and nature of the restrictions introduced by governments worldwide. Finally, as we did not provide any reimbursement to participants, response rate at W2 was at 45%; this limited the statistical power of our analyses.\nAcknowledgement: This work was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland (Grant No: 2018/31/B/HS6/02848)\nBibliography Beadle, J.

This study represents the first assessment of the mental health of the nation during the initial phase of the COVID-19 response, as part of a multi-wave investigation into the social, behavioural, and psychological impact of the pandemic.\nAims: First, estimate prevalence rates of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and combined anxiety and depression, and identify risk factors associated with screening positive for anxiety/depression. Second, determine if COVID-19-related anxiety was highest amongst those identified with the greatest mortality risk from the virus.\nMethod: Self-report data from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1,041) was collected online between March 31 and April 5; the first week of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s nationwide quarantine measures. Results: A substantial proportion of people screened positive for depression (22.77%), generalized anxiety (20.00%), and anxiety/depression (27.67%). Screening positive for anxiety/depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection, and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety than adults aged 18-34. Sex, underlying health conditions, and proximity to COVID-19 deaths were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. Conclusions: Government responses to the current pandemic should ensure that measures protect not only the population\u2019s physical health, but its mental health also, as an equally important component of health and wellbeing. KEY WORDS: COVID-19, coronavirus, anxiety, depression, mental health.\nSignificant outcomes\n\u2022 More than one-in-four (27.67%) people screened positive for generalized anxiety or\ndepression during the first week of the strictest COVID-19 lockdown measures in Ireland.\n\u2022 Risk-factors for anxiety/depression included younger age, female sex, loss of income\ndue to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection, and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection.\n\u2022 Anxiety specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic was highest amongst citizens\naged 65 years and older.\nLimitations\n\u2022 The sample is representative of the general population but does not reflect persons\nwho are currently institutionalised or in care.\n\u2022 Self-report measures were used to screen people for generalized anxiety and\ndepression.\nAnxiety and depression in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) \u2013\nthe virus that causes COVID-19 - on the island of Ireland was confirmed on the 27th of February 2020 in Northern Ireland, with the first case confirmed in the Republic of Ireland two days later. On the 12th of March, the government of the Republic of Ireland announced the closure of all schools, colleges, and childcare facilities, and banned all gatherings of more than 100 people. Many businesses, including bars and restaurants, voluntarily followed suit by shutting down their premises. Mandatory government measures followed on March 27th, with the temporary closure of all non-essential services and additional physical distancing measures including the stipulation that people were not to leave their homes except under necessary or exceptional circumstances. By comparison, the United Kingdom (UK) government postponed the closure of cafes, bars, and other recreational facilities until the 20th of March, three weeks after the World Health Organization had raised the COVID-19 alert to the highest level.1 The instruction from the UK government for people not to leave their homes except under exceptional circumstances followed on March 23rd.\nAs of April 20, 2020, there have been 15,652 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the\nRepublic of Ireland, and 687 people have died.2 While statistics fluctuate with daily updates, more women (~55%) than men are being infected by COVID-19, the median age of patients is approximately 48 years, and the majority of infections have occurred in the capital city, Dublin.2 Regarding deaths due to COVID-19, more men (~59%) have died than women, the median age of those who have died stands at 83 years, 76% of those who have died lived in the east of the country where Dublin is located, and at least 70% of those who have died had a confirmed underlying health condition.2\nCoinciding with the initiation of the quarantine measures enacted across both\ncountries, we conducted parallel nationally representative surveys in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) and the Republic of Ireland using identical research protocols as part of a longitudinal study designed to assess the social and psychological impact of the pandemic. The first UK survey took place a week prior to the Irish survey3 and found that 22.12% (95% CI = 20.31, 23.93) of people screened positive for depression, 21.63% (95% CI = 19.83, 23.42) screened positive for generalized anxiety, and 27.75% (95% CI = 25.80 - 29.71) screened positive for anxiety/depression. Furthermore, in a multivariate model, screening positive for anxiety/depression was associated with younger age, having more than one child in the home, reporting a lower levels of income in 2019, experiencing a loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, having an underlying health condition (lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes), a loved one having an underlying health condition (lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes), having a confirmed or suspected infection of COVID-19, and having a high level of perceived risk of infection of COVID-19 over the next month.4"}, {"heading": "Aims of the study", "text": "The current complementary study had two research objectives. The first was to\nreplicate our UK population study by determining (a) what proportion of the Irish population screened positive for depression, generalized anxiety, and anxiety/depression during the initial phase of the COVID-19 quarantine, and (b) if the sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for anxiety/depression in the UK were also associated with screening positive for anxiety/depression in the Irish sample. The second was to determine if levels of COVID-19 pandemic-related anxiety were highest amongst those identified as most at-risk of death from COVID-19 within the Republic of Ireland; that is those who were aged 65 or older, those who were male, those with an underlying health condition (i.e., lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes), and those who lived in the east of the country.\nMethods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (N = 1,041) were recruited from an online research panel representative\nof the general adult population of the Republic of Ireland. Participants were recruited by the survey company Qualtrics using stratified quota sampling to ensure that the sample characteristics of sex, age, and region of Ireland matched known population parameters from the 2016 Irish census. Data collection started on 31st March 2020, 31 days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland, 19 days after the first physical distancing measures were enacted (i.e., closure of all childcare and educational facilities), and two days after the Taoiseach (the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister) announced that people were not to leave their homes. The survey was completed on the 5th of April 2020. Findings therefore reflect the state of the Irish population\u2019s mental health during the first week of the strictest quarantine measures ever implemented within the Republic of Ireland.\nParticipants had to be aged 18 years or older at the time of the survey and be able to\ncomplete the survey in English. Participants were contacted by the survey company via email and requested to participate. If consenting, participants completed the survey online (median time of completion = 37.52 minutes) and were reimbursed by the survey company for their time. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the ethical review board of the University of Sheffield and Ulster University. Participants were recruited from the four provinces of the Republic of Ireland, relative to their population size: Leinster, the east of the country including the capital city of Dublin (n = 576, 55.3%); Munster, the south of the country (n = 284, 27.3%); Connaught, the west of the country (n = 125, 12.0%); and Ulster, the north of the country (not including the six counties of Northern Ireland; n = 56, 5.4%).\nThe mean age of the sample was 44.97 years (Mdn = 44.00, SD = 15.76, range 18-88),\nand 51.5% (n = 536) were female, 48.2% male (n = 502), and 0.3% (n = 3) checked the transgender/prefer not to say/other option. Most participants reported having been born in the Republic of Ireland (70.7%, n = 736) and having grown up in Ireland up to the age of 16 (79.2%, n = 824).

These were collapsed into a binary variable representing \u2018Perceived infection status\u2019. Positive perceived infection status was based on the selection of either, \u2018I have the symptoms of the COVID-19 virus and think I may have been infected\u2019 or \u2018I have been infected by the COVID-19 virus and this has been confirmed by a test\u2019.

Positive status was coded \u20181\u2019 and negative status coded as \u20180\u2019.\nParticipants were also asked \u201cHas someone close to you (a family member or friend)\nbeen infected by the coronavirus COVID-19?\u201d and four responses were provided. These were collapsed into a binary variable representing \u2018Perceived infection status \u2013 someone close\u2019. Positive perceived infection status was based on the selection of either, \u2018Someone close to me has symptoms, and I suspect that person has been infected\u2019 or \u2018Someone who is close to me has had a COVID-19 virus infection confirmed by a doctor\u2019. Negative perceived infection status was based on the selection of either, \u2018No\u2019 or \u2018Someone close to me has symptoms, but I am not sure if that person is infected\u2019. Positive status (other) was coded \u20181\u2019 and negative status coded as \u20180\u2019.\nPerceived risk of COVID-19 infection: Participants were asked \u201cWhat do you think\nis your personal percentage risk of being infected with the COVID-19 virus over the next month?\u201d Participants were presented with a visual analogue (i.e. slider) scale with \u20180\u2019 and \u2018100\u2019 at the left- and right-hand extremes respectively, shown in 10-point increments, and the labels \u2018No Risk\u2019, \u2018Moderate Risk\u2019 and \u2018Great Risk\u2019 shown on the left, middle and right-hand part of the scale, respectively. This produced a continuous score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of perceived risk of being infected by COVID-19. The scores were recoded into \u2018Low\u2019 (0 - 33), \u2018Moderate\u2019 (34 - 67), and \u2018High\u2019 (68 - 100).\nDepression: Nine symptoms of depression were measured using the Patient Health\nQuestionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).5 Participants indicate how often they have been bothered by each symptom over the last two weeks using a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Possible scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicative of higher levels of depression. To identify participants likely to meet the criteria for depressive disorder a cut-off score of > 10 was used.5 This cut-off produces adequate sensitivity (.85) and specificity (.89), corresponds to \u2018moderate\u2019 levels of depression, and is used to identify a level of depression that may require psychological intervention. The psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 scores have been widely supported,6 and the reliability in the current sample was excellent (\u03b1 = .91).\nGeneralized anxiety: Symptoms of generalized anxiety were measured using the\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7).7 Participants indicate how often they have been bothered by each symptom over the last two weeks on a four-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all, to 3 = Nearly every day). Possible scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicative of higher levels of generalized anxiety. A cut-off score of > 10 was used, and this has been shown to result in sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82%.7 The GAD-7 has\nbeen shown to produce reliable and valid scores in community studies,8 and the reliability in the current sample was excellent (\u03b1 = .94).\nCovid-19 related anxiety: The survey also included a question \u201cHow anxious are you\nabout the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic?\u201d. Participants were provided with a visual analogue (i.e. slider) scale to indicate their degree of anxiety with \u20180\u2019 and \u2018100\u2019 at the left and right-hand extremes respectively, and 10-point increments.

There was a statistically significant main effect for age (F (5, 1035) = 7.29, p < .001, \u03b72 = .03) with those aged 65 and older reporting the highest levels of COVID-19 anxiety (M = 77.83, SD = 22.23) (see Figure 1). Post-hoc analyses using the Tukey HSD test showed that those aged 65 and older had significantly (p < .05) higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety than those aged 18-24 (M = 61.06, SD = 28.50) and 25-34 (M = 69.83, SD = 25.59).\nFigure 1 here\nThere were no statistically significant differences in the mean levels of COVID-19\nanxiety between the sexes (t (1036) = 1.43, p = .152, d = .09), between those with and\nwithout an underlying health condition (t (1039) = 0.71, p = .475, d = .06), or across the four regions of Ireland (F (3, 1037) = 0.63, p = .596, \u03b72 = .002).\nDiscussion\nFindings from the current study offer initial insights into the Irish adult population\u2019s\nmental health during the early period of the COVID-19 quarantine measures, the factors associated with screening positive for mental health problems, and the extent to which these findings align with results from a parallel survey conducted one week earlier in the UK. Rates of depression, generalized anxiety, and anxiety/depression closely mirrored those found in the UK4 with over one-in-four Irish adults screening positive for depression or generalized anxiety. The rates of anxiety and depression found in this study do not differ markedly from those reported in previous national prevalence studies in the UK.9 We propose that the current findings can be used as a national baseline through which to identify potential changes in depression and generalized anxiety throughout the duration of the pandemic in the Republic of Ireland.\nScreening positive for anxiety/depression in this study was significantly associated with\nyounger age, female sex, reporting a loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, having a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 infection, a loved one having a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 infection, as well as moderate and high levels of perceived risk of COVID-19 infection within the next month. Four of these variables \u2013 younger age, lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a confirmed/suspected infection of COVID-19 in oneself, and increased perceived risk of COVID-19 infection in the next month \u2013 were also associated with screening positive for anxiety/depression in the UK.4 It would seem, therefore, that these are risk factors for mental health problems irrespective of culture or nationality.\nSome unique correlates of anxiety/depression did emerge across the two studies. In\nIreland, females were significantly more likely to screen positive for anxiety/depression, and having a loved one with a suspected/confirmed case of COVID-19 was also associated with increased risk of anxiety/depression. Contrastingly, in the UK people with multiple children in the home, those with a lower income in 2019, those with an underlying health condition, and those with a loved one with an underlying health condition were more likely to screen positive for anxiety/depression. These findings suggest that although there are likely to be common factors across nations associated with risk for mental health problems, unique contextual risk factors are also likely to exist. For example, the latest Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures show that the Republic of Ireland\u2019s GDP per capita is nearly twice that of the UK, the national net income in Ireland is approximately 20% higher than in the UK, and Ireland\u2019s social welfare provisions are substantially higher than the UK\u2019s.10,11 The greater wealth and social services enjoyed in Ireland may help to explain why lower income was associated with anxiety/depression in the UK but not in Ireland. Additionally, the death rate from COVID-19 in the UK is nearly twice as high as in Ireland (236.57 per 1 million vs. 123.54 per 1 million),12,13 which may account for why the presence of an underlying health condition associated with elevated risk of death from COVID-19 was associated with anxiety/depression in the UK, but not in Ireland.\nElevated levels of COVID-19-related anxiety were found for those aged 65 and older,\nconsistent with early government reports and the early identification of this age group as being particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 related mortality.14,15 These findings show that the importance of providing mental health supports to the elderly, in addition to offering accurate information and appropriate material supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation conducive to physical distancing. These could include increased support for community outreach activities that make use of low-intensity psychological interventions,16\nsafe-distancing forms of exercise, technology-supported social activities, and videoconferencing solutions for the delivery of mental health care services.17 This is considered especially important given the 30% increase in suicide among those aged 65 years and older observed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003.18 Notably, at the onset of the lockdown measures the Irish government initiated a programme of \u2018cocooning\u2019 the elderly \u2013 and other persons deemed extremely medically vulnerable \u2013 with due attention paid to ensuring their psychological wellbeing.19\nCurrent findings are also consistent with the results of a recent rapid review of the\nliterature on the psychological effects of quarantine which found that poorer psychological responses were associated with a heightened fear of infection and loss of income due to quarantine measures.20 Mitigating the impact of these factors may include clear and accurate health communication and financial assistance for those who have experienced financial loss as a result of the pandemic. The Irish and British governments have both put in place financial support measures for workers and business owners affected by the pandemic, however, loss of income was nonetheless associated with higher risk of anxiety/depression in the two countries.\nThe current study contributes towards answering a wider, international call for a multi-\ndisciplinary approach to better understand the social, psychological, and neurological impact of COVID-19 as an immediate research priority.21 Specifically, a recent position paper published in the Lancet Psychiatry calls for immediate improved monitoring of the reported rates of anxiety, depression, and other outcomes including self-harm and suicide, across the general population in order to better inform global responses to pandemics. Likewise, the paper stresses a need to identify the mechanisms that can help explain differential psychological outcomes including a better understanding of the factors that exacerbate and protect against the effects of quarantine measures on psychological health. Results from a\nlongitudinal survey conducted across 190 Chinese cities, for example, found that a high level of confidence in doctors, perceived likelihood of survival and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, and personal precautionary measures all protected against increased stress, depression, and anxiety during the COVID-19 response in China.22\nThe current study is not without limitations. First, while the sample is representative of\nthe general adult population as per the 2016 census across a number of key demographic indicators, the study is prone to a number of sampling biases. Excluded from the sample were individuals within institutionalised care, including prisons, direct provision centres, and inpatient care, all of whom are known to be at higher risk of psychological distress.23,24 Second, the self-report nature of the survey differs from clinically administered interviews, and may have resulted in an over-estimation of the prevalence rates for both anxiety and depression measures.\nTaken together, and consistent with those found in a parallel study in the UK, the\nresults of this study support the need to better understand how the physical distancing and quarantine measures implemented to ensure our physical safety during a pandemic may incur unintended, negative consequences for our psychological well-being. This is considered particularly important in light of the results of another recent general population survey in the UK which found greater concern among respondents for the social and psychological impacts of the pandemic, compared to the physical impact of COVID-19.25 The current study establishes a national baseline to facilitate such work.\n* p <.05, ** p <.01, ***p <.001.\n\u20ac0 - \u20ac19,999 478 143 (29.9%) 1.547 (.691 - 3.467) 1.369 (.540 - 3.474) \u20ac20,000 - \u20ac29,999 335 87 (26.0%) 1.272 (.560 - 2.887) 1.300 (.509 - 3.323) \u20ac30,000 - \u20ac39,999 129 35 (27.1%) 1.350 (.563 - 3.233) 1.407 (.516 - 3.837) \u20ac40,000 - \u20ac49,999 62 15 (24.2%) 1.157 (.436 - 3.067) .826 (.262 - 2.608) \u20ac50,000 or more 37 8 (21.6%) -\nLost income Not lost income 596 126 (21.1%) - Lost Income 445 162 (36.4%) 2.135 (1.621 - 2.813)*** 1.612 (1.179 - 2.204)** Pre-existing health condition Self\nNo 876 235 (26.8%) - - Yes 165 53 (32.1%) 1.291 (.901 - 1.849) 1.302 (.834 - 2.030)\nSomeone close No 741 192 (25.9%) - - Yes 300 96 (32.0%) 1.346 (1.004 - 1.804)* .940 (.659 - 1.339) Covid-19 Self No 997 257 (25.8%) - - Yes 44 31 (70.5%) 6.866 (3.538 - 13.324)*** 4.481 (2.092 - 9.600)*** Covid-19 Close No 971 246 (25.3%) - - Yes 70 42 (60.0%) 4.421 (2.682 - 7.285)*** 3.377 (1.862 - 6.125)*** Personal Risk 1month Low 374 71 (19.0%) - - Moderate 448 128 (28.6%) 1.707 (1.227 - 2.374)** 2.009 (1.389 - 2.905)*** High 219 89 (40.6%) 2.922 (2.011 - 4.245)*** 2.800 (1.837 - 4.267)***\nReferences\n1.

At the same time, this pandemic has given rise to speculations and conspiracy theories. Conspiracy worldviews have been connected to refusal to trust science, the biomedical model of disease and to legal means of political engagement in previous research. In three studies, we went beyond this focus on a general conspiracy worldview and tested the idea that different forms of conspiracy belief despite being positively correlated have distinct behavioral implications. Whereas conspiracy beliefs describing the pandemic as a hoax were more strongly associated with reduced containment-related behavior, conspiracy beliefs about sinister forces purposefully creating the virus related to an increase in self-centered prepping behavior.\nKeywords: covid-19; conspiracy theories, coronavirus, health behavior, pandemic,\nconspiracy mentality\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nA bioweapon or a hoax? The link between distinct conspiracy beliefs about the\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and pandemic behavior\nIn November 2019, a 55-year old man from the Hubei province in China was\ndiagnosed with a new disease caused by a new virus SARS-CoV-2. In the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has infected an enormous amount of people worldwide. Countries closed their borders, announced lock downs and people were asked to follow protective measures against the new coronavirus such as physical distancing or hand washing. Health systems were often not properly prepared to handle the influx of cases and arguably, the public information system was not prepared either. Already in February 2020, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of the WHO, warned that the world is \"not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous\u201d (WHO, 2020). A survey from mid-March 2020 conducted in the U.S. supported this notion: 42% of the US-Americans have seen a lot or some news about the coronavirus outbreak that seemed completely made up (Mitchell & Oliphant, 2020). In the present paper, we sought to better understand how such distorted beliefs about the coronavirus relate to the various way to react to the pandemic. Specifically, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs claiming that the pandemic is a hoax are linked to a weaker support of containment-related behavior compared to perceiving the pandemic as human made which should be linked to a stronger support of self-centered prepping behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic and conspiracy beliefs\nPast research shows that the increase of conspiracy theories during a pandemic is not\na new phenomenon: Especially in times of crises, conspiracy thinking increases substantially (e.g., Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). There are hardly any major events over the past\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\ndecades that have not fostered various conspiracy allegations that questioned the official version of why these events came about and proposed an explanation involving plots hatched in secret by powerful agents instead. This is also true for major outbreaks of diseases. A misinformation campaign run by the Soviet Committee for State Security claimed HIV to be a biological weapon developed by the US (Geissler & Sprinkle, 2013) and the widespread belief that AIDS is a conspiracy to kill black people has a direct impact on prevention behavior (e.g., using condoms or pre-exposure prophylaxis; e.g., Bogart & Thorburn, 2005; Bogart et al., 2010). During the Zika virus outbreak 2015-2016, there were speculations that the virus was caused by genetically modified mosquitoes or used by the governments to kill people on purpose (e.g., Klofstad et al., 2019).\nThe endorsement of conspiracy beliefs has been associated with several variables that\nlikely determine people\u2019s responses to the crisis. Events of such magnitude beg an explanation of comparable magnitude (Leman & Cinnirella, 2007). Providing explanations is psychologically advantageous for several reasons, with one sticking out in the previous literature: granting an illusion of control. Considering this reasoning, it is not surprising that a lack of control has been identified as one of the key drivers of conspiracy beliefs. When people are not able to gain control in the real world, they compensate for this lack by perceiving patterns - even if they are an illusion (e.g., Douglas et al., 2017). The current coronavirus crisis is an almost ideal breeding ground for conspiracy thinking (Van Bavel et al., 2020). There is no easily comprehensible mechanistic explanation of the disease, it is an event of massive scale, it affects people's life globally, and leaves them with lots of uncertainty.\nSuch conspiracy beliefs might potentially even palliative in giving people back at\nleast a sense of control. Nevertheless, so we argue, there are real dangers in such conspiracy theories that must be regarded as problematic in the current crisis. During the coronavirus\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\npandemic, many scientists, specifically epidemiologists and physicians, have been the most articulate voices in making recommendations how to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and slow down the infections. Conspiracy mentality, however, a generalized belief that powerful forces operate in secret to rule the world (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014) has been connected to both generalized distrust in science in general (as it is perceived as high power; Imhoff et al., 2018) and the biomedical system more specifically (for the same reason: Lamberty & Imhoff, 2018; Galliford & Furnham, 2017; Oliver & Wood, 2014). Thus, people who endorse a conspiracy worldview are particularly unlikely to trust the expert recommendations so critical in these times.\nWhereas most people use information about what others do as a cue to how to behave\nthemselves, and thus are more likely to show conformity and follow (descriptive) social norms, there are some exceptions to this rule. Specifically, people high in a need for uniqueness, for whom it is a great importance to stick out from the crowd, are intentionally trying to not do or say what the majority of people says or does (Imhoff & Erb, 2009). This is relevant, as endorsement of conspiracy beliefs has been associated with an increased need for uniqueness both in correlational and experimental studies (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2017; Lantian et al., 2017). Thus, conspiracy believers are less likely than others to comply with descriptive social norms. Additionally, a conspiracy-prone worldview does not only reduce trust in official versions and adherence to norms, but also makes it more plausible to engage in illegal, non-normative forms of action to reach one\u2019s goals (Imhoff et al., 2020) and is linked to a stronger acceptance of violence (Rees & Lamberty, 2019). Specifically, people who imagined seeing the world as people high in conspiracy mentality see it, saw it as more defensible to use force and other illegal means to pursue one\u2019s political goals. Distinct effects of different conspiracy beliefs on behavior\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nMany of the above-cited findings rely on associations between certain attitudes or\nbehavioral intentions with a generalized conspiracy worldview (e.g., Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; Moscovici, 1987; Popper, 2006). The reasoning behind this relies on the robust finding that content-wise even completely unrelated conspiracy beliefs are so highly intercorrelated that they typically load on one factor (Bruder et al., 2013; Swami et al., 2011) and are thus often understood as specific expressions of a generalized mindset or political attitude (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018). This goes as far as logically incompatible conspiracy theories correlating positively (Wood et al., 2012).\nAlthough this general pattern seems to be one of the most robust findings in the\npsychology of conspiracy theories, in the current COVID-19 situation two popular conspiracy theories did not only seem to be logically incompatible but might be related to different behaviors as well. While many people played down the danger of COVID-19, calling it no worse than a flu, and suspected others to purposefully claim otherwise for their own advantage (e.g., hurting national economies, passing unpopular/restricting laws), others painted an even more drastic picture by claiming that the new coronavirus had not evolved by mutation (Andersen et al., 2020) but been intentionally manufactured and purposefully spread for either as a bioweapon or for political or economic gains. A survey conducted in the beginning of March 2020 in the US supported the notion to differentiate between the two types of conspiracy beliefs: The results showed that 49 percent claimed that the coronavirus is a manmade epidemic. In contrast, 44 percent thought that the threat of the coronavirus is being exaggerated for political reasons and 13 percent were convinced that the coronavirus is a hoax (Frankovic, 2020).\nThe denial or downplay of the danger of an illness should directly affect the risk\nassessment of a person and the perception of illness related risks influences in turn directly health promoting self-care behavior (e.g., Ferrer & Klein, 2015; Rosenstock, 1974). A higher\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nperceived risk is, for example, associated with a greater likelihood to engage in protective behavior (Brewer et al., 2004). Therefore, if people believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax or exaggerated by the government, they should be less likely to follow official recommendations like hand-washing and social-distancing (see also Stanley et al., 2020).\nOn the other hand, many people are convinced that the virus was created in a lab -\neither accidentally or to intentionally \u201creduce the population\u201d as a secret plan of a so-called \u201cnew world order\u201d. People who hold these kinds of beliefs should be less likely to underestimate the severity of the coronavirus outbreak since they perceive it as an attack of governments or secret services against \u201cthe people\u201d. As a consequence, these people should not follow the recommended behavior of the institutions that they suspect of plotting a conspiracy (i.e., governments, WHO, health care providers) and might instead follow their own policies of protection against the pandemic (e.g., alternative medicine, weapons, hoarding)."}, {"heading": "The Present Research", "text": "Conspiracy theories that suggest that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax are expected\nto primarily be related to refusal to engage in containment-related behavior (e.g., hygiene, physical distancing). Conspiracy theories that describe SARS-CoV-2 as a humanmanufactured virus are expected to mainly predict self-centered prepping behavior (e.g., alternative remedies, hoarding). Despite these divergent predictions (and the logical inconsistency), we expect both conspiracy beliefs to be positively correlated and correlated with conspiracy mentality.

We created two sets of three items (one reverse-coded)\nto tap into the two most prevalent conspiracy beliefs. To tap into the idea that it is a harmless virus that receives overblown attention for personal benefit of a few people (COVID-19 hoax) we asked participants for their agreement with the following statements: \u201cThe virus is intentionally presented as dangerous in order to mislead the public\u201d, \u201cExperts intentionally\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nmislead us for their own benefit, even though the virus is not worse than a flu\u201d, and \u201cWe should believe experts when they say that the virus is dangerous\u201d (reverse-coded). The (logically incompatible) notion that the virus was purposefully created for the personal benefit of a few people (SARS-Cov-2 human-made) was assessed by asking for agreement with the following propositions: \u201cCorona was intentionally brought into the world to reduce the population\u201d, \u201cDark forces want to use the virus to rule the world\u201d, and \u201cI think it's nonsense that the virus was created in a laboratory\u201d (reverse-coded). All six statements were completed on a scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).\nPandemic-related behavior. To tap into respondents\u2019 pandemic-related behavior we\nasked them to report for 18 possibilities to what extent they behaved this way from never (1) to always/ strongly (7). Specifically, participants were informed that \u201cpeople have reacted differently to the emergence of the new coronavirus. Below, we ask you to indicate for each of several behaviors to which extent you have implemented this as part of your reaction to the coronavirus.\u201d These behavior option were either containment related (e.g., increased hygiene behavior, keeping physical distance to others) or self-centered prepping behavior (e.g., hoarding everyday goods, relying on \u201calternative\u201d sources of information or remedies; see Table 1 for the full list as well as factor loadings).\nCOVID-19 threat perception. We asked participants with four items how strongly\nthey felt affected by the outbreak(\u201cTo what extent are you currently worried about the spread of coronavirus?\u201d, \u201cTo what extent are you currently personally affected by the spread of coronavirus?\u201d, \u201cTo what extent do you currently feel threatened by the spread of coronavirus?\u201d, and \u201cTo what extent are you at risk for COVID-19 complications?\u201d) on scale from not at all (1) to very much (7).\nAdditional variables. For exploratory purposes, we also included the twelve-item\nconspiracy mentality scale (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; e.g., \u201cThere are secret organizations that have great influence on political decisions.\u201d; 7-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Additionally, one item tapped into self-reported political orientation on a scale from extremely liberal (1) to extremely conservative (7)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "All scales proved to be satisfactorily reliable (Table 2). The exploratory factor\nanalysis of pandemic-related behavior clearly suggested a two-factor solution. Only two items on hoarding behavior (stocking up on food and sanitary items) exhibited double loadings (see Table 1). This may be due to the fact the \u201choarding\u201d of such goods (which was discussed as an overreaction and primarily problematic) had created a situation where a) these goods were indeed becoming scarce and b) to avoid physical contact, less frequent grocery shopping (and thus \u201cstocking up\u201d) was becoming instrumental. We thus excluded these two items and averaged the others to composite scales of containment-related behavior and self-centered prepping behavior.\nassociated with conspiracy mentality as a general mindset. People who believed that the pandemic was a hoax were more likely to perceive the pandemic as less threatening, while there was no significant link between assuming that the virus was human-made and threat\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nperception (Table 2). To test our focal hypothesis that the two distinct conspiracy beliefs were distinctly associated with recommended and non-recommended reactions to the coronavirus pandemic, and whether this would hold above and beyond effects of political orientation, we regressed the respective behaviors on the two conspiracy belief scales and added political orientation. In line with our predictions, believing that COVID-19 was a hoax was a strong negative predictor of containment-related behaviors like hand-washing and keeping physical distance, B=-0.647, SE=0.109, p<.001, whereas believing in a human origin of the coronavirus did not, B=0.104, SE=0.104, p=.319. Self-reported conservatism had no prediction above beyond these, B=0.088, SE=0.081, p=.276. The local effect size of COVID19 hoax above and beyond the other predictors was thus f2 = .162. For self-centered prepping behavior, the pattern was less clear-cut as it was uniquely associated (as expected) with conspiracy beliefs about human creation of the coronavirus, B=0.521, SE=0.095, p<.001, but to a moderate extent also with the idea that COVID-19 is a hoax, B=0.326, SE=0.092, p<.001. Conservatism was also below the traditional .05 level, but only slightly so, B=0.139, SE=0.062, p=.024. Thus, even claiming that COVID-19 was not worse than a common flu was associated with behavior characterized as overreacting (e.g., hoarding), but SARS-Cov-2 Human-made still had a substantial effect, f2 = .057. Exploratory analyses show that these associations are generally stronger, the more threatened people felt by the virus (see supplement)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Study 1 provides first evidence that - although there is a certain overlap of constructs -\ndifferent conspiracy theories are associated with different types of behavior. While people who belittle the risk of COVID-19 are less likely to follow official recommendations, people who believe that the virus originated in a laboratory are more likely to prepare for worst case scenarios. Intriguingly, these strong reactions were independently related also to the\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nendorsement that COVID-19 is no worse than a flu, particularly for those who feel strongly threatened by it. This finding raises some doubt to what extent these respondents were actually fully convinced of their own opinion that it was an overblown but actually harmless disease. In light of the purely exploratory nature, the ad-hoc construction of scales and the scarcity of control variables, we conducted a set of replications and extensions in two different national contexts to bolster our findings\u2019 generalizability.\nStudy 2\nThe main aim of study 2 was to replicate the results of study 1 in two national\ncontexts: the USA and the UK. For this purpose, the double-loading behaviors were removed, and we aimed to show the specific influence of conspiracy beliefs as distinguished from other constructs. Most notably, people\u2019s reactions to the pandemic has been associated with political ideology. While we controlled for this in Study 1, it was a mere one item measure with unclear reliability. We thus included two multi-item scales of well-established constructs of political ideology: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). Despite being more specific and more reliable measures of overall political orientation, both also entail specific aspects. People high in RWA tend to follow norms and be obedient to authorities, allowing the prediction of greater adherence to official recommendations. High SDO, on the other hand, reflects a belief system of a \"dog-eat-dog\" world (Pratto et al., 1994). Therefore, people with a pronounced SDO should rather follow prepping behavior that benefit themselves. We also added the Big Five personality traits as control variables frequently associated with health behavior (e.g., Atherton et al., 2014). All data was collected on March 25th. The night before data collection was planned to start in the US and UK, UK prime minster Johnson declared a lockdown. For this reason, we had to adjust the wordings of the items and checked past behavior. For the UK, we also included an\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior\nexploratory measure of intentions to comply with this lockdown.

To control for the respective unique predictions, in a second step we added measures of political ideology in a stepwise procedure (to avoid multicollinearity and suppression issues due to their high intercorrelation) and added the personality measures, age and COVID-19 threat in a third step. The full regression tables are available in the supplement (Table.S2 to Table.S6), importantly, however, controlling for all these variables did not alter the results.\nIn the pre-registration, we had mentioned the inclusion of a measure of compliance\nwith lockdown regulations in the UK sample, but failed to specify predictions. Following from the proximity to containment-related behavior, we tested whether hoax beliefs would not only relate to past containment-related behavior but also to future expectation of complying with (at that time very new) lockdown regulations. We also thus applied the same analytical procedure to the intended noncompliance with lockdown regulations. Mirroring the results for containment-related behavior, this noncompliance was associated with hoax beliefs, B=0.197, SE=0.039, p<.001, f2=.09, but not human-made beliefs, B=-0.046, SE=0.029, p=.120, \u0394\u03b2=.429, t(295)=6.69, p<.001 (Table.S6)."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Overall, Study 2 replicated Study 1- both in the USA and the UK. The belief that\nCOVID-19 is a hoax was particularly associated with a reduced containment-related behavior. Conversely, a stronger belief that the virus originated in the laboratory was associated with a stronger advocacy of self-centered prepping behaviors. These effects remained stable even when controlling for other relevant variables. Overall, the effects were substantially weaker for the UK than in the US, even if they followed the same patterns. Although the primary function of the other included variables was to critically test the unique variance of conspiracy beliefs, some patterns seem noteworthy. First, feeling threatened by\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior - Supplement\nthe COVID-19 disease was associated with greater conformity with containment-related behavior, but also more pronounced self-centered prepping behaviors. Pronounced threat thus does not operate as a functional mechanism to enhance (only) containment-related behavior. Its association with self-centered prepping behavior was \u2013 at least in the US \u2013 particularly pronounced for those endorsing either kind of conspiracy beliefs. As would be expected, greater compliance with official recommendation was also related to conscientiousness, a personality trait associated with rule compliance and orderliness.\nGeneral Discussion\nWe observed similarly problematic correlates of two distinct conspiracy beliefs\nconcerning the coronavirus pandemic. Depending on whether COVID-19 was believed to be a hoax or the SARS-Cov-2 human-made participants indicated less compliance with infection-reducing containment-related behavior and more engagement in self-centered prepping behavior targeting not a reduction of the infection rate but personal benefits in the crisis. Although these associations seem relatively straight-forward, it is important to note that previous research has pointed to the danger of conspiracy beliefs but has dedicated less attention to potentially distinct relations of different kinds of conspiracy beliefs. These distinct associations notwithstanding, our results also provide strong support for the general notion that even logically incompatible conspiracy beliefs show a high correlation and are both associated with a general mindset of conspiracy mentality.\nAdding to the robustness of the findings, another study conducted within the German\ncontext (reported in the Supplement) closely replicates this general pattern. This seems noteworthy as another dataset from the German context failed to find strong relations between conspiracy endorsement and hygiene measures (Pummerer & Sassenberg, 2020). Limitations and further research\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior - Supplement\nAs arguably the most important limitation of our research, all findings are cross-\nsectional correlations and thus mute with regard to causality. Although it seems plausible that people adopt their behavior according to how they see and perceive the world, it is also conceivable that people behave in a certain way (for no or other reasons) and adapt their worldview as a justification after the fact. Another clear limitation is that these studies were conducted in a time of rapidly changing world events and thus might not have undergone the amount of planning and detailed pre-registration as generally desirable for any kind of research question (Scheel, 2020). Applying a stricter alpha level (e.g., p=.005; for a discussion see Benjamin et al., 2018) would yield the negative impact of hoax belief on containment-related behavior in the UK non-significant after including all control variables. Trusting in the readers\u2019 intuition to interpret the results we refrain here from forcing a binary significant- non-significant decision on these data but merely point to the substantially weaker data pattern in the UK compared to the US."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, however, in two national contexts conspiracy beliefs were associated\nwith behavior that undermines the much-required solidarity in order to mitigate or contain the infection. Not adhering to recommendations of containment behavior and seeking a strategy to maximize one\u2019s one personal benefit irrespective of systemic considerations of infection control are thus two sides of the same coin. Conspiracy beliefs do matter and have \u2013 in the absence of casual evidence at the very least \u2013 highly problematic associated behaviors.\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior - Supplement\nReferences\nAndersen, K.

(2020, April 14). A bioweapon or a hoax? The link between\ndistinct conspiracy beliefs about the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and pandemic behavior.\nSupplement 1: Exploratory Moderation by Perceived Threat\nIn all three samples, we conducted exploratory analyses to test whether the relation\nbetween conspiracy beliefs and (non-recommended) self-centered prepping behavior were generally stronger, the more threatened people felt by the virus. Specifically, in Study 1 adding an interaction term of the endorsement of one of the conspiracy beliefs and the perceived threat by the coronavirus, led to significant interaction terms and increases in explained variance in the extent of non-recommendable behavior, B = 0.432, SE = 0.089, p < .001 , \u0394R2 = .083, p < .001 for hoax, B = 0.296, SE = 0.093, p = .002 \u0394R2 = .037, p = .002 for human-made (see supplemental material for full model), in the form that the association between conspiracy belief and self-centered prepping behavior generally became stronger, the more threatened people felt (Figure 1). A higher order model additionally suggested a three-way interaction (see supplement), but we refrained from putting too much interpretative weight on it before replicating these interactions.\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior - Supplement\nWe tested in Study 2 whether this moderation, with COVID-19 threat amplifying the\nrelation between the respective conspiracy beliefs and self-centered prepping behavior, would replicate. In short, the pattern replicated for both interactions (but not the three-way interaction) in the US sample (B = 0.407, SE = 0.075, p < .001, \u0394R2 = .041, p < .001 for hoax; B = 0.347, SE = 0.087, p < .001, \u0394R2 = .026, p < .001 for human-made), but not in the UK sample (for both \u0394R2 = .001, ps > .509). Thus, the effect seems to be reliable albeit specific to the context of the USA (Figure 2).\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior - Supplement\nSupplement 2: Detailed explanation and deviation from pre-registration in Study 2\nDue to the rushed nature of data collection in the given social context our pre-\nregistration for Study 2 was not as detailed enough as desirable. In addition, there have been some (data-independent) changes to the pre-registered plan. Below we thus provide more detail.\nTable.S1\nWORDING IN PRE-REGISTRATION EXPLANATION (+ POTENTIAL DEVIATION) 2) What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? Testing the relation between two different COVID-19-related conspiracy theories and COVID-related behavior. Conspiracies that COVID is a hoax are expected to be primarily related to refusal ton engage in recommended actions (hygiene, physical distancing). Conspiracy theories that COIVD-19 is a humanmanufactured virus are expected to mainly predict non-recommended actions (alternative remedies, hamstering). Despite these divergent predictions (and the logical inconsistency), we expect both CTs to be positively correlated and also correlated with conspiracy mentality. At the time of the pre-registration, the most sense we could make of the factor structure in Study 1 was that one factor included all the actions recommended by the WHO and national health agencies at that time, whereas the others mostly included behaviors that were depicted as problematic by these same institutions. It therefore seemed intuitive to think of them as \u201crecommended\u201d and \u201cnon-recommended\u201d and this is also the terminology used in the syntax: compute action_reco = mean (COVID_reactions_1, COVID_reactions_2, COVID_reactions_3 , COVID_reactions_5, COVID_reactions_6, COVID_reactions_8). compute action_non = mean (COVID_reactions_4, COVID_reactions_7, COVID_reactions_9, COVID_reactions_10, COVID_reactions_11, COVID_reactions_12, COVID_reactions_13, COVID_reactions_14, COVID_reactions_15). After collecting data for Study 2, however, it dawned on us that there is a deeper, a psychological difference between them that seem much more interesting to us. While the former are mostly solidarity-oriented in the sense of breaking infectious cycles and containing the spread, the latter are just about protecting oneself and getting through the crises as unharmed as possible. The hypotheses were tested in a regression (see point 5). In addition, we aimed to show the \u201cprimary\u201d relation by comparing the respective beta weights of the conspiracy theories and testing whether they\nCOVID-19 related Conspiracy Theories and Pandemic Behavior - Supplement\nwere significantly different from each other. This was done manually outside of the syntax based on instruction by Cohen et al.\n3) Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. List of COVID-related actions: never 1 2 3 4 5 6 Always/ strongly 7 washing hands after being outside not touching the face while being outside disinfecting hands after being outside wearing protective face masks out of the house avoiding social contacts staying at home in quarantine stocking up on sanitary items avoiding crowds buying weapons for defense and security purposes using alternative remedies like homeopathy or essential oils buying equipment for water storage and water purification withdrawing available cash from my bank account invest in stock market stocking up on petrol and oil searching information by alternative media online PCA with loadings > .30 on one and < .30 on the other factor will determine which items to keep in which scale.\nVariables were measured as described but instead of Principal Component Analyses we conducted Exploratory Factor Analyses (with promax rotation) as the more adequate method for extracting factors. This decision was not based on the data and both analyses lead to virtually identical results with PCA providing somewhat stronger factor loadings.\nIn the UK only, compliance with new lockdown: comply with the curfew rules + go out to meet friends from time to time - go directly home from work/ grocery shopping without seeing anyone + briefly chat with friends/ neighbours when I meet them on the street - hang out in groups of friends at private places - hang out in groups of friends in public places - Conspiracy theory 1: The virus is intentionally presented as dangerous in order to mislead the public. Experts intentionally mislead us for their own benefit, even though the virus is not worse than a flu. We should believe experts when they say that the virus is dangerous. Comnspiracy Theory 2: Corona was intentionally brought into the world to reduce the population. Dark forces want to use the virus to rule the world. I think it's nonsense that the virus was created in a laboratory. Variables were measured as described: Compliance with lockdown: compute noncompl = mean(Q23_1r, Q23_3r, Q23_2, Q23_4, Q23_5, Q23_6). Conspiracy Theory 1: compute CT_hoax = mean (SpecCTs_1, SpecCTs_2, SpecCTs_3r). Conspiracy Theory 2: compute CT_weapon = mean (SpecCTs_4, SpecCTs_5, SpecCTs_6r). 5) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. Prediction of recommended actions (items selected based on PCA; expected to include hygiene and physical distance behavior) and non-recommended actions (same selection criteria; expected to include buying guns and stocking up on petrol and sanitary As mentioned above, EFA rather than PCA was used to extract factor structure (but PCA yielded identical results).

We had a chance to replicate our findings in the German context by including our two conspiracy scales as well as a few items related to prepping into the COVID-19 battery of the Social Cognition Center Cologne. Further studies that were run within the battery are reported elsewhere (Dohle et al., 2020; Dorrough et al., 2020; Gl\u00f6cknet et al., 2020a, 2020b; Schneider & Dorrough, 2020).

Throughout March 2020, the United States became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, recording the most cases of any country worldwide. The current research found that, at the state level within the United States, more conservative political ideology predicted delayed implementation of stay-at-home orders and more rapid spread of COVID-19. Effects were significant across two distinct operationalizations of political ideology and held over and above relevant covariates, suggesting a potentially unique role of political ideology in the United States\u2019 COVID-19 outbreak. Considering political ideological factors may offer valuable insights into epidemiological processes surrounding COVID-19.\nOne Sentence Summary: Conservative political ideology may have delayed protective policy implementation and promoted spread of COVID-19 in the U.S.\nMain Text: Throughout March 2020, the United States became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite declaring a state of national emergency on March 13 when the prevalence of COVID-19 remained low in the U.S. at 1,264 cases (1-2), the U.S. proceeded to experience a rapid outbreak of COVID-19 during the following month, exceeding over 400,000 cumulative cases by April 10 (2). Politicization of COVID-19 in the U.S. may have played a unique role in the virus\u2019s proliferation, with conservatives feeling less concerned about COVID-19 than liberals as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s downplaying the pandemic\u2019s urgency (3). This, in turn, resulted in divergent social norms for conservatives and liberals, with COVID-19 being seen as less threatening among conservatives and more threatening among liberals (3). These politicized perceptions of COVID-19 may have influenced how individual U.S. states responded to the pandemic. The current research specifically asked the following question: At the state level within the U.S., did political ideology predict the outbreak of COVID-19?\nAcross the 50 U.S. states, variances in political ideology are substantial (4). Theoretical perspectives from social psychology suggest that a having a more conservative political ideology could have delayed a state\u2019s COVID-19 protective policy implementation and promoted spread of COVID-19 via processes of motivated reasoning and moral cognition. Through motivated reasoning, individuals are intrinsically\u2014and often unconsciously\u2014biased to confirm their preexisting beliefs and to evaluate evidence with self-serving partiality (5). Holding a politically conservative ideology may have promoted selective interpretation of COVID-19 evidence to support the in-group norm (upheld by President Trump) that the COVID-19 outbreak was under adequate control and of little urgent concern. Political-ideological differences in moral cognition may have coupled with motivated reasoning to decrease the perceived need for COVID-19 protective policy (e.g., stay-at-home orders) and individual behavior (e.g., social distancing) within conservative states. Compared to liberals, conservatives more strongly emphasize moral values of respect for authority and loyalty to social in-groups (6). With President Trump\u2019s administration\u2014as the authority of political conservatism in the U.S.\u2014downplaying the urgency\nof COVID-19, conservative state policy makers and residents may have been morally motivated to trust that COVID-19 is of little urgent risk, to support the COVID-19 positions endorsed by President Trump, and in turn to practice fewer protective individual behaviors. These factors may have delayed the implementation of stay-at-home orders and promoted the spread of COVID-19 within more conservative states.\nThe aim of the current research was to investigate the role of political ideology in the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S. at the state level. The first specific aim was to identify whether a state\u2019s political ideology predicted the date at which the state implemented a stay-athome order. The second specific aim was to identify whether a state\u2019s political ideology predicted the rate at which COVID-19 spread within that state three weeks into the pandemic. Throughout tests of these aims, three covariates were controlled for to rule out potentially confounding variables that could covary with state political ideology and drive these outcomes: 1) the total population of each state, 2) the population density of each state, and 3) the relative accumulated prevalence of COVID-19 cases in each state (i.e., the number of accumulated cases per million residents) on March 31, 2020. In predicting the date at which states implemented a stay-at-home order, the rate at which COVID-19 was spreading three weeks into the pandemic was controlled for. In predicting the rate at which COVID-19 was spreading, date of stay-athome order implementation was controlled for. Adjusting on these covariates facilitated more precise tests for causal inference as to whether a state\u2019s political ideology may have uniquely driven COVID-19 policy and spread.\nIt was hypothesized that, over and above covariates, more conservative states\u2014as indicated by a) a higher prevalence of self-identified conservatives relative to liberals and b) a higher prevalence of residents who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u2014would implement a stay-at-home order at a later date and report a more rapid growth in COVID-19 cases from March 31, 2020, through April 10, 2020. March 31 was selected as the start of this interval because it marked approximately the average date on which U.S. states implemented a stay-at-home order (7). April 10 was selected as the end of this interval given that it marked the passing of one month since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (8) and four weeks since the U.S. declared a state of national emergency (1). All confirmatory analyses involved ordinary least squares regressions, with a separate regression conducted to test each of the four distinct hypotheses. Data were obtained from recent reportings by the Center for Disease Control (9-10), Gallup (4), Politico (11), US Census State Population Estimates (12), and the Kaiser Family Foundation (7). All data and code for the current research are publicly available at https://osf.io/be3vf/?view_only=044a25689b9b4f08a7b88bde11e37c93.\nSupport emerged for all four hypotheses, with state political ideology predicting date of stay-at-home order implementation and spread of COVID-19 within the state, over and above the effects of all covariates. First, higher prevalence of self-identified conservatives relative to liberals in a state strongly predicted later date of implementing a stay-at-home order, \u03b2 = 0.70, p < 0.001 (see Fig. 1). Second, higher prevalence of residents who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election within each state strongly predicted later date of implementing a stay-at-home order, \u03b2 = 0.52, p < 0.001 (see Fig. 2). Third, higher prevalence of self-identified conservatives relative to liberals in a state predicted more rapid growth of COVID-19 cases within the state from March 31 through April 10, \u03b2 = 0.16, p = 0.01. Fourth, higher prevalence of residents who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election within each state\npredicted more rapid growth of COVID-19 cases within the state from March 31 through April 10, \u03b2 = 0.12, p = 0.03.\nThese findings suggest that the political ideology of states in the U.S. predicted what\nmeasures states took to reduce the spread of COVID-19 as well as how rapidly new cases of COVID-19 spread within states from March 31 through April 10, 2020. Effects of both political\nideology indices held significant over and above states\u2019 total populations, population densities, and incidences of COVID-19 prior to March 31. Beyond controlling for these factors, political ideology offered unique value for predicting a) the timing of stay-at-home order implementation over and above effects of COVID-19\u2019s growth rate within each state and b) the growth rate of COVID-19 within each state over and above that state\u2019s timing of stay-at-home order implementation. Although true causality cannot be inferred from these correlational data, the highly controlled nature of the performed regression models suggests the potential for causal mechanisms. Specifically, it may be that politically conservative ideologies delayed the implementation of stay-at-home orders and promoted the proliferation of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S.\nOne theorized mechanism underlying the effects of state political ideology on COVID-19 outcomes is motivated reasoning, or the bias to confirm one\u2019s preexisting beliefs and to evaluate evidence with self-serving partiality (5). Other mechanisms may relate to politicized perceptions of morality, with conservatives emphasizing moral values of respect for authority and loyalty to social in-groups to greater extents than do liberals (6)\u2014in the current context, these moral values may have promoted respect for President Trump\u2019s views on COVID-19 and feeling a moral obligation to support those views oneself. Together, these social-psychological factors may have led conservatives to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 and to undervalue the urgency of preventative policies (e.g., stay-at-home orders) and individual behaviors (e.g., social distancing).\nUltimately, the current research suggests that more conservative political ideology predicted delayed implementation of stay-at-home orders and more rapid growth of COVID-19 cases by state within the U.S. In considering discrepant COVID-19 pandemic outcomes across countries and territories within and beyond the U.S., giving attention to political ideological factors may offer valuable insights into epidemiological processes."}, {"heading": "References and Notes:", "text": "1.

Some of them lightheartedly make fun of different facets of the pandemic experience such as life in quarantine, others ironically criticize harmful behaviors or contain pungent remarks on how politicians deal with the pandemic. The creativity that characterizes Covid-19 humor is expressed in verbal jokes, but also in multimodal fashions, such as through memes, cartoon strips, and clips. The rise of humor on Covid-19 takes place within the boundaries of disaster jokes, i.e., the kind of jokes that stems from difficult situations depicting tragedies and concomitant or background crises in a playful way (Ellis, 2001; Kuipers, 2002), as happened for the AIDS outbreak or after 9/11 terrorist attacks (Dundes, 1987; Ellis, 2001; Kuipers, 2002, 2005), or even in earlier times, such as after the sinking of the Titanic (Chovanec, 2019). In exploiting an incongruity between innocuous and macabre scripts (Attardo & Raskin, 1991; Kuipers, 2002), disaster jokes often shares features with black humor, i.e., humor that touches upon contents such as death and diseases (Maxwell, 2003; Willinger et al., 2017). In terms of functions, while humor, in general, is classically described as the \u201chighest of [\u2026] defensive processes\u201d (Freud, 1960), disaster jokes are deemed to operate as a \u201ccollective mental hygienic defense mechanism\u201d to cope with tragedies (Dundes, 1987), and to reflect the desire to speak about such events (Ellis, 2001) or to rebel against media discourse (Chovanec, 2019; Oring, 1987). The emotional response to humor, i.e., appreciation, is largely affected by its specific content, both in the positive dimension of funniness (the degree to which one considers the humor to be funny) and in the negative dimension of aversiveness (the degree to which one considers the humor to be disturbing) (Ruch, 1992). Specifically, black humor is perceived as more aversive and less enjoyable than non-black one (Carretero-Dios & Ruch, 2010; Herzog & Karafa, 1998). Looking at\n3\nindividual differences, black humor is judged as less funny by females and by older adults, rated as less aversive by males, and its enjoyment increases with higher levels of education (Aillaud & Piolat, 2012; Carretero-Dios & Ruch, 2010; Willinger et al., 2017). Also personality factors play a role: for instance, the degree to which one uses humor to cope with stressful situations is associated with higher perceived funniness of sick jokes (Saroglou & Anciaux, 2004). However, this literature has rarely investigated disaster jokes specifically, and has rarely considered both funniness and aversiveness and their relationships with other individual factors. In this study, we focused on a tragically new topic for disaster jokes, i.e., Covid-19 humor. We tested its appreciation (funniness and aversiveness) through a large-scale online survey conducted during the worst phase of the outbreak in one of the most affected countries, Italy. The historical moment and geographical coordinates in which the survey took place allow us to investigate not only the role of content and personality factors, but also the effects of psychological distance (Trope & Liberman, 2010), i.e., how perceived risk, spatial and social distance from the epidemic affect how people laugh at misfortunes and terrifying events. The novelty of this study, thus, lies not only in the Covid-19 humor topic, but also in its consideration of the concurrent role of different layers of individual variation in the appreciation of disaster humor. We expected Covid-19 humor to be more aversive than humor on more benign topics. In addition, we anticipated a complex interplay of personality factors and psychological distance factors, above and beyond demographic aspects: specifically, we hypothesized that humor coping and optimism would be linked to an increment of funniness and a reduction of aversiveness. Moreover, we expected that the different facets of the distance from the risk would greatly affect Covid-19 humor perception, either in the positive or negative dimension. This research will provide a better understanding of disaster humor and its emotional correlates, both positive and negative ones, allowing for real-time estimation of these effects during the emergency from a nationwide perspective. On a more practical level, this study will offer indications on the benefits and disadvantages of using disaster humor uses, accounting for audience\n4\nheterogeneity, of possible relevance in guiding hereafter social communication practices, as well as media discourse during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\nMethod Materials We extracted \u201cInternet jokes\u201d (Shifman, 2007) from humor hubs, namely Facebook pages posting entertaining contents (>10k followers), and humorous strips. Items were either related to Covid-19 or not. Covid-19 humor were divided into three types: Covid Verbal (n=12), Covid Meme (n=6), and Covid Strip (n=6). Each type involved heterogeneous contents, from innocuous to quarantinerelated to dark themes. Covid Strip items portrayed the virus as a face-shaped object joking on pandemic mishaps or outcomes in bitter and black tones (see Ebola-chan in Marcus & Singer, 2017). NonCovid Verbal (n=12) served as baseline and included miscellaneous themes, generally softer and benign. See Figure 1 for examples. We gathered information on items virality in terms of \u201clikeability\u201d (the number of likes) and \u201csharability\u201d (the number of shares) (Mills, 2012). Adjusted values (divided by hubs\u2019 followers) were similar to those derived from Taecharungroj & Nueangjmnong (2015), i.e., 1.4% for likeability and 0.3% for sharability.\nPersonality assessment We assessed participants on two personality traits, namely the use of humor in coping with stressful situations, assessed with the Coping Humor Scale (CHS) (Martin & Lefcourt, 1983), and dispositional optimism, assessed with the Life Orientation Test \u2013 Revised (LOTR) (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994; Italian version: Giannini, Schuldberg, Di Fabio, & Gargaro, 2008).\nPsychological Distance\n5\nWe focused on three forms of psychological distance (McGraw & Warren, 2010; Trope & Liberman, 2010): perceived risk of being infected by Covid-19 (on a 1-10 scale); spatial distance, calculated as the geodesic distance (in kilometers) between the epicenter of the Italian outbreak (Codogno) and the municipality where each participant completed the questionnaire; social distance, i.e., the number of known Covid-19 cases among friends and relatives.\nParticipants A total of 1903 participants completed the survey (Table 1 for Demographics). They were recruited via social media, with posts on authors\u2019 personal and institutional social media profiles, targeted advertising on Facebook, public communication, and by email. Results are based on 1751 native speakers of Italian (556 M, 1195 F), living in Italy (126 participants completed it from abroad), and aged above 18. Participants were informed that upon completion of a second part of the survey at the end of the Covid-19 emergency, they will partake to a prize draw of fifty 10\u20ac prizes. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences of the University of Pavia (protocol 44/2020).\nProcedure We designed a web-based survey on LimeSurvey\u00ae (https://limesurvey.org). The study was launched during the most dramatic stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, between March 18 and March 30, 2020 \u2013 soon after the nationwide lockdown issued by the Italian Government with the Prime Ministerial Decree signed on March 8, 2020. After providing informed consent and demographics (Age, Gender and Provenance), participants completed a section with psychological distance questions, the personality assessment, and then they were asked to rate each item for funniness and aversiveness on two 7-point scales ranging from 0 (not at all funny/disturbing) to 6 (very funny/disturbing) (Ruch, 1992). The median time of completion was 13 minutes.\n6\nStatistical Analysis We tested the relationship between Type of humor, Demographic factors (Age, Gender, and Education), Personality measures (CHS and LOTR scores), and Psychological Distance (Perceived risk, Spatial distance, and Social distance) on the two dependent variables (Funniness and Aversiveness), with a \u201chierarchical\u201d approach (e.g. Cohen, 2013): four models (for each dependent variable) of increasing complexity were built and compared in terms of goodness of fit. We used Linear Mixed Models (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000; lme4 package, Bates, M\u00e4chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015) in R (R Core Team, 2020) with crossed random effects for Participants, Items, and Province of completion. We expected that Personality factors would capture data variance over and above that accounted for by Demographic factors, and that Psychological Distance would further explain data variance, over and above that accounted for by Demographic and Personality factors. While the impact of Demographic factors on jokes and black humor perception has been previously reported (Aillaud & Piolat, 2012; Bischetti, Ceccato, Lecce, Cavallini, & Bambini, 2019; Carretero-Dios & Ruch, 2010; Willinger et al., 2017), here these factors will have limited interest and will not be described in detail. The baseline model tested the effect of Type of humor, for which three specific contrasts were set (Schad, Vasishth, Hohenstein, & Kliegl, 2020): Covid Verbal vs. NonCovid Verbal, Meme vs. Covid Verbal, and Strip vs. Covid Verbal. Dependent variables ranged from 0 to 6, while all continuous predictors were z-centered. A parsimonious random structure of the models was selected on grounds of feasibility and results are based on fully identified models (Bates, Kliegl, Vasishth, & Baayen, 2015): for each random factor, a varying intercept was estimated. Moreover, within-participants slope adjustments for Type of humor, and item level adjustments for Age were allowed.\nData availability\n7\nThe material used in the current study, as well as the dataset and the R script for the analyses, are available in the Open Science Framework repository (https://osf.io/gj52h/).\nResults Likelihood ratio tests showed that variance in Funniness and Aversiveness ratings was best explained by the models including Demographic, Personality, and Psychological Distance (Table 2).\nFunniness No differences in Funniness were found (t<1) between NonCovid Verbal (M=2.94) and Covid Verbal (M=2.86), while, compared to Covid Verbal, Covid Meme (M=3.45) resulted funnier (t=+2.73, p<.01), and Covid Strip (M=1.89) less funny (t=-4.43, p<.001). All Demographic and Personality variables modulated the differences between humor types. Interestingly, the effect of both CHS (\u03b2=+0.23, t=+7.89, p<.001) and LOTR (\u03b2=+0.08, t=+2.84, p<.01) had a positive direction (Figure 2B-C). Larger CHS scores were associated with higher funniness ratings, but critically, planned contrasts showed that this relation was stronger (\u0394\u03b2=+0.07, t=+3.86, p<.001) for Covid Verbal (\u03b2=+0.24) as compared to NonCovid Verbal (\u03b2=+0.17). A stronger involvement (\u0394\u03b2=+0.07, t=+3.40, p<.001) of LOTR was instead observed between Covid Meme (\u03b2=+0.14) as compared to with Covid Verbal (\u03b2=+0.07). As for Psychological Distance, the model showed a significant and positive contribution of the quadratic term of Spatial distance (\u03b2=+0.12, t=+2.44, p<.05), while the linear term was only numerically positive (\u03b2=+0.06, t<1): ratings increased as function of distance, after an initial fall, and especially at longer distances (Figure 2D and Figure 3 for a representation on the Italian map).\nAversiveness\n8\nDifferences in Aversiveness were found (+0.39, t=+2.26, p<.05) between Covid Verbal (M=0.87) and NonCovid Verbal (M=0.48). Moreover, Covid Strip (M=1.42) were judged as more aversive (+0.54, t=+2.53, p<.05) than Covid Verbal materials. If Demographic variables (Gender and Education) showed an effect dependent on the different humor types, Personality factors further explained data variance. CHS (but not LOTR) was a reliable predictor of Aversiveness (Figure 4B): the overall effect of CHS on Aversiveness was negative (\u03b2=-0.17, t=-8.14, p<.001). The planned contrasts further revealed that the effect was graded, with more negative slopes (\u0394\u03b2=-0.10, t=-6.76, p<.001) for Covid Verbal (\u03b2=-0.19) as compared to NonCovid Verbal (\u03b2=-0.09); CHS effect on Meme (\u03b2=-0.16) was slightly less negative (\u0394\u03b2=+0.03, t=+2.01, p<.05) than on Covid Verbal; CHS effect on Covid Strip (\u03b2=-0.28) was more negative than on Covid Verbal (\u0394\u03b2=-0.09, t=-3.75, p<.001). As for Psychological Distance factors, a positive effect of risk perception (\u03b2=+0.04, t=+1.74, p<.10) emerged and was modulated by Type of Humor (Figure 4C): the effect was stronger (\u0394\u03b2=+0.05, t=+3.03, p<.01) in Covid Verbal (\u03b2=+0.04) as compared to NonCovid Verbal (\u03b2=+0.00), and that it was even stronger (\u0394\u03b2=+0.05, t=+2.28, p<.05) and different from zero for Covid Strip (\u03b2=+0.09) compared to Covid Verbal.\nInspection of by-item variability The investigation of random effects distribution revealed that the difference between the mean aversiveness value of all materials and the \u201cadjusted\u201d Conditional Modes of each joke described our data beyond the fixed effects included in the model. The inspection of the random effects (Figure 5) suggests a role of joke content: the least funny and most aversive items are the jokes associated with death, contagion, or infection, while the least aversive items are the jokes associated with quarantine mishaps and change of habits.\nDiscussion\n9\nIn this study, we showed that the appreciation of Covid-19 humor is concurrently explained by joke features, personality traits, and psychological distance measures. Starting with the role of joke content, which was analyzed in the first step of the analysis, findings indicated that Covid-19 humor lacks a \u201csignature\u201d of funniness: no differences emerged between Covid and NonCovid Verbal jokes. Moreover, among all Covid-19 jokes, funniness ratings were highly heterogeneous, with memes being funnier than verbal and strips being less funny. We argue that the joke format might have interacted with pandemic-related contents in shaping funniness ratings: while memes elicited a greater enjoyment (for theoretical support see (Dynel, 2016; Yus, 2019), strips were rated less funny than other formats, probably due to the bitter and macabre contents (for previous examples (Aillaud & Piolat, 2012; Carretero-Dios & Ruch, 2010; Herzog & Bush, 1994; Saroglou & Anciaux, 2004). Overall, thus, disaster jokes seem to lack specificity for the dimension of enjoyment. On the contrary, Covid-19 humor appears characterized by a clear mark of aversiveness, with increasing values from memes to verbal jokes and strips. This finding suggests that disaster jokes approximate other forms of black humor in the negative dimension of appreciation (Carretero-Dios & Ruch, 2010). This is also confirmed by the qualitative inspection of by-item variability, which further indicated that the most aversive jokes about Covid-19 dealt with dark themes, such as the spread of the contagion to grandparents (see Fig. 1 panel D) or the unpleasant conclusion that Covid-19 might be a solution for the prospective issue of Italian pensions. Going to the next step of the analysis, results indicated that personality factors were significant predictors of Covid-19 humor appreciation and explained variance beyond demographics. Specifically, the measure of humor coping exerted a significant effect on both funniness and aversiveness, for humor in general and in particular for Covid Verbal jokes. In other words, our findings illustrate that adopting a humorous perspective in uneasy circumstances has an effect on the two dimensions of jokes appreciation, boosting the positive dimension of funniness and shrinking the aversiveness response. Although we did not directly test the therapeutic value of\n10\nCovid-19 humor in facing the pandemic, we follow previous evidence on the benefits of humor in handling negative emotions (Martin & Lefcourt, 1983; Perchtold et al., 2019) and we argue that the emotional processing of Covid-19 humor could contribute to down-regulate the negative feelings and mitigate the stress induced by the Covid-19 outbreak, especially in the individuals inclined to use humor to deal with uneasy circumstances. In these individuals, Covid-19 humor may be a way to bypass the more worrying and fearsome aspects of the pandemic, as attested by the graded effect on aversiveness ratings. To complete the discussion on personality factors, our results showed that, in addition to the effects of coping, the positive attitude towards life, as measured with dispositional optimism, broadly influenced funniness ratings (especially in more enjoyable forms such as Covid Meme), expanding previous literature on the relationships between humor practices and optimism (Ford, Lappi, & Holden, 2016; Yue, Hao, & Goldmann, 2010). On top of the differences associated with joke features and the effect of personality, results highlighted the importance of the different facets of psychological distance. Participants who perceived higher risk of contagion also gave higher ratings of aversiveness for Covid as compared to Non-Covid materials, and especially when judging the most bitter strips. This relationship between risk perception and aversiveness for Covid-19 humor resonates with a wealth of research showing that risk perception is tied to emotions and negative feelings typically associated with avoidance (Loewenstein, Webber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001). The more aversive ratings for strips given by those who perceived a higher risk of contagion reflect the difficulty in avoiding discomfort when a tragedy is psychologically close (Dor\u00e9, Ort, Braverman, & Ochsner, 2015), and this effect does not simply depend on spatial proximity. In showing that psychological distance is needed to appreciate disaster jokes, our findings expand previous evidence by showing that distance affects not only the positive dimension of enjoyment (McGraw & Warren, 2010; McGraw, Warren, Williams, & Leonard, 2012), but also the aversiveness ratings. While the higher subjective distance from the risk suppresses the disturbing connotation of Covid-19 humor, the greater objective\n11\ngeographical distance allows to deeper enjoy the bright side of all humor, including Covid-19 jokes. Indeed, we observed a mild effect of spatial distance on perceived funniness. Participants living far from the epicenter of the pandemic tended to judge humorous materials as globally funnier, as if more distant participants had a generally more positive disposition towards humor. The high individual variation emerging from our findings draw implications for the uses of humor based on Covid-19 in political and media communication. First, subjects that exercise public functions, such as politicians or heads of health-related agencies, should carefully ponder the choice of sharing posts with Covid-19 humor on their social media accounts or rebut with gallows remarks. Second, content creators, both in traditional and social media, might profit from analytics to correctly calibrate the delivery of Covid-19 humor, aware of the emotional consequences that shared contents might trigger in their followers or viewers. Indeed, Covid-19 humor is likely to be as funny or even funnier than the average Internet joke, but it has a high chance of being perceived as disturbing or aversive by many.\n12"}, {"heading": "Reference list", "text": "Aillaud, M., & Piolat, A.

In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public wellbeing, are deliberately disregarded or ignored by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 617 participants took part in the online survey and answered several questions related to socio-demographic variables, political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation, intellectual curiosity, trust in science, COVID-19 risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science.

Current data, which likely underscore the actual prevalence of the disease (Lipsitch, Swerdlow, & Finelli, 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020), support this notion; as of now (April 5th, 2020), COVID-19 has spread to at least 206 countries and territories and has recently exceeded more than 1,200,000 confirmed cases and 64,000 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus and the exponential growth of infections observed in many countries (e.g. Italy; Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020), a high level of compliance with prevention guidelines, such as those issued by the WHO, is necessary to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and slow the spread of the virus (Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, & Hollingsworth, 2020). In spite of this, there have been numerous reported instances of people ignoring these instructions all over the world (Bhanot, 2020), likely exacerbating the problem.\nWhile the previous literature has begun to unravel important medical and\nepidemiological information about the severity of the disease and the transmissibility of the virus, the psychosocial responses of the public are still relatively unknown (for one of the rare published articles, see Wang, Di, Ye, & Wei, 2020), and this is particularly true when it comes to individuals\u2019 reactions to the COVID-19 prevention guidelines. We argue that exploring the antecedents of compliance with these guidelines could potentially be of great practical importance as it could help us identify high-risk groups and take the necessary steps towards improving the rate of compliance."}, {"heading": "Development of the model", "text": "To investigate the predictors of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, we\ndeveloped a theoretical model (Figure 1) that includes several variables, previously identified as relevant, and relates them in a meaningful way.\nThe first likely predictor of compliance with COVID-19 guidelines is COVID-\n19 risk perception (i.e. the extent to which a person believes that the novel coronavirus poses a serious threat). More specifically, we predict that those who are generally more concerned about COVID-19 are more likely to adhere to preventive measures as shown by previous studies, conducted in similar contexts (e.g. Chen, Fox, Cantrell, Stockdale, & Kagawa-Singer, 2007; Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007; Maughan-Brown & Venkataramani, 2018). Since it is scientific organizations and scientists who are often the source of both, prevention guidelines and messages informing the public about COVID-19 risks, those who trust science and scientists are more inclined to perceive COVID-19 as an actual risk and follow the risk-mitigating guidelines. Support for this assumption can, for example, be found in the vaccination literature (e.g. Keelan, Pavri, Balakrishnan, & Wilson, 2010) and other studies that highlight the role of trust in\ndetermining the perception of various emotionally charged scientific issues (Nadelson & Hardy, 2015).\nIn addition, previous studies have highlighted numerous correlates and\nantecedents of trust in science and science skepticism, that could, directly or indirectly via trust in science, predict compliance with COVID-19-related prevention guidelines. Key variables among these are political conservatism (e.g. Rutjens, Sutton, & van der Lee, 2018; Wilgus & Travis, 2019), religiousness/religious orthodoxy (e.g. Chan, 2018; Rutjens et al., 2018), conspiracy thinking (e.g. Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Oberauer, 2013; Rutjens & van der Lee, 2020) and, to some extent, education (e.g. Morgan, Collins, Sparks, & Welch, 2018). While more general and stable personality traits are less present in the previous literature on predictors of trust in science, we believe that aspects of open-mindedness in particular (i.e. the extent to which an individual prefers to have a broad versus narrow range of perceptual, cognitive, and affective experiences; Soto & John, 2017) could also play an important role in predicting both - trust in science and compliance with evidence-based prevention guidelines. Hence, this aspect was additionally added to the theoretical model."}, {"heading": "Objectives", "text": "The aim of this study was to develop and examine the theoretical model that could help us explain the different responses to the COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

All items of the reported instruments were used as indicators of the respective latent variable in the SEM (except for trust in science), and a few pairs of items with similar content (within the same scale) were allowed correlated measurement errors (Meece, Wigfield, & Eccles, 1990; Seekatz et al., 2016).\nFirst, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the proposed\nmeasurement models of the latent variables (i.e. to verify the \u201cfit\u201d of the observed variables to each latent variable). Second, structural models were examined to assess the relationships between the latent variables. Model fit was assessed using the Chi-square goodness of fit test, Comparative Fit Index (CFI \u2265 .90 recommended), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA \u2264.08 recommended) and Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR \u2264 .08 recommended; Kline, 2005), and the two models (M1 \u2013 the theoretical model, M2 \u2013 the adapted model) were compared using Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). Standardized estimates for path coefficients, interpreted as regression coefficients, were calculated for all proposed relationships in the final model, as well as the relevant indirect effects to test the mediation hypotheses.

This allowed us to work with latent variables and calculate correlations between them (Table 1). As shown in the table below, trust in science is significantly correlated with all of the other variables. Specifically, it is positively correlated with education and intellectual curiosity and negatively correlated with political conservatism, religious orthodoxy and conspiracy ideation. Similar patterns can be seen in the case of COVID-19 risk perception (which is positively correlated with trust in science), while correlation coefficients, related to compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, generally show weaker relationships.

This model exhibited a slightly better fit, as expressed by the AIC and BIC values.\nshown in Figure 2 below. As can be seen in the figure, political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity are all significant predictors of trust in science.

The results suggest that all four variables exert an indirect effect on COVID-19 adherence via trust in science."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The present study aimed to develop and test the theoretical model that could help us understand the differences in public compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. The final model highlights at least two important findings. First, COVID-19 risk\nperception and trust in science (relatively independently) predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines; specifically, individuals who perceive COVID-19 as a serious threat and those who have greater trust in science and scientists are more likely to act in accordance with the proposed guidelines. Second, political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity do not directly affect compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines but do so indirectly through trust in science. To further elaborate on this finding \u2013 individuals who are higher on political conservatism, religious orthodoxy and conspiracy ideation trust science to a lesser degree, which in turn leads to a lower level of compliance with the preventive measures. The opposite is true in the case of intellectual curiosity; participants high on intellectual curiosity trust science more, which in turn leads to a higher level of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.\nAlthough our results are highly consistent with the proposed theoretical model,\nit is worth noting that one variable, education level, had to be excluded from the theoretical model, as it did not significantly affect trust in science or any of the COVID19-related variables. This finding is rather surprising, but not unprecedented, since some previous studies have also found no relationship between education level and trust in science (e.g. Wilgus & Travis, 2019) and between education and disease-preventive behavior (e.g. Velan, Kaplan, Ziv, Boyko, & Lerner-Geva, 2011). It is also worth noting that this finding may be due to the somewhat limited variability of education in the present sample, as, for example, only 2.5% of participants indicated \u201cprimary education or less\u201d and \u201clower secondary education\u201d as their highest level of education."}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "The present study has some limitations, which are briefly outlined in the following paragraph. One of these limitations is that only self-report measures were used in the\nstudy, which could be problematic as some of the measured variables are very prone to socially desirable responding.

Some attention also needs to be paid to the shortcomings of the sample; since we used convenience sampling and promoted the study on social media websites such as Reddit (see Shatz, 2017 for a review of recruiting participants this way), it is possible that our sample is somewhat biased towards having higher trust in science (participants voluntarily chose to participate in an academic study). Finally, we acknowledge the fact that compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines is not as context-free as treated in the present study, but may be influenced by various variables outside the scope of this research article (e.g. having to go to work, participants\u2019 occupation, government policies and laws)."}, {"heading": "Implications", "text": "In conclusion, we have developed and tested a model that explains a significant proportion of the variance in compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

Across three studies totaling nearly 1,000 participants, we evaluated two different potential reasons why conservatives are less concerned: Experiential (conservatives are less directly affected by the outbreak than liberals) versus Political (conservatives hold COVIDspecific political beliefs that make them motivated to reduce their concern). All three studies consistently showed evidence that motivated political (and not experiential) reasons more strongly underlie conservatives\u2019 lack of concern for COVID-19. Whereas experience with (e.g., knowing people with symptoms) and impacts of (e.g., financial hardships resulting from COVID-19) the disease did not consistently mediate the conservatism-COVID concern relationship, COVID-specific Political Beliefs (e.g., opposition to government restrictions) did consistently mediate the key relationship. Pooled analyses further suggested that, while it did not strongly mediate the relationship, experience nonetheless provided a boundary condition for the conservatismperceived threat relationship: As experience/impacts with COVID-19 increased, ideology played less of a role in predicting perceived threat. Taken together, this evidence suggests that (1) conservatives\u2019 lack of concern with the pandemic is not based in direct experience but rather motivated by desired political outcomes. However, it further suggests that (2) as experiences and impact of COVID-19 grow, the ideological effect on COVID-19 threat diminishes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this set of findings.\nKeywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, political ideology, disease avoidance\nExperiential Versus Political Explanations\nIn the United States, conservatives seem less concerned than liberals about the COVID-\n19 pandemic. A recent poll found that only 35% of conservatives (compared to 68% of liberals) are concerned about the virus (Malloy & Schwartz, 2020). Furthermore, only 42% of Republicans feared that they or someone in their family might be exposed to coronavirus, whereas 73% of Democrats and 64% Independents agreed (Brownstein, 2020).\nConservatives\u2019 relative apathy towards the pandemic is curious in light of a large body of\nsocial psychological research and theory suggesting strong ties between conservative ideology and threat \u2013 and especially to direct physical threats such as disease (for summaries, see Conway, Chan, & Woodard, 2019; Crawford, 2017). For example, at a general level, belief in a dangerous world is consistently stronger in conservatives than in liberals (e.g., Altemeyer, 1996; Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Feldman, 2003; see Choma & Hanoch, 2017, for discussion). More specific to disease, research shows that disgust sensitivity \u2013 one of the psychological mechanisms by which disease threat operates \u2013 is associated with more conservative policy positions and voting tendencies (Brenner & Inbar, 2015; Inbar et al., 2012; Liuzza et al., 2018, Oosterhoff et al., 2018; Shook et al., 2017). Parallel work in the laboratory reveals that priming disgust-related schemas makes people become more conservative (Helzer & Pizarro, 2011), and a recent study found that priming COVID-19 increased social conservatism (Karwowski et al., 2020). Complementary work at a socio-ecological level suggests that the presence of more communicable disease is generally associated with higher levels of politically conservative values and beliefs (Beall, Hofer, & Schaller, 2016; Conway et al., 2017; Fincher, Thornhill, Murray, & Schaller, 2008; Murray, Kerry, & Gervais, 2019; Tybur et al., 2016).\nthreat, why do they seem especially apathetic to a worldwide disease pandemic in which the United States currently has the highest number of confirmed cases (World Health Organization, 2020)? In the present article, we consider and test two possible explanations for this effect.

Theoretical and Practical Implications", "text": "Understanding how different ideological groups respond to disease threat is vital for both\ntheoretical and practical reasons. At a theory level, although work evaluating the psychology of past and present disease outbreaks is growing (e.g., Karwowski et al., 2020; Harper et al., 2020; Martin, 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020; Zettler et al., 2020), we currently do not have many guiding theories concerning the interface of ideology and disease outbreaks more broadly. Thus, in the present project we aim to use the current data to aid in theory-building in this regard. Given the dearth of available theory and research on disease outbreaks, this is a vital gap to fill.\nBuilding better theoretical models also has important practical implications as well.\nIndeed, better understanding factors that contribute to why people might (or might not) feel dismissive towards a world-wide pandemic is vital to how organizations and governments respond to such crises. Because ideology has a huge impact on how people think, feel, and behave (see, e.g., Jost et al., 2008), understanding how ideology might interface with COVID-19 can importantly advance our knowledge of the practical realities that governments face in terms of potential responses to their policies.\nThe Present Research: Comparing Motivated Political Versus Experiential Explanations\nmight be less prone to view the outbreak as dangerous. First, we consider the possibility that conservatives are simply less directly affected by the pandemic than liberals in the U.S., and thus their reasons for apathy are based in an experiential reality. Liberal and conservative groups in the U.S. comprise different portions of the population that not only generally reside in different regions of the country, they also comprise often very-different demographic groups within those regions. For example, at the time of data collection, largely-liberal New York was the state with the most COVID-19 cases. It is thus possible that conservative apathy results from less actual exposure to potential threats from the disease.\nSecond, it may be that conservatives hold political beliefs relevant to the pandemic that\ncause them to want to dismiss the pandemic as less important. Much research on motivated ideological cognition shows how pre-existing ideological beliefs motivate behavior, shape beliefs, and guide interpretations of events (Clark & Winegard, 2020; Conway, Zubrod, & Chan, 2020; Ditto et al., 2019; Honeycutt & Jussim, 2020; Jost et al., 2003). Thus, it is possible that conservatives\u2019 apathy comes from the particular way that their pre-exising ideologies might interface with the COVID-19 pandemic, and not because of differential experience with the disease. In the present studies, we evaluated six dimensions on which conservatives might differ from liberals in their views of their government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis. To the degree that beliefs about what they would prefer the government would do mediate the conservatismperceived threat relationship, this suggests that political motives regarding preferred government responses are the reason that conservatives report less concern with the disease.\nFurther, in pooled analyses of Studies 1-3, we additionally consider the potential\nCOVID-19. In particular, we pursue the degree that conservative identification has a greater effect at lower levels of experience than higher levels. If that is the case, it would help us not only understand what mediates the conservatismperceived threat relationship, but also when ideology is more likely to predict perceived threat.\nOverview of Studies 1-3\nAcross three studies collected on March 30, March 31, and April 3 (2020), participants\ncompleted measurements related to self-identification with political conservatism, perceived threat of COVID-19, political motives related to governmental action for COVID-19, and their experiences/impacts related to COVID-19. All COVID-19 measurements were developed and factor-analyzed (including Confirmatory Factor Analyses in Studies 2 and 3) throughout this research project. As a result, some small differences occurred in these measures from study to study (see Conway, Woodard, & Zubrod, 2020). However, as seen below, these differences clearly did not affect the main storylines reported here. Thus, we focus here on those key storylines for brevity\u2019s sake; more details about the specifics of the questionnaires and their development and validation can be found in Conway, Woodard, and Zubrod, 2020.1\nStudy 1 Methods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "1 All three studies contained a paragraph-writing prime at the beginning of the study. The prime was designed to get participants to think about COVID-19, a happy topic, a neutral topic, or no topic. We originally anticipated that this prime might alter the relationship of ideology to threat. However, all the relationships reported here were essentially identical in each priming condition, and thus the prime is not relevant to the main storyline reported here. Further, we found no consistent main effects of the prime on anxiety, self-reported ideology, or on voting preferences. This is, on the surface, inconsistent with a recent study that found a COVID-19 prime increased anxiety and support for conservative candidates in the U.S. and Poland (Karwowski et al., 2020). It is unclear why we did not replicate their findings. It is possible that our prime was less powerful (Karwowski et al. used news articles to prime thinking, whereas we used participant self-reflections). A more likely explanation is that their study was collected three weeks before ours, and it is possible that by the time we ran our study, COVID-19 was so much on the minds of most Americans that our prime was weakened by a ceiling effect. However, the key point for our purposes is that the prime is irrelevant to the key storylines reported here, and we mention it no further.\n(MTurk) participants completed a battery of items relevant to the key conceptual variables. MTurk has been validated for use as a representative U.S. sample for research related to political ideology (see, e.g., Clifford, Jewell, & Waggoner, 2015; Kennedy et al., 2018) and generally shows similar results as other samples in the U.S. (see Conway et al., 2018). Given recentlyidentified potential quality issues with MTurk (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2018), across all three studies discussed here, we ensured the highest quality of data by including several screener questions that participants had to answer correctly to be included in the study. Evidence suggests that MTurk still produces excellent data given such safeguards (Kennedy et al., 2018). Independent Variable: Political Conservatism\nTo measure self-identification with political conservatism, participants completed two\nstandard items anchored by Liberal/Democrat at the low end and Conservative/Republican at the high end (e.g., Jost et al., 2008). These were averaged into a Political Conservatism score (standardized alpha = .95). Dependent Variable: Perceived Coronavirus Threat Questionnaire\nParticipants completed six items concerning how threatened or worried they were about\nCOVID-19, for example: \u201cThinking about the coronavirus (COVID-19) makes me feel threatened.\u201d2 Consistent with the cultural narrative about conservative apathy towards COVID19, this Perceived Coronavirus Threat Questionnaire was negatively related to Political Conservatism, r = -.33, p < .001."}, {"heading": "Political Beliefs Mediators: Governmental Response to Coronavirus Questionnaire", "text": "Participants completed 48 items concerning their political beliefs about their\n2 As reported in Conway et al (2020), standardized alphas for this and all other COVID-19-related questionnaires included in the present studies were satisfactory.\noccurred across 3 different layers of government (Federal, State, City). For each psychological dimension, participants completed two questions that were parallel for each level of government. Although the scales show better factor structures if used separately for each level of government (Conway, Woodard, & Zubrod, 2020), they consistently showed the same pattern in our results across all levels of government. As a result, for the sake of reporting brevity we provide summary scores across levels of government here. The six dimensions were as follows.\nRestriction. Restriction questions measured the degree that participants wanted their\nFederal, State, and City governments to restrict citizens to help stop the spread of the virus, for example: \u201cI support [Federal/State/City] government measures to restrict the movement of American citizens to curb the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19).\u201d\nPunishment. Punishment questions measured the degree that participants wanted their\nFederal, State, and City governments to punish citizens who violated social distancing rules, for example: \u201cI want my [Federal/State/City] government to severely punish those who violate orders to stay home.\u201d\nReactance. Reactance questions measured the degree that participants felt angry that\ntheir Federal, State, and City governments were taking away their freedom during the crisis. These items were adapted from prior work on political reactance (e.g., Conway & Repke, 2019; Conway et al., 2017). A sample question is \u201cI am upset at the thought that my [Federal/State/City] government would force people to stay home against their will.\u201d\nResearch. Research questions measured the degree that participants wanted their\nFederal, State, and City governments to fund research on the virus, for example: \u201cI think we should spend most of our [Federal/State/City] resources right now towards finding a vaccine (or\nStimulus. Stimulus questions measured the degree that participants wanted their Federal,\nState, and City governments to give stimulus money back to individual persons to help the economy, for example: \u201cI think it is a good idea for the [Federal/State/City] government to give individual citizens money back during these difficult times to increase spending and keep business going.\u201d\nInformational Contamination. Informational Contamination questions measured the\ndegree that participants felt that they could not trust their Federal, State, and City governments to provide accurate information during the crisis. These items were adapted from prior work on political informational contamination (e.g., Conway & Repke, 2019; Conway et al., 2017). A sample question is \u201cI distrust the information I receive about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) from my [Federal/State/City] government.\u201d"}, {"heading": "Experiential Mediators: Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire and Coronovirus Experiences", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Questionnaires", "text": "Participants completed 14 items concerning their experiences with, and impacts of,\nCOVID-19. These questionnaires measured their Personal COVID-19 Symptoms/Diagnoses, (\u201cI have been diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d), the degree that they might have known Others with COVID-19 (\u201cI know someone who has had coronavirus-like symptoms in the last two months\u201d), how much COVID-19 News they had been watching (\u201cI watch a lot of news about the Coronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d), and how much they have been Financially Impacted (I have lost job-related income due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d)."}, {"heading": "Summary Scores for Mediators", "text": "Although the Experiential/Impacts and Government Responses Questionnaires were\nnonetheless each represent larger conceptual variables for our purposes. As a result, in addition to performing scale-by-scale analyses, for summary purposes we created two summary scores to represent those larger conceptual groupings into experiential versus political mediators. For COVID-19-Specific Political Beliefs, we averaged the six Government Responses scales, reverse-scoring as necessary so that higher scores always indicated a greater desire for government response/more trust in the government. For Experiences/Impacts, we averaged the four scales in the Experiences and Impacts Questionnaires, such that higher scores always equaled greater level of experiences/impacts with COVID-19.3\nStudy 1 Results and Discussion\nTo analyze the degree that experiential versus political reasons accounted for the\nconservatismperceived COVID-19 threat relationship, we performed a series of mediational analyses according to recommended current practices (Darlington & Hayes, 2017; Hayes, 2018). Specifically, we used the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2018; model 4) to compute normal inferential tests of indirect effects, bootstrapped indirect effect sizes (using 5000 samples), and bootstrapped indirect effect confidence intervals (using 5000 samples). Each analysis tested the degree that there was an indirect effect in a conservatismpotential mediatorperceived COVID-19 threat model, such that conservatism was operating on perceived threat through the mediator. In each case, every test also controlled for age, biological sex assigned at birth, and\n3 Across all three studies, we dropped two measurements (one for experiences/impacts, one for political beliefs about Trump) that had too much method overlap with the key DV (perceived threat/anxiety about COVID-19). First, we dropped the Psychological Impacts scale that measures participants\u2019 belief that they had been negatively psychologically impacted by COVID-19 (see Conway et al, 2020). Second, we dropped a measurement of how anxious people felt about Donald Trump. However, we performed analyses with each of these dropped measures (including a separate analysis of the summary Experiences/Impact score that added Psychological Impacts), and while both measures did predictably mediate the conservatismperceived threat relationship, inclusion of them would not change the basic storyline presented here in any meaningful way. Given the clear reasons for excluding them, we discuss these measurements no further.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, strong evidence emerged for a motivated political belief\nmodel, but little to no evidence was found for an experiential model. All of the political beliefs were significant mediators except for informational contamination, whereas the most direct markers of experience all showed no mediational effect. The only experiential marker that showed an impact was that for watching news \u2013 and it was still weaker in magnitude that almost all of the political beliefs variables.\nStudy 1 showed initial evidence that conservatives are less concerned about COVID-19\ndue to motivated political beliefs that intersect with COVID-19 and not because of direct experiences they have had with the disease. Study 2 attempted to replicate this basic effect while adding an additional experiential variable.\nStudy 2 Methods and Results\nIn Study 2, two hundred and eighty-five Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants\ncompleted a similar battery of items as Study 1 participants, with identical data quality safeguards as used in Study 1. Study 2 questionnaires were identical to Study 1 questionnaires except for minor differences (see Conway et al., 2020, for more details). Importantly, to provide an even broader test of the experiential model, Study 2 expanded the Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire by creating a new Resource Acquisition subscale that focused on COVID-19\u2019s interference with participants\u2019 ability to obtain basic resources. Further, to better ensure our effects were not accounted for by demographic factors, in addition to the three covariates used in Study 1, in Study 2 we added standard measurements of income and education as covariates in all analyses.\nConsistent with the cultural narrative about conservative apathy towards COVID-19,\n< .001. As can be seen in Table 2, Study 2 provided a replication of Study 1 concerning why this relationship existed. There was little to no mediational impact of any of the experiential variables. Although the mediational effects of COVID-specific political beliefs were weaker overall than in Study 1, the same patterns generally held in Study 2 \u2013 and the overall mediational effect for the summary political beliefs variable was still statistically significant. As in Study 1, the weakest effect for political beliefs was for the measurement of informational contamination.\nStudy 3 Methods and Results\nIn Study 3, four hundred and two Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants\ncompleted a similar battery of items as Study 1 and Study 2 participants, with identical data quality safeguards as used in Studies 1 and 2. Study 3 questionnaires were identical to Study 2 questionnaires except for minor differences on one questionnaire (see Conway, Woodard, & Zubrod, 2020).4\nConsistent with the cultural narrative about conservative apathy towards COVID-19,\nPerceived Coronavirus Threat was again negatively related to Political Conservatism, r = -.29, p < .001. As can be seen in Table 3, in explaining this effect, there was once again a much larger mediational effect of political beliefs than direct experience. None of the individual experiential variables were significant mediators. Although a weak (but statistically significant) effect emerged for the overall experiential variable, this was again dwarfed by the mediational effect of the political beliefs variables. As in Studies 1 and 2, the weakest effect for the political variables was for informational contamination.5\n4 Combining all three studies, our sample had typical Mechanical Turk characteristics for age (range = 20 to 76, mean age = 41), biological sex assigned at birth (48% female), and race/ethnicity (largest groups were White/European-American = 78%, Asian = 9%, and Black/African-American = 7%).\nWe further performed a pooled analyses of Studies 1-3 with two goals in mind. First, we\nwanted to provide an overarching empirical summary of the mediational impact of Political Beliefs versus Experiences/Impacts across the various measures. Second, we wanted to test the boundary conditions of the effect of Conservatism on Perceived COVID-19 Threat."}, {"heading": "Pooled Summary of Indirect Effects Presented in Studies 1-3", "text": "As can be seen in Table 4, pooled mediational analyses were consistent with the results of\nthe individual studies. Political Beliefs about the Government showed a much stronger mediational effect on the ConservatismPerceived COVID-19 Threat relationship than did Experiences/Impacts (Summary Political Beliefs indirect effect standardized beta = -.13, LCI = - .16, UCI = -.09, p < .0001; summary Experiences/Impact indirect effect standardized beta = -.03, LCI = -.05, UCI = -.01, p = .007). Indeed, neither of the two most direct measures of personal experience (Personal Experiences with COVID-19 or Proximity to Others with COVID-19) showed any mediational power at all. Instead, the two measurements of impact and the measurement of indirect contact via news exposure showed very small effects.\nHowever, all of those effects typically paled in comparison to the effects of COVID-\nspecific political beliefs. The two largest effects both had to do with people\u2019s desire for, and reaction to, government policies requiring social distancing (Restriction and Reactance; see\ngovernmental policy choices.6"}, {"heading": "Does Political Ideology Become Less Important at Higher Levels of Experience/Impact?", "text": "Although experience does not show great mediating power in the conservatism\nperceived threat relationship, it is possible that experience might play a different kind of role. Rather than serving primarily as a mediator, it is possible that instead it serves primarily to moderate the effect of conservatism on perceived threat, such that ideology is less predictive of perceived threat as experience grows. To see if ideology takes on less importance as experience with (and impacts of) COVID-19 grow, we first tested the interaction between Conservatism and the cumulative Experience/Impact score on perceived threat via simultaneous regression. As a secondary test, to see if this moderating influence of experiential variables might also alter the effect of COVID-specific political beliefs on perceived threat, we performed a Political Beliefs X Experience/Impact regression on perceived threat.\nAnalyses provided partial support for the interaction hypothesis. For the main political\nConservatism measure, the effect of conservatism on perceived coronavirus threat was significantly reduced as COVID experiences/impacts increased (Conservatism X Experience/Impacts interaction beta [980] = .05, p = .002). However, this same effect for the combined Political Beliefs scale showed an effect that was in the same direction, but was much weaker and did not approach statistical significance (Political Beliefs X Experience/Impacts interaction beta [980] = .03, p = .481). These results clearly suggest that the general effect of\n6 This difference among the COVID-19-Specific Political Beliefs measures was further corroborated by some additional data. A subset of participants (n = 243) in Study 3 completed a 4-item questionnaire concerning how much they trusted Trump to lead them through the COVID-19 crisis and a 2-item scale concerning how seriously they believed Trump was taking COVID-19. Neither of these questionnaires concerning how they felt about Trump\u2019s leadership significantly mediated the conservatismperceived COVID-19 threat relationship. Like the informational contamination measure, this suggests \u2013 somewhat surprisingly given media reports \u2013 that conservative apathy does not result from differences between liberals and conservatives in their level of trust in the current government.\nhigher levels of experience with COVID; but the effect of COVID-specific political beliefs on COVID concern is far less impacted by increasing experience with the disease.\nGeneral Discussion\nIf conservatives are more sensitive to physical threats such as disease, why are they less\nconcerned about COVID-19? The present research suggests that it is, for the most part, not because conservatives have different levels of experience with the disease at the time of data collection. Conservatives do report in our data being significantly less impacted by the disease; yet this fact provides very little explanatory power towards understanding why they care less about COVID-19 overall.\nInstead, the present research offers a different explanation \u2013 an explanation that is in line\nwith decades of research on motivated political cognition (e.g., Clark & Winegard, 2020; Conway, Zubrod, & Chan, 2020; Ditto et al., 2019; Honeycutt & Jussim, 2020; Jost et al., 2003). Namely, these three studies suggest that conservatives care less (and that liberals care more) about this pandemic because they have political beliefs that intersect with the COVID-19 pandemic.7 These political beliefs provide motives for both conservatives and liberals to view the pandemic through a lens that would lead them to assign more or less threat to the disease. For conservatives, this means that because they (for example) do not want government restrictions \u2013 and the full acknowledgment of the threat might make those restrictions more psychologically plausible \u2013 they are motivated to downplay the severity of the threat.\n7 Throughout, we have largely framed this as an attempt to understand conservative apathy towards the disease. However, it would be equally true to frame it as an attempt to understand liberal concern with the disease. We could have titled our paper \u201cWhy are liberals more concerned with COVID-19 than conservatives?\u201d and it would have been an equally accurate description. We opted for the present framing because it matches prior discussions of disease threat and ideology more clearly (and thus makes integration with prior research simpler to understand), but we acknowledge that it is the relative difference between liberals and conservatives that matters.\ncurrent situation, but also for building models about ideology and disease."}, {"heading": "A Pandemic Ideology-Experience Model", "text": "Given that epidemics and pandemics are unpredictable occurrences with uncertain and\noften transient time courses, it is hardly surprising that there is a dearth of theorizing on the interface of ideology and perceived pandemic threat. Indeed, as discussed in the introduction, most of that research would expect that conservatives would be more concerned about COVID19. The three studies reported here clearly suggest this approach is too simplistic and in need of modification.\nThe present set of data suggests an initial model of the relationship between disease\noutbreaks and ideology that could be more widely applied (1) beyond the variables collected in our studies, (2) beyond the cultural and geographical boundaries of our studies, and (3) beyond the current outbreak. This model contains two primary aspects. First, drawing from both the present data and work on motivated political cognition (e.g., Clark & Winegard, 2020; Conway, Zubrod, & Chan, 2020; Ditto et al., 2019; Honeycutt & Jussim, 2020; Jost et al., 2003), this model suggests that the ideological match between group-level ideologies and the outcomes of the pandemic will be crucial in determining public responses to a given pandemic. Ideological groups who feel a pandemic will benefit their own ideological ends will be more likely to view it as a threat; ideological groups who feel a pandemic will hurt their own ideological ends will be less likely to view it as a threat. For future researchers, this offers a large arena for discovery \u2013 to the degree that this model is accurate, one of the primary tasks of new research ought to be to more directly parse the variables that contribute to perceived ideological match.8\n8 Ideological motives may or may not lead to biases and inaccuracies. We would expect, of course, that inaccuracies would on average likely grow with increased influences of ideological motives \u2013 some evidence suggests, for\noften moderate key socio-ecological effects (Sng et al., 2018; Van de Vliert, 2013; Van de Vliert & Tol, 2014; Van de Vliert & Conway, 2019), this model suggests that the effect of ideological match on how people view a pandemic will become less pronounced as the direct experiential impact of the pandemic grows. Once people begin to be personally impacted by a disease outbreak in tangible ways \u2013 once they catch the disease, or loved ones catch it, or they begin to lose resources on account of it \u2013 then pre-existing ideological beliefs likely play less of a role in accounting for perceptions of the disease itself.\nAs one possible extension, this model has implications for additional aspects of\nconservative and liberal ideology that we did not test in the present set of studies. For example, conservative ideology is more likely to generally oppose foreign outgroups than liberal ideology (see Jost et al., 2003). This model suggest that such ideological opposition might account for part of conservatives\u2019 current relative apathy. Indeed, when the disease was viewed as something mostly occurring in foreign countries (and specifically in China), polling suggests that conservatives viewed it as a more serious threat. But as the coronavirus reached the United States, conservative rhetoric shifted suggesting that COVID-19 concerns were not warranted (Covucci, 2020; Kristian, 2020). Importantly, the present results and corresponding model not only suggest the current apathy likely emerged in part because a dangerous disease here in the U.S. is less conducive to conservative ideological ends than a dangerous disease over there, but they also suggest that as direct experience with the disease itself grows, this relative effect of ideology will wane.\nexample, that conservatives have more inaccurate views of the danger of COVID-19 than liberals (Cillizza, 2020). However, our data and model do not directly suggest necessary outcome biases, but rather motives which may contribute to such biases.\nLike all studies, the present work is not without limitations. The studies were conducted\nentirely on a U.S. MTurk sample. While MTurk is a valid recruitment mechanism for American samples, it nonetheless does limit the scope to the U.S. Based on research suggesting that the liberal/conservative anchors have less crystallized meanings elsewhere (see, e.g., Federico et al., 2017), we suspect that our results might be weaker in many other parts of the world. Indeed, the model resulting from our research would specifically expect that only the crystallized ideologies within each culture that were relevant to the disease in question in those countries would matter.\nConcluding Thoughts\nA recent Atlantic headline suggests that \u201cRed and blue America aren\u2019t experiencing the\nsame pandemic\u201d (Brownstein, 2020). Our data suggest that is indeed true. But the primary point of divergence is not because of differences in objective experiences; rather, our data suggest it is because conservatives and liberals have ideological beliefs that predispose them to believe that COVID-19 is differentially threatening. But our data also suggest that as more people are impacted by the pandemic directly, these ideological differences in perceived threat will become less prominent. Of course, somewhat ironically, this set of studies suggests that the very measures that conservatives oppose (more government restrictions) might in fact keep them from more direct contact with the disease \u2013 which might in turn serve to reinforce the ideology-apathy relationship. These data thus not only suggest explanations for what is currently happening in the U.S., but provide ideas for future researchers to apply to this and other disease outbreaks.\nAltemeyer, R. A.

Prior work has highlighted that previous epidemics are linked to elevated suicide rates, however, there is no research to date on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States. Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and attempts. Further, we found that a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for increased suicide risk screening and access to mental health services. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services in order to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.\nKeywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, suicide, suicide risk, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt Public Significance: The present study provides evidence that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reaches beyond just physical health, having a negative impact on individuals\u2019 psychological well-being. Our findings suggest an association between a range of COVID-19 experiences and increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Results underscore the need for increased suicide risk screening efforts and access to mental health care.\nAfter being identified first in Wuhan, China during late 2019, COVID-19 (i.e.,\n\u201ccoronavirus\u201d; \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d) saw its first case confirmed in the United States (U.S.) in January 2020. As of April 6, 2020, more than 330,000 positive COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. and over 8,900 deaths have resulted domestically (Center for Disease Control [CDC], 2020a). While staggering, these somber numbers reflect only a portion of the overall impact that COVID-19 has had on U.S. citizens. The COVID-19 pandemic has directly caused psychological distress in many individuals (e.g., Liptak & Colins, 2020), with such effects stemming not only from uncertainty about the future and disruptions to social support networks, but also from significant economic hardships, fears of physical safety, and the experience of illness and death among family and friends. Importantly, many of these factors have been linked to severe psychological distress resulting in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (e.g., Franklin et al., 2017).\nSuicide is a leading cause of death worldwide (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019)\nand is an increasing public health concern (CDC, 2020b). Death by suicide is estimated to occur every 11 minutes in the U.S., with many more people contemplating and/or attempting suicide each day (CDC, 2019), underscoring the need to identify factors that may proliferate suicide risk. Perhaps most relevant under present circumstances are findings from prior empirical work that implicate many of the stressors and psychological consequences of epidemics (e.g., depression, anxiety, physical illness, social disruption) in engendering suicidal thoughts and behaviors (e.g., Franklin et al., 2017). This suggests that there may be a strong link between COVID-19-related experiences and suicidality.\nThe psychological impact of past epidemics, such as polio and severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS), have been well documented, which strongly suggests that COVID-19 will\nhave significant mental health ramifications. Distress experiences have ranged from psychological burden, panic, and despair among those diagnosed (National Health Commission of China, 2020; Wilson, 2008), to poor sleep quality, and feelings of general distress, fear, and depression among uninfected community members (Taylor, Agho, Stevens, & Raphael, 2008; Yu, Ho, So, & Lo, 2005). Given the widespread and devastating nature of COVID-19, we would expect it to have a similarly prolific negative impact on citizens\u2019 psychological well-being. This notion has already been supported by preliminary work in China, which demonstrates significant psychological distress (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety) as a result of COVID-19 among its citizens (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).\nGiven robust evidence of psychological distress attributed to epidemics, it is not\nsurprising that associated increases in suicide rates have been documented. Researchers have shown that in 2003, the year of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, suicide rates sharply increased among the local elderly, in contrast to a previous downward trend (Chan, Chiu, Lam, Leung, & Conwell, 2006). This highlights the indirect, detrimental impacts epidemics can have, often over looked in well-documented death tolls. The extreme nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented and widespread threat and that has forced essential, yet highly disruptive, public health measures, has led to warnings about a possible downstream impact on suicidal thinking (e.g., American Foundation for Suicide Prevention; Marshall, n.d.). Beyond high-level warnings from national organizations, however, speculation about COVID-19-related suicide risk has largely been limited to opinion pieces (i.e., USA Today; Dastagir, 2020) and news stories linking specific deaths by suicide to COVID-19-related experiences (e.g., Panayi, 2020). Despite the likely and logical link between COVID-19 and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, to our knowledge, there has yet to be an empirical investigation of this association.\nPerhaps more importantly, there is no research examining which aspects of the experience of COVID-19 are linked to suicidality, which could provide guidance on the development of targeted large-scale suicide prevention campaigns.\nBeyond the aforementioned general psychological impact of epidemics, there is evidence\nsuggesting that the specific effects of public health measures implemented to contain disease spread (e.g., quarantine) may have a particularly detrimental effect on psychological well-being, potentially extending to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. A recent review of the psychological impact of illness-initiated quarantine (SARS, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS], novel influenza A [H1N1], and equine influenza) indicated that quarantine measures are cross-sectionally and, in some studies, longitudinally associated with negative mental health outcomes such as post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, confusion, anger, anxiety, and fear (Brooks et al., 2020). Notably, no studies in this recent review specifically examined the effect of quarantining measures on suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This is surprising, given the social isolation and disconnection inherent in quarantining measures, and the documented relationship between social disconnection and interpersonal stress and suicide risk (e.g., Joiner, 2005; King & Merchant, 2008). Similarly, there has been no empirical examination of the relationship between COVID-19-related public health measures enacted throughout much of the U.S. (i.e., social distancing, stay-at-home orders,) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Understanding the psychological impact of these orders may have important implications when considering the risks associated with these public health measures.\nWhile deaths and attempted death by suicide typically occur utilizing one of only a few\ncommon methods (in the case of deaths, firearms or suffocation, and, in the case of attempts, less lethal methods such as overdose; e.g., CDC, 2020c; Lim, Lee, & Park, 2014), prior literature\nsuggests there to be a much wider range of nontraditional suicide attempt methods, including the intentional exposure to potentially lethal disease. Indeed, there have been several case studies suggesting that individuals experiencing suicidal ideation may attempt to contract diseases (such as human immunodeficiency viruses [HIV]) as a method of carrying out suicidal behavior (e.g., Frances, Wikstrom, & Alcena, 1985; Papathomopoulos, 1989; Tompkins-Rosenblatt, 1997). Thus, as COVID-19 continues to spread, individuals who are experiencing severe psychological distress resulting in suicidal thinking, may have increased access to a potentially lethal means of suicide (i.e., COVID-19; WHO, n.d.). Such increased access is a well-cited predictor of deaths by suicide (e.g., Marzuk et al., 1992). Thus, there is a need to better understand if, and then to what extent, the experience of intentional self-exposure to COVID-19 is occurring within the U.S., and, moreover, whether intentional exposure is engaged in with suicidal intent. Current Study\nThe current study\u2019s primary aim was to examine the association between COVID-19 and\nrecent suicidal thoughts and behaviors among U.S. community members. More specifically, we aimed to better understand the specific aspects of COVID-19-related experiences that may contribute to suicidality. We hypothesized that COVID-19-related general distress, fear for one\u2019s physical safety, and perceptions of effects of social distancing measures would be associated with recent suicidal ideation and suicide attempt(s). We further hypothesized that a significant proportion of individuals endorsing recent suicidal ideation would directly link their ideation, at least in part, to COVID-19. A secondary, exploratory aim of the present study was to assess the presence of intentional exposure to COVID-19, with the specific goal of evaluating the extent to which intentional exposure is engaged in with suicidal intent. Given the lack of previous research on this topic, we consider these analyses exploratory in nature, and do not offer hypotheses.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically examine the link between\nCOVID-19 and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as to explore intentional COVID-19 exposure. Collectively, this information is important to acquire in order not only to better characterize the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but also to illuminate the potential contribution of suicide deaths to the COVID-19 death toll and the possible role of intentional exposure in disease spread.\nMethods"}, {"heading": "Participants and Procedures", "text": "Participants were recruited from an online community, Amazon Mechanical Turk\n(mTurk). Potential participants on mTurk are able to browse available tasks (i.e., marketing campaigns, focus groups, research studies) and self-select to participate in those that they are interested in based on a brief description. The current study sample was part of a larger online study that recruited a general population through mTurk by advertising a task described as a research study on well-being and social connection. The study was approved by the first-author\u2019s Institutional Review Board for research ethics; data were collected on April 3-4, 2020. To ensure valid and attentive responding, inclusion in the current analysis required: (a) passing an online bot-detection test (i.e., ReCaptcha), (b) passing at least 50% of the 12 included attention check items (i.e., \u201cPlease answer \u20183\u2019 on this item\u201d), (c) passing the time completion attention check (i.e., completing the survey within three standard deviations of the mean completion time), and (d) providing a response on the study\u2019s primary outcomes (i.e., past-month suicidal ideation, past-month suicide attempt). The final sample consisted of 907 participants.\nThe mean age of participants was 36.43 years old (SD = 11.02, Range = 18 - 74).\nOverall, 56.30% of participants (n = 511) identified as a man, 42.60% (n = 387) identified as a\nwoman, .40% (n = 4) identified as transgender or another gender, and .60% (n = 5) preferred not to answer. The majority of the sample identified as White (76.4%, n = 693), followed by African American / Black (12.0%, n = 109), Asian (7.0%, n = 63), more than one race (2.3%, n = 21), American Indian or Alaska Native (.9%, n = 8), or other (.9%, n=8); a subset preferred not to answer (.6%, n = 5). The majority of the sample identified as non-Hispanic/Latinx (83.6%, n = 758), with 14.1% (n = 128) identifying as Hispanic/Latinx and 2.3% (n=21) preferring not to answer. Measures\nSuicidal thoughts and behaviors. The current study utilized two modified, face-valid\nitems from the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (Nock, Holmberg, Photos & Michel, 2007) to assess for presence (yes/no) of past-month active suicidal ideation (i.e., \u201cIn the past month, have you had thoughts of killing yourself?\u201d) and past-month suicide attempt (i.e., \u201cIn the past month, have you attempted to kill yourself?\u201d).\nCOVID 19-related experiences. The following items were developed for use in the\ncurrent study. Exposure to COVID-19 was assessed through one forced-choice (yes/no) item (\u201cHave you or a close loved one tested positive for coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19)?\u201d). Four 7- point Likert scale items were utilized to assess for potential distress and disruption due to COVID-19: \u201cHow much are you concerned about your physical safety due to coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19)?\u201d (1=Not all concerned to 7=Extremely concerned); \u201cTo what extent have you been affected by coronavirus-related social distancing practices / policies (i.e., no gatherings over 10 people; keeping 6ft. distance from others)?\u201d (1=Not at all (my normal social / work routine has not been affected) to 7=Very much so (my normal social / work routine has been strongly affected); \u201cHow much are social distancing practices / policies put into place due to coronavirus\n(i.e., COVID-19) impacting your mental health?\u201d (1=No impact at all to 7=Significant negative impact); and \u201cHow much distress, in general, are you currently experiencing as it relates to coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19)?\u201d (1=Not at all distressed to 7=Extremely distressed). Among those endorsing past-month suicidal ideation, participants were asked, \u201cHow often have your thoughts of suicide / killing yourself been linked to coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19)?\u201d (1=Have not been related, 4=Related approximately half of the time, 7=Related all of the time).\nIntentional COVID-19 exposure. Participants were asked one forced-choice (yes/no)\nquestion regarding intentional COVID-19 exposure, \u201cHave you done anything in order to intentionally (on purpose) increase the chance that you would get coronavirus (i.e., COVID19)?\u201d Participants who reported intentional exposure were asked to rate the extent to which they exposed themselves to COVID-19 for five different reasons, assessing both passive and active forms of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious intents: \u201cWanted a break from life\u201d; \u201cWanted to punish yourself\u201d; \u201cWanted to hurt yourself (without wanting to die)\u201d; \u201cDidn\u2019t want to be alive anymore\u201d; and \u201cWanted to kill yourself.\u201d All items were answered on a 1-5 Likert scale [1=Not at all to 5=Extremely]). Data Analysis\nDemographics (i.e., age, gender, race, ethnicity) were examined in relation to past-month\nsuicidal ideation and suicide attempt(s). For any analyses including gender, due to small sample sizes of other gender identities, only those identifying as a man or woman were included (n = 898). Demographics demonstrating significant group differences were included as covariates in primary analyses. To address the study\u2019s primary aim, four logistic regressions with the outcome of past-month suicidal ideation and four logistic regressions with the outcome of past-month suicide attempt(s) were conducted. Given the significant association between suicidal ideation\nand attempts (Ribeiro et al., 2016), past-month suicidal ideation was included as a covariate in models where past-month suicide attempt(s) was the outcome. To address the study\u2019s exploratory aim, univariate (i.e., chi-square, t-tests) and multivariate (i.e., MANOVA) group difference tests were utilized. Where applicable, effect sizes were reported (i.e., Cramer\u2019s V for chi-square, partial eta squared for MANOVA).\nResults"}, {"heading": "Preliminary analyses", "text": "Of the overall sample, 159 participants (17.5%) reported active suicidal ideation in the\npast month and 44 (4.9%) reported having attempted suicide in the past month. Approximately 40% of the sample (n = 345) reported having ever received help from a mental health professional, with 33.9% of those individuals (n = 115) having seen a professional in the past month. Further, 7.9% (n = 72) reported that they, or a close loved one, had tested positive for COVID-19. With regard to past-month suicidal ideation, there were group differences on age (t (905) = 2.82, p = .005), and ethnicity (x2 (1) = 19.20, p < .001), but not on gender (x2 (1) = 3.05, p = .08) or race (x2 (4) = .91, p = .92). With regard to past-month suicide attempt, there were group differences on age (t (905) = 2.35, p = .02), gender (x2 (1) = 7.83, p = .005) and ethnicity (x2 (1) = 53.48, p < .001), but not race (x2 (4) = 9.01, p = .06). See Table 1 for descriptive information on study variables. Primary analyses\nAim 1. After considering the influence of age and ethnicity, independent regression\nanalyses demonstrated that physical safety concerns and general distress due to COVID-19 were significantly, positively associated with past-month suicidal ideation, whereas daily routine impacts due to COVID-19 social distancing policies was significantly, negatively associated with\npast-month suicidal ideation. Perceptions of the effect of social distancing practices on one\u2019s mental health were not significantly associated with past-month suicidal ideation. See Table 2.\nAfter considering the influence of age, gender, ethnicity, and past-month suicidal\nideation, independent regression analyses demonstrated that all four COVID-19-related experiences were significantly, positively associated with past-month suicide attempt(s). See Table 3.\nAmong those with past-month suicidal ideation, on average, participants reported that\ntheir past-month suicidal thoughts were linked to COVID-19 nearly half of the time (M = 3.27, SD = 2.26, on 1-7 scale). See Table 4 for further descriptive information.\nExploratory Aim. Of the overall sample, 83 (9.2%) individuals reported intentionally\nexposing themselves to COVID-19. Individuals who intentionally exposed themselves to COVID-19 were more likely to report past-month suicidal ideation (x2 (1) = 64.16, p < .001, V = .27) and past-month suicide attempt(s) (x2 (1) = 224.83, p < .001, V = .50). Further, among those with past-month suicidal ideation, those who intentionally exposed themselves to COVID-19 reported a greater link between their past-month suicidal thoughts and COVID-19 (M = 5.68, SD = 1.42) compared to those who did not intentionally expose themselves (M = 2.42, SD = 1.86), t (156) = -10.24, p < .001.\nMultivariate differences between those who have and have not engaged in intentional\nCOVID-19 exposure were demonstrated on COVID-19-related experiences, Wilks\u2019 lambda=.81, F (4,890) = 21.41, p < .001. Univariate statistics demonstrated significant group differences on all four COVID-19-related experiences, such that those reporting having intentionally exposed themselves to COVID-19 exhibited higher scores on all experiences. See Table 5.\nAmong those who reported intentionally exposing themselves to COVID-19, five reasons\nfor exposure were explored1. On average, individuals reporting intentional COVID-19 exposure endorsed moderate agreement with all five assessed reasons. See Table 6.\nDiscussion\nThe present study suggests that the public health ramifications of COVID-19 are far\nbroader than its documented toll on physical health. The primary aim was to investigate the potential association between COVID-19 and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. To this end, findings present initial evidence that COVID-19-related experiences are associated with recent suicidal thoughts and behaviors among community members in the U.S. Further, through exploratory data analyses, we demonstrate that intentional exposure to COVID-19 is surprisingly common in our sample and, moreover, that some individuals may be enacting suicidal behavior through intentional exposure to COVID-19.\nFindings from the current study highlight that several COVID-19-related experiences\nmay contribute to past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Indeed, results highlight that the specific experiences of general distress and physical safety concerns due to COVID-19 may positively contribute to suicidal ideation. However, the overall pattern of findings suggests that the impact of COVID-19-related experiences may be more strongly linked with suicide attempts than suicidal ideation. Indeed, all four of the assessed COVID-19-related experiences contributed to past-month suicide attempt(s) and these associations were larger in magnitude with suicide attempts than suicidal ideation. We observed particularly strong associations between general distress and concerns about physical safety due to COVID-19 and past month suicide attempt, which supports prior work highlighting acute increases in distress and anxiety as risk factors for suicidal behavior (Kerkhof & van Spijker, 2011). Perhaps of greater concern are findings that\nincreased perceived impact of social distancing public health policies (both on social/work routines and on mental health) are associated with past-month suicide attempt. While in line with evidence suggesting that quarantining measures have an adverse impact on mental health (Brooks et al., 2020), this finding is worrying, given that social distancing is a less drastic, but currently highly prevalent, COVID-19 prevention strategy. Numerous theories of suicide and a robust body of evidence collectively indicate that reduced social connection is a risk factor for suicidal behavior (e.g., Interpersonal Theory of Suicide; Joiner, 2005). Thus, it is possible that the acute distress and anxiety due to COVID-19, combined with the social routine disruption and social disconnection of distancing policies, may result in a pernicious blend of risk factors for suicidal behavior. Given the relevance of these findings when weighing the costs and benefits of extending the current and/or implementing future (Ferguson et al., 2020) social distancing policies, it will be important for researchers to replicate and expand upon our results.\nFindings also provide direct evidence of the association between COVID-19 and suicidal\nthoughts and behaviors. Upwards of 45% of community members endorsing past-month suicidal thoughts reported their thoughts were explicitly linked to COVID-19 at least half of the time and approximately 65% reported this to be the case at least some of the time. Future research is needed to explore this link further to aid in our understanding of how and for whom the COVID19 pandemic is influencing suicide risk. For example, it will be important to examine the extent to which COVID-19 and its effects play a role in exacerbating existing suicidal thinking and in initiating the onset of suicidal thinking. Prospective research, such as ongoing studies that have assessed suicidal thoughts and behavior prior to the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and then again during the pandemic, should investigate these important questions directly.\nA surprising proportion of individuals - 9% of our sample - reported intentionally\nexposing themselves to COVID-19. Our results suggest that many of these individuals carried out exposure as a means of enacting suicidal behavior: approximately 50% who intentionally exposed themselves indicated their reason for doing so was strongly-to-extremely due to wanting to kill themselves. Further supporting the link between intentional COVID-19 exposure and suicidality, results demonstrated a moderate to strong association between intentional exposure and past-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempt(s), and between intentional exposure and explicitly associating suicidal ideation with COVID-19 concerns. The finding that intentional exposure to COVID-19 may be used as a nontraditional suicide method aligns with numerous case reports of individuals exposing themselves to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV) as a means to enact suicidal behavior (e.g., Frances, Wikstrom, & Alcena, 1985; Papathomopoulos, 1989; Tompkins-Rosenblatt, 1997). However, to our knowledge, the current findings are the first to empirically examine this potential suicide method as it applies to COVID-19.\nThe evident phenomenon of people engaging in intentional COVID-19 exposure during\nthe initial stages of the pandemic has significant public health implications. First, the ongoing spread of COVID-19 provides increasing access to a potentially lethal means for suicide. Prior research indicates that access to means is associated with death by suicide (Marzuk et al., 1992), suggesting that as access to the virus increases through its own proliferation, intentional deaths due to COVID-19 may also increase. However, this will be difficult to track. Deaths resulting from intentional COVID-19 exposure are unlikely to be (accurately) documented as a suicide by medical examiners, skewing our understanding of suicides linked to COVID-19 exposure. The repercussions of likely mischaracterization are twofold. It is plausible that this may increase the attraction to this method of suicide, given the heightened stigma associated with suicide versus\nother causes of death (e.g., Pitman, Osborn, Rantell, & King, 2016). Second, this finding is relevant to the primary public health goal of virus mitigation via inhibiting the spread of the disease. COVID-19 is highly contagious (WHO, 2020), suggesting that essentially any degree of intentional exposure, no matter how limited, could have a meaningful impact on virus spread. Strengths and Limitations The present study\u2019s findings must be interpreted with consideration of design limitations. First, this study is cross-sectional and, as a result, none of the associations presented should be interpreted as causal. Our findings therefore do not demonstrate that the reported effects of COVID-19 preceded or caused suicidal ideation or behaviors reported in this sample. Future longitudinal research is necessary to draw conclusions about the temporal relationship between COVID-19-related distress and suicidality. Second, we employed mTurk in order to recruit a large adult community sample in a short period of time, with the goal of quickly disseminating research that is relevant to the current public health crisis. While there are notable concerns regarding mTurk samples (e.g., generalizability, valid responding), there is research to suggest that mTurk participants are reliable and attentive (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Hauser & Schwarz, 2016), and may be more socioeconomically and racially diverse than other convenience samples (e.g., samples collected via other internet sources, university student samples; Behrend, Sharek, Meade, & Wiebe, 2011; Casler, Bickel, & Hackett, 2013). Moreover, the goal of the present study was not to produce results that can generalize to the U.S. but rather was to provide preliminary evidence of the impacts of COVID-19 on suicidality. However, it will be important for future research to replicate the current findings in a larger sample and consider the impact of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. Third, the majority of the measures employed were developed for the purpose of this study and thus are not\npsychometrically validated. Fourth, our data were limited in scope. They do not permit examination of the role of virus symptoms in suicidal thinking or behavior; we would expect the virus to affect people very differently and, moreover, that psychological distress would increase as virus symptom severity increases. Relatedly, although we assessed and adjusted for the effect of age (an important correlate of COVID-19 mortality; CDC, 2020d) on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, we did not evaluate the presence of comorbid physical conditions, another central mortality correlate (CDC, 2020d), or other relevant COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., resultant financial hardship). Fifth, although we assessed several other reasons for intentional COVID-19 exposure (e.g., nonsuicidal self-injury, self-punishment), we did not assess all potential reasons. Understanding the full range of motivations for such exposure may be important in order to mitigate this form of disease spread. For example, individuals may be motivated to \"get the illness over with\", particularly if they are not in a vulnerable population, with a perceived lower chance of virus-induced mortality. Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, this study has numerous strengths, the most central of which is being the first study, to our knowledge, to assess the association between COVID-19 and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and to evaluate the presence and correlates of intentional exposure to this infectious virus. Clinical Implications\nThe current study underscores a significant need to increase suicide risk screening efforts,\nas it is essential to identify those at risk to implement interventions. Consistent with current recommendations, mental health clinicians and general health workers alike should strongly consider screening all patients for suicide risk. However, it may be important to introduce a more systematic screening process. While widespread screening may be difficult to carry out due to\nsocial distancing and stay-at-home policies, one potential opportunity to facilitate large-scale risk identification is to integrate suicide risk screenings into the protocol at COVID-19 testing sites. With millions of Americans likely to be tested over the coming months, a one or two question screener that would result in a follow-up phone call to facilitate care connection, if suicide risk is indicated, may allow a significant number of individuals to be reached, with a limited resource expenditure. Regardless of screening modality, our findings suggest that in addition to directly assessing imminent suicide risk, it might be important to assess thoughts about engaging in intentional exposure to COVID-19. It is possible that detecting those at risk for this method of suicidal behavior and encouraging treatment could not only reduce suicide risk but also may prevent virus spread.\nBeyond increasing screening efforts, the present study suggests a need to increase access\nto intervention for those experiencing psychological distress related to COVID-19. Currently, although mental health resources such as coping tips and self-help skills are being widely offered online (i.e., Suicide Prevention Lifeline; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention), such resources may not be adequate to help individuals who are already in crisis. Evidencing this, there has been a spike in call volumes to crisis hotlines (National Public Radio, 2020). However, this also highlights the potential of long wait times for those seeking help (Public Broadcasting Service, 2018). Thus, there is a need for alternative, creative approaches as many traditional professional help services have suspended in-person activities and transitioned to fully remote phone or online video session formats to reduce COVID-19 spread. Other states may consider adopting initiatives similar to those of New York State, which has demonstrated initial success in offering free online services for those who need it by way of psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers volunteering their time (Carlisle, 2020).\nThere is a complementary need for nationwide campaigns that highlight the profound\nimpact of epidemics on mental health and that advertise the expansion of remotely accessible crisis services. Foremost, it is likely that national public health campaigns regarding suicide risk in the context of COVID-19 would be useful. As national suicide prevention programs have been effective more broadly (Lewitzka, Sauer, Bauer, & Felber, 2019), raising public awareness during particularly trying times may be pertinent, as suggested by the current findings and as relevant under current circumstances. Moreover, it seems that there would be a benefit to increasing awareness regarding the potentially negative mental health impacts of social distancing measures as a way to increase support and decrease isolation, which may in turn protect against suicide risk.\nFirearms, one of the most common and also most lethal suicide method (Shenassa, Catlin,\n& Buka, 2003), have been sold at record rates in the U.S. since the inception of this pandemic (Federal Bureau of Investigations, 2020). It will therefore be essential for public mental health campaigns to additionally provide psychoeducation about the increased suicide risk among those with access to firearms, as well as how to mitigate this risk. There have been recent calls for widespread \u201cmeans safety\u201d efforts, which would promote the safe storage of firearms (and other suicide means), in general, but particularly in times of known heightened public distress (Anestis & Bond, 2020).\nConcerns about the continued spread of COVID-19 remain unabated and,\nconsequentially, public health officials will consider the continuation of social distancing policies (Ferguson et al., 2020). While these practices remain necessary for curtailing the physical ramifications of COVID-19, our findings underscore the significant public health need to consider citizens\u2019 mental health alongside the physical, given how individuals\u2019 psychological\nwell-being may have direct impacts on the spread of COVID-19 and deaths associated with the virus."}, {"heading": "Footnotes:", "text": "1 Correlations between all reasons for intentional COVID-19 exposure were significantly correlated (r's = .53-.68, p's <.001).

We focused on two groups of possible antecedents. The first group are feelings of worry and anxiety that accompany the perception of the situation. The second group encompasses knowledge about the situation but also unfounded beliefs that frequently thrive in crises and, thus, possibly drive irresponsible behaviors. Finally, we also tested a \u201cone-shot\u201d intervention aimed at improving formation of beliefs related to C-19 crisis.\nThere are several strains of evidence showing that feelings of worry and anxiety can have\na positive effect on health behavior. First, both worry and anxiety are generally related to responsible and protective health behavior. Recent reviews show that worry predicts adaptive preparation and planning, uptake of health-promoting behaviors and seeking information in response to stressful events (Sweeny & Dooley, 2017), but also increased uptake of tests to detect presence or risk of various cancers, intentions to obtain a Lyme disease vaccine or engage in safe sex behavior (McCaul & Mullens, 2003). Second strain of evidence comes from the studies showing a positive relationship between worry and anxiety with risk aversion (see Hartley & Phelps, 2012 for an overview). A final piece of evidence that anxiety and worry could be related with responsible behavior is related to the studies showing greater trust in authorities following a fear evoking events (Burke, Kosloff & Landau, 2013). In sum, given its relationship with responsible and protective behavior, risk-avoidance and trust in authorities, we expect to find a positive association between worry and responsible C-19 related behavior, and believe that greater worry about the situation partially stems from the personality trait of anxiety (Spielberger, 2010).\nThe research also show that a period of crisis and high uncertainty is especially fruitful for\nthe emergence of conspiracy theories (Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017, 2018). In the times when\npeople feel vulnerable, scared and helpless, conspiracy theories are attractive because they help to make sense of the situation by providing the answers about the emergence of the crisis and actors behind it (Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). Thus, it is no wonder that misinformation related to C19 disease proliferated in such a degree to deserve its own Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_related_to_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus _pandemic).\nThe conspiracy theories can seem absurd, but they present a danger if many people start\nbelieving in them and acting accordingly. One of the characteristics of conspiracy beliefs is that they are consequential: they impact behavior in important domains of life such as health, interpersonal relationships or safety (Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018). If a person believes that coronavirus is a hoax, (s)he is more likely to behave irresponsibly and spread the virus.\nIt seems that conspiracy beliefs are underpinned by a stable characteristic called conspiracy\nmentality (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014) that explains why same people hold conspiracy and other unfounded beliefs across various domains (St\u00e5hl & Van Prooijen, 2018; Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018). So, the traits that were shown to underpin other unfounded beliefs could also lead to C-19 conspiracy beliefs. In our research we focused on cognitive reflection, faith in intuition, actively open-minded thinking and science curiosity.\nCognitive reflection (CR) refers to ability and/or disposition to engage in reflective\nthinking instead of relying on intuition and reporting a first response that comes to mind (Frederick, 2005; Pennycook, Cheyne, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2016). Multiple findings consistently showed that it is a robust negative predictor of unfounded beliefs. Namely, CR was predictive of lower endorsement of paranormal, superstitious, pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs (Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2012; Pennycook, Cheyne, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2019;\nPennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015; St\u00e5hl & Van Prooijen, 2018; \u0160rol, 2020) and higher endorsement of scientifically founded beliefs (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2019; Pennycook et al., 2019). Recently, Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang and Rand, (2020) found that these findings also extend to beliefs about C-19. Specifically, in their study CR was negatively related with belief in misinformation about C-19, but also to the concern about the disease and proactively checking the news about it.\nParticularly important for the formation of evidence-based beliefs is openness to new\ninformation and evidence that counteract current beliefs, leading to willingness to revise beliefs if new evidence deems it necessary. This disposition is called actively open-minded thinking (AOT; Baron, 2019; Baron, Scott, Fincher & Metz, 2015). Svedholm-H\u00e4kkinen and Lindeman (2018) provide an overview of studies showing that AOT is a basis of rational thought. AOT generally predicts lower endorsement of unfounded beliefs such as paranormal, conspiracy, supernatural, theistic and anti-science beliefs (Svedholm-H\u00e4kkinen & Lindeman, 2018; Swami, Voracek, Stieger, Tran, & Furnham, 2014; Pennycook et al., 2019), but higher endorsement of pro-science claims (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2019). Similarly to AOT, science curiosity (SC), a disposition to seek out and consume scientific information for personal pleasure, was shown to promote openminded engagement with evidence even when this evidence is contrary to individual\u2019s predispositions (Kahan, Landrum, Carpenter, Helft, & Hall Jamieson, 2017).\nConversely, a disposition to trust one\u2019s initial hunches (i.e., faith in intuition, FI) has been\nshown to predict higher endorsement of unfounded beliefs. FI was positively correlated with different conspiracy beliefs (Swami et al., 2014) as well as other unfounded beliefs such as paranormal beliefs (Aarnio & Lindeman, 2005) and superstitious thinking (Erceg, Gali\u0107, & Bubi\u0107,\n2019; Sadler-Smith, 2011). In sum, we expected CRT, AOT and SC to be negatively, and FI to be positively related to C-19 related unfounded beliefs and, in turn, irresponsible behavior.\nEarlier studies showed that AOT is a thinking style that can be practiced and learned\n(Baron, G\u00fcr\u00e7ay & Metz, 2017). Thus, the goal of many debiasing techniques is to provoke actively open-minded thinking. One specific debiasing technique that has been shown to improve the quality of decisions is so called \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d that nudges a decision-maker into generating rival points of view or imagining counterfactual outcomes for an event (Lilienfeld, Ammirati, & Landfield, 2009, Morewedge, Yoon, Scopelliti, Symborski, Korris, & Kassam, 2015). In line with this, a second goal of our study was to see whether the one-shot intervention based on the \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d debiasing technique could nudge people to revise their C-19 related beliefs.\nMethodology"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We used a convenience sample of 1439 participants, of which 996 (69.2%) reached the end\nof the questionnaire and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics. Of these participants, 74.1% were females and their average age was 34.8 years (SD = 10.67, min = 15, max = 74). Most of the participants had college or university degree (79.8%) while 20.1% had a high school diploma.\nAll 1439 participants completed the items that asked about unfounded beliefs regarding C-\n19, given that they were at the beginning of the questionnaire. Therefore, we tested the effect of \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d intervention on the full sample in order to increase statistical strength. We\nconducted the rest of the analyses on participants that had data on all the used variables, and we report sample sizes for each analysis in tables in the Result section."}, {"heading": "Instruments", "text": "We report all the items we used in the supplemental online materials available at\nhttps://osf.io/9ht5k/ and omega coefficients of reliability (Raykov, 2001) for the focal latent variables in Table 1.\nCOVID-19 responsible behavior. We used four items that asked participants to estimate\nhow often, in the last 10 days, they performed each of the four desired behaviors regarding C-19: avoiding physical contact, washing hands, avoiding going out and coughing and sneezing in elbow. We used a five-point scale where 1 = never and 5 = all the time.\nCOVID-19 related worry. We measured worry with one item that asked participants to\nassess the degree of their worry for themselves and their family on a scale from 1 = not worried at all to 7 = extremely worried.\nUnfounded beliefs about COVID-19. We captured two types of unfounded beliefs.\nBeliefs about conspiracies regarding coronavirus (8 items, e.g. \u201cThe coronavirus was created to reduce the world population\u201d) and beliefs about possible treatments of C-19 that are not scientifically backed up (6 items, e.g. \u201cColloidal silver is a potentially good cure for this coronavirus strain.\u201d). For both sets of items participants reported on their agreement on a six-point scale (1 = completely disagree; 6 = completely agree).\nGiven that we were interested in the relationships with unfounded beliefs about C-19 in\ngeneral, we specified a measurement model in which conspiracy regarding coronavirus and beliefs about possible treatments latent factors loaded on a higher order unfounded beliefs factor. The\nmodel had an acceptable fit to the data (\u03c72 (76) = 982.08, p < .001; CFI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.09, 90% CI[0.09, 0.10], AIC = 55851.329) and the first order factors had high standardized loadings with the second order unfounded beliefs factor (0.58 for conspiracy factor and 0.87 for treatment factor). Therefore, we used the higher order unfounded beliefs factor in our analyses.\nKnowledge about COVID-19. We measured knowledge using six objective knowledge\nC-19 questions (e.g. \u201cCoronavirus mortality is higher among the elderly population\u201d) where participants responded with yes/no answer. Each correct response was awarded one point and the total score was a mean of correct responses on six questions.\nTrait anxiety. We measured trait anxiety with four items from Johnson (2014). Example\nitem is \u201cI get stressed out easily\u201d. Participants estimated the degree to which each of the emotions described in the item applies to themselves in general, using a seven-point scale (1 = it does not apply to me at all; 7 = it completely applies to me).\nCognitive reflection. We measured CR with three Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) items\ntaken from currently existing versions of the CRT (Erceg, Gali\u0107 & Ru\u017eoj\u010di\u0107, 2020) which we revised so that their content appears to be related to C-19. We coded each of the responses as correct/incorrect and the total score was a mean of correct responses on the three items.\nActively open-minded thinking. We measured AOT with ten items from Baron (2019).\nExample item is \u201cPeople should revise their conclusions in response to relevant new information\u201d. Participants assessed their agreement with items on a five-point scale (1 = completely disagree; 5 = completely agree). Due to two items being practically unrelated to others (number 3 and 9 in the supplemental online material), we discarded them from the analyses and proceeded with eight-item version.\nFaith in intuition. We measured FI with a five-item scale (Norris, Pacini, & Epstein,\n1998). Example item is \u201cMy initial impressions of people are almost always right\u201d. The participants assessed how well each of the items describes themselves on a five-point scale (1 =not at all; 5 = very much).\nScience curiosity. We measured SC with five items taken from Kahan et al. (2017). We\nasked participants to estimate how closely they follow science related news, read science related books, talk about science related topics, share science related posts on social networks and generally how interested they are in science. We also included filler items related to other topics such as politics, sports and entertainment to make appear that a questionnaire is about general participants\u2019 interests and not only those related to science."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "We collected our sample between 21st and 29th March 2020 through an on-line survey. We\nshared a link to the survey questionnaire on our department\u2019s Facebook page and on our personal pages on different social networks. We also posted the link in three Facebook groups concerning coronavirus news and sent the link privately to our friends and colleagues.\nAll participants answered the same set of questions, but the introduction to the\nquestionnaire differed randomly among participants. For approximately half (680, 47.3%) of the sample the introduction included \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d debiasing message. The debiasing message informed participants that psychological research indicate that people make more accurate conclusions if they don\u2019t make their judgement quickly but rather try to find the opposing arguments to their current beliefs before reaching final conclusion."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The database we used as well as R-code for all the analyses are available at\nhttps://osf.io/9ht5k/.\nTest of the consider the opposite intervention\nPrior to testing the prediction of C-19 responsible behavior, we tested if our one-shot\nintervention based on the \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d technique reduced unfounded beliefs of our participants. We compared latent means of unfounded belief higher order latent factor of the group that was exposed vs the group that was not exposed to the intervention. In both models we first equalized the loadings and the intercepts across the two groups, which is a precondition for the test of latent mean differences (Putnick & Bornstein, 2016). Compared to the model in which loadings and intercepts were constrained but latent means differed among groups (\u03c72 (175) = 1115.63, p < .001; CFI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.09, 90% CI[0.08, 0.09], AIC = 55894.21), the \u201cconstrained latent means model\u201d did not fit worse to the data (\u03c72 (178) = 1116.18, p < .001; CFI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.09, 90% CI[0.08, 0.09], AIC = 55888.76; \u0394\u03c72 (3) = 0.55, p = 0.908). This meant that the \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d intervention did not affect unfounded beliefs of our participants. Accordingly, we conducted the rest of our analyses only on full sample which included both participants that were exposed and not exposed to the intervention.\nDescriptive statistics and correlation analyses\nDescriptive statistics and omega coefficients of reliability (Raykov, 2001) for the focal\nlatent variables are shown in Table 1. Intercorrelations among variables are shown in Table 2. We show both correlations among total scale scores, calculated as mean of scores on the items, and correlations among latent factor scores, calculated through an unrestricted structural equation\nmodel estimated through maximum likelihood (ML) procedure. Given that we tested our hypotheses through SEM using latent factor scores and because these scores are free from measurement error, we comment only on the correlations among latent factors.\nAs can be seen, trait anxiety correlated with more worry on C-19 and higher amount of\nresponsible C-19 behavior. Also, anxiety had a small negative correlation with C-19-related knowledge.\nCR and thinking dispositions correlated in expected direction with C-19-related unfounded\nbeliefs and knowledge. CR, AOT and SC were related with less unfounded beliefs and better knowledge on C-19, while FI related with more unfounded beliefs and worse knowledge on C-19. As for the behavior, only AOT and SC showed significant relation with more responsible behavior regarding C-19 threat.\nFinally, C-19 worry was related with more responsible behavior, while unfounded beliefs\nrelated with less responsible behavior regarding C-19. Knowledge on C-19 was not related to C19 behavior.\nNotes. AOT = Active Open-minded Thinking; CI = Confidence Interval.\nNotes. AOT = Active Open-minded Thinking; *p < .01, **p < .001\n14\nThe predictors of COVID-19 responsible behavior\nTo test the prediction of responsible behavior regarding C-19 threat, we estimated a\nstructural equation model using ML estimator and confidence intervals (CI) of parameter estimates calculated through 5000 bootstrap samples. We deemed the effect significant if the 95% bootstraped CI did not include zero. In the model, individual differences: anxiety, CR, AOT, FI and SC, served as predictors of C-19-related worry, unfounded beliefs, knowledge and responsible behavior, whereas C-19-related worry, unfounded beliefs and knowledge served as mediators of the effects of individual differences on the C-19 responsible behavior. We note that C-19 related worry was measured with one item and it is therefore included in the model as observed variable. Knowledge on C-19 was measured with six loosely related items about various aspects of coronavirus and C-19 so we believed it was more appropriate to include it as an index calculated as mean of correct responses on the six questions rather than a latent variable. Rest of the variables in the regression portion of the model were latent. We calculated indirect effects by multiplying the effect of a predictor on a mediator with the effect of a mediator on the criterion while controlling for the effect of the predictor on the criterion. Finally, we controlled for the effects of several variables we believed to be important for reaction to C-19 threat, namely: age, education level, political values (liberal vs conservative) and whether participants studied or worked in psychology, medicine or pharmacology, thus possessing relevant knowledge. The tested model showed an appropriate fit to the data (\u03c72 (1162) = 3001.04, p < .001; CFI = 0.86; RMSEA = 0.04, 90% CI[0.04, 0.04], AIC = 97743.34). We show the structural/regression portion of the model with only significant parameter estimates in Figure 1, while all regression estimates are shown in the supplemental online materials (https://osf.io/9ht5k/).\n15\nIn total, we explained 16.9% variance of C-19-related worry. As for the \u201cemotional part\u201d\nof our model, trait anxiety predicted how concerned are the participants about the situation and that variable predicted C-19 responsible behavior. Neither of the \u201ccognitive\u201d variables was related to COVID-related worry. The indirect effect of anxiety on more responsible behavior via worry was significant (0.069, 95% CI [0.044, 0.102]), indicating that the effect of trait anxiety on responsible behavior regarding C-19 was fully mediated through C-19-related worry.\nWe explained 39% of variance of C-19-related unfounded beliefs. The beliefs were\nnegatively predicted by CR and AOT and positively predicted by FI, while the relationships of SC and anxiety with the unfounded beliefs were non-significant. Unfounded beliefs significantly predicted less responsible behavior and the effects of CR (0.132, 95% CI [0.029, 0.297]), AOT (0.071, 95% CI [0.013, 0.196]) and FI (-0.036, 95% CI [-0.085, -0.008]) on behavior were all fully mediated by unfounded beliefs. This suggested that individuals who are less reflective, less openminded and show more faith in intuition engage in less responsible C-19-related behavior due to the amount of unfounded beliefs they had about C-19.\nThe predictors from our model explained 14% of variance of C-19 related knowledge.\nSignificant predictors were CR (positive) and FI and trait anxiety (both negative). Knowledge about C-19 did not predict C-19 related responsible behavior.\nFinally, once the other predictors in the model were controlled for, among individual\ndifference variables only SC remained a direct predictor of responsible behavior. In total, with our model we explained 31.7% of variance in C-19 responsible behavior.\n16"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Our main finding was that C-19 responsible behavior follows both from emotions and\ncognitions about C-19 situation. Our correlation and SEM analyses showed that greater worry and weaker endorsement of C-19 unfounded beliefs lead to more responsible C-19 behavior. At the same time, knowledge of the most important facts about C-19 situation showed non-significant\n17\nrelationship to C-19 behavior, though it correlated moderately positively with CR and moderately negatively with C-19 unfounded beliefs.\nWe confirmed our expectation that trait anxiety would be a significant predictor of\nperceived threat related to the situation, and, in turn, lead to responsible C-19 behavior. In other words, dispositionally anxious individuals reacted to the current situation with more fear and worry and adhered to the recommendations about how to behave. Anxiety and worry had, as Sweeny and Dooley (2017) put it, an upside of making people behave in a more responsible way.\nThe unfounded beliefs had a significant negative effect on C-19 responsible behavior:\nindividuals that believe in conspiracy and unscientific claims about C-19 behave less responsibly, supporting the idea of consequentiality of unfounded beliefs (Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018). Almost all explored psychological determinants were significant predictors of unfounded beliefs in the expected direction. CR and AOT predicted less and FI more endorsement of unfounded beliefs. Stated simply, less smart/rational individuals (CR), that are reluctant to seek contrary evidence before making judgment (AOT) and trust their \u201cgut feelings\u201d (FI) more frequently endorsed unfounded C-19 beliefs. The three traits indirectly influenced behavior through the unfounded beliefs.\nWhile supporting consequentiality of unfounded beliefs, our data somewhat surprisingly\nrevealed non-significant relationship between C-19 knowledge and responsible C-19 behavior. On the one hand, the result is surprising because one would expect that people who know more about the disease and its perils would be more careful in their behavior. On the other hand, the result is not so surprising given the extant literature on the \u201cknowledge-behavior gap\u201d showing that the\n18\nrelationship between knowledge and behavior is generally very small or moderate at best (Rimal, 2000). Still, the question is why the beliefs are and the knowledge is not important determinant of C-19 behavior? The finding probably has to do with the difference in conceptual proximity between the pairs of constructs. The beliefs are closer to the behavior than the knowledge in several ways. First, if one thinks that the whole C-19 narrative is a hoax or that the disease can be easily cured, one will be less motivated to behave in responsible ways. Second, if one has incorrect beliefs about the origin of the virus and ways of treating the disease, one will probably also have incorrect beliefs about the behavior. Finally, if one questions the official COVID-19 facts, one will also question official behavior recommendations. At the same time, the knowledge items dealt with broad concepts while behaviors were quite specific, and judging factual items to be true or false had less clear implications for the behavior (Ajzen, Joyce, Sheikh and Cote, 2011).\nContrary to our prediction, SC did not predict endorsement of C-19 unfounded beliefs but\nhad a substantial direct effect on responsible behavior. We can only speculate on the reasons here. SC might exhibit its influence on behavior not thorough its effect on unfounded beliefs but on some other variable that we did not capture with our model (e.g., trust in scientists).\nIn our study we failed to support efficacy of the \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d technique on C-"}, {"heading": "19 unfounded beliefs. Regardless of whether they were exposed to \u201cconsider-the-opposite\u201d", "text": "intervention or not, participants showed same levels of endorsement of C-19 related unfounded beliefs. We attribute this finding to the fact that our participants probably held a deeply developed beliefs about coronavirus/C-19 issues because they have been by far the most salient topics discussed in public sphere including news media, social networks and informal social contacts for\n19\nweeks. Possibly people already came with firmly formed opinions and our simple intervention could do a little to change their cognitions.\nStill, we believe that this does not mean that interventions aimed at inducing more AOT-\nlike way of thinking are useless in this situation. We partly derive this conclusion from our own data. In our model, AOT was a substantial predictor of lesser endorsement of C-19 unfounded beliefs and had significant indirect influence on responsible behavior. Therefore, it seems that teaching AOT way of thinking could be beneficial, although these educational efforts should probably be more long-term oriented than a \u201cone-shot\u201d intervention (Baron, G\u00fcr\u00e7ay and Metz, 2017).\nOur findings are qualified by three limitations: we used one-point cross-sectional study,\nseveral of our measures were developed ad hoc for this study and our sample consisted mostly of well-educated participants. While the last two could probably resulted in the underestimated effect than those using perfected measures of various aspects of C-19 crisis and collected on the more educationally diverse samples, the first one seems to be the most problematic. Due to our study design we cannot be in any way certain about the causal order among the constructs in our research model. Still, we believe that because of the urging need to confront the public health crisis, even this imperfect attempt could be informative to the interested audience."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Responsible C-19 behaviors follow from both perceived psychological threat related to\ncorona virus and a more rational grasp of the current situation. Irresponsible behavior seems to be grounded in unfounded beliefs, and independent of the basic knowledge about the situation. In\n20\norder to ensure adherence to guidance, responsible institutions should stress the perils of the situation and try to publicly scrutinize the most frequent unfounded beliefs about the corona virus and its effects. If the current situation persists in the medium term as expected (i.e., until the vaccine is found), psychologists could also encourage actively open-minded thinking in order to improve beliefs, judgments and behaviors related to the C-19 crisis.\n21"}, {"heading": "Erceg, N., Gali\u0107, Z., & Bubi\u0107, A.

The current work investigated the emotional and behavioral reactions people experience in response to COVID-19 through their internet searches. We hypothesized that when the prevalence rates of COVID-19 increase, people would experience more fear, which in turn would predict greater rates of protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying. Methods: Prevalence rates of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, were used as predictors. Fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying were indicated by internet search volumes in Google Trends. Cross-temporal analyses were conducted. Results: We found that increased prevalence rates of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. This pattern was consistent across four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Fear-related emotions explained the associations between COVID-19 and the content of their information searches. Conclusion: Findings suggest that exposure to prevalence rates of COVID-19 and fear-related emotions may motivate people to search for relevant health-related information so as to protect themselves from the pandemic. Keywords: COVID-19, intention, protective behavior, health knowledge, panic buying, fear\nSince the coronavirus outbreak in January 2020, COVID-19 has infected around two\nmillion people and led to more than 119,700 deaths (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020). The World Health Organization has announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. It has exerted a profound impact on people\u2019s lives and livelihoods around the world (World Health Organization, 2020c). With huge increases in COVID-19 infections, there is a need to understand how people cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet searches provide a window to answer this question.\nThe internet has become an essential channel for people to seek health-related\ninformation (Kalichman et al., 2003; Reeves, 2001). For example, in the United States, about six-in-ten Americans turn to the internet for health information by using search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo (Pew Research Center, 2013). Internet searches have intensified during the coronavirus outbreak. On March 11, 2020, there were nearly 20 million mentions of coronavirus-related terms, compared with 4 million mentions of Trump and under 2 million mentions of newly canceled NBA games on that day (Molla, 2020). Therefore, huge amounts of coronavirus-related internet searches make it possible to understand how people think of, feel about, and behave as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrevious research has shown that when people are threatened by a disease such as\ncoronavirus, they experience fear-related emotions which could then lead them to adopt protective behaviors, seek more health-related knowledge, and sometimes engage in maladaptive behaviors (Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1997; Ruiter, Kessels, Peters, & Kok, 2014; Witte, Meyer, & Martell, 2001). In this article, we suggest that COVID-19, as an imminent and ongoing threat to human beings all over the world, may elicit emotional and behavioral reactions online. We predicted that increasing cases of COVID-19 may be associated with more internet searches associated with fear-related emotions, protective\nhypothesized that searches related to fear-related emotions would explain associations of cases of COVID-19 with searches on protective behaviors, health knowledge, and maladaptive behaviors. This prediction is consistent with fear appeal theories, which posit that threat of a disease elicits fear, which in turn motivates people to initiate behavioral changes and improve health knowledge (Floyd, Prentice Dunn, & Rogers, 2000; Kok,\nBartholomew, Parcel, Gottlieb, & Fern ndez, 2014; Ling, Kothe, & Mullan, 2019; Rogers &\nPrentice-Dunn, 1997). There are several reasons which justify our theoretical model (COVID-19 prevalence \u00e0 fear \u00e0 health-related knowledge and behavioral outcomes) we posited.\nFirst, in terms of protective behaviors and health knowledge, people may have\nintentions to adopt behaviors and gain knowledge about COVID-19 based on health advice from official authorities, such as the World Health Organization. The World Health Organization, as well as governments of many countries, has suggested adopting several protective behaviors, including washing hands, social distancing, quarantining, and wearing masks when necessary (World Health Organization, 2020b). Moreover, people may be keen to know health-related knowledge about vaccines and immunity which can enhance their self-efficacy to fight against COVID-19. When the prevalence rate is increasing, people may search for protective behaviors and health knowledge more often.\nSecond, facing uncertainty caused by COVID-19 (e.g., city lockdown), people can\nalso demonstrate maladaptive behaviors to protect themselves. During periods of disasters in human history such as pandemics, public panic is not uncommon. People are worried about survival so they can sometimes act blindly and excessively (Clarke, 2002). A typical excessive behavior in response to COVID-19 is panic buying (Van Bavel et al., 2020). Due to worries about the lack of daily necessities, people might irrationally stockpile things, such as\nrecent media (e.g., Lufkin, 2020). However, it remains unclear what might account for this panic buying. We predicted that when the prevalence rate is increasing, people may also engage in information searches related to panic buying more often.\nThird, perceptions of a pandemic threat can lead to negative emotional reactions, such\nas fear-related emotions (Van Bavel et al., 2020). During a pandemic, the media tends to report infection cases and mortality cases, rather than recovery cases. Hence, fear is transmitted faster in a pandemic than usual (Depoux et al., 2020). Indeed, as COVID-19 spreads all over the world, public fear seems to be rising in many countries (Garrett, 2020). To avoid feelings of anxiety and distress, the World Health Organization has advised people not to focus on news about COVID-19 too much, because watching, reading or listening to news about COVID-19 will exacerbate fear (World Health Organization, 2020a). Here, we predicted that when the prevalence rate is increasing, people tend to use fear-related emotional search terms more often; moreover, fear-related emotional search terms would explain the relationships between the prevalence rate of COVID-19 and search terms of protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying.\nThe Present Research\nThe present study aims to demonstrate the immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic\non health-related internet searches. To achieve our research aims, we utilized the Google research tool \u201cGoogle Trends\u201d to retrieve internet search data. Google Trends provides data related to Google internet search volume with a wide range of search terms using an index ranging from 0 (representing the least popular search term) to 100 (representing the most popular search term). Google search volume data have been demonstrated to be a valid indicator of people\u2019s desires and intentions, such as risky behavior, religiosity, pursuit of\nHannay, 2017; Pelham et al., 2018; Walasek & Brown, 2015).\nWe retrieved the Google search volume data for four countries, including the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. All four countries are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic and were chosen as the target countries because the four countries are English-speaking countries so that we were able to use the same keywords in English to examine internet searches of their citizens. We retrieved data of Google search volume by using keywords that index fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying (see Table 1). We hypothesized that in each of the four countries, increasing COVID-19 prevalence would be associated with a greater search volume associated with fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying, respectively. Furthermore, fear-related emotions would mediate the associations of COVID19 with protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying behaviors.\nFindings will inform the coping efforts through online activities when being exposed\nto a pandemic. Findings will also be informative for health policymakers, health care providers, and official authorities to make decisions on when and how to distribute pandemic-related messages to citizens.\nMethod\nThe present study used publicly available data and the authors had no interaction with\nthe participants; therefore, human subjects ethical review was not required.\nCOVID-19 data were retrieved from the website of Johns Hopkins Coronavirus\nResource Center (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020). For each country, we used the data of COVID-19 since the date of the first confirmed case till March 24, 2020. The prevalence rates of COVID-19 were log-transformed and standardized before analyses.\nintentions related to COVID-19, we retrieved the search volume data using the keyword coronavirus. We found that the prevalence rates of COVID-19 were highly correlated with the searches for the topic coronavirus in the United States (r = .90, p < .001), the United Kingdom (r = .90, p < .001), Canada (r = .79, p < .001) and Australia (r = .86, p < .001), suggesting that Google searches did reflected people\u2019s psychological concerns.\nProtective behaviors were indexed by search volume data using four keywords: mask,\nhand washing, social distancing, and quarantine, which represented four types of protective behaviors recommended by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2020b) (see all keywords in Table 1). The four types of behaviors showed moderate to high correlations between each other across four countries (rs > .55, ps < .001, see details in Tables S1-S4). Because all search volumes of keywords increased in exponential curve patterns (see Figure 1a-1d), we log-transformed and standardized data. Then we computed a composite score by averaging four behavior scores, with higher scores indicating more searches for protective behaviors.\nHealth knowledge was indexed by search volume data using two keywords: vaccine\nand immunity, which reflected people\u2019s inclination to seek health-related information, such as availability of vaccine and ways of gaining immunity. The two types of health knowledge showed high correlations between each other across four countries (rs > .93, ps < .001). After log-transformation and standardization, we computed a composite score by averaging two knowledge scores, with higher scores indicating more searches for health knowledge.\nPanic buying was indicated by search volume data of using two keywords: panic\nbuying and stockpile, which reflected motivation for excessive buying. The two types of buying behavior showed moderate to high correlations between each other across four countries (rs > .70, ps < .001). After log-transformation and standardization of the data, we\nindicating more searches for panic buying.\nFear-related emotions were indicated by search volume data of using three keywords:\nfear, worry, and panic. We first checked a broad scope of negative emotions, which were operationalized by five keywords: fear, worry, panic, anxiety, and sadness, which reflected overall negative emotional reactions. Three keywords including fear, worry, and panic showed moderate to high correlations between each other across four countries (rs > .48, ps < .001); however, the last two keywords anxiety and sadness showed mixed correlations (e.g., non-significant or even negative correlations) with the first three keywords. Therefore, we used only three keywords (i.e., fear, worry, panic) as indicators of fear-related emotions. We log-transformed and standardized data, and then computed a composite score by averaging three emotion scores, with higher scores indicating more searches for fear-related emotions.\nAll internet search variables demonstrated acceptable reliability (see Cronbach\u2019s\nalphas in Table 1). Analyses\nTo test the hypothesis, we conducted cross-temporal analyses within countries. Cross-\ntemporal analyses within countries provide a stronger test of our hypotheses compared to cross-national analyses because the former naturally controls for numerous third variable confounds associated with between country differences (e.g., government policy, public health system, elderly population) (Oishi, Kesebir, & Diener, 2011).\nAs mentioned above, because all scores showed exponential curve patterns, we\nconducted log-transformation and standardization with all scores (Bishara & Hittner, 2012), with which we were able to use multiple linear regression to analyze the data. We conducted a series of multiple linear regressions to examine the association of the prevalence rates of\nFurther, we conducted mediation analyses to test mediation effects of fear-related emotions in the associations of the prevalence rates of COVID-19 with protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying.\nResults\nCOVID-19 and internet searches\nThe COVID-19 prevalence rate significantly predicted searches for protective\nbehaviors in four countries: the United States (B = 0.88, SE = 0.03, t = 28.51, p < .001), the United Kingdom (B = 0.84, SE = 0.05, t = 18.02, p < .001), Canada (B = 0.78, SE = 0.06, t = 12.97, p < .001), and Australia (B = 0.82, SE = 0.05, t = 17.15, p < .001), suggesting that increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases were associated with more searches for protective behaviors.\nThe prevalence rate significantly predicted searches for health knowledge in four\ncountries: the United States (B = 0.89, SE = 0.06, t = 16.26, p < .001), the United Kingdom (B = 0.87, SE = 0.06, t = 13.49, p < .001), Canada (B = 0.85, SE = 0.07, t = 12.39, p < .001), and Australia (B = 0.88, SE = 0.06, t = 14.8, p < .001), suggesting that increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases were associated with more searches for health knowledge.\nThe prevalence rate significantly predicted searches related to panic buying in four\ncountries: the United States (B = 0.83, SE = 0.07, t = 12.56, p < .001), the United Kingdom (B = 0.83, SE = 0.07, t = 11.1, p < .001), Canada (B = 0.62, SE = 0.09, t = 6.77, p < .001), and Australia (B = 0.61, SE = 0.09, t = 6.48, p < .001), suggesting that increasing numbers of confirming cases of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for panic buying.\nThese results are consistent with the hypothesis and indicate that in a given country,\nwhen the prevalence rates of COVID-19 increased, people searched for protective behaviors,\nconsistent across the four countries. Fear-related emotions explain the link between COVID-19 and searches\nNext, we examined whether fear-related emotions would mediate the associations of\nCOVID-19 with protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. We regressed protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying on both COVID-19 and fearrelated emotions, respectively (see Tables S5-S16). We reported significant mediation effects in Figures S1-S10.\nFear-related emotions mediated the association of the prevalence rates of COVID-19\nwith searches for protective behaviors in the United States (indirect effect = 0.17, SE = 0.05, 95%CI = [0.10, 0.28]) and Canada (indirect effect = 0.24, SE = 0.06, 95%CI = [0.14, 0.36]), but not in the United Kingdom (indirect effect = 0.10, SE = 0.06, 95%CI = [-0.01, 0.21]) and Australia (indirect effect = -0.04, SE = 0.04, 95%CI = [-0.11, 0.05]).\nFear-related emotions mediated the association of the prevalence rates of COVID-19\nwith searches for health knowledge in the United States (indirect effect = 0.57, SE = 0.07, 95%CI = [0.43, 0.71]), the United Kingdom (indirect effect = 0.33, SE = 0.10, 95%CI = [0.15, 0.53]), Canada (indirect effect = 0.40, SE = 0.09, 95%CI = [0.23, 0.58]), Australia (indirect effect = 0.22, SE = 0.05, 95%CI = [0.13, 0.33]).\nFear-related emotions mediated the association of the prevalence rates of COVID-19\nwith searches for panic buying in the United States (indirect effect = 0.73, SE = 0.15, 95%CI = [0.40, 1.01]), the United Kingdom (indirect effect = 0.36, SE = 0.10, 95%CI = [0.18, 0.58]), Canada (indirect effect = 0.47, SE = 0.21, 95%CI = [0.04, 0.83]), and Australia (indirect effect = 0.49, SE = 0.13, 95%CI = [0.26, 0.76])\nThese results support the hypothesis that fear-related emotions mediated the\nassociation between the prevalence rates of COVID-19 and searches for health knowledge\nassociation between the prevalence rates and searches for protective behaviors.\nDiscussion\nThe present study aimed to understand people\u2019s emotional and behavioral reactions to\nCOVID-19 through online searches. We hypothesized that the prevalence rates of COVID-19 would be associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying through higher levels of fear-related emotions. In general, the hypotheses were confirmed by the results that increasing cases of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying, most of which were mediated by fear-related emotions.\nThe present findings are in line with the fear appeal approach that threat of a disease\narouses fear emotions, which in turn motivates people to seek for behavioral changes and gain health knowledge (Floyd et al., 2000; Kok et al., 2014; Ling et al., 2019; Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1997). Moreover, the present study used a socioecological factor (prevalence rate of COVID-19) to predict psychological reactions, which corroborates the perspective of socioecological psychology (Du, Chi, & Li, 2018; Oishi, 2014), and demonstrates that the prevalence rate of a disease can be considered as a direct psychological threat and useful for changing health-related intentions.\nAlthough we can only indicate that internet searches might represent intentions for\nbehavioral changes, the fear appeal literature has shown that threat perceptions (e.g., threat severity, threat vulnerability) have comparable impacts on intentions and behaviors (Floyd et al., 2000). Therefore, the implications of the present findings may be also applied to people\u2019s behavioral responses to COVID-19, such that when a country has more cases of COVID-19, citizens could be more likely to demonstrate protective behaviors, learn health information, and conduct excessive buying.\naware of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, they tend to more actively respond to the disease and seek useful information and behavioral changes. The World Health Organization suggests minimizing exposure to news about COVID-19, because the exposure causes worry, distress, and anxiety (World Health Organization, 2020a). Based on our findings, we rather suggest that optimal levels of fear are needed, so as to motivate people to adopt protective behaviors.\nIt is important to note that fear itself is not enough to motivate people to act. Fear\nfunctions best when it is coupled with a sense of efficacy (Kok et al., 2014; Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1997), such that when individuals are fearful about the disease and also recognize the efficacy of protective behaviors, they are more likely to initiate behavioral changes. COVID-19 has undoubtedly elicited fear. Governments should also provide information on how to protect oneself and one\u2019s community against the disease (e.g., through hand washing and social distancing) to increase people\u2019s efficacy in fighting against COVID19.\nMore searches for panic buying reflect increased desires for excessively storing daily\nnecessities to respond to COVID-19, because most countries affected by COVID-19 advised citizens to stay at home. A potential consequence of panic buying is to deprive people who actually need these supplies from having them (e.g., elderly, disabled people) (The Guardian, 2020). To alleviate the impact of COVID-19 and dampen fear and panic buying, governments should deliver timely information on sufficient supplies of basic goods (O'Keefe, 2016) to prevent the panic spread and loss of control.\nDespite the dismal situation, there is a glimmer of hope. The COVID-19 pandemic\ngives people a chance to reflect on healthy versus unhealthy behaviors. Healthy behavioral habits such as hand hygiene protect people not only from COVID-19, but also from the flu,\npossible pandemics in the future. The current research suggests that healthy behaviors might be encouraged through exposure to prevalence rates of disease and fear-related emotions, which could be used to promote COVID-19 prevention and interventions.\nBishara, A.

In the current preregistered research, we recruited a large sample (N = 1,088) from an underrepresented society in psychology literature, Turkey, which also happens to be the seventh country in the world with the most COVID-19 cases, as of April 2020. We aimed to investigate (1) individual differences that might be associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; (2) whether COVID19 conspiracy beliefs were related to the preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, wearing masks, etc.); and (3) how individual differences in several psychological variables including risk perception, uncertainty avoidance, and intuitive thinking style were related to the level of preventive measures."}, {"heading": "Predictors of COVID-19 Conspiracy Beliefs", "text": "Conspiracy theories are unwarranted beliefs that certain events are planned and carried\nout by secret, malevolent, and powerful organizations (Douglas & Sutton, 2015; Swami & Furnham, 2014). Studies showed that individuals who believe in any conspiracy theory tend to believe in another conspiracy theory even when they are unrelated (Swami, Chamorro\u2010 Premuzic, & Furnham, 2010; Wood, Douglas, & Sutton, 2012). Therefore, a general tendency to believe in conspiracy theories would be expected to be positively associated with COVID19 conspiracy beliefs.\nBesides, two important predictors of believing in conspiracy theories are feeling of\ncontrol and uncertainty. Subjective uncertainty makes conspiracy theories seem more plausible and increases the tendency to believe them (van Prooijen & Jostmann, 2013). A\nassociated with having a conspiracy mentality (Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah, & Imhoff, 2013) and perceiving patterns in random stimuli (van Harreveld, Rutjens, Schneider, Nohlen, & Keskinis, 2014; Whitson & Galinsky, 2008).\nPeople with high levels of uncertainty avoidance would be less tolerant of the\nambiguities surrounding the pandemic (e.g., the exact source of the disease, debates on how it can be cured, etc.). Such uncertainty, and the anxiety it produces, would render people with high uncertainty avoidance to be more prone to believe in conspiracy theories that provide \u201cmore clear\u201d, and yet incorrect, explanations. Since perceived stress and stressful life events such as illness and bereavement predict belief in conspiracy theories (Swami et al., 2016), the perceived risk of getting infected by COVID-19 could also be an important predictor. In other words, as people with a higher perception of risk would lack the sense of control over the situation, it might be related to believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, as well as the level of compliance with the preventive measures, suggested to minimize the risk of infection. Thus, it could be argued that uncertainty avoidance and the perceived risk of getting infected by COVID-19 would predict belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories.\nIndividuals who perform better on cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005; which\nindicates more analytical, as opposed to intuitive, thinking) are less likely to believe in conspiracy theories (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2015; Swami, Voracek, Stieger, Tran, & Furnham, 2014), and they are better at detecting fake news (Bronstein, Pennycook, Bear, Rand, & Cannon, 2019; Pennycook & Rand, 2019). Furthermore, in a recent study, Stanley, Barr, Peters, and Seli (2020) found that individuals who perform worse on the cognitive reflection test are more likely to believe that the COVID19 is a hoax. Based on these findings, we expected that more intuitive thinkers would be more likely to believe in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Being closely associated with a lack of\nmight be associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs.\nIdeology and religiosity are also important predictors of belief in conspiracy theories.\nIt was found that conservatives are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories (Pasek, Stark, Krosnick, & Tompson, 2015; Swami, 2012; Swami et al., 2012). Religiosity is also positively associated with conspiracy beliefs (Douglas, Sutton, Callan, Dawtry, & Harvey, 2016; Franks, Bangerter, & Bauer, 2013; Newheiser, Farias & Tausch, 2011). Thus, we argue that political conservatism and religiosity would be positively associated with beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories."}, {"heading": "COVID-19 Conspiracy Beliefs and Preventive Measures", "text": "Previous studies showed that there is a negative relationship between believing in\nconspiracy theories and health-related measures (Jolley & Douglas, 2014; Oliver & Wood, 2014; for a systematic review, see Goreis & Voracek, 2019). In a recent study, Plohl and Musil (2020) showed that believing generic conspiracist beliefs indirectly predicts compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines through trust in science. Individuals who trust more in science implement more preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak and this relationship is mediated by believing in conspiracy theories (Plohl & Musil, 2020). However, the evidence is scarce on the association between believing in COVID-19 conspiracies and preventive behaviors especially in underrepresented and non-WEIRD societies (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). Therefore, one of the goals of this study is to explore this association in Turkey, a non-WEIRD society."}, {"heading": "Predictors of Preventive Measures", "text": "World Health Organization (2020b) has identified various preventive behaviors\nagainst COVID-19 (e.g., handwashing, avoid touching eyes, and social distancing). Although\nindividuals do not implement them. Certain individual differences, including the ones explained above, might be related to these preventive behaviors. One such factor might be risk perception (Cameron & Diefenbach, 2001; McCaul, Canevello, Mathwig, & Klein, 2003). In a study on the SARS epidemic, it was found that individuals who perceive greater risk about the outbreak were more likely to implement precautionary measures against the infection (Leung et al., 2004). However, in early studies on COVID-19, there were some mixed findings on this relationship. It was found that individuals who fear more about COVID-19 report exhibiting more public health compliance behaviors such as hand washing and social distancing (Harper, Satchell, Fido, & Latzman, 2020). However, according to the results of a study in Wuhan, China (where the COVID-19 pandemic started), the risk perception was found to be negatively related to preventive behaviors (Qian et al., 2020).\nImpulsivity might be another factor in predicting the level of preventive behaviors.\nImpulsivity is a multi-dimensional feature that expresses unplanned, impatient, and careless behaviors regardless of considering consequences with fast processing of information and poor inhibitory control (e.g., Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995). It is associated with risky behaviors with harmful consequences for health (e.g., Gran\u00f6, Virtanen, Vahtera, Elovainio, & Kivim\u00e4ki, 2004).\nThus, previous literature suggests that individual differences in the variables\nsummarized above might play a role in preventive behaviors. We aimed to explore these individual differences that might be related to the level of compliance with the preventive measures taken against COVID-19. We were also interested in the potential association between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and preventive behaviors to have an understanding of the potential health-related consequences of widely held conspiracy beliefs.\nBased on the previous literature, we hypothesized that (1) higher scores in faith in\nintuition, generic conspiracy beliefs, uncertainty avoidance1, impulsiveness, religiosity, and right-wing political orientation and a lower score in cognitive reflection would be associated with higher scores in belief in COVID-19 conspiracies; and (2) belief in COVID-19 conspiracies would be related to the level of preventive behaviors. We also explored the associations between our variables and preventive behavioral intentions. We preregistered our hypotheses, stopping rule for data collection, and data analytical strategy before data collection (https://osf.io/kp8md/?view_only=81ec63a0efd1443da8fa82399e388f3d).2\nMethod\nData and materials are available online\n(https://osf.io/umt4d/?view_only=a19fbe8299a84f5f9e7342591f21077a)."}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were recruited via Facebook and Twitter in exchange for gift draws. As\nstated in the preregistration, we stopped data collection after seven days. A total of 1,133 participants completed all measures of the study. We excluded 45 participants who either (a) failed the attention check question which explicitly asked to choose one of the options; (b) took a very long (z for the duration for completion is larger than 3), or (c) took a very short time (z is smaller than -3). All exclusion criteria were specified in the preregistration form. The resulting sample consisted of 1,088 participants (790 females, 291 males, 7 responded as \u201cother\u201d; Mage = 31.02, SD = 39.43).\n1 We unintentionally omitted uncertainty avoidance in the preregistration form, although it was included in our hypothesis. 2 We also had a non-directional preregistered hypothesis that individual differences might moderate the association between COVID-19 conspiracy theories and preventive measures. As these analyses are not central to the current research, we report those findings in the Online Supplementary Material (SM).\nThe order of measures, except for demographic form, was randomized for each\nparticipant. The demographic form appeared in the last section of the survey.\nBelief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. As a measure of how much they were\neager to believe in conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19, we developed a 2-item scale where participants were asked to report how much they agree (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) with the followings: \u201cCoronavirus was developed and spread around the world by certain people for their own purposes\u201d and \u201cThere is no intentional plan of a person or a group behind the spreading of coronavirus around the world\u201d (reverse item). Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the two items was .81.\nGeneric conspiracist beliefs. We measured the general tendency to believe in\nconspiracy theories that are unrelated to COVID-19 by using the 15-item Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (Brotherton, French, & Pickering, 2013). An example item was \u201cSecret organizations communicate with extraterrestrials, but keep this fact from the public\u201d. We translated the items into Turkish and a 5-point response scale (1 = definitely not true, 5 = definitely true) was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was found to be .90.\nPreventive measures. We developed 7 items to measure how much participants\nabided with the suggested preventive measures that would minimize the risk of infection. An example item was \u201cAfter I spent time outside, I clean my hands with soap or hand sanitizer\u201d. A 7-point response scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .65.\nFaith in intuition. Faith in intuition was measured using Pacini and Epstein\u2019s (1999)\n11-item scale. The scale measures to what extent someone trusts his/her instincts and hunches and it was previously adapted to Turkish (T\u00fcrk & Artar, 2014). An example item was \u201cI\nagree) was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was found to be .91.\nCognitive reflection. Cognitive reflection test (CRT) measures intuitive versus\nanalytical thinking, using 3 mathematical questions for which the intuitive responses are incorrect (Frederick, 2005). Turkish version of the test has been previously used (e.g., Yilmaz & Saribay, 2016). We first cleaned the data by converting any non-numerical responses to numerical and standardizing the responses (for example, some participants responded as 0,05 Turkish liras whereas others wrote 5 kuru\u015f, the equivalent of a cent, which is essentially the same answers). Incorrect answers were coded as 0 while correct ones as 1; then the scores were summed. A higher score indicates more analytical thinking. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .63.\nImpulsivity. To measure impulsivity in thinking and behavior, we used the 15-item\nTurkish version of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (G\u00fcle\u00e7 et al., 2008; Patton et al., 1995). An example item was \u201cI say things without thinking\u201d. A 4-point (1 = never, 4 = always) response scale was used. The items of \u201cI change hobbies\u201d and \u201cI think about the future\u201d (reverse item) had item-total correlations of less than .30 and thus were removed. The remaining 13 items had a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .80.\nUncertainty avoidance. We used 12-item uncertainty avoidance scale which was\ndeveloped by Carleton, Norton, and Asmundson (2007) and adapted to Turkish by Sar\u0131\u00e7am, Erguvan, Ak\u0131n, and Ak\u00e7a (2014) to measure how much participants found uncertain situations as uncomfortable. An example item was \u201cUnforeseen events upset me greatly\u201d. A 5-point response scale (1 = not at all characteristic of me, 5 = entirely characteristic of me) was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .90.\nPerceived risk. Oh, Lee, and Han (2020) used a 4-item scale to measure perceived\nrisk in the context of the MERS outbreak in 2015. We translated it to Turkish and re-worded\ninfected by coronavirus\u201d. A 7-point response scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .56.\nDemographic form. At the end of the study, participants filled out a socio-\ndemographic form including questions on age, sex (male, female, or other), education level (ranging from primary school to PhD on a 7-point scale), perceived socioeconomic status (measured on a socioeconomic status ladder; ranging from 1, the bottom of the ladder, to 10, the top of the ladder), ideology (1 = extremely leftist, 7 = extremely rightist), religiosity (1 = not religious at all, 7 = very religious) (see SM for detailed analyses on the sociodemographic differences).\nResults"}, {"heading": "Psychological Correlates of COVID-19 Conspiracy Beliefs", "text": "Belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories had a positive correlation with faith in\nintuition, r = .206, p < .001, and negative correlation with CRT, r = -.178, p < .001, and these suggested that more intuitive (as opposed to analytical) thinkers were more likely to believe that there is a conspiracy behind COVID-19 pandemic, as hypothesized (see Table 1).\nAnother psychological trait that is associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs is\nuncertainty avoidance.

Bayesian correlation analysis also revealed support for the null hypothesis (BF01 = 21.529). Generic conspiracist beliefs, on the other hand, had a significant but very small positive correlation with preventive measure, r = .070, p = .022. Thus, there was no conclusive evidence to suggest any meaningful relationship between conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19-related preventive measures in Turkey.\nThe results also showed that more impulsive participants were less likely to take\npreventive measures, r = -.154, p < .001. Since the impulsivity corresponds to a lack of elaboration before performing the behavior (Bakhshani, 2014), such a result would be expected. Also, those with a higher perception of risk were more likely to take preventive measures, r = .208, p < .001.\nDiscussion\nWe recruited a large sample from a non-WEIRD country, Turkey, to investigate the\npsychological correlates of belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and preventive measures. We found evidence for our preregistered hypotheses that higher intuitive thinking tendency (both self-reported and performance-based), impulsivity, generic conspiracy beliefs, religiosity, and right-wing ideology are associated with a higher level of belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. In contrast to our expectation, we failed to find any significant association between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and preventive measures. These findings are in line with the previous literature on the psychology of conspiracy theories (e.g., Swami et al., 2010) but not compatible with the literature linking conspiracy beliefs to the health impairing behaviors (e.g., Goreis & Voracek, 2019).\nlaboratory construct virus (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020), COVID-19related conspiracy beliefs have spread rapidly (Frenkel, Alba, & Zhong, 2020). However, little is known about to what extent COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs contribute to the compliance with the preventive measures. We adopted an individual differences approach and explored this association. Although believing in conspiracy theories had been previously associated with various health impairing behaviors (Goreis & Voracek, 2019), our results failed to find any evidence in Turkey. The first possibility of this null finding is that there is indeed no association between these two variables in the COVID-19 context where the risk perception is very high due to death toll unlike other health-related behaviors such as rejection of vaccination and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Second, there might be some boundary conditions. Plohl and Musil (2020) have recently proposed a boundary condition (trust in science) to explain this association. Another boundary condition might be the country (where the study is conducted) due to different numbers of confirmed cases and death tolls (i.e., risk perception) among the countries. Interestingly, as of April 2020, we witnessed an armed protest in Michigan, the U.S., demanding the reopening of the economy and an end to preventive measure orders on the grounds that the measures violate the right of freedom. Thus, our initial conjecture that anti-prevention attitudes during the outbreak might partially be explained by the reliance on conspiracy theories about COVID-19 might be observed in other countries such as the U.S.\nThere is also extensive literature indicating that deficiencies in cognitive ability and\nmotivation of critical thinking play a role in believing conspiracy beliefs (Douglas, Sutton & Cichocka, 2017). We hypothesized that since reliance on intuitive thinking favors belief in conspiracy theories as shown in the previous literature (Pennycook et al., 2015; Swami et al., 2014) and the current research, reliance on intuition might also predict the level of compliance\npreventive measures were impulsivity and risk perception. Those who are less impulsive and perceive more risk for the COVID-19 are more likely to take preventive measures.\nOne of the limitations of this study is that we used a large but a convenience sample\nfrom Turkey, which might not be representative of the Turkish population. Future research should also measure actual behaviors rather than behavioral intentions. It is of course very difficult to measure actual preventive behaviors in a research context but applications that provide data via GPS on how far people are away from their homes during the outbreak can be used as an operationalization of preventive behavior.\nThis study is one of the earlier studies trying to understand conspiracy beliefs and\npreventive behaviors in the context of the COVID-19. Overall, our findings replicated most of the associations previously found regarding the psychology of the conspiracy theories in Turkey but did not find any evidence of its association with preventive behavioral intentions in contrast to the literature linking conspiracy beliefs to health impairing behaviors.\nAndersen, K.

Adolescents (N=437; 78% female) were recruited across the US using social media and reported on their COVID-19 prosocial experiences (giving, receiving help), mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, belongingness), and community attachments (social responsibility, social trust, self-interest). Greater engagement in COVID-19 prosocial behavior was associated with greater anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, and social responsibility. Receiving more COVID-19 help was associated with lower depressive symptoms and higher belongingness, social trust, and self-interest. Findings highlight the importance of furthering our understanding of these connections in adolescence to help inform post-pandemic recovery and relief efforts. Keywords: COVID-19; Adolescence; Prosocial Behavior; Mental Health\nAdolescents\u2019 Prosocial Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations with Mental\nHealth and Community Attachments\nThe novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11,\n2020 and a US national emergency on March 13, 2020 (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). The outbreak was first revealed in late December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and has since spread globally. As of April 29, 2020, there were over 3,018,952 confirmed cases worldwide, and over 983,457 confirmed cases in the United States (WHO, 2020; CDC, 2020). Like many natural disasters (Brooks et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2006), the COVID-19 pandemic has produced several negative social, economic, and health consequences for youth, including social isolation, increased family financial strain, elevated mental health symptoms, and engagement in antisocial behaviors, such as hoarding (Cao et al., 2020; Oosterhoff et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However, natural disasters also provide opportunities for youth to help\u2014and be helped by\u2014others in their community (Kaniasty & Norris, 2004; Reissman et al., 2006). Engaging in prosocial action either as an actor or beneficiary may attenuate the social and psychological impact of the pandemic. Furthermore, examining these processes may be especially important during adolescence, which represents a developmentally sensitive period of time when youth are at risk for many mental health disorders (Lee et al., 2014). Adolescents are also forming lasting views of their role within society, and developing community attachments (Metzger & Smetana, 2010), which may have important public health implications (Kawachi et al., 2008) as research has shown that community attachments are positively related to adolescents\u2019 compliance with recommendations for safe, preventative practices during COVID-19 (Oosterhoff & Palmer, 2020).\nNatural disasters and other times of crisis can provide those affected with opportunities to\nengage in prosocial action through supporting one another, helping those in need, and preserving\nsocial functioning (Kaniasty & Norris, 2009; Reissman et al., 2006). For instance, there were a number of prosocial responses to Hurricane Katrina (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2006), with many citizens donating funds to victims, volunteering to distribute supplies, and participating in search and rescue teams (Avdeyeva et al., 2006; Vollhardt, 2009). Similarly, during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, media reports indicated an increase in prosocial action including charitable donations, volunteers to grocery shop for those at risk, and volunteers producing personal protective equipment, such as facemasks (Vergin, 2020; Watson, 2020). As COVID-19 symptoms appear less severe among pediatric patients (Dong et al., 2020), adolescents may be willing to engage in a variety of different prosocial behaviors.\nBeing a prosocial actor or recipient may be positively connected with mental health and\ncommunity attachments during natural disasters. Benefitting others through prosocial acts has been associated with lower depression and anxiety (Haroz et al., 2013; Nantel-Vivier et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2003), greater feelings of belongingness and lower feelings of burdensomeness (i.e., sense of worth vis-\u00e0-vis others; Devi et al., 2017; Oosterhoff, Hill, & Slonaker, 2019), and increased social trust, concern for others, and social responsibility values (i.e., community attachments; Brown & Ferris, 2007; Flanagan et al., 2015; Irwin, 2009; Pratt et al., 2003). Although less studied, being the recipient of prosocial behavior can help youth cope with stressful circumstances, promote well-being, provide opportunities to connect with others, and motivate reciprocity (Bartlett & DeSteno, 2006; Froh et al., 2010; Tsang, 2006; Weinstein & Ryan, 2010).\nProsocial experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic may be particularly important for\nadolescents\u2019 mental health and community attachments. Adolescence is a developmental period marked by increased risk for mental illness, including anxiety and depression (Lee et al., 2014),\nand adolescents rely more heavily on peers for social support (Smetana et al., 2006). As social support may be limited due to pandemic social distancing, adolescents may be at risk for experiencing lower belongingness and higher burdensomeness on others (Joiner, 2007). COVID19 prosocial experiences may provide important opportunities for youth to feel supported by and connected to others, which may buffer against potential negative mental health consequences of the pandemic. Adolescence has also been characterized as a sensitive period for civic development (Smetana & Metzger, 2010) when youth begin to form lasting concepts of their social world that carry into adulthood (Smetana & Villalobos, 2009; Wray-Lake et al., 2016). Prosocial experiences during the pandemic may shape adolescents\u2019 budding views of society in ways that contribute to stronger community attachments, which could have a critical impact on their contributions to society and public health (Kawachi et al., 2008). Examining connections between COVID-19 prosocial experiences, mental health, and community attachments during adolescence is an important first step toward advancing an understanding of how variability in pandemic-related experiences may be negatively or positively affecting youth. The Current Study\nThe primary aim of this research was to describe adolescents\u2019 prosocial experiences\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and examine how being the actor or recipient of COVID-19 specific prosocial acts was related to adolescents\u2019 mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, belongingness) and community attachments (social responsibility values, social trust, self-interest). We expected that greater experience with prosocial action (both as an actor and recipient) would be associated with better mental health and stronger community attachments. Past research has found substantial heterogeneity in youths\u2019 negative natural disaster experiences (Dodd et al., 2019), as well as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and\nsocioeconomic differences in adolescents\u2019 mental health symptoms (Kessler et al., 2009). Thus, the current study accounted for variability in adolescents\u2019 negative COVID-19 experiences and a variety of demographic characteristics to isolate links between prosocial experiences, mental health, and community attachments.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants and Procedures", "text": "The survey was completed by 437 adolescents residing in the United States between the\nages of 13-20 years (M = 16.43, SD = 1.10). The sample was primarily 11th (29.6%) and 12th (32.6%) graders with some 9th graders (14.3%), 10th graders (22.2%), and college students (1.2%). The sample was composed of more females (78.8%) than males (18.0%) with 3.2% identifying as non-binary. The sample was primarily White/Caucasian (78.1%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (15.9%), Asian American/Pacific Islander (9.7%), African American/Black (5.8%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (3.7%), or other (4.8%). As a proxy for family financial strain (Galinsky, 1999), youth were asked whether their families had: enough money to buy almost anything they wanted (4.8%), no problem buying the things they need and can also sometimes buy special things (51.7%), just enough money for the things they need (34.2%), or a hard time buying the things they need (9.2%).\nData were collected at 7:00 PM on April 12th through 5:00PM on April 13th of 2020.\nThis study was advertised on various social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit) and participants self-selected into the study and completed a 10-minute survey. This study involved no more than minimal risk and thus, passive parental permission was used. Upon selecting into the study, participants were given a link to a letter explaining the study and asked to provide this letter to their parents. All youth who provided written informed assent were\ninvited to participate. Those who completed the initial survey were entered into a drawing for a $50 Amazon gift card. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the last author\u2019s institution. Measures\nCOVID-19 Prosocial Experiences. A multi-phase process was used to assess\nadolescents\u2019 experiences with prosocial action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first phase, free-response data were collected from an independent sample of adolescents (n = 648) in which youth were asked to describe the most significant experience of engaging in COVID-19 prosocial behavior and their experience being the beneficiary of COVID-19 prosocial behavior. Free-response data were collected the week prior (April 5th and 6th, 2020) to the current study. Adolescents\u2019 responses were thematically coded using two independent raters. Common themes found across responses were then used to develop a quantitative measure of COVID-19 prosocial experiences. See the Supplemental Material for greater details concerning sample description and procedure.\nBased on the free-response data, eight items were developed to measure how often\nparticipants engaged in COVID-19 prosocial acts in the past 7 days (\u03b1 = .71) and four items were developed to measure how often participants received help from others because of COVID-19 in the past 7 days (\u03b1 = .56). Given the few number of items used to assess receiving prosocial behavior, Corrected item-total correlations were also used to assess the internal consistency of receiving help from others, which were all in the acceptable range (rs .32 to .38; Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Items are described in Table 1. Responses for both measures were given on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very often). Mean scores were calculated with higher values\nindicating greater engagement in prosocial behavior and greater receipt of help from others, respectively.\nAnxiety Symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short fixed-form 8-item\nPatient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) anxiety scale (\u03b1 = .94; Quinn et al., 2014). Youth rated their agreement with items (e.g., \u201cIn the past 7 days, I felt nervous.\u201d) on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). Mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating greater anxiety symptoms.\nDepressive Symptoms. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the short fixed-form\n8-item PROMIS depression scale (\u03b1 = .93; Quinn et al., 2014). Youth rated their agreement with items (e.g., \u201cIn the past 7 days, I felt sad.\u201d) on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). Mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating greater depressive symptoms.\nBelongingness. Belongingness was measured with three items (\u03b1 = .82) adapted from the\nInterpersonal Needs Questionnaire (Joiner, 2007). Participants rated the extent to which they belong, that other people care about them, and they felt like they have many caring and supportive friends on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating greater feelings of belongingness.\nBurdensomeness. Burdensomeness was measured with two items (r = .65) adapted from\nthe Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (Joiner, 2007). Participants rated the extent to which they currently felt like a burden on society and make things worse for the people in their life on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating greater feelings of burdensomeness.\nSocial Responsibility Values. Social responsibility values were measured with three\nitems (\u03b1 = .82) in which youth rated how important it is to consider the needs of other people,\nmake sure that all people are treated fairly, and think about how their actions affect people in the future (Syvertsen, Wray-Lake, & Metzger, 2015). Responses ranged from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important). Mean values were calculated so that higher values indicated more social responsibility.\nSocial Trust. Social trust was measured with three items (\u03b1 = .87) taken from past\nresearch (Wray-Lake et al., 2012; e.g., \u201cMost people can be trusted.\u201d). Responses were given on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Mean scores were calculated with higher values indicating higher social trust.\nSelf-Interest Values. Self-interest values were measured with two items (r = .36) in\nwhich youth rated how important it is to put their own needs before the needs of others, and to do what you want, regardless of what other people might want (Syvertsen et al., 2015). Responses ranged from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important). Mean scores were calculated so that higher values indicated more self-interest.\nNegative COVID Experiences. Adolescents were presented with a 20-item (\u03b1 = .75)\nchecklist of statements about how they may have been negatively affected by COVID-19 in the past 7 days (e.g., state was on lockdown, self-quarantined, had family member lose a job). A sum score was calculated (possible range 0 to 20) with higher scores indicating greater negative COVID-19 experiences.\nDemographic Covariates. Adolescents reported their age, gender, race, ethnicity,\nparents\u2019 education, and family financial strain. Highest level of mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 education were reported with separate items on a 3-point scale including 1 (high school or less), 2 (some college), and 3 (college graduate or more) with the option of indicating \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and were\ncombined into one index representing 1 (neither parent attended college), 2 (at least one parent completed some college), and 3 (at least one parent completed college)."}, {"heading": "Analytic Technique", "text": "Multiple linear regression models were used to examine associations between\nadolescents\u2019 COVID-19 prosocial experiences (helping others, receiving help from others) and their mental health and community attachments. Indicators of mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, belonging) and community attachments (social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest values) were specified as dependent variables. Adolescents\u2019 engagement in COVID-19 prosocial behavior and receipt of COVID-19 prosocial behavior by others were the primary independent variables. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, parents\u2019 education, family financial strain), as well as a sum indicator of negative COVID-19 experiences, were included as covariates. Low levels of missing data (<5%) were estimated using multiple imputation. Analyses were estimated using the lm function in R version 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020).\nResults\nThe frequencies for COVID-19 prosocial items are presented in Table 1. The percentage\nof adolescents who reported at least some engagement in prosocial acts aimed at helping others over the past seven days ranged from 23% to 90% across items. Adolescents most frequently endorsed giving support to friends, neighbors, or relatives who were worried about COVID-19, with 90% of youth providing support at least a little. The second most common prosocial behavior was giving a gift to quarantined friends or family. Helping with childcare and donating personal protective equipment were among the least frequently endorsed prosocial behaviors. Frequencies for endorsing at least some receipt of prosocial behavior by others over the past\nseven days ranged from 31% to 78%, with receipt of support from friends, family, or neighbors the most frequently endorsed item. Receipt of money, food, or supplies was the least frequently endorsed item. Means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations among study variables are presented in Table 2. Engaging in COVID-19 prosocial behaviors and being the recipient of COVID-19 prosocial acts were moderately correlated (r = .39, p < .01). COVID-19 prosocial engagement was positively associated with indicators of mental health and social responsibility values. Receipt of COVID-19 prosocial acts by others was positively associated with anxiety symptoms, belongingness, and indicators of community attachment.\nMultiple regression models were used to examine associations between adolescents\u2019\nCOVID-19 prosocial experiences and mental health symptoms (Table 3) and community attachments (Table 4). Greater negative COVID-19 experiences were associated with higher depressive symptoms, higher anxiety symptoms, and lower belongingness. Greater family financial strain was associated with higher depressive symptoms and lower belongingness. After accounting for demographic characteristics and negative COVID-19 experiences, being the recipient of COVID-19 prosocial acts more often was associated with lower depressive symptoms. When predicting anxiety symptoms, engaging in COVID-19 prosocial acts more often was associated with greater anxiety symptoms. When predicting burdensomeness, greater engagement in COVID-19 prosocial behavior was associated with higher feelings of burdensomeness. Being the recipient of COVID-19 prosocial acts more often was associated with higher feelings of belonging. Results from multiple regression models predicting community attachments are presented in Table 4. Greater financial strain, being White, and negative COVID-19 experiences were associated with lower social trust whereas higher levels of parent education were associated with higher social trust. Adolescents girls reported higher\nsocial responsibility values than boys. After accounting for demographic characteristics and negative COVID-19 experiences, engaging in COVID-19 prosocial behavior more often was associated with higher social responsibility values. Additionally, being the recipient of COVID19 prosocial acts more often was associated with greater social trust and greater self-interest values.\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique socio-historical moment that will likely have\nimportant consequences on adolescents\u2019 development. Although natural disasters have substantial negative effects on multiple domains of functioning (Weissbecker et al., 2008), times of crises also provide youth with opportunities for prosocial experiences (Bokszczanin, 2012). The purpose of this study was to examine adolescents\u2019 experiences regarding COVID-19 prosocial acts and investigate how these experiences were connected with mental health and community attachments. Findings demonstrate that many adolescents are actors and recipients in a variety of COVID-19 prosocial acts (e.g., providing support to people concerned about the pandemic, making donations to charities or people in need, grocery shopping for individuals at risk, helping with household chores, and giving gifts). Additionally, adolescents\u2019 COVID-19 experiences with giving and receiving help were differentially associated with mental health and community outcomes.\nBeing the recipient of prosocial action was associated with lower depressive symptoms,\nhigher feelings of belongingness, and higher social trust. Youth who are helped by others during times of crisis may be more inclined to feel connected with their peers and community and may be less inclined to experience negative moods. Findings are consistent with previous studies that have found receipt of support is associated with a stronger sense of belonging (Ham & Faircloth,\n2005) and can buffer against depression during times of crisis (e.g., HIV epidemic, McDowell & Serovich, 2007; earthquake, Watanabe et al. 2004). Further, being the recipient of prosocial behavior during the pandemic may prompt more general positive views about others. Conversely, adolescents who believe humanity is generally good may be more inclined to seek or accept help from others, especially if others are from their ingroup (Baldassarri & Grossman, 2013). Receiving help during COVID-19 was also associated with greater self-interest values. Youth who value their own self-interest over the needs of others may be more likely to accept or solicit help offered by others. Alternatively, it is possible that youth who are in more disadvantaged positions that would benefit from additional help during the pandemic are momentarily more focused on their own needs rather than the needs of others.\nConsistent with hypotheses, youth who engaged in greater COVID-19 prosocial behavior\nreported higher social responsibility values. Social responsibility values have been characterized as a facet of youths\u2019 prosocial orientation and an integral component of civic development (Metzger et al., 2018; Wray-Lake et al., 2016). Emphasizing the importance of the greater good and welfare of others has been found to motivate prosocial, moral, and civic actions and this connection is theorized to be bidirectional (Wray-Lake et al., 2011; Youniss & Yates, 1997). Youth who value helping others may be more motivated to participate in prosocial behavior during times of crisis. Simultaneously, through engaging in prosocial action during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents may learn the importance of helping others and these experiences may help cultivate social responsibility values.\nContrary to hypotheses, engaging in COVID-19 prosocial behavior was associated with\ngreater anxiety symptoms and feelings of burdensomeness. A potential motivation for engaging in prosocial behavior during a crisis may be to decrease one\u2019s own distress (Dovidio et al.,\n2017). For instance, studies of vicarious victims of 9/11 found that those who reported more post-disaster distress were more likely to help others (Piferi et al., 2006; Wayment, 2004). In addition, a recent study on youth affected by severe earthquakes found that higher levels of postdisaster distress were associated with greater prosocial behavior toward other disaster survivors; the link was partially explained by increased connectedness with others who were similarly affected by the disaster (Vezzali et al., 2016). It is possible that adolescents who feel greater anxiety or burdensomeness during the COVID-19 pandemic sought out opportunities to help others with shared COVID-19 experiences as a means of alleviating or channeling these feelings into a productive outlet. It is also possible that participating in prosocial behavior during a pandemic\u2014including supporting friends and family\u2014can promote anxiety and burdensomeness as youth are reminded of the global situation and impact that it is having on other people. Scholars have suggested that too much commitment to others can actually be harmful to the self, for example, excessive concern for others may place youth at risk for mental illness (ZahnWaxler, Cole, & Barrett, 1991).\nFindings from this study have implications for public policy. Descriptively, our findings\nsuggest a substantial proportion of adolescents are engaged in COVID-19 prosocial behavior at least a little during a 7-day period. Parents, educators, and policy makers seeking to improve adolescents\u2019 mental health and community attachments may benefit from finding ways for youth to benefit or receive help from others. Prosocial experiences during the pandemic may have implications for youths\u2019 well-being and may play a role in their perceptions of community and how they view themselves in relation to others. Findings also highlight the potential importance of understanding how mental health and community attachments may affect youths\u2019 prosocial action. Results showing youth with worse mental health engage in more prosocial behavior may\nreflect a prosocial coping response to the pandemic, which has been associated with greater engagement in recommended and effective preventative health behaviors (e.g., wearing masks) during past pandemics (Baggley et al., 2004; Puterman et al., 2009). However, it is important for future research to further explore the potential for pandemic prosocial acts to harm youth and identify resources that may buffer this effect. Our finding that social responsibility values are connected with greater prosocial action also emphasize the role of social responsibility as a potential marker of community resilience. Increasing youths\u2019 social responsibility values may be an important preventative measure for future pandemics and public health concerns. Limitations\nFindings should be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. Data were cross\nsectional, and casual or temporal interpretations cannot be made. Future research is needed to examine within-person, longitudinal associations between prosocial experiences and mental health and community outcomes. Although our sample was recruited from across the US, youth were primarily White and female. Future studies would benefit from examining prosocial experiences in a more diverse sample of youth, which may yield a wider range of COVID-19 prosocial behaviors that our newly developed measures may not have captured. In addition, although inter-item total correlations were within acceptable range for items used to measure receipt of COVID-19 prosocial acts (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994), Cronbach\u2019s alpha was generally low which may have been due to the low number of items. Future research should work to develop additional items that may strengthen our ability to reliably assess experiences receiving help during the pandemic. Conclusions\nOverall, the current study highlights the importance of considering prosocial responses to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. Our findings demonstrate that adolescents have opportunities to engage in and receive various forms of support and assistance during COVID19. Prosocial interactions during this time of crisis may have important implications for adolescents\u2019 mental health status and developing community attachments. It will be important to further our understanding of these connections in youth to help inform post-disaster recovery and relief efforts.\nReferences\nAvdeyeva, T. V., Burgetova, K., & Welch, I. D.

Sample and Procedure for Developing COVID Prosocial Experiences Measure\nAdolescents from across the United States were recruited using social media on April 5th\nand 6th, 2020. The sample consisted of 663 adolescents aged 13 to 20 years (M = 16.39, SD = 1.13; 76.9% female, 17.7% male, 5.4% non-binary). The sample was primarily White (86.7%), with fewer youth identifying at Hispanic/Latinx (15.9%), Asian (10.1%), Black (4.5%), American Indian (3.2%), or other (4.6%). There were more 11th (30.7%) and 12th graders (32.6%) than 9th (14.4%) and 10th graders (19.1%). As a proxy for family financial strain (Galinsky, 1999), youth were asked whether their families had: enough money to buy almost anything they wanted (7.1%), no problem buying the things they need and can also sometimes buy special things (53.2%), just enough money for the things they need (34.5%), or a hard time buying the things they need (7.3%).\nParticipants completed an online questionnaire that included two quantitative items about\nCOVID-19 prosocial behavior and two open-ended follow-up questions about their prosocial experiences. Youth indicated how often in the past 7 days they helped other people with any struggles they may have had due to COVID-19 and have been helped by other people with any struggles they personally have faced due to COVID-19. Responses were given on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very often). Participants were instructed to describe the most significant experience with helping others and with being helped by others they had in the past 7 days. Responses were analyzed for common themes by two independent raters. The most salient themes across responses to both questions included donating (or receiving) food, money, or household supplies to people affected by COVID-19; donating/receiving masks, cleaners, or other personal protective equipment; providing/receiving social or emotional support to friends, neighbors, or family who were concerned about COVID-19; and giving/receiving a gift during\n30\nquarantine. In addition, responses about helping others also included descriptions of grocery shopping for individuals who are considered high-risk for COVID-19; helping family, friends, and neighbors with household chores; gathering donations for and spreading awareness about charities or local businesses in need because of COVID-1; and providing childcare to those affected by COVID-19.

We also provide initial evidence for underlying mechanisms: Individuals high in neuroticism (a) pay more attention to and worry more about Covid-19-related information (crisis preoccupation), and (b) experience more negative affect during this preoccupation (affective reactivity). These findings have important theoretical implications for understanding affective dynamics during large-scale health crises, as well as practical implications for applied settings. First, the identification of personality risk factors may help to efficiently identify individuals at emotional risk that would be overlooked on the basis of sociodemographic information alone. Second, the development of personality-tailored interventions that address the identified mechanisms (i.e., crisis preoccupation, affective reactivity) may help to prevent increases in mental health problems due to the Covid-19 and future pandemics."}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 4", "text": "Neuroticism and Emotional Risk During the Covid-19 Pandemic\nLarge-scale health crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, pose serious health threats\nto members of affected societies. Humans generally respond to such threats with negative affect, which may lead to lower psychological well-being and psychopathology (Brooks et al., 2020; Wichers, 2014). To identify and support those at risk, policy-makers and journalists typically emphasize the role of sociodemographic factors (e.g., advanced age, living alone), but previous research has shown that individual differences in personality predict psychological well-being beyond these aspects (Boyce et al., 2013). Therefore, to identify those at risk, it is crucial to consider personality.\nA promising candidate is the trait neuroticism because it involves negative\nemotionality and reactivity to stress (Barlow et al., 2014; Lahey, 2009). Neuroticism predicts a range of negative outcomes, including negative affect (Geukes et al., 2017), low subjective well-being (Lucas, 2018; Soto, 2019), and poor physical and mental health (Kotov et al., 2010; Malouff et al., 2005). Negative emotional reactions in individuals high in neuroticism are typically triggered by stressors such as threat and uncertainty (Lahey, 2009). However, whether and why neuroticism puts people at affective risk in the face of severe health crises is still unknown.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is marked by potentially severe but at the same time highly\nambiguous and uncertain threats. It should thus activate negative emotional reactions, particularly in individuals high in neuroticism. This reasoning has been corroborated by research on neuroticism mechanisms that point to the important role of preoccupation and affective reactivity processes (Merino et al., 2016; Segerstrom et al., 2020): Individuals high in neuroticism might (a) pay more attention to Covid-19-related information and worry more about the consequences of the pandemic (e.g., for their own health; crisis preoccupation), and (b) experience more negative affect during this preoccupation (affective reactivity)."}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 5", "text": "Here, we used cutting-edge experience-sampling methodology (Wright &\nZimmermann, 2019) in a large German convenience sample (N = 1,609) to study whether and why individuals high in neuroticism experienced more negative affect in their daily lives during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany (March and April 2020).\nMethod\nIn this Method section, we describe the sample, procedures, and measures of the\nrelevant data collection project. A codebook with a full description of all procedures and measures applied in this project as well as all data and analytical code necessary to reproduce reported results can be retrieved from http://go.wwu.de/t7hy9. None of the tested hypotheses was preregistered. All procedures used in this study were approved by the review board of the University of M\u00fcnster, Germany (2020-22-LK). Participants\nData for the present paper were provided by a German convenience sample consisting\nof 1,609 participants (78% women, Mage = 33.7 years, SDage = 12.7, Range = 16 to 83). Most participants (84%) held at least an A-level (German Abitur), and most of them were either working (51%) or attending a university program (37%). Participants were recruited via media announcements and received personalized feedback on their emotional states as an incentive for participation. Procedures\nThe study was programmed in formR (version v0.18.3; Arslan et al., 2020) and\nreleased on March 18, 2020. The study began when social distancing measures were recommended but not yet officially advised (March 18) and covered critical events such as the decree of restrained contact on March 22 and the decree of prolonged restrained contact on April 1, as well as marked increases in deaths due to Covid-19 (from 20 deaths on March 19 to 1,017 deaths on April 3). Data collection consisted of three phases: an initial and a final online survey and an experience-sampling phase in between. For the initial online survey"}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 6", "text": "(Day 1), participants provided informed consent and information on demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, cohabitation status, educational status, occupational status), on personality traits (e.g., neuroticism), and on their experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g., personally experienced health threats). The subsequent experience-sampling phase (Days 2 to 15) began the next day in the morning. Participants completed up to six surveys per day for a maximum of 14 days. Each survey assessed momentary states (e.g., negative affect, attention to Covid-19-related information, and engagement in Covid-19-related worries) and took about 2 minutes to complete. Participants received an email reminder for each survey that provided them with a personalized link to the respective survey. The emails were sent at random time points throughout the day based on individual time preferences for daily start and end times, with the stipulation that two successive surveys had to be a minimum of 40 minutes apart. Surveys were accessible for 45 minutes after the email reminder was sent. If participants did not respond to a reminder within 20 minutes, one additional reminder was sent. On the basis of participants\u2019 indication of whether or not they had engaged in a social interaction (> 5 minutes) since the last survey (first item on each survey), two slightly different versions of the survey were administered. These versions were optimized to capture participants\u2019 recent state experiences (i.e., social interaction vs. individual activity). The link to the final online survey was sent the day after the experience-sampling phase was completed (Day 16). In this online survey, participants provided (additional) information on demographic variables (i.e., relationship status, information about social networks) as well as on personality traits and their experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWe aimed to collect as many participants as possible within the critical time period to\nobtain precise estimates of effect sizes. For the present analyses, we included participants (N = 1,609) with the initial and the experience-sampling surveys who provided state data on or before April 3, 2020. Moreover, we included data on the final online survey for participants (n = 697) who completed the whole study on or before April 4, 2020, that is, who started within"}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 7", "text": "the first three days of the study. Surveys were excluded in cases of partial completion. On average, participants of this study took part for 7.4 days (Mdn = 7) and completed 3.2 surveys (Mdn = 3) per day, with a total average of 23.7 surveys (Mdn = 15) per participant. Measures\nWhenever items were aggregated to form a composite score, we either computed a\nmean per participant (trait measures) or a mean per time point per participant (state measures). Sociodemographic Information (Trait Survey)\nFor the sociodemographic variables, we assessed age, sex, educational status,\noccupational status, and participants\u2019 household size. The last variable was recoded into a dummy variable that indicated whether or not participants were living with others or alone (cohabitation status). Moreover, participants indicated whether (Yes) or not (No) their personal social network included grandparents, parents, siblings, their own children, and a partner. Neuroticism (Trait Survey)\nParticipants completed the Neuroticism subscale from the German version of the Big\nFive Inventory-2 S (Rammstedt et al., 2018). This scale comprises six items, with two items assessing the neuroticism facets anxiety, depression, and emotional volatility, respectively. These items were answered on 5-point rating scales with the anchors: 1 (disagree strongly), 2 (disagree a little), 3 (neutral; no opinion), 4 (agree a little), and 5 (agree strongly). Personally Experienced Health Threats (Trait Survey)\nTo assess the extent to which participants were personally affected by the Covid-19\npandemic, they completed a total of six items. Four were used in the present study because they were deemed theoretically most relevant and exhibited considerable variance between individuals. These items were answered on a dichotomous response format (Yes vs. No) and targeted different degrees of personal health threat. The items read: \u201cAre you in voluntary quarantine?\u201d \u201cAre you in mandatory quarantine?\u201d \u201cDo you have or did you have the typical"}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 8", "text": "disease symptoms (e.g., fever, cough)?\u201d and \u201cDo you think one or more people in your household are part of the risk group for the Coronavirus?\u201d We formed a composite score reflecting the degree of experienced health threats by summing (a) whether participants were in either voluntary or mandatory quarantine, (b) whether participants had the typical disease symptoms (e.g., fever, cough), and (c) whether participants thought that one or more people in their household belonged to the risk group for Covid-19. Negative Affect (State Survey)\nParticipants rated their emotional states on a total of 16 items. Three items were\nincluded as indicators of negative affect for this study on the basis of their theoretical relevance. Depending on whether or not participants had engaged in a social interaction (> 5 minutes) since the last survey, the item stem read either \u201cHow did you feel directly after the interaction?\u201d or \u201cHow did you feel directly after the activity?\u201d The items themselves were \u201canxious,\u201d \u201crelaxed\u201d (reverse coded), and \u201cinsecure.\u201d These items were answered on 6-point rating scales ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 6 (agree completely) and aggregated on the basis of conceptual reasons. Attention to Covid-19-related Information (State Survey)\nTo assess attention to Covid-19-related information, participants completed different\nversions of one item, depending on whether or not they had engaged in a social interaction (> 5 minutes) since the last survey. If participants reported a social interaction, the item stem read \u201cDuring the interaction, I showed the following behavior:\u201d and the item read \u201cI addressed the topic of Coronavirus.\u201d When there had been no social interaction, the item stem read \u201cDuring the activity, I experienced the following:\u201d and the item read \u201cI thought about the Coronavirus.\u201d Both items were answered on 6-point rating scales ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 6 (agree completely).

Educational status and occupational status were treated as categorical variables.\nIn a first step, we investigated the between-person correlations of all main variables\nincluded in our analyses. Next, we ran multilevel models, in which neuroticism predicted negative affect. We used three-level models with measurement occasions nested in days and days nested in participants and included a residual autocorrelation for consecutive measurement occasions within the same day. Moreover, we controlled for several betweenperson (age, sex, cohabitation status, educational status, occupational status, personally experienced health threats) and time-varying variables (presence vs. absence of social interactions, weekend vs. weekday).

Affective reactivity was assessed as the cross-level interaction between neuroticism and attention to Covid-19 and between neuroticism and worries about one\u2019s own health in the prediction of negative affect, respectively. Moreover, the interaction between neuroticism and attention to Covid-19 in the prediction of worries about one's own health was examined. These analyses were repeated by simultaneously including the between-person and time-varying control variables described above. Due to the high number of statistical tests, we used an alpha level of .01 (two-sided) for all tests and report 99%-confidence intervals.\nWe conducted three sets of robustness analyses. First, we examined whether our\nresults regarding worries about one\u2019s own health generalized to a broad worry aggregate including five worry variables. Second, we repeated the affective reactivity analyses with the three neuroticism facets anxiety, depression, and emotional volatility.

In line with our hypotheses, neuroticism was associated with higher mean levels of negative affect in daily life, r(1607) = .51 [.46, .56], p < .001 (see Figure 1 - Panel A and Table S1). Importantly, neuroticism predicted negative affect beyond a wide range of control variables. These included person-level variables, such as demographic information (age, sex, cohabitation status, educational status, occupational status) and personally experienced health threats (being in quarantine, having symptoms, living with a person from a risk group), as"}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 11", "text": "well as time-varying predictors, namely, the presence versus absence of social interactions or whether it was a weekend versus weekday (Table S2).\nNotably, neuroticism predicted individual differences in negative affect better than all\nthe control variables combined (neuroticism: R2 = 0.26 vs. control variables: R2 = 0.03; Table S3). This finding highlights neuroticism\u2019s importance as an affective risk factor during major health crises. The longitudinal course of negative affect is illustrated in Figure 1 - Panel B. For the entire 2-week period, levels of negative affect were low to moderate for the average person, even lower for individuals low in neuroticism, but considerably elevated for individuals high in neuroticism. Underlying Mechanisms: Crisis Preoccupation and Affective Reactivity\nTo test why individuals high in neuroticism are at emotional risk, we first examined\nneuroticism\u2019s associations with mean levels of attention and worries (crisis preoccupation). As shown in Figure 1 - Panel A and Table S1, neuroticism was related to paying more attention to Covid-19-related information, r(1607) = .18 [.12, .25], p < .001, and worrying more about one\u2019s own health, r(1607) = .22 [.16, .28], p < .001. We focused on worrying about one\u2019s own health because such worries are most clearly conceptually linked to intrapersonal neuroticism processes and the salience of health issues during pandemics. However, the effects were similar for other Covid-19-related worries (see Figure 1 - Panel A and Table S1). As depicted in Figure 1 - Panel B, attention was highest in the beginning of the 2-week period and decreased thereafter. Worries about one\u2019s own health increased between March 20 and March 23 (decree of restrained contact) and remained at a high level for the rest of the study. Individuals high in neuroticism consistently paid more attention to Covid-19related information and worried more about its consequences for their own health.\nFinally, we investigated whether neuroticism moderated how strongly attention and\nworries were related to negative affect (affective reactivity). In multilevel models (all continuous variables z-standardized, Table S4), both attention to Covid-19-related information"}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 12", "text": "and worries about one\u2019s own health were related to more negative affect in daily life (b = 0.195 [0.176, 0.215], p < .001 and b = 0.196 [0.158, 0.233], p < .001, respectively). Attention and worries were mutually related (b = 0.019 [0.012, 0.027], p < .001). In line with the idea of affective reactivity, neuroticism moderated the relationships between attention to Covid-19related information and negative affect (b = 0.043 [0.023, 0.063], p < .001) and between worries about one\u2019s own health and negative affect (b = 0.038 [0.001, 0.075], p = .007) but not between attention and worries (b = 0.000 [-0.007, 0.007], p = .990). The effects of neuroticism were substantial in size: An examination of the beta coefficients suggested that the effects of attention and worry on negative affect were approximately 50% higher for those scoring 1 SD above the mean in neuroticism compared with those scoring 1 SD below the mean. The results were similar when examining an aggregate of different types of worry (Table S5).\nAll effects remained significant when we controlled for demographic variables,\npersonally experienced health threats, the presence versus absence of social interactions, and weekend versus weekday (Tables S4 and S5). Moreover, the findings were similar when we restricted our analyses to the most compliant participants (at least 10 assessments) and when we examined the three neuroticism facets anxiety, depression, and emotional volatility separately, with the most pronounced effects for the first two (Tables S6-S10). Our main findings are visually represented in Figure 2.\nDiscussion\nThis study shows that global pandemics threaten not only people\u2019s physical well-being\nbut also their psychological well-being, particularly for individuals high in neuroticism. Whereas negative affect was low to moderate for most people, people high in neuroticism experienced elevated levels of negative affect throughout the entire study. Importantly, the processes behind this elevated level may constitute a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d (see the \u201cneurotic cascade\u201d; Suls & Martin, 2005): Individuals high in neuroticism attend to and worry more"}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 13", "text": "about Covid-19-related information (crisis preoccupation), to which they react with more negative affect (affective reactivity). Covid-19 may act as an accelerant of this vicious cycle by reciprocally reinforcing detrimental attentional and cognitive processes.\nIt is important to note that our investigation provided a rather conservative test of these\nhypotheses as this study took place in Germany, a country that was only mildly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic during the study period. Therefore, our study may have underestimated the absolute levels of negative affectivity, the effects of neuroticism, and the strength of the underlying processes. It will be important to replicate our findings in other countries that are more seriously affected by the pandemic.\nOur findings have important implications for applied settings. Identifying risk groups\non the basis of sociodemographic information alone may overlook people in need of help, such as individuals high in neuroticism. Neuroticism is typically assessed via short self-report scales (e.g., Rammstedt et al., 2018) but new technologies even allow for the assessment of neuroticism on the basis of digital footprints (e.g., likes on social media platforms). These technologies could be used to screen large numbers of individuals with minimal effort and to deliver personality-tailored prevention campaigns (e.g., targeting individuals high in neuroticism with information on how to break through the vicious cycle; Matz et al., 2017). Delivering personality-tailored prevention strategies while considering ethical standards regarding data privacy (Matz et al., 2020) may help to prevent increases in mental health problems due to the Covid-19 and future pandemics (Galea et al., 2020). To implement significant and scientifically-informed prevention campaigns, policy-makers should actively seek out psychological policy consultation, and psychological scientists should explicitly and responsibly communicate their findings to the public (Bleidorn et al., 2019)."}, {"heading": "NEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 14", "text": "References\nArslan, R.

This table shows the relationship between neuroticism and negative affect when controlling for demographic variables, personally experienced health threats, the presence versus absence of social interactions, and weekend versus weekday. The results are based on multilevel models (3 levels: time points nested in days nested in persons) with autoregressive errors. All continuous variables (neuroticism, age, personal health threats) were z-standardized. Sex: 0 = female, 1 = male; Cohabitation status: 0 = living alone, 1 = living with others; Social interaction: 0 = no interaction, 1 = interaction; Weekend: 0 = weekday, 1 = weekend day. Reference category educational status: higher education degree; Reference category occupational status: full and part-time work.\nNEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 22\nTable S3\nVariance Decomposition: Negative Affect\nBaseline Neuroticism Control variables Full model\nSigma person 0.63 0.55 0.63 0.54 Sigma day 0.26 0.26 0.26 0.26 Sigma residual 0.73 0.73 0.73 0.73 R2 person - 0.26 0.03 0.26 Note. Four different multilevel-models with negative affect as the dependent variable were computed. Baseline = a model without predictors, Neuroticism = only neuroticism predicted negative affect, Control variables = only control variables predicted negative affect, Full model = neuroticism and control variables predicted negative affect. Sigma person and day refer to the standard deviations of the random intercepts on level 3 and 2, respectively. Sigma residual refers to the residual standard deviation. As can be seen, substantial differences between models only emerged on level 3. R2 represents a pseudoR2 calculated by dividing the random intercept variance estimate on the person-level from any given model by that of the estimate from the baseline model: R2 = 1 - Var1/Var0.\nNEUROTICISM AND EMOTIONAL RISK 23\nTable S4\nMultilevel Analyses of the Relationships Between Attention, Worries, and Negative Affect and the\nModerating Effects of Neuroticism\nPredictor Estimate Std.

Yet there seems to be substantial variation across individuals in knowledge and concern about COVID-19, as well as in the willingness to change behaviors in the face of the pandemic. Here, we investigated the roles of political ideology and cognitive sophistication in explaining these differences across the U.S.A. (N = 689), the U.K. (N = 642), and Canada (N = 644) using preregistered surveys conducted in late March, 2020. We found evidence that political polarization around COVID-19 risk perceptions, behavior change intentions, and misperceptions was greater in the U.S. than in the U.K.. However, Canada and the U.S. did not strongly differ in their level of polarization. Furthermore, in all three countries, cognitive sophistication (indexed by analytic thinking, numeracy, basic science knowledge, and bullshit skepticism) was a negative predictor of COVID-19 misperceptions \u2013 and in fact was a stronger predictor of misperceptions than political ideology (despite being unrelated to risk perceptions or behavior change intentions). Finally, we found no evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization for any of our COVID-19 measures. Thus, although there is some evidence for political polarization of COVID-19 in the U.S. and Canada (but not the U.K.), accurate beliefs about COVID-19 (albeit not intentions to act) are broadly associated with the quality of one\u2019s reasoning skill regardless of political ideology or background polarization.\nThis working paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.\nDate: April 14th, 2020\nAs the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread across the globe, concern about the virus has increased\nas well. For example, Gallup estimated that in early-to-mid February only 36% of United States residents were somewhat or very worried about being exposed to the novel coronavirus, but this number rose to 60% by early-to-mid March (Newport, 2020). Many would argue, however, that this change did not happened quickly enough. There have been numerous news reports indicating that many people were still not taking the COVID-19 disease seriously as of late March in, for example, the United States (Jacobo, 2020; Schnell, 2020), the United Kingdom (BBC, 2020; Dalton, 2020), and Canada (Bryden, 2020; Hensley, 2020). Furthermore, there is evidence that misinformation about COVID-19 has proliferated on social media (Frenkel, Alba, & Zhong, 2020; Russonello, 2020), suggesting that belief in harmful misperceptions may be contributing to this problem.\nGiven that having even a vaguely accurate understanding of the risk posed by COVID-19 is\npresumably a central first step toward mobilizing the behavior changes necessary to save lives, it is therefore important to understand why people differ in their opinions about COVID-19. Here we report the results of three preregistered surveys using parallel quota-sampling of residents from the U.S.A. (N = 689) and the U.K. (N = 642), in addition to a convenience sample of residents from Canada (N = 644) \u2013 all via the polling firm Prolific (see supplementary materials, Table S1, for full demographic breakdown). The survey is therefore not nationally representative; however, the samples all came from the same source which allows for a relatively clean comparison. The survey was completed on March 24th. We investigate two key factors that may help explain differences in attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19 across these countries: Political partisanship and cognitive sophistication (and their interaction). Our data, materials, and preregistration is available on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/3a497/. All non-preregistered analyses are labelled as post-hoc."}, {"heading": "Data and Methods", "text": "We measured three key dependent variables: 1) Misperceptions about COVID-19, 2) Risk\nperceptions about COVID-19, and 3) Intentions to change behavior in response to COVID-19.\nFor misperceptions, we created a large list (k = 21) of falsehoods that have been spread about\nCOVID-19 based on various news reports and fact-checking efforts. The misperceptions that we discovered fit broadly into four possible categories (see Table 1), but we will focus on the overall misperception measure for simplicity (it was reliable in all three countries; Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 > .79 \u2013 see Methods for full description). Although each falsehood was not believed by a particularly large proportion of individuals (with a few exceptions), most participants held at least one misperception (61% in Canada, 69% in the U.K., and 66% in U.S.A.). The low overall rate of belief in specific misperceptions was paralleled by widespread agreement about the risks posed by COVID-19 (% agreement: 86% in Canada, 87% in the U.K., and 82% in U.S.A.) and also widespread agreement with behavior change intentions (% agreement: 89% in Canada, 91% in the U.K., and 90% in U.S.A.). Our samples may under-estimate the proportion of misperceptions which, at any rate, are a moving target and subject to change over time and depending on how questions are worded. For example, a Pew survey from early-to-mid March found that 23% of polled Americans believe that\nthan the 13% implied here with the \u201cthe coronavirus was created in a lab\u201d question (Table 1).\ncoronavirus poses a major threat to the public\u201d). Behavior change intentions were assessed using sliding scales (0 strong disagree to 100 strongly agree). We asked eleven questions relating to cleanliness behaviors (e.g., washing hands) and ten questions relating to social distancing (e.g., avoiding bars and restaurants) (Jordan, Yoeli, & Rand, 2020). We also asked ten questions about the perceived quality of response from national leadership (e.g., \u201cPresident Trump [Prime Minister\nMethods for a full description of measures.\nResults"}, {"heading": "Political partisanship", "text": "One of the most salient apparent sources of disagreement is political partisanship. In the\nUnited States, President Donald Trump has vacillated on the level of threat that the nation is facing. Although Trump declared a state of emergency on March 13th, he has been notably skeptical about the risk posed by the virus. For example, he said that the country is \u201cin very good shape\u201d on February 14th (Politifact & Greenberg, 2020), likened it to the common flu on March 9th (Montanaro, 2020), and, on March 24th when it was clear that the virus has spread throughout the country, he nonetheless proposed that the U.S. be \u201creopened\u201d by Easter (Ballhaus, Armour, & Leary, 2020) (a proposal he later backtracked on; Sink, Jacobs, & Fabian, 2020). Similar messaging has come from other elite Republicans and conservative media outlets such as Fox News (Costa, 2020; Grynbaum & Abrams, 2020). Consistent with this messaging, a Pew poll from early-to-mid March estimated that most (59%) Democrats viewed COVID-19 to be a major threat to the health of the U.S. population whereas only a minority (33%) of Republicans agreed.\nInterestingly, COVID-19 represents a sort of natural experiment: An identical crisis (in form)\nis being faced by other culturally similar countries, but without the seemingly extreme politicization that has occurred in the U.S. For example, although there have been disagreement about the effectiveness and quality of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the pandemic in the United Kingdom (Crace, 2020), Johnson has nonetheless primarily deferred to experts (Harris, 2020). This stands in stark contrast to Trump, who has frequently contradicted even his own experts (Sink & Parker, 2020). Indeed, the British public does seem generally supportive of the government\u2019s ability to handle the crisis (59% agreed in a poll from March 19th; Curtis, 2020).\nA more ambiguous comparison to the polarization in the U.S. comes from Canada. Prime\nMinister Justin Trudeau has not faced the same level of criticism as Trump (with some exceptions; Chase, 2020) \u2013 in fact, it has been argued that Trudeau\u2019s response has been better than Trump\u2019s (Ibbitson, 2020; Maher, 2020). Furthermore, a recent study of Twitter behavior from Canadian Member\u2019s of Parliament found no evidence that members from any party were downplaying the pandemic (Merkley et al., 2020). However, so-called \u201cculture wars\u201d in the U.S. tend to spill over into Canadian politics and there is evidence that political ideology (although not political party membership) correlates with perceptions of COVID-19 severity in Canada (with conservatives viewing it as less severe; Merkley et al., 2020).\nTo investigate the differential impact of political polarization, we correlated the same\nmeasure of political ideology (mean of social and economic liberal-conservatism) with our COVID-19 attitude and behavior measures across the three countries. As is evident from Table 2, political conservatism was associated with misperceptions in all three countries. However, this correlation was stronger in the U.S.A. than in the U.K. (Table 3). Notably, the correlations in Canada and the U.S. did not significantly differ \u2013 although we note that that conservatives in the U.S. held the most misperceptions about COVID-19 (Figure 1). The same pattern held for perceptions of COVID-19 risk and self-reported behavior change intentions: Political\npattern is not evident in the U.K. (indeed, ideology does not significantly predict risk perceptions or change intentions in the U.K.). Again, conservatives in the U.S. viewed the risk of COVID-19 as being the lowest (although the median response was 5 \u201csomewhat agree\u201d for half of the risk perception questions and 6 \u201cagree\u201d for the other half; see Figure 2 for means). The correlation between ideology and behavior change intentions was smaller, but nonetheless divergent between U.S. and U.K. (Figure 3). Ideology was also a stronger predictor of COVID-19 risk perceptions in the U.S. than Canada once demographics (age, gender, income, education, and overall health) were controlled for (see Table S5 in supplementary materials \u2013 all other findings were identical with demographics included).\nInterestingly, the U.S. and Canada do diverge in terms of partisan differences for opinions\nabout the effectiveness of Trump versus Trudeau: Ideology is an extremely strong predictor of opinions about the quality of Trump\u2019s response to the crisis in the U.S. (r = .68), but this is half as large in Canada (r = -.35; note the coefficient is negative because Trudeau is a Liberal). There was also an interaction between ideology and country for the U.K., indicating that partisan disagreement about Johnson is also weaker (r = .43) than disagreement about Trump in the U.S.\nNotably, a post-hoc analysis found that trust in conservative news outlets (namely, Fox News\nand Breitbart) correlated significantly with higher misperceptions (r\u2019s = .35 for both Fox and Breitbart) and with a stronger belief in Trump\u2019s efficacy (r\u2019s = .66, .50, for Fox and Breitbart, respectively). These correlations were robust to controlling for ideology \u2013 in fact, the correlation between misperceptions and trust in Fox New/Breitbart was nominally stronger than the correlation with ideology (\u03b2\u2019s = .25, .29 for Fox and Breitbart, respectively, \u03b2\u2019s = .17, .21 for ideology). Trust in conservative news outlets was also associated with decreased risk perceptions (r\u2019s = -.21, -.25, for Fox and Breitbart, respectively), but this was only robust to controlling for ideology for Breitbart (\u03b2 = -.13) and not Fox News (\u03b2 = -.02). Importantly, these correlations were evident but in a muted form for trust in conservative news outlets in the U.K. (e.g., Daily Mail) and Canada (e.g., Rebel Media) (see Table S9 in supplementary materials). Trust in other mainstream sources (e.g., NPR, CBC, BBC) was associated with fewer misperceptions and increased belief in the seriousness of the pandemic. Thus, although causality cannot be determined with our cross-sectional design, differential exposure to low-versus-high quality content relating to COVID-19 appears to be a source of political polarization.\nKingdom (N = 642), and United States of America (N = 689).\n1 2 3 4 5\nCanada 1.

Furthermore, many of the misperceptions about COVID-19 (see Table 1) are similar to common misconceptions about science (and, in particular, medical science); such as that simple remedies (e.g., Vitamin C) are sufficient to cure diseases. Interestingly, the politicization of COVID-19 (at least in the U.S. and, apparently, Canada) also brings it in parallel with other scientific topics. For example, there are striking parallels between messaging from President Trump (and others) in the U.S. around COVID-19 and the history of climate change skepticism \u2013 where some contrarians have moved from denying global warming entirely [COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S.] to arguing that the solutions are (now) too costly (Edelman, 2020). Thus, in the next section we will draw on research that focuses on science-related beliefs to better understand misperceptions about COVID-19.\nGiven the salience of politically divisive topics like climate change, it is perhaps unsurprising\nthat research on why people believe what they believe about science has focused on the role of political ideology (Gauchat, 2012; Kahan, 2013; Kahan et al., 2012; Linden, Leiserowitz, & Maibach, 2017; McCright, 2011; McCright & Dunlap, 2011; Pennycook, Cheyne, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2019; Rutjens, Sutton, & van der Lee, 2018; Scheufele, 2014). There are a variety of theories that make somewhat different claims in this space, but a common feature is that antiscience beliefs are largely cultural. For example, historical evidence shows that conservative thinktanks actively politicized global warming (undermining scientists and relevant experts) (Brulle, 2013; Dunlap & Jacques, 2013; Jacques, Dunlap, & Freeman, 2008); this polluted information environment is then transmitted to the general public and interacts with the ideology of individuals such that political conservatives are motivated to accept anti-science attitudes (e.g., to protect their political identities; Kahan et al., 2012; Kahan, Peters, Dawson, & Slovic, 2017).\nThis narrative seemingly finds support in our above analyses: In the politicized U.S. context,\nideology is a consistent predictor of attitudes toward COVID-19, but this does not occur in the less politicized U.K. context. However, there has recently been some criticism of this focus on ideology in the context of science beliefs because it is likely that that beliefs about science also proceed through what might be consider more \u2018typical\u2019 information processing routes.\nFor example, early theories about public understanding of science focused on the role of\none\u2019s basic science knowledge\u2014referred to as knowledge deficit models. This perspective argues that people hold anti-science beliefs largely because they do not possess enough basic scientific knowledge to properly understand novel science-related claims (Allum, Sturgis, Tabourazi, & Brunton-Smith, 2008; Sturgis & Allum, 2004). The claim that follows is that providing people with basic scientific knowledge will then lead to an increase in acceptance of science. In support of this, some recent research suggests that teaching people about the basic science behind genetically modified foods (McPhetres, Rutjens, Weinstein, & Brisson, 2019) and climate change (Ranney & Clark, 2016) can actually lead to positive attitude changes. Given that the current threat is a virus, it seems that fundamental biological and scientific knowledge might be especially relevant in assessing and responding to the threat.\nYeo, 2016), research in other areas has converged on a similar conclusion: Not all reasoning is politically motivated and being more cognitively sophisticated (including, but not limited to, basic scientific knowledge) facilitates the adoptions of accurate and pro-scientific beliefs. For example, people who are more reflective and analytic (as opposed to relying more on their intuitions) are more likely to endorse evolution (Gervais, 2015), and vaccination (Sarathchandra, Navin, Largent, & McCright, 2018) and are less likely to believe in superstitions (Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2012), conspiracies (Swami, Voracek, Stieger, Tran, & Furnham, 2014), and fake news (Pennycook & Rand, 2019a). Relatedly, people who are more receptive to pseudoprofound bullshit (i.e., they rate random sentences filled with buzzwords as profound) are more likely to believe in the efficacy of non-evidence-based alternative medicines and general conspiracy theories (Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2015) as well as fake news (Pennycook & Rand, 2019b). Finally, being able to understand probabilities and numbers (i.e., numeracy; Peters et al., 2006) has been shown to be important for a variety of decisions, but most notably in medical contexts (Lipkus & Peters, 2009).\nGiven the conflicting perspectives offered by this past research, it is unclear how cognitive\nprocessing will function in the context of COVID-19. In addition to helping to guide COVID-19 interventions, this also sheds light on basic theoretical question of what shapes peoples beliefs about science, particularly as it relates to the relative roles of ideology versus cognitive sophistication (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2020). As is evident from Table 2, conservatism does significantly predict attitudes about COVID-19 in the U.S. (and Canada). To test whether cognitive sophistication is also strong and consistent predictor of attitudes \u2013 and, in particular, misperceptions \u2013 we also had our participants complete a battery of tests consisting of a 17-item basic science knowledge test (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2020; Miller, 2004), a 6-item Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005) as a measure of analytic (versus intuitive) thinking, a 5-item Bullshit Receptivity test (Pennycook, Cheyne, et al., 2015), and a 6-item numeracy test (Cokely, Galesic, Schulz, Ghazal, & Garcia-Retamero, 2012; Lipkus, Samsa, & Rimer, 2016). We present the correlations between our outcomes and the constituent measures of cognitive sophistication in the supplementary materials (Table S4).\nAs is evident from Table 2, overall cognitive sophistication (the composite of the 4\nmeasures) was a strong negative predictor of COVID-19 misperceptions (r\u2019s = -.34, -.40, -.46 in Canada, the U.K., and the U.S., respectively). In a post-hoc comparison of effect sizes using an rto-z transformation, cognitive sophistication more strongly predicted misperceptions than did ideology for the U.S., z = 3.44, p < .001, and U.K. samples, z = 5.50, p < .001 (this was only marginally significant in the Canadian sample, z = 1.63, p = .052).\nInterestingly, cognitive sophistication was not a strong or consistent predictor of COVID-19\nrisk perceptions or behavior change intentions (Table 2). Thus, even though individuals who are better at reasoning are less likely to believe falsehoods surrounding COVID-19 (which itself correlated with other COVID-19 attitudes), the factors that determine how seriously they are taking the crisis (beyond ideology) are more uncertain. Our findings are consistent with a recent study using an international convenience sample where performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) was negatively correlated with COVID-19 misperceptions and positively correlated with COVID-19 knowledge, but uncorrelated with worry about COVID-19 and behavior changes\nOther recent work by Stanley, Barr, Peters, and Seli (2020) found that, in a U.S. sample from Mechanical Turk, performance on the CRT correlated with lower belief that in a specific COVID19 misperception (namely, that it is a hoax) \u2013 consistent with what we find here (they did not report interactions with political ideology). However, Stanley et al. also found \u2013 inconsistent with our results \u2013 that more reflective individuals were also more likely to report intentions to change their behavior. Further complicating things, other work indicates that CRT is, if anything, negatively associated with concern about COVID-19 (Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang, & Rand, 2020) and negatively related to behavior change intentions once demographics are taken into account (Jordan et al., 2020). Thus, although there is convergence evidence that CRT is associated with lower misperceptions, future work is needed to further explore how (or if) cognitive sophistication associates with risk perceptions and behavior changes relating to COVID-19."}, {"heading": "Identity-protective cognition", "text": "Our data suggest that, at least in terms of common misperceptions about COVID-19,\ncognitive sophistication has a larger overall impact than ideology. However, there is another prominent theory that relates to this question that we have yet to address: Identity-protective cognition (Drummond & Fischhoff, 2017; Kahan, Jenkins\u2010Smith, & Braman, 2011; Kahan et al., 2012; Kahan et al., 2017; Landrum, Lull, Akin, Hasell, & Jamieson, 2017). This account proposes that ideology and cognitive sophistication actually interact to predict attitudes about science and misinformation, such that individuals who have the strongest reasoning capacities are the most politically polarized (this is sometimes referred to as \u201cmotivated System 2 reasoning\u201d). For example, whereas Democrats who are the most reflective and numerate believe that the risks associated with climate change are greater than those who are more intuitive and innumerate, the opposite pattern is evident among Republicans (Kahan et al., 2012). That is, the more cognitively sophisticated Republicans are actually less likely to hold beliefs that are consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change (see also: Drummond & Fischhoff, 2017; Kahan, 2013).\nThis research, however, faces the same criticism as research on the broad role of ideology\non science beliefs: It tends to focus on a small number of issues and it is therefore unclear how generalizable it is to other scientific issues. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that there is very little evidence that cognitive sophistication is associated with increased anti-science attitudes, even in cases where such attitudes are politically congenial (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2020; Pennycook et al., 2019). Furthermore, recent work in the context of political misinformation (\u201cfake news\u201d) shows that cognitive sophistication is associated with an increased capacity to discern between true and false content regardless of whether it is consistent or inconsistent with one\u2019s political identity (Bago, Rand, & Pennycook, 2019; Pennycook & Rand, 2019a). This is consistent with the work cited above that shows the benefits of cognitive sophistication (and analytic thinking specifically) for accurate belief formation (Pennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015).\nHere again, the COVID-19 crisis offers a unique possible test of two competing accounts:\nDoes cognitive sophistication lead to more accurate beliefs overall or is it primarily used to support ideologically motivated reasoning and, therefore, increased political polarization? To test this, we interacted ideology and cognitive sophistication separately for our four dependent variables in the three samples (see Table 4). Although political ideology was a predictor of\nno evidence whatsoever for an interaction between ideology and cognitive sophistication for any measure in any country (all \u03b2\u2019s < .06). The result is clear: Cognitive sophistication is associated with decreased misperceptions about COVID-19 for liberals and conservatives alike (and to the same degree) in all three countries \u2013 and is unrelated to risk perceptions and prevention behavior intentions regardless of ideology.\ncorrelation between key DVs and ideology across countries (with USA as a baseline).

Our results support this conclusion: Political ideology was a stronger predictor of attitudes relating to COVID-19 (including risk perceptions, behavior change intentions, misperceptions, and support for national leadership) in the U.S. than in the U.K. Interestingly, Canada and the U.S. were more similar.\nWe suggest that this differential politicization is driven by political elites and news\norganizations on the political right in the United States (but not the U.K.) consistently downplaying COVID-19 in the months proceeding our study. As an example, the correlation between trust in Fox News and (a) misperceptions in the U.S. sample was (r) .35 and (b) belief in the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s leadership was (r) .66 (both of which were robust to controlling for ideology). In the U.K., the correlation between trust in the Daily Mail (perhaps the closest comparator to Fox News) and (a) misperceptions was (r) .17 and (b) belief in the effectiveness of Johnson\u2019s leadership was (r) .22. Our results demonstrate the potentially life-and-death consequences of the politicization that has occurred in the United States. They also serve as a warning to the Canadian public about their own apparent politicization around matters where scientists and experts broadly agree.\nDespite this political polarization, cognitive sophistication \u2013 i.e., the quality of one\u2019s\nreasoning \u2013 was associated with lower misperceptions in all three countries. In fact, in both the U.S. and U.K., cognitive sophistication was a stronger predictor of resistance to misperceptions than was political ideology. Furthermore, we found no evidence in any country that cognitive sophistication was associated with stronger political polarization \u2013 thus, at least in terms of avoiding falsehoods about COVID-19, improving scientific literacy and reasoning skills seems an important pathway for inoculation even in the face of political polarization.\nThis research resonates with an important claim of science deficit models: That teaching\npeople the basics of science will lead to more acceptance and positive-attitude change. There is some evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach with genetically modified foods (McPhetres et al., 2019) and climate change (Ranney & Clark, 2016). Other research suggests that communicating basic facts, such as the level of scientific consensus around climate change (Linden et al., 2017) is also effective in promoting acceptance of anthropogenic global warming.\nHere, we observed an interesting pattern that both supports the conclusions of this research\nand suggests limits to it: Across all three countries combined, greater levels of cognitive sophistication was strongly associated with reduced levels of misconceptions, but not with risk perceptions or behaviour change intentions. This seems to suggest that being reflective, numerate, skeptical, and having basic science knowledge (or some combination of these things) is important for the ability to identify false information about the virus, but it may not be enough to determine what behaviours are most effective or to motivate one to change their behaviours. In fact, the only measures that correlated positively with behaviour change in our data were a lower number of misperceptions and a greater perception of risk (ranging from r = .10 to r = .52 across the three countries; see also Wise, Zbozinek, Michelini, Hagan, & Mobbs, 2020). Relatedly, in an international community sample, Harper, Satchell, Fido, and Latzman (2020) found that behavior change intentions relating to COVID-19 were most strongly predicted by fear of the disease.\ncommunication. Given the complexity and level of uncertainty regarding the risks, dangers, and future outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, science communicators may wish to focus on communicating consistent behaviours rather than teaching people how the virus works or trying to provide information on risk levels, transmission, or other complex factors. Particularly given the current uncertainty, clear and consistent messages regarding what people should and shouldn\u2019t do seems paramount. Fortunately, this seems to be a major focus of recent efforts. For example, there is some evidence that framing prevention behaviors as benefiting others is more effective than framing them as beneficial for oneself (Jordan et al., 2020), and that emphasizing empathy promotes physical distancing (Pfattheicher, Nockur, B\u00f6hm, Sassenrath, & Petersen, 2020).\nOur results also have various theoretical and empirical implications. The first is that, at least\nat this relatively early stage of the pandemic, there is a clear empirical distinction between the relative roles of ideology and cognitive sophistication for COVID-19 relative to global warming. Specifically, global warming is one of the few scientific issues where beliefs are more consistently predicted by political ideology (in the U.S.) than cognitive sophistication (McPhetres & Pennycook, 2020). Not coincidentally, global warming is also a unique issue where cognitive sophistication is actually associated with increased political polarization (Kahan et al., 2012; Kahan et al., 2017; McPhetres & Pennycook, 2020; Pennycook et al., 2019). Despite the similarities in the trajectory of messaging about global warming and COVID-19 from political elites in the U.S. \u2013 where the threat was initially downplayed and, later on, it was argued that the solution may be worse than the threat itself \u2013 we do not find parallels in the underlying psychology. Rather, much like other scientific issues (such as the false belief that vaccines cause autism or the belief that genetically modified foods are bad for one\u2019s health), COVID-19 misperceptions were more strongly related to cognitive sophistication than political ideology. Furthermore, we also found no evidence for identity-protective cognition (\u201cmotivated System 2 reasoning\u201d; c/o Kahan, 2013; Kahan et al., 2017) in the context of COVID-19 attitudes. This is consistent with recent criticisms of motivated reasoning (Druckman & McGrath, 2019; Pennycook & Rand, 2019a; Tappin, Pennycook, & Rand, 2019).\nHealth-related misinformation during pandemics can have many effects. It may lead people\nto not engage in social distancing by downplaying effects of the disease or even provide deadly incorrect advice (e.g., misinformation about drinking industrial alcohol reportedly led to hundred of deaths in Iran; The Associated Press, 2020). Hence, correcting misinformation could quite literally save lives. However, effectively correcting misinformation, health-related or other, after people read and believed it, is not so intuitive. Misinformation continues to influence people even after it was retracted (Ecker, Lewandowsky, & Tang, 2010; Johnson & Seifert, 1994). Perhaps more importantly, it is much easier to create falsehoods than to debunk them and, therefore, it is nearly impossible for fact-checkers to keep up with people who create misinformation. Pennycook, Bear, Collins, and Rand (2019) found that, although fact-checker warnings do reliably decrease belief in information (at the time of presentation; see also Clayton et al., 2019; Wiley, Ecker, O\u2019reilly, Reid, & Chang, 2019), people may believe (and share) headlines that have not yet been fact-checked more. Our findings suggest \u2013 in accordance with research on political misinformation (Bago et al., 2019; Pennycook & Rand, 2019a) \u2013 that nudging people to slow down and deliberate before making judgments about accuracy or sharing on social media could be an effective strategy\nstrategy see: Roozenbeek & Linden, 2019). Indeed, there is evidence that such strategies are effective for misinformation that is specifically related to COVID-19 (Pennycook, McPhetres, et al., 2020)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is posed to reveal a great deal about the strengths and\nweaknesses of human psychology. Social scientists have a responsibility to learn as much as possible about people beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors relating to the global pandemic so that we can be more prepared the next time that humanity has to face similar struggles. The present work indicates that political polarization can occur quite rapidly and even in the face of a collective crisis (as in the U.S.), but also that it is not inevitable (as in the U.K.). Furthermore, at least in terms of misperceptions, our findings further support past research on the importance of nurturing competency in cognitive processing as a pre-inoculation against polarized messaging from political elites and vested interests. Future research should continue to track these developments and further investigate pragmatic long-term interventions that can increase people\u2019s basic reasoning competencies.\nMaterials and Methods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "We recruited 750 participants each in Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. via Prolific on March\n24th, 2020. The U.K. and U.S. samples were recruited to be \u201crepresentative\u201d, which means that Prolific quota-matches the sample to the national populations (via census data) across age, sex, and ethnicity. Prolific does not offer quota-matching for Canadian samples. In total, 753 (Canada), 765 (U.K.), and 759 (U.S.) entered the survey. However, some participants did not complete the survey (N\u2019s = 5, 11, 17) and some did not indicate residing in the target country (N\u2019s = 2, 1, 1). We also included 3 attention check questions (see https://osf.io/3a497/ for full materials; Berinsky, Margolis, & Sances, 2014). Following our preregistration, we removed participants who failed 2 or more of these (N\u2019s = 104, 111, 52). This left us with final sample sizes of 644 (Canada), 642 (U.K.), and 689 (U.S.A.). Full demographic breakdowns can be found in Table S1 of the supplementary materials."}, {"heading": "Materials and Procedure", "text": "Full materials and a copy of the Qualtrics survey file can be found on OSF\n(https://osf.io/3a497/) and descriptive statistics are available in the supplementary materials (Table S2). Measures are listed in order of presentation, unless otherwise stated. At the beginning of the study, participants were told that we had a number of questions about COVID-19, \u201cthe novel coronavirus that has recently been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.\u201d We then informed the participants that we will refer to COVID-19 as \u201ccoronavirus\u201d throughout the survey for simplicity.\nCOVID-19 behavior change intentions. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which\nthey intended to change their behavior in light of the coronavirus outbreak using a sliding scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 100 (strongly agree) (Jordan et al., 2020). We first asked 7 questions about stopping the spread through cleanliness (we didn\u2019t mention the term cleanliness) (e.g., \u201cwash my hands more often\u201d, \u201cstop hugging other people\u201d, \u201ctry my hardest to avoid touching my face),\n\u201ccover my mouth when I cough and sneeze\u201d). We then asked 10 questions about social distancing and, specifically, things that they were intending to avoid (e.g., \u201cgoing to restaurants\u201d, \u201cgoing to the grocery store\u201d). This was done on a scale from 0 (I will make no effort to avoid this activity) to 100 (I will completely avoid this activity). We also asked people to indicate which of these 10 activities they would engage in even if there was no coronavirus outbreak (e.g., some people may not go to restaurants regardless of the virus). We did not preregister any re-analysis of the data using this extra question, however. Indeed, the full behavior change intention measure was quite reliable across all three countries: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .86 (Canada), .85 (U.K.), and .88 (U.S.). At the very beginning of the study, participants were asked to select \u201c67\u201d on a sliding scale to ensure that their browser/device allowed them to use sliders. We two data for the intentions measure for 2 participants from the U.K. and 2 from the U.S. because they failed this check question (those who answered 66 or 68 were retained).\nCOVID-19 risk perceptions. We asked 8 questions related to risk perceptions (e.g., \u201cThe\ncoronavirus poses a major threat to the public\u201d, \u201cI think the situation with the coronavirus is overblown (reverse scored)\u201d). The scale had acceptable reliability in all three countries: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .73 (Canada), .77 (U.K.), and .83 (U.S.). We also asked three \u201cpersonal\u201d risk questions as an exploratory measure (e.g., \u201cBecause of my age and/or pre-existing conditions, I am likely to have serious symptoms if I were to contract the coronavirus\u201d) \u2013 however, we did not preregister any analyses for this measure. Participants responded on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), with 4 (neither agree nor disagree) as the scale midpoint. We also included two exploratory questions about the trade-off between being coronavirus restrictions and the economy (e.g., \u201cThe country should *not* be shut down because of the coronavirus \u2013 the economic costs are too high\u201d). The risk perception questions were randomized with the misperception questions.\nCOVID-19 misperceptions. The full list of misperceptions is available in Table 1. As\nmentioned, the full misperception measure had strong reliability in each country: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .80 (Canada), .79 (U.K.), and .84 (U.S.).\nNational leadership. Finally, we asked people 10 questions about how happy they are with\nthe leadership of their respective countries. The questions were identical for the three countries except that the leader was exchanged: Prime Minister Trudeau / Prime Minister Johnson / President Trump. The questions asked about a variety of factors (e.g., \u201c[Leader] is a good source of information regarding the coronavirus\u201d, \u201c[Leader] is doing all he can to prevent further spread of the coronavirus]\u201d, etc.) and were highly reliable in each country: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .92 (Canada), .94 (U.K.), and .98 (U.S.). We also asked 4 exploratory questions that relate to nationalism (e.g., \u201c[America] is the most prepared nation with respect to the coronavirus outbreak\u201d).\nCognitive sophistication. The four cognitive sophistication measures were presented in a\nrandom order for each participant. After each of the three tests (i.e., excluding the bullshit receptivity measure), participants were asked to estimate their accuracy.\nWe assessed science knowledge using 17 true/false question test (McPhetres & Pennycook,\n2020; Miller, 2004) with questions like \u201cElectrons are smaller than atoms\u201d and \u201cAntibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria\u201d (this was the only item with direct relevance for COVID-19). The\n(U.K.), and .77 (U.S.).\nTo assess the disposition to engage in analytic and reflective thinking, we used a 6-item\nCognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005). The CRT consists of questions that trigger an automatic intuitive answer that is incorrect (e.g., \u201cIf you are running a race and pass the person in second place, what place are you in?\u201d \u2013 the intuitive answer is 1st place but the correct answer is 2nd place) and therefore requires reflection to override (Pennycook, Cheyne, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2016). Our measure consisted of a re-worded version of the original 3 items (Shenhav, Rand, & Greene, 2012) and 3 items from a non-numeric CRT (we excluded the \u2018hole\u2019 item; Thomson & Oppenheimer, 2016). The CRT was sufficiently reliable in each country: Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .70 (Canada), .70 (U.K.), and .72 (U.S.).\nNumeracy was assessed using 3 items from the Berlin Numeracy Test (Cokely et al., 2012)\nand 3 items from the Lipkus numeracy scale (Lipkus et al., 2016). The questions all pertained to understanding probabilities that varied in difficulty (e.g., \u201cImagine we are throwing a five-sided die 50 times. On average, out of these 50 throws how many times would this five-sided die show an odd number (1, 3 or 5)?\u201d). The numeracy test was sufficiently reliable in each country (albeit marginally so in Canada): Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .65 (Canada), .71 (U.K.), and .73 (U.S.).\nFinally, we included a measure of one\u2019s general receptivity to bullshit (Pennycook, Cheyne,\net al., 2015). This consisted of 5 sentences that were randomly using a corpus of buzzwords (e.g., \u201cThe invisible is beyond new timelessness\u201d) \u2013 i.e., pseudo-profound bullshit. Participants rated the profundity of the sentences on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all profound) to 5 (very profound). This scale was then reverse-scored to put it in-line with the other cognitive sophistication measures. The bullshit receptivity scale, despite using a specific form of bullshit, correlates with a wide range of epistemically suspect beliefs (including belief in fake news; Pennycook & Rand, 2019b) and therefore appears to measure general receptivity to bullshit.\nTrust. As additional exploratory measures (their analysis was not included in the\npreregistration), we asked the participants to indicate their degree of trust in various information sources using a 5-point scale from \u201cnone at all\u201d to \u201ca great deal\u201d. Participants from all countries were first asked about the following sources: Friends and family, Social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), Scientists, Medical experts, The Center for Disease Control (note: this was incorrectly given to participants from all 3 countries despite being American-specific), and Medical doctors (e.g., general practitioners). We then asked them to indicate how much they trust various news sources specific to their own country. A full breakdown of these sources and correlations with COVID-19 measures are presented in supplementary materials (Tables S6-S7). Broadly, those who trust scientists and medical experts/doctors less and conservative media sources more tend to be are more skeptical of COVID-19 and more likely to hold misperceptions.\nPolitical ideology. Participants in all three countries were then asked two questions about\npolitical ideology that were then combined to create our conservatism measure: \u201cOn social issues I am: (1) Strongly Liberal, (2) Somewhat Liberal, (3) Moderate, (4) Somewhat Conservative, and (5) Strongly Conservative\u201d and \u201cOn economic issues I am: (1) Strongly Liberal, (2) Somewhat Liberal, (3) Moderate, (4) Somewhat Conservative, and (5) Strongly Conservative\u201d. We created the \u201dliberal\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d, and \u201cconservative\u201d group categories (e.g., in Figures 1-4) by putting"}, {"heading": "3 in the \u2018conservative\u2019 category, and exactly 3 into the \u2018moderate\u2019 category.", "text": "In addition to the ideology measure, we also asked several country-specific questions.\nParticipants in each country were asked about which federal party they align with (options changing depending on their country). They were also asked 3 questions about the national leadership in their respective country: 1) a feeling thermometer (0 = extremely unfavorable feeling; 100 = extremely favorable feeling), 2) strength of support or opposition (1 = strongly oppose; 7 = strongly support), and 3) likelihood of voting for the leader in the future (1 = extremely unlikely, 7 = extremely likely).\nDemographics. Finally, at the end of the survey we asked a variety of demographic\nquestions. This included age, education, income, gender, and two questions about health."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments and Competing interests", "text": "We would like to thank Antonio A.

Methods: The cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in March 2020 in Sargodha, Pakistan. Sample was consisted of 200 male and female adults age ranged between 21-50 years. A self-constructed piloted semi structured questionnaire was used for data collection. SPSS 24 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 200 participant, 148 (74 %) were male and 52(26%) were female. 98 (49 %) were between 21-35 years of age while 102 (51%) were between 35-50 years. Overall, 174 (87%) participants knew about COVID-19; 170 (85 %) believed that the disease is dangerous for elderly or already sick people, and 134(67%) thought that they know about the symptoms 144 (97 %) male and 63 (33 %) were female were aware about the common symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough and tiredness. Conclusion: There is a need to improve the awareness of people regarding the symptoms and seriousness of the disease so that people take preventive measure to protect themselves and rapid transmission of the disease could be controlled. Key words: Covid-19, pandemic, knowledge, symptoms, global health emergency\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic outbreak originated in China in December, 2019 [1]. The World health organization in February, 2020 declared it a global health emergency [2] and on 11th march recognized a pandemic [3]. The disease has been spreading all over the word as of 3 April 2020; in more than 180 countries, the reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 are more than 1.01 million [4] COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease with symptoms of runny nose, nasal congestion, fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, diarrhea and myalgia [5]. In severe cases, acute respiratory syndrome, coagulopathy or impairment in forming blood clots, metabolic acidosis or septic shocks may also develop [6]. The findings of a study which was conducted in December, 2019 to explore the clinical features of the disease reported that out of 41 patients, most prevalent symptoms reported by patents were fever (98%), cough (76%), and fatigue (44%). Whereas the less common symptoms were septum production (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%) and diarrhea (3%) [7]. Till now the novel COVID-19 has no specific treatment therefore, physicians are mainly relaying on a variety of treatment techniques including antiviral drugs, steroids, immunosuppressant plasma from recovered patients [8], psychological support and traditional Chinese medicines [5]. Pakistan is a densely populated country that is dealings with many challenges including efforts to reform the crippling economy, untapped public health structure, weak institutes and poor governance at local level. All these factors make Pakistan that is already facing the pandemic, more vulnerable toward the devastating consequences of COVID-19. There are more than 7000 confirmed cases, and 135 people have lost their life [9]. The Govt. is trying to promote awareness in people all across the country. Lock down has been implemented to restrict the mobility of people. They are also continuously advising people to stay at home and to maintain social distance\nserious attitude can be seen from time to time. Due to lack of precautionary measures number of cases are increasing.\n2. Subjects & Methods\nThe current cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in March 2020 in Sargodha, Pakistan. Convenience sampling technique was used to draw the sample of 200 adolescents and adults including both male and female. A semi-structured questionnaire was constructed by carefully reading the material available on the disease and validated by trying out among the participants. Those participants were excluded from advance analysis. The questionnaire consisted of four sections including: demographic details such gender, age, education, working status and locality, awareness about COVID-19 ( 12 questions), knowledge about symptoms of COVID-19 (9 questions), and preventive practices (9 questions) [3,8]. Approval from institutional review committee was obtained. Participants were contacted at various places including educational institutes, offices, or rural areas. They were informed about the nature and rationale of the study and informed consents were obtained from all of them. Participants were assured about the confidentiality of their data. The semi-structured questionnaire was given to the participants the perception, knowledge and preventive strategies were assessed using two options \u2013 yes, and no. Data were analyzed using SPSS 24. Frequencies and percentages were computed for all variables. Chi-square test was used to find out the association between the two groups (male and female) and their knowledge of COVID-19.\n3. Results\nrefused to participate.

Discussion\nAs COVID-19 is spreading very rapidly all around the world and causing serious health issues, there is a dire need to make public aware of the precautionary measure so that they can save themselves from this dangerous disease. The present study was conducted to explore the risk perception, knowledge of symptoms and preventive strategies among general public in Pakistan. Pakistan is a developing country and most part of the population are living in the rural areas.\nbetween 21 to 50 years. The main reason for this broad age range was to get a more comprehensive view of the people\u2019s level of awareness about the disease, knowledge about symptoms and preventive techniques. People having different education levels were included in the study, most of them belonged to urban areas. Out of 200 participants 87% reported that they had heard about corona virus, and 67% confirmed that they know about the symptoms of the COVID-19. 55% believed that this is not a serious problem and just like a mild flue in nature. 76% participant were of the opinion that the virus can only survive in cold weather. 85% were sure that the disease was alarming for elderly only while 32% considered it life threatening for all age groups. 67 % participants have given their view in favor of eating ginger to treat the COVID-19 symptoms, while 68 % reporting that drinking hot water has no effects on the symptoms. Further it was observed that male participants are more aware of the symptoms of COVID-19 as compared to female respondents. One reason of this difference between the level of knowledge between the two gender might be our traditional gender roles. In patriarchal Pakistani society, men are considered as the figure head who are responsible for the decision making about family while women are considered to be focused more on household and taking care of family and home [10] Men have more social interaction as they have to go outside to earn for the family so they get more opportunity to interact and discuss current news including psychosocial issues with others and update their knowledge. Though this social mobility increases their knowledge but also make them more vulnerable as they have to go out of home more frequently to meet the different needs of their family as recently reported by Govt of Sindh, that during the pandemic 68.3% male and 31.7% females were affected by the coronavirus [11]. Another reason of males being more knowledgeable about symptoms of COVID-19 could be that they spend more time on watching\nchannels as compared to 22 % female viewers therefore, male viewers dominate the watching on news channels then female viewers. It was further recounted that in cable or satellite tv viewers, males dominated the viewership by 11 % as 29% males watch news channels whereas female viewers are only 18% of the sample. In the current study, it was further found that though people have many misconceptions and ambiguities about the disease and its symptoms they were aware of the preventive strategies as 83 % reported that regularly cleaning and washing hands and avoiding to touch face, eyes and mouth are important. 78 % were in favor of wearing mask while 77% in social isolation. 71 % participants considered lockdown necessary while 68 % were in view of avoiding going outside unnecessarily. The main reason for having good awareness about the preventive strategies is likely to be news channels and media coverage. Govt is also trying to spread awareness about the disease and emphasizing to stay home and maintain social distance and 65% Pakistani reported satisfied with the performance of the govt [13]. One main area in which govt and health authorities need to pay attention is to educate people about the seriousness of the disease and its symptoms as still 62% Pakistanis believe that the threat of coronavirus has been exaggerated. This is largely based on some conspiracy theories that circulate through misinformation and digital fake news. There are several methods that Gov can employ to tackle this issue of misinformation. For example, Gov can encourage TV news hosts to bring more health case specialists onto their programs. Similarly, they can run their media campaigns in which correct information is given to the public. Govt health departments and hospitals can also be used for the same purpose. The strength of the present study it\u2019s the first in its nature which made an effort to cover all the possible extents related to the awareness, knowledge of symptoms and prevention about COVID-\ngeneral public. Nonetheless, the research had certain limitations as it was conducted on a small sample which was drawn using convenience sample which might diminish the generalizability of the findings.

METHOD: A national sample of participants were randomly assigned to an intervention and reported demographics and COVID-19 beliefs. Two weeks later, they were contacted and reported on social distancing behaviors over the previous two weeks. RESULTS: Neither intervention increased social distancing. Concern over self-infection, economic concerns, death, and political ideology did not predict social distancing.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, is considered a pandemic by the World Health\nOrganization (2). With an R0 potentially greater than 3 (3), COVID-19 is considered extremely contagious (4). To suppress infections by the contagion and decrease hospital overflow, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has strongly recommended individuals practice social distancing (SD; 5). Social Distancing\nThe Center for Disease Control stated that one of the best ways to avoid exposure to\nCOVID-19 is through social distancing (5). This includes keeping space (six feet, or at least two arms\u2019 length) from others when outside the home, not gathering in groups, and avoiding crowded places (5). Early reports show that spreading of the virus has slowed through social distancing, with a \u201cFlattening of the Curve\u201d effect in cities hit hardest, including New York (6) and Seattle (7). While the number of infections appears to be flattening, authorities urge individuals to continue to prevent unnecessary exposure through social distancing. Thus, identifying mechanisms that promote social distancing is important for public health. Personalize Normative Feedback\nPersonalized normative feedback (PNF) is a brief intervention designed to target\nmisconceptions regarding problematic behaviors by highlighting the discrepancy between perceived and actual social norms (8). This intervention has been most commonly used to reduce heavy alcohol consumption (9). However, PNF has also been used to target other problematic\nhealth behaviors, including sexual victimization (10), gambling (11), prescription stimulant use (12), cannabis use (13), and residential water conservation (14). Deviance Regulation Theory\nDeviance regulation theory (DRT) is another promising approach that has been used to\nchange various problematic health behaviors. DRT is a social psychology theory which posits that individuals will strive to \u201cstand-out\u201d in desirable ways or to \u201cfit-in\u201d to avoid deviating from social norms in undesirable ways, as a way to maintain a desired self-image (15). DRT has been most utilized to target substance use behaviors (16, 17). However, DRT has been used to target various other health behaviors including, unsafe driving (18), risk-taking (19), flu immunizations, and condom use (15). Overview\nThe current study had two aims. First, we tested three norm-based interventions to\nincrease social distancing behavior. The first intervention used PNF to increase social distancing norms, the second and third used DRT, but each relied on different norm types (see supplementary material). All three interventions were tested against an assessment only control. Second, we examined the extent to which pre-intervention concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic predicted engagement in social distancing practices over the next two weeks. Data were collected at two time points. At T1, participants (n = 480) completed demographic information and an assessment of COVID-19 concerns. They were then randomized to one of four conditions (PNF, DRT1, DRT2, or control). Participants in the PNF intervention received feedback on their normative beliefs about social distancing among US citizens based on data from the CDC. In the DRT conditions, participants received positive information about individuals engaging in social distancing if they believed social distancing was uncommon\namong US citizens (DRT group 1) or uncommon among close family/friends (DRT group 2). Alternatively, they received negative information about individuals who are NOT engaging in social distancing if they believed social distancing was common among US citizens (DRT group 1) or common among close family/friends (DRT group 2). Participants were contacted two weeks after completing T1 (n = 442 completed follow-up at T2) and reported on social distancing practices over the past two weeks.\nMethod"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants (n = 480 at T1; n = 442 at T2) were individuals residing in the United States,\nwith nearly all 50 states and 10 territories represented. Average age was 36.43 (SD = 12.62). The sample was predominantly female (80.54%). Race and ethnicity were: White/Caucasian = 75.11%, Black/African American= 9.82%, American Indian/Alaskan Native = 0.46%, Asian = 8.68%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander = 0.46%, Mixed Race or Other Race = 5.48; and Hispanic or Latino/a = 10.23%. Political ideology was roughly evenly distributed (M = 3.35, SD = 1.76; range 0 = extremely liberal to 7 = extremely conservative). This study was approved by the university\u2019s institutional review board. Procedure\nThis study included a screen/intervention (T1, Week of April 13) and a two-week follow-\nup (T2, Week of April 27). At T1, participants were recruited through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. Participants completed an online survey entitled \u201cSocial Distancing During COVID-19.\u201d In the survey, participants were asked to provide demographic information, beliefs about COVID-19, and social distancing behaviors. Participants were then randomly assigned a condition, DRT1, DRT2, PNF, or control. At T2, participants were contacted to\nprovide information regarding social distancing behaviors over the past two weeks. All data and materials for this study can be found at: https://osf.io/5afs2/ Interventions\nPNF. Participants in the PNF group received the same normative questions as the DRT\ngroup. After rating their descriptive norms for SD, participants were directed to a new page that presents them with (a) their norms and (b) the actual percent of individuals in the US engaging in SD. For example, if a participant selected 20%, the next image would show their percent in bar graph format next to a second bar graph of 70%, highlighting the discrepancy between the two. Text would state: \u201cActually, over 70% of the population are engaging in some form of social distancing, with 95% of individuals making at least some small changes in accordance with CDC guidelines.\u201d The 70% statistic was calculated based off a survey by Gallup Panel (20).\nDRT Conditions. DRT condition 1: At T1, participants were asked \u201cWhat percent of individuals in the US\ndo you believe are engaged in social distancing currently due to COVID-19?\u201d They responded on a sliding scale from 0% to 100%. Individuals who endorsed 50% or less received a message highlighting the positive aspects of others that actively engage in SD. Individuals who reported greater than 50% received information highlighting the negative aspects of others who DO NOT engage in SD.\nDRT condition 2. At T1, participants were asked \u201cHow often do you believe people in\nyour social group (ex: friends, family, religious groups, clubs, etc.) are engaged in social distancing currently due to COVID-19?\u201d and reported their answer on an 8-point Likert scale ranging from \u2018Never\u2019 to \u2018Always.\u2019 Individuals who endorsed a \u201csometimes or less\u201d (range 1- 4) received a message highlighting the positive aspects of others that actively engage in SD.\nIndividuals who endorsed \u201csometimes or more\u201d (range 5 - 8) received information highlighting the negative aspects of others who DO NOT engage in SD.\nExamples of the positive messages included: \u201care seen as socially responsible\u201d, \u201care\nviewed as family-oriented and place family values first\u201d, and \u201care seen as self-sacrificing for the greater good of others\u201d. Example negative messages included: \u201ctend to be disliked socially by others\u201d, \u201care seen by others as amoral and uncompassionate\u201d, and \u201care viewed as dangerous and arrogant\u201d. After this intervention, participants provided their opinion as to why individuals are viewed either more positively for engaging in SD or more negatively for not engaging in SD. Measures\nDemographics. At Time 1, demographic information about the participant\u2019s age, sex,\ngender, ethnicity, race, employment, education, and political ideology was collected.\nCOVID Belief Inventory. This 10-item inventory was created for the current study to\ninvestigate views, specifically fears, regarding COVID-19. The measure was designed to tap into five basic concerns, and began with \u201cHow afraid are you in regards to...\u201d followed by concerns associated with self-infection (e.g.: \u201ccontracting COVID-19 yourself\u201d, \u201cBecoming seriously ill with COVID-19\u201d; \u03b1 = .91) infecting others (e.g. \u201cunknowingly giving someone you love COVID-19\u201d, someone you love becoming seriously ill\u201d; \u03b1 = .86), economic concerns (e.g.: \u201ceconomic effects caused by COVID-19\u201d, \u201cJob security related to COVID-19\u201d; \u03b1 = .80), socializing (e.g.: \u201cdisruptions in social activity caused by COVID-19\u201d, \u201cplans [such as concerts, vacations, conferences, festivals, sports] being cancelled\u201d ; \u03b1 = .82) and concerns of death due to COVID-19 (e.g.: \u201cdying from COVID-19\u201d, \u201c\u201dsomeone you love dying from COVID-19\u201d; \u03b1 = .66).\nSocial Distancing Practices. We created a social distancing practices measure using\nCDC recommendations for social distancing. The 20-item measure referenced the participant\u2019s behavior over the past two weeks. The measure asked, \u201chow often do you engage in each the following social distancing strategies?\u201d followed by 20 behaviors. Examples include: \u201cavoiding all in-person social gatherings, such as birthday parties, happy hours, and game nights (even with a small group of people)\u201d, and \u201cavoid touching (hugs, kisses, handshakes, holding hands) other people, including family and friends\u201d. Response were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = never to 5 = always). The measure showed good internal consistency (\u03b1 = .92). Data Preparation and Analysis Plan\nData were examined for univariate and multivariate outliers, leverage, and influence.\nThree potentially problematic observations were identified. Analyses conducted both with and without these observations indicate no substantial change to any parameters, though removing them led to a slight (1%) increase in variance accounted for. Thus, all observations were retained in the final analysis. Data were analyzed in Mplus 8.4 using the Bayes estimator with a conservative convergence criterion of .001. All parameters used noninformative priors. The MCMC estimation proceeded in two chains. Final convergence was determined by potential scale reduction (PSR). Following convergence, trace plots were examined to identify potential issues in the mixing of the MCMC chains. Below we report Bayesian 95% credibility intervals (95% BCI) for the posterior distributions.\nResults\nFor the primary analysis, social distancing frequency over the last two weeks was\nregressed onto the three intervention conditions (dummy coded with Control as the reference group) and the five COVID-19 concern variables. Biological sex, political ideology, and whether\nor not the person was deemed an essential worker, were added as model covariates. The initial model converged in 1,300 iterations. The model was reestimated using 5,000 burner iterations followed by 5,000 estimation iterations (PSR = 1.000). The final model (see Table 1) showed good fit to the data, 95% CI of the \u0394 between observed and replicated \u03c72 = -13.95 to 14.90, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00. Biological sex and being an essential employee were associated with more social distancing practices over the last two weeks. Political ideology did not predict social distancing. The model accounted for 16% of the variance in SD over the last two weeks.\nIntervention Effects. Neither of the DRT based interventions had an effect on future\nsocial distancing practices (relative to control). However, PNF led to less social distancing practices, relative to control (\u03b2 = -0.12, 95% BCI: -0.217, -0.022; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.30; see Figure 1).\nProspective Prediction of Social Distancing via COVID-19 beliefs. Of the five\nCOVID-19 concern variables assessed at T1, only two predicted social distancing behaviors over the next two weeks. Concern of infecting others was prospectively associated with more social distancing over the next two weeks (\u03b2 = 0.22, 95% BCI: 0.089, 0.346). In contrast, concerns over disruptions in social activities was prospectively associated with less social distancing over the next two weeks (\u03b2 = -0.16, 95% BCI: -0.259, -0.050). Concerns over the economy (\u03b2 = -0.02), fear of self-infection (\u03b2 = -0.07), and fear of death (\u03b2 = -0.05) did not prospectively predict social distancing.\nDiscussion\nThe current study had two aims. First, we tested three norm-based interventions to\nincrease social distancing practices. Second, we examined five potential concerns related to\nCOVID-19 infection as prospective predictors of social distancing practices over the next two weeks. None of the interventions resulted in more social distancing, and one of the interventions (PNF) actually led to less social distancing. Regarding concerns over COVID-19 infection, only two beliefs, concern of infecting others (positively) and concern of missing out on social events (negatively), predicted future social distancing practices.\nThe lack of positive effects of the interventions suggest that simple norm-based\napproaches may be, at best, ineffective, or at worst, iatrogenic. There are examples in the literature of normative feedback approaches having unanticipated, and even negative effects (21). In addition, some recent research has indicated that PNF types of approaches may not be as effective as once thought (22). Perhaps the approach used here of referencing \u201cother Americans\u201d left too wide a reference group. However, the DRT intervention tried both approaches, using a proximal group norm and a distal group norm, neither of which was any different from the control condition. It seems more likely that these sorts of interventions are applicable to behaviors that are less polarizing (e.g., safe drinking practices). Indeed, the elaboration likelihood model (23) suggests that change occurs when information is processed via a central route in which individuals have both the motivation and ability to process the information. This is particularly important for issues that are especially polarizing (24). Simple norm-based interventions likely operate via a peripheral route, where little processing is required. However, acceptance of the message requires additional resources (e.g., abundance of information, expertise by the source, etc.). It seems likely that the minimal information presented via computer screen, in the absence of a credible source, is simply not enough to persuade behavior change. One must wonder, however, if an intervention such as this could be effective through a stepped process whereby an individual identifies who they consider a credible source, followed\nby an adaptive message from that source. While this remains an area for future research, we would strongly caution against using norm-based approaches without substantial testing.\nThe findings regarding the concerns over COVID-19 infection were the most interesting\naspect of the study. Concern over infecting others led to more social distancing while concern over missing social activities such as concerts, vacations, and sporting events or disruptions in social activities led to less social distancing practices over the next two weeks. While this appears to tell a story of selfishness vs. self-sacrifice for the greater good, we feel it is more complex and nuanced than this. Indeed, many social activities are inherently linked to important milestones (e.g., graduations, weddings, etc.) as well as important social activities that promote well-being. Consistent with the finding that concerns of infecting others predicted greater social distancing, being an essential employee was also prospectively associated with greater personal efforts at social distancing, likely due to the increased risk of infection at one\u2019s worksite and spread to family members and friends. Interestingly, economic concerns (e.g., job security, personal income, etc.) did not predict social distancing practices. Nor did fear of infecting one\u2019s self or death from COVID-19. In these polarizing times, it is worth noting that two of the most oft cited reasons for individual\u2019s attitudes about social distancing (fear of infection and economic concerns) do not appear to predict social distancing practices at all. Indeed, economic concerns were the weakest predictor in the model. Similarly, despite this being a polarizing issue, political ideology did not predict social distancing behaviors after controlling for all other variables in the model. Thus, interventions seeking to increase social distancing practices might instead appeal to the desire to prevent others from becoming ill and/or to help alleviate concerns of missed social activities.\nThis study is not without limitations. Though the sample was recruited from a broad\nnational base with a normal distribution across the political spectrum, it was still limited to active social media users. Further, the sample was predominantly female. Though we controlled for biological sex, this remains an issue \u2013 especially considering women engaged in more social distancing practices. Finally, this study did not take place in a media vacuum. Throughout the two weeks between T1 and T2 there was significant societal and political unrest aimed at the very topic under study. It\u2019s unclear how this may have affected the overall outcomes at T2. Indeed, these findings may not generalize to countries where the pandemic was handled differently. Nonetheless, these findings offer some explanation for the current social distancing climate and may inform future pandemic responses.\nReferences\n1.

Examples include influenza pandemics (Gagnon, Acosta, Madrenas, & Miller, 2015) and the HIV-AIDS pandemic (Merson, 2006). At the time of this study in 2020, humanity is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO, 2020) which has to this date killed around 150,000 people. During a pandemic, most of individuals uphold protective practices and take precautionary actions such as social distancing to avoid contagion (Ibuka, Chapman, Meyers, Li, & Galvani, 2010; Brug, Aro, & Richardus, 2009). However, some individuals do not take such behavior seriously, endangering their own lives and those of others (Kamate et al., 2010; Van, McLaws, Crimmins, MacIntyre, & Seale, 2010).\nOne of the variables that predict the types of action people employ is personality type.\nExisting studies have attested to the association between personality type and various kinds of behaviors. For instance, Boone, De Brabander, and Van Witteloostuijn (1999) demonstrated that personality has a substantial impact on cooperative behavior, such as following group rules and helping group members (Tyler & Blader, 2001). Salgado (2002) showed that the big five personality traits predict deviant behavior, such as violating institutional rules.\nPersonality traits are also associated with health behavior. For example, individuals who\nscore high on neuroticism are often worried about their health (Van Dijk et al., 2016) and therefore more likely to maintain good health habits such as oral hygiene (Shanker, Mohamed, Hegde, & Kumar, 2013; Meshram, Gattani, Shewale, & Bodele, 2017). Mortensen, Becker,\nagreeableness, extraversion, and openness to experience are more inclined to avoid infectious diseases. Bogg and Roberts (2004) reported that conscientiousness is linked to healthy behaviors, such as avoidance of risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.\nIn the context of a pandemic, people engage in behavioral practices to protect themselves\nfrom infection; these include behaviors such as social distancing and increased personal hygiene practices (Reluga, 2010; Cowling et al., 2010). Social distancing refers to practices implemented by individuals to avoid contagion (Caley, Philp, & McCracken, 2008), such as reducing contact frequency with others (Reluga, 2010), keeping adequate space between themselves and others when communicating face to face (Morrison, & Yardley, 2009), staying at home for extended periods, and avoiding crowds (Glass, Glass, Beyeler, & Min,2006). Some studies found that voluntarily adopting social distancing is related to personality traits. For example, Jones and Salathe (2009) demonstrated that anxiety could predict engaging in protective behavior, such as avoiding crowded places.\nSeveral studies also found gender differences in the precautionary behaviors to avoid\ninfection. For example, women are more likely to endorse social distancing and maintain personal hygiene practices than men (Park, Cheong, Son, Kim, & Ha, 2010; Liao Cowling, Lam, Ng, & Fielding, 2010). Moran and Del Valle (2016) demonstrated that\u2014compared with men\u2014 women are more likely avoid crowds and physical contact with others to avoid respiratory pandemic diseases.\nThe implementation of health protective behavior such as social distancing is also related\nto risk perception (Caley et al., 2009; Poletti, Ajelli, & Merler, 2012; Pistone et al., 2007), which is defined as one\u2019s assessments of hazardous objects or activities (Slovic, Fischhoff, &\npandemic disease, such as an influenza pandemic, risk perception is associated with protective behaviors such as frequent hand washing and avoidance of hand shaking.\nIn Arab culture, people do not recognize\u2014and may have never experienced\u2014social\ndistancing; this is due to the collectivistic characteristics of Arab societies (Mourad & Abdella Carolan, 2010). Therefore, we ask the following questions: in the context of a respiratory disease pandemic such as COVID-19, to what extent do Arabs practice social distancing? What are the predictors of social distancing to avoid COVID-19 infection in an Arab society? Are there gender differences in social distancing?\nReferring to the above, this study aims to investigate the impact of personality traits, risk\nperception, and personal hygiene practices on social distancing to avoid COVID-19 infection."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Data were collected online by a snowball sampling method and the target population was\nresidents of Qatar.

This study aimed to ascertain the main determinants of social distancing adopted by Arab residents in Qatar to avoid infection with the pandemic disease COVID-19.\nReferring particularly to the association between personality traits and social distancing,\nthe results show that agreeableness is negatively associated with social distancing, which indicates that individuals who are more sociable and prefer to participate in social events\u2014such as volunteering activities and social interactions\u2014are less likely to practice social distancing to avoid infectious disease. This behavior may increase their likelihood of being infected with COVID-19. Furthermore, conscientiousness and neuroticism were shown to be positively associated with adopting social distancing to avoid COVID-19 infection. This means that individuals who are more inclined to comply with social norms and those who develop anxious and fearful feelings tend to practice social distancing.\nwith lower rates of personal hygiene practices (handwashing) and higher levels of social distancing to avoid H1N1 contagion. Moreover, Trobst, Herbst, Masters, and Costa Jr (2002) found that individuals who score high on neuroticism tend to adopt risky sexual practices. The inconsistency in the behavior of people prone to neuroticism when dealing with a pandemic disease may be associated with their level of neuroticism. For example, individuals with high levels of fear and anxiety tend to adopt denial as a psychological defense mechanism to mitigate their fears; this means that they practice risky behaviors to feel psychologically secure (Florian & Mikulincer, 1997; Aronson, 2008; Peek, Sayad, & Markwardt, 2008).\nIn addition to the findings on personality traits, the results show that risk perception\npredicts social distancing. Hence, individuals who consider the pandemic disease (COVID-19) to be a serious danger are more inclined to adopt social distancing practices to avoid infection. These results corroborate those of previous studies (e.g., Brug et. al., 2009; Ibuka et. al., 2010; Walter, B\u00f6hmer, Reiter, Krause, & Wichmann, 2012). Furthermore, when an individual perceives a health risk factor, they react to the risk by attempting to find solutions to avoid it. These solutions represent avoidance behavior that is adopted to survive an infectious disease. Our results also show that women are more likely to practice social distancing than men; these results coincide with those of prior studies (e.g., Liao et. al., 2010; Park et. al., 2010; Moran & Del Valle, 2016).\nThe participants who declared that they maintain good personal hygiene practices were\nshown to be more likely to adopt social distancing. This variable is the most powerful predictor of social distancing practices. It could be inferred that an individual\u2019s personal perception of being clean motivates them to reinforce such behavior by adopting further actions, such as social\nothers as \u201cless clean\u201d or more contaminated, which, in turn, increases the probability of being infected; therefore, they embrace more protective behavior such as social distancing.\nThe findings of this study provides a better understanding of individuals\u2019 responses to the\npandemic based on personality traits and illustrates the importance of both risk perception and personal hygiene practices. Moreover, based on the findings concerning gender differences in the precautionary behaviors to avoid contagion (social distancing), our findings would be useful to encourage media platforms to focus on presenting persuasive messages focused on men in the media, as they are less likely to adopt protective behaviors.\nOur study has two limitations. First, the respondents were residents of Qatar of different\nArab nationalities; therefore, their precautionary behavior (social distancing) may be affected by the culture of their home country. Second, the sample may not be representative of all nationalities in Qatar, particularly individuals of non-Arab nationalities working in Qatar, such as Indians, Filipinos, and Pakistanis; therefore, caution should be used when generalizing the results.\nThe current study sheds light on the factors that could predict the adoption of\nprecautionary behaviors (social distancing) to avoid infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main predictors are personality traits, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices. We suggest further research on the role of the neuroticism personality trait on predicting social distancing behavior, as there were inconsistent findings of how individuals with the neurotic personality trait behave in response to the pandemic. Further research is also recommended to investigate the impact of personal hygiene practices on social distancing from an interpersonal contact perspective.\nAronson, E. (2008).

Key strengths of this study were that it was based on well annotated national electronic health record data from a team with decades of experience using VA data, enabling a rapid and reliable analysis of Covid-19 by race and ethnicity. This analysis utilized patients\u2019 records from an entire healthcare system, which made it less prone to collider bias (i.e., non-random selection of individuals into a study) than other Covid-19 studies limited to individuals testing positive and admitted to hospital.17 Unlike other national healthcare systems, linkage to Covid-19 testing data or outcomes was not required as the integrated nature of VA healthcare provided at over 1200 sites nationally allows all information to be stored in its national Corporate Data Warehouse. We used validated algorithms to accurately extract information on and adjust models for a wide range of clinical, behavioral, and geographic factors with very little missingness in the data. The scale of VA data also allowed us to assess the impact of Covid-19 across separate race/ethnicity groups, which would have masked important differences between black and Hispanic individuals. We continue to monitor numbers for individuals of other minority backgrounds and plan to follow-up these analyses when there are sufficient numbers for analysis. While this analysis adds information, its limitations must be kept in mind. First, this study was conducted on Veterans currently receiving care in the VA who are older and have a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions and risk behaviors than the general US population.18-20\nHowever, prior research has established that after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and residence type, all of which were included in this study, there is no difference between total disease burden between Veterans and non-Veterans.20 Therefore, associations reported in this study are likely generalizable to the wider US population. Second, while individuals in VA care represent a diversity of backgrounds, women represented a small proportion of individuals in the sample. Thus, we were not powered to assess interactions between sex and race/ethnicity. Third, beyond adjusting for rural/urban and site of testing, we were not able to explore likely causes of the pronounced differential burden of Covid-19 among minority individuals. More detailed information on nursing home residence, socioeconomic status (e.g., type of employment, income, number of individuals in household) were unavailable or not consistently recorded in VA data as in most other electronic health record data sources. Fourth, as is true outside the VA, a small proportion of individuals have been tested (~1%) and rates of testing vary widely by site and within important subgroups. However, while initial testing was limited, by mid-April the VA began testing all individuals admitted to hospital and before any inpatient or outpatient procedures are done for clearance even in those not suspected to have Covid-19. We performed sensitivity analyses to see if associations with testing positive changed over time and found conclusions were broadly similar but with some important distinctions. However, our models for testing positive should not be interpreted as a proxy of likelihood of infection since those with mild symptoms were unlikely to have received testing, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak."}, {"heading": "Findings in context", "text": "Our findings of racial and ethnic disparities in Covid-19 provide important distinctions from previous reports in the US and other countries with ethnically diverse populations. To our knowledge, the largest national study of race/ethnicity and Covid-19 in the US to date included 580 individuals across 14 states, showing that black individuals represented 33% of Covid-19 hospitalizations despite only making up 18% of the total population studied.7 In the UK, which was the first country with an ethnically diverse population to experience a Covid-19 outbreak,21 a study of 17 million individuals showed that those from minority backgrounds had a substantially higher risk of in-hospital death from Covid-19, which was not fully explained by underlying health conditions or deprivation.22 While our study also found racial and ethnic disparities that were not fully explained by health status, we found that these disparities occurred primarily at stages prior to hospitalization (i.e., testing positive for Covid-19). We found no evidence of racial or ethnic disparities in 30-day mortality once models were restricted to those who tested positive for Covid-19. We demonstrated that black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to test positive than their white counterparts even after accounting for underlying health conditions, other demographics, residence type, and site of care. Our finding may still be an underestimate of the US population risk as health disparities in VA tend to be smaller than in the private sector.23 Based on experience with 1918 Spanish Flu and the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, public health experts have warned that racial and ethnic minority populations may be at higher risk during infectious disease outbreaks due to underlying health conditions, lower access to care, and socioeconomic conditions.24 25 Prior reports have highlighted that members of racial and ethnic minorities are\nmore likely to live in densely populated areas or multi-generational households, and minority groups are overrepresented in jails, prisons, and detention centers, all of which lead to reduced capacity to implement physical distancing.26-30 Similarly, black and Hispanic workers are more likely than their white counterparts to be workers in essential industries who continue to work outside the home despite outbreaks in their communities making them more prone to infection.30-32 Testing rates for Covid-19 in the VA were higher among black and Hispanic individuals compared to white individuals. Local reporting from metropolitan areas with large minority populations, including New York City33 and Chicago,34 have highlighted the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 in minority communities. We showed that VA facilities in these cities and others around the country that conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests also had the highest proportion of black individuals in care. There was a striking difference in the rate of Covid-19 testing by age across race/ethnicity groups, whereby higher rates of testing were observed for middle-aged, white individuals while testing rates steadily increased with age and was highest among those aged 80 or more years among black and Hispanic individuals. White individuals living in urban residences were more likely to be tested than those living in rural residences while the opposite was true among black and Hispanic individuals. Among all individuals tested, those living in urban residences were more likely to test positive for Covid-19 than those living in rural residences. Finally, women were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 than men, but men were twice as likely to test positive. This association strengthened after adjustment and in conditional analyses but should be considered preliminary given limited numbers of women in this analysis."}, {"heading": "Policy implications", "text": "We have been able to confirm several local and national reports that black and Hispanic individuals in the US are impacted by Covid-19 differentially to their white counterparts. While other studies have focused on hospitalized individuals, this study is the first and largest to show that, at least through May 4, 2020, black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be tested and to test positive. We found no difference in 30-day mortality among Covid-19 cases. These findings highlight the urgent need for improved strategies to contain and prevent further outbreaks in the US, particularly within black and Hispanic communities."}, {"heading": "Future research", "text": "We appeal to other researchers investigating racial and ethnic disparities to perform analyses on the entire population at-risk for Covid-19, where data are available, and compare findings associated at each stage in the clinical course of Covid-19, from testing to outcomes.

We plan to explore other outcomes, including hospitalization, intensive care, and intubation, in subsequent analyses to examine whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in the clinical course of Covid-19 after testing positive and before death. Among other factors, future research should consider the role of employment type, nursing home residence, and incarceration. Other racial and ethnic minorities in the US deserve attention and while we did not have enough power to include other groups in this analysis, we will continue to monitor these numbers for future research."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "While minority individuals with Covid-19 did not appear to have worse outcomes, black race and Hispanic ethnicity were strongly associated with testing positive for Covid-19 suggesting a substantial excess burden of Covid-19 in US minority populations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The views and opinions expressed in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Government.

By then, a total of 278 patients were diagnosed with Covid-19 by public services out of a total population of 479,234 people. Baseline clinical findings are summarized in table 1. Of note, female patients made up to 46% of admitted cases. The cohort includes only 1 minor of 15 years old. A total of 7 patients (25%) were treated on ICU. By the 10th of May, 2 patients included in this study were still admitted in the hospital, with 1 on ICU. Median length of stay in hospital was 9.5 days, and median length of stay in ICU was 19 days. Fifteen patients (54%) could be discharged to home, 9 (32%) were discharged to a regional health centre. By May 10th, 2 patients had died in hospital, and 1 after referral to a regional health centre.\nOf patients of whom smoking status was known, 11% were current smokers and 29% ex-smokers. Median blood pressure (133/77 mmHg) and heart rate (84 /min) were in the normal range, as were hemoglobin (135 g/L), thrombocytes (234 e9/L), leukocytes (5.7 e9/L), and creatinine (79 \u00b5mol/L). Fever (median 38.0\u00b0C),\nhypoxemia (median SaO2 92%), lymphocytopenia (median 1.0 xe9/L), increased C-reactive protein (CRP, median 90 mg/L) and increased procalcitonin (PCT, median 0.13 \u00b5g/L) were common. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral opacities in 68% of cases and unilateral opacities in 16%. Common pre-existent conditions included hypertension in 43% of cases, obesity (in 35%), OSA (29%), diabetes mellitus (25%), asthma (14%), COPD (7%) and active malignant disease (11%). Baseline characteristics are summarized in table 1.\nBaseline characteristics were compared between patients who were later on admitted to ICU (n=7) and those who were not (non-ICU, n=21). Baseline CRP (median 187 mg/L) and PCT (median 0.46 \u00b5g/L) were significantly higher among those who were later on transferred to ICU compared to those who were not (median CRP 52 mg/L, p<0.005 and median PCT 0.12, p=0.047). In addition, a trend towards lower SaO2 on admission was observed in ICU-patients (87%) in comparison with non-ICU patients (93%, p=0.09). All ICU-patients had bilateral opacities in CXR on admission to the hospital (table 1 and figure 1).\nIn the Hospital District of Southwest Finland, a total of 12,799 people (2.7%) are treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and around 2,000 people with mandibular advancement device (MAD) for OSA. Thus, prevalence of hospital-treated OSA is around 3.1%.\nAs prevalence of previously diagnosed OSA was disproportionally high in this cohort, we performed a posthoc descriptive analysis of those patients. BMI >30 kg/m2 was found in 75% of OSA patients. Median BMI was 38.0 kg/m2. Thus, the majority of OSA patients in this cohort were severely obese. Median time of diagnosis of OSA was 2.5 years before Covid-19 and at time of diagnosis, median apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was 18 /h. Median 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI3) was 12 /h. At time of diagnosis of OSA, average overnight SpO2 was 92.1% and minimum was 83.5% (median values) and morning pCO2 values were in the normal range in all cases (median 4.9 kPa). One patient was using MAD and the other 7 patients were CPAP-users (six using automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) device and one fixed pressure CPAP). CPAP adherence was good (median 7.5 hours) in those actually using the device (n=5), but two patients had discontinued before admission for Covid-19. Characteristics of OSA patients in our case series are summarized in table 2."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Most of our findings were generally consistent with reports of Covid-19 cases elsewhere.2,4,5 However, two of our findings are of special interest. Pre-existent OSA was present in 29% of cases being over ten times higher than the prevalence of OSA patients under treatment in our region. Because of this disproportionally high frequency of OSA, we performed a post-hoc analysis of those patients and their pre-existent condition. Even though obesity is by now an established risk factor for severe Covid-19, weight alone does not explain the high proportion of patients with OSA, as obesity is a much more common pre-existing condition than OSA in the Finnish population with a prevalence of 26.1% among men and 27.5% among women.10 In fact, OSA was present in 21% of cases in a case series in Seattle and in 28.6% of critically ill Covid-19 patients in a cohort of Washington.11,12 Several mechanisms may contribute to increased risk of severe Covid-19 in OSA patients, independent of overweight. Intermittent hypoxemia is one of the main pathologic features of OSA and could potentially worsen hypoxemia caused by Covid-19.13 OSA is also related to chronic inflammatory state and is associated with increased levels of proinflammatory markers such as ferritin, IL-6 and leptin, which may contribute to the risk for cytokine storm in Covid-19.13-15 Hypercoagulability is another pathophysiologic feature shared by both Covid-19 and OSA.16,17 Furthermore, RAAS may also be influenced by sleep apnoea, and RAAS-associated regulation of ACE2-expression could be another mechanism by which OSA may contribute to the risk of severe Covid-19.7,8,18\nA second striking observation is the high level of CRP in patients admitted to the ICU. Even though CRP has a well-established role in diagnostics and follow-up of bacterial pneumonia and other bacterial infections, the usefulness of CRP levels has been less clear. Even though several studies were not able to distinguish viral pneumonia from a pneumonia of bacterial origin based on CRP, CRP is often being used as a guidance for treatment with antibiotics.19 Our data shows that high CRP is associated with increased risk for ICU admission within several days. CRP levels may reflect the pulmonary damage caused by Covid-19. Theoretically, concomitant bacterial pneumonia can be present but undiagnosed. However, we found no evidence of bacterial infection, blood cultures remained negative in all patients and those with CRP >100 mg/L upon presentation had in most cases radiology findings consistent with Covid-19 without radiologic suspicion of bacterial pneumonia.\nAccording to our findings, high CRP and PCT and possibly low SaO2 on admission may be predictors for transfer to critical care. If confirmed in larger studies, this may be useful in triage which may be especially helpful when the epidemic is out of control and hospital places are scarce, requiring decision making based on basic clinical and laboratory assessment. The usability of CRP, PCT and SaO2 in clinical workup of Covid-19 has yet to be confirmed in larger studies.\nThe high prevalence of pre-existing OSA in this cohort may have implications for individual risk assessment and may help to understand pathogenesis of severe Covid-19. However, the finding should be considered with extreme caution, as this cohort is rather small. The question whether OSA is an independent risk factor should be addressed in larger cohorts.\nOur study has some major limitations. First, the size of the study remains small due to low incidence of Covid-19 in Southwest Finland in the early phase of the pandemic. Second, due to the retrospective nature of this study, there was incomplete documentation on some of the variables. Third, follow-up was very short, which may lead to under reporting of mortality and complications, although the number still in hospital on the date of data cut-off was very low. Fourth, we only report on patients admitted in the hospital, which leads to an obvious bias, mild cases are largely missed, and fragile patients with severe disease may not be transported to the hospital but receive instead palliative care at home.\nAcknowledgement\nWe are grateful to Ton Feuth for his advices on the statistics used in this study."}]}, {"paper_id": "q1w57", "claim2": "There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P<0.0001)", "claim3a": "students with high levels of psychological distress have the least motivation to distance learning", "claim3b": "Multinomial logistic regression was employed to test the association between psychological distress severity and motivation for distance learning.", "claim4": "The multinomial logistic regression revealed that there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (OR=0.45, P<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.28-0.7)"}, {"paper_id": "d6omw", "claim2": "After confounding adjustment in multivariable linear regression models, there found a better wellbeing scores for males (estimate=1.79, 95% CI=0.5, 3.1), and government-workers (estimate=5.86, 95% CI=2.2, 9.5).", "claim3a": "Working in a government position is associated with higher mental health compared with the people involved in business during the coronavirus pandemic.", "claim3b": "In multivariable linear regression models, associations between WEMWBS (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale) and socio-demographic variables were investigated, with WEMWBS as the dependent variable, and socio-demographic variables as independent variables.", "claim4": "The participants who were involved in business had lower levels of wellbeing than government employees (by 5.87 units, p=0.01)", "content": [{"text": "Title: Mental wellbeing in the Bangladeshi healthy population during\nnationwide lockdown over COVID-19: an online cross-sectional survey\nRunning title: Mental wellbeing in the Bangladeshi healthy population\nAuthors: Mohammad Ali1, 2, Gias U.

The survey was conducted between March 27, 2020, and April 7, 2020, following the Bangladesh government's lockdown announcement.\nMethod: A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and sociodemographic information was posted to an online survey.\nResults: The mean wellbeing value was 38.4 (standard deviation, 11.2), indicating a lower mental health level exist in adults. Also, the mean wellbeing score for males was 39.0 (10.8) units compared to females with scores 37.0 (11.2), and the highest scores for government workers was 41.2 (11.8). Unemployment (35.6) or business employees (35.5) have a lower level of mental health. In the lockout days, the elderly population of age 50 years and above had high day-to-day variation of wellbeing scores. After confounding adjustment in multivariable linear regression models, there found a better wellbeing scores for males (estimate=1.79, 95% CI=0.5, 3.1), and government-workers (estimate=5.86, 95% CI=2.2, 9.5).

Suggestions for improvement will be implemented to promote the mental health to women, unemployed and business communities. Older people 50 years of age and over reported a greater day-to-day variation in their mental health. The married women with their decreased mental wellbeing should be given special consideration. The research will help let clinicians and policymakers decide where the measures can be implemented to improve their mental health during and after this pandemic.

Rapid human-to-human transmission of this virus has been widely confirmed, with no clinically approved antiviral medication or vaccine to be used for treatment or prevention [2]. Social-distancing and home quarantine recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been proven to be an effective way to minimize the speed of this virus spread. Thus governments of many countries have locked down their countries due to COVID-19. During the lockdown period, all the business centres, government, and non-government offices are closed. Restrictions also apply to any social gathering after closing all transport modes which forced\ncitizens to be isolated or quarantined at home [3].\nFear of being infected with COVID-19 and uncertainty due to lock down have an immense psychological negative effect on the general population [4]. In fact, social quarantine also affects human psychology and mental health [5]. A study showed that there is a strong connection between quarantine and cognitive function, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular system that can cause depression, cognitive\nimpairment and sleep disturbance [6].Some studies have found that quarantine can cause adverse behavioral patterns including substance abuse, crime and even suicide [7-8]. A suicide case relating to quarantine has been reported in Bangladesh due to COVID-19 [9]. A recent review also indicated that negative psychological effects such as symptoms of post-traumatic stress, frustration and rage along with long-lasting quarantine effects are widespread among quarantined populations [10]. Thus mental well-being data during the lockdown period is needed to assist the policymaker in\nassessing this pandemic's current and post-pandemic situation.\nResearch has indicated a close link between poor mental health and financial insolvency and instability [11]. It was predicted that record 3.3 million people could only lose their jobs in the US during and after this pandemic. The situation could be worse in low-income countries like Bangladesh than the high-income countries [12]. Therefore the psychological problems relating to economic instability are an\napparent consequence of people being locked down.\nPositive mental health or mental well-being has recently emerged as an important predictor of overall health and longevity [7\u20139]. Mental well-being is more than the absence of mental illness or psychiatric pathology. It implies \u2018feeling good\u2019 and \u2018functioning well\u2019 and includes aspects such as optimism, happiness, self-esteem, resilience, agency autonmy and good relationships with others [7-11,13-14]. Mental wellbeing has also been found to be associated with better occupational functioning\nin adulthood [1-2,15].\nPathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical management of COVID-19 are the main research subject during this pandemic [16]. The psychological effects of such a pandemic could nevertheless be left to millions of people with a long-term or irreversible psychiatric disorder with which negative social implications could begin. Preventing emotional and behavioral issues and encouraging physical and social and mental well-being should therefore be a priority for the people of Bangladesh. The research would further identify those individuals who need support that can help strengthen the mental health care mechanisms.

The WEMWBS measures subjectively perceived wellness and psychological function on a 5-point Likert scale over the last 2-week period (14\u201370 points, higher = better mental health). The scale was not invented as a mental illness screening method and there is no cut off point [10]. WEMWBS was used in various studies and validated in several languages and settings [11,13-14].

The mean score for WEMWBS was 38.5 (standard deviation, SD 11.1) and the median was 38. During the COVID-19 pandemic, male scores were 1.7 points higher than for female suggesting a lower mental health level among female participants. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for WEMWBS was 0.88 (95% CI [0.85; 0.90]) which indicates an internal consistency of the WEMWBS ratings. A significant association was found between WEMWBS scores and occupation. More variabilities are observed in age groups 16-19 and older than 50 years which indicates these groups of participants were psychologically unstable.\n[Table 1 here]\n[Figure 1 here]\n[Figure 2 here]\nThe WEMWBS scores ranged from 14 to 67 (see Figure 1), i.e. the range of possible values from 14 to 67 was used. It appears from the Figure 1 that the mean wellbeing scores is nearly 38 for March 7, 2020 and did not change as the days changed. It suggests a lower mental health level during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rising number of COVID-19 cases per day in Bangladesh since the start of the lockout period had no significant effect on the mental wellbeing indicates the current lower mental health wellbeing started early due to global stressful situations. In addition, the Figure 2 shows that scores are almost normally distributed for the male group. But the scores suggest higher variability for the female community. It indicates in the\nlockdown time female was mentally disturbed.\nItems of WEMWBS scores\nFigure 3 shows WEMWBS with items numbered, each of which was presented as percentage in turn by participants. Most participants reported negatively on Items 3 (\"feeling relaxed\u201d) and 4 (\"interested in other people\u201d) during the COVID-19 time. Looking at sub-scales of WEMWBS, it was found 75% of all participants were \u2018rarely\u2019 or \u2018none of the time\u2019 interested in other people, and about 60% of participants did not feel relax (item 3) during this pandemic time. In addition, at this time almost 60 percent of the participants did not feel confident (item 10). On the contrary, about 50% of the participants can feel they are useful (item 2) and can make up own mind about things (item 11).\n[Figure 3 here]\nTrajectories of scores by Socio-demographic factors The Figure 4 shows a comparison of day to day variation by different categories of sociodemographic factors since the start of the survey at the beginning of the lockdown period. The rising scores seem a similar trend for both male and female as day changes. Compared to other age groups, the variability of scores in age group 50 and above is much higher indicates that the participants from this age group deviated that scores as the day changes. It indicates that the elderly population may be more disturbed by the pandemic situation. Similar types of instability have been observed in the divorced / separated population and in the people living in the village during survey time. The participants who were housewives or unemployed are in the non-working group and found WEMWBS scoring low but the variability is constant while the participants who work at home and work both at home and outside of home were found to be inconsistent with the changing days.

The results present the slope estimate, 95% confidence interval of the slope and the corresponding p-value. We applied 3 models. The first model is with all the data and the next two models were for male and female participants, respectively. We stratify the gender and applied the two models to avoid the confounding bias. It appears from the Model 1 that gender and occupational groups have had significant effect on the mental wellbeing scores. Male had a significantly higher feelings of wellbeing by an increment of 1.79 scores (slope estimate=1.79, 95% CI = 0.5 to 3.1) than female. The participants who were involved in business had lower levels of wellbeing than government employees (by 5.87 units, p=0.01) or health care (by 4.98, p=<0.001) or employees of private companies (by 3.31, p=0.02). Model 2 provides the similar results because male was predominant in this study. Most women are not in the working group and therefore the occupational factor is not an important factor for the women participants. The unmarried female group participants appear to have higher well-being scores than the married women (by 3.31, p=0.01). [Table 2 here]\nComparison with existing literature\nDuring the lockdown time due to COVID-19 the general population sample in Bangladesh recorded average mental health score as 38.4. In Bangladesh, the mental health scores were much lower compared to the general population in Denmark (52.2) or the general population in England (49.8). Northern Ireland's health care professionals (50.2) or Pakistan's health care professionals (48.1) received much higher scores compared to health care professionals in Bangladesh (39.2). Thus, health care professionals in Bangladesh tended to have substantially lower mental wellbeing score during the pandemic period compared to any occupation in other countries. The worst WEMWBS score was seen in the inmates on remand from Scotland (37.1) and the rating is almost identical to Bangladesh's wellness score.\n[Table 3 here]"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This was the first study assessing Bangladeshi adult population mental health over different professional groups. Throughout the lockdown period, residents reported substantially lower mental health relative to citizens from other countries at a normal time. We used a Bangla version of WEMWBS to define mental wellbeing, and in this adult population group we found a strong internal consistency with a high Cronbach alpha.\nDespite high levels of stress due to COVID-19 in Bangladesh, males had the highest level of mental health compared to females. Contrary to the study from Murray et al, in which women had significantly higher mental wellbeing than men, women's mental well-being in the present sample was lower than men's (+1.7 to \u2013 1.7 units in this survey). Similar to our study, during the COVID-19 situation, a study among health care workers in China found female are more anxious than men [18]. Another research also found females in this pandemic situation were in the lower mental wellbeing [19].\nOur results reflect more day-to-day variation in age group 50 and over mental wellbeing. Findings at the population level to which the scale is intended are stable.\nWorking in a government position has been found to be associated with higher mental health (increase of 1.6 units) compared with the people involved in business. One explanation for that could be business financial uncertainty. A retrospective research indicates a strong link between financial solvency and good mental wellbeing [20]. Similar to our results, a report found that business and career uncertainty have a substantial negative effect on the mental health of adult population [21].\nAlthough being single was associated with increased wellbeing for female participants (increase of 2.0 units) compared to married women. Compared to regular time, married women can face a burden with a high household workload,\nwhich results in less private time. The arrangements for household work may have increased to meet the needs of their families, and children. One research concluded that increased household load raises common mental illness [22]. These results agree with findings from other studies which defined the pandemic period as the most distress and difficulty characterized phase [23-25].\nIt is accepted that the research had limitations: First, we were unable to include dietary habit, physical activity in these analyzes because no data were collected on this behaviour. Second, while the study's cross-sectional nature helped us to explore the associations between mental well-being and multiple behaviours, it did not allow us to establish the causality and temporality of the relationships that were observed. Selection bias may be significant if those of a poor people appear to have less participation. Fourth, there is risk of bias due to online data collection.\nStudy strengths are the novelty of surveying adult population in order to assess mental wellbeing at various career points. To the best understanding of the authors, there was no earlier sample of a general population study for mental health. The research was controlled enough to identify variations, as in comparable studies or settings. Further research is needed to find new findings, with larger and more diverse samples from populations with different health status."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this population-based analysis, we found that during this pandemic period mental well-being in the Bangladeshi adult population was worst in female, unemployed, business community occupational group and married person.

Design A prospective observational study using data on the daily number of infected patients and deaths from the New York Times daily database. Setting 50 States and the District of Columbia Participants All individuals judged to be positive for the coronavirus or to have died from COVID19. Main outcome measures Number of people diagnosed with or died from COVID19. Results We found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the WeberFechner law of psychophysics. Both the number of infections (p=<0.0001; R2=0.79) and deaths (p<0.0001; R2=0.63) were highly statistically significantly associated with the decision to issue the stay-at-home orders. The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths within their state, an additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. We also observed a clear dose-response relationship in the Cox model: the larger the number of cases, or deaths, the higher the probability that the stay-at-home order will be made. When the number of deaths reached 256 or the number of infected people was greater than 16,384, the probability of issuing a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order was close to 100%. Conclusions When there are not clearly articulated rules to follow, decision-makers in times of crisis such as COVID19 resort to use of simple heuristics consistent with the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics.

In the U.S., the reluctance of the federal government to issue a national order has placed state governors in the position of having to decide when to escalate from vague wishes for social distancing to stay-at-home directives. What information guides that decision? We suggest there are two clearly identified, readily available signals that convey crisis magnitude, namely the numbers of cases (people reported as infected) and people pronounced dead of the disease. When those numbers increase sufficiently, action will be taken. The two numbers are correlated, of course, but we might expect each of these numbers to affect the governor\u2019s decision to issue a stay-at-home order.\nPeople vary in their sensitivity to stimulus differences. According to the classical Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics1 2, the amount by which a stimulus must increase in order to be noticed, the \u201cjust noticeable difference\u201d or JND, is a fraction of the intensity of that stimulus. For example, Ernst Weber, a 19th century psychologist, found that people could not discriminate between 20.5 and 20.0 g weights but could usually discriminate between 21 and 20 g.2 When a series of baseline weights was 40, 60, 80, and 100 g, the JND was 2, 3, 4, and 5 g, respectively. That is, to appreciate the differences between weights (JND), the weight (i.e., stimulus) should increase by a constant percentage of the stimulus itself i.e., by at least 5% of the original weights in this example.2 Gustav Fechner, another 19th century psychologist, proposed that the \u201cJND\u201d can be conceptualized as a unit of psychological intensity rather than physical intensity.1-3 Subsequently, the relationship between the intensity of a signal and how much more intense the signal needs to increase before a person can reliably tell that the signal had changed has become known as the Weber-Fechner Law of psychophysics. As expected for physiological systems, the law is valid within certain domains of stimulus-response ratios. Therefore, if we\naccept Fechner\u2019s assumption that JNDs are psychologically equal in size, then there will be a logarithmic relation between stimulus intensity and perception. The Weber-Fechner law has been well documented across different physiological and psychological phenomena 4 - it describes responses in a variety of domains in which increasingly intense stimuli can be placed along a continuum, from the perception of loudness or brightness1 2 to the subjective value of money5 to the mental line for numbers6 and risky choices.7 In the present context, we anticipate that the perception of danger from the virus will depend upon the number of cases and/or deaths observed within a governor\u2019s jurisdiction.\nOur hypothesis is that in order to move an uncommitted governor to action, the additional number of infected people or deaths required will be logarithmically larger as more cases or deaths are reported. That is, the governors will not \u201cnotice\u201d that conditions are sufficiently worse until an increasingly larger number of people are infected or die."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "We obtained the daily numbers of cases and deaths from the New York Times daily database [https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data]. We examined both numbers separately, cases and deaths, to see whether one signal was more clearly linked to the stay-at-home decision. The analyses were performed on data downloaded on April 12, 2020 from all 50 states and the District of Columbia (we regarded the mayor of that city as a governor in our analyses); by that time all but 7 states had issued stay-at-home orders. Four of the governors had issued stay-athome orders before any deaths were recorded.\nThe data cannot be regarded as precise. The Times consider a case confirmed when it is reported by a federal, state, territorial or local government agencies. Confirmed cases are patients who test positive for the coronavirus. However, it must be acknowledged that the\nperformance of diagnostic tests vary, limiting diagnostic accuracy.8 Deaths are more visible, but may be inaccurate because of incorrect attributions. Some states updated records on a daily basis, while others updated only after a certain number of cases or deaths had accumulated. In sum, the reported numbers may not be exact, but the numbers we worked with and the numbers the governors saw are the same.\nBecause the virus surfaced at different times across the country, in order to count the number of days between the signaling event and the stay-at-home order, we had to start a separate calendar for each state. We called that starting date t0. We suspected that setting t0 to the day when the first death was reported would be appropriate, because officials are more likely to trust reports of deaths, which are concrete events, than of cases, which depend on the infected person\u2019s decision to seek medical attention. It also would be possible to set t0 on the basis of cases. We tried that out to see if it mattered, but rather than starting the count after the first case in the state, as customarily in these types of the analyses, we started it after the first 50 cases had been reported. Because both cases and deaths accumulated exponentially, the growth rate was similar for both signals and so we expect similar results whichever way the calendar is defined."}, {"heading": "Statistical analyses", "text": "We used two analytical approaches. First, we fitted the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function by regressing the log2 of cases and deaths, respectively against the daily counts. If the logarithmic notion is correct, these should appear as straight lines. The idea is that relatively few cases or deaths may be needed to inspire the first governor to issue an order, while governors who do so later will require increasingly stronger signals. In the case of the latest states, many more cases or deaths may be needed. Using the base 2 for the logarithmic analysis allows us to see how many doublings of the signal strength (which we defined as JND) are required to inspire the various governors to issue the stay-at-home orders. Because we were interested in learning\nhow the states responded in sequence , we first ranked the states according to the order of declaring the stay-at-home order after each state had cases \u226550 or deaths \u22651. We then regressed the stay-at-home state rank list on log2(cases) or log2(deaths). Thus, the coefficient of the regression represents the number of additional states introducing stay-at-home order for each doubling of cases or deaths.\nFor the analysis using cases, we excluded the 7 states that had not issued stay-at-home orders by April 12, the date of our analysis, thereby leaving us with data for 44 states. For the analysis using deaths, we also excluded an additional 4 states whose governors had issued the stay-athome order before any deaths had occurred. The rationale for the latter is that these governors were not using the signals as we had defined them.\nAnother way to approach the data is to track the changes in the probability of making the stayat-home decision as days pass. To do this, we used Cox regression modeling. We expected that the probability of issuing the stay-at-home order would proportionately increase as the number of cases or deaths increases. For the Cox analysis we used data for all eligible states but censored those states that had not issued the order by the time of our analysis\nBecause the data were somewhat noisy, we also repeated the analyses using three-day moving averages for cases and deaths. We performed sensitivity analyses using number of cases or deaths per million, and population size per area of state (density) as the stimuli rather than actual number. The results were sufficiently similar that we elected to not present them.\nAll analyses were done in STATA statistical software.9"}, {"heading": "Patient and public involvement", "text": "This analysis is based on publicly available, individual data.

The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths within their state, an additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. The analysis of the residuals for the linear regression analysis indicated no deviation from normality, thus supporting a customary assumption of the analysis.\nOur decision regarding t0, when to start each state\u2019s calendar, was somewhat arbitrary. To see whether it mattered, we performed an additional set of exploratory analyses. In these, we started each state\u2019s calendar after a particular number of cases or deaths were recorded. We tried fitting the logarithmic function to n\u2019s from 1 to 100 for cases and from 1 to 20 for deaths. In general, as one would expect, better fit was observed when we started t0 at higher numbers of cases or deaths, but at the expense of fewer data points. For example, R2 increased to about 80% when we started at \u226510 deaths or \u2265100 cases but was based on data from fewer states - 28 and 42, respectively.\nThe Cox regression curves in Fig 2a and 2b show that both number of cases and deaths were significantly associated with the probability of declaring the state-at-home order [hazard ratio (HR)=1.36 (p<0.045) for cases and HR=1.68 (p<0.00001) for deaths]. The adequacy of the\nanalysis was confirmed by the non-significant result from Schoenfeld\u2019s test for the proportionalhazard assumption, indicating the non-violation of the proportionality of effects of increasing number of cases or deaths on the probability of issuing state-at-home order.\nWe observed a clear dose-response relationship: the larger the number of cases, or deaths, the higher probability that the stay-at-home order will be made. The probability of issuing stay-athome order was nearly 100% if the number of deaths exceeded log2(8) [i.e., 2 8= 256 deaths]. For cases, this near-certainty occurs within 2 weeks of t0 when the number of cases exceeded log2(14) [ i.e., 2 14= 16,384 infected people]. The maximum number of cases or deaths for the states without stay-at-home orders were 2,221 and 94, respectively."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "During the COVID19 crisis, one commentator remarked \u201cwe are all getting tired looking at the exponential graphs\u201d, wondering how to act on the information shown in those graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the classical psychophysical Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. The signals \u2013 cases and deaths - are strongly correlated with the decision to announce the stay-at-home order. Here, for each doubling of the number of cases beyond 50 or deaths beyond 1, additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. When the signal is truly strong - more than about 250 deaths or 16,000 cases in our analysis- the probability of issuing state-at-home order approaches nearcertainty.\nGiven the noise introduced by differences between states in terms of population density, political persuasion, and media coverage, this appears to be a remarkably simple result. The percentages of variance accounted for are quite high (60-80%) by industry standards, The typical R2 for a one-variable predictor in judgment research is between 5% to 30%. This appears to be another instance of a familiar phenomenon; when there are not clearly articulated\nrules to follow, people rely upon simple heuristics10 of which they need not be aware. These powerful rule-of-thumb, decision-making strategies can surprisingly be more accurate than complex statistical models, but sometimes can be disastrously wrong. 10 Here the heuristic is to wait until the day that the number of cases or deaths is striking. Indeed, it has been suggested that Weber-Fechner law can also operate as a heuristic \u2013heuristic based on the prominent numbers defined as the powers of ten, their doubles, and their halves [e.g., 1,2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200\u2026] approximates the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics.1 2 11 10 For those governors who did not issue the state-at-home orders it is possible that they have not yet reached their personal Weber-Fechner heuristic threshold to act. Perhaps, crossing one of these psychologically important numbers-for example, more than 200 deaths may move the governors in that direction. There are, however, exceptions, as not all people employed this heuristic. The more proactive governors-the four who issued stay-at-home orders before any deaths were observed in their jurisdiction- seemed to have acted on the number of cases alone. And while the seven recalcitrant governors who did not issue orders may be waiting for an even stronger signal, it is also possible that their decisions are based on considerations of a completely different nature.\nThe major limitation of our approach is that it does not incorporate the kind of information \u2013 perhaps political stance, perhaps personality characteristics, perhaps availability of advice from colleagues or agencies - that might enable us to predict how many doublings in the numbers of deaths a particular governor needs to observe before taking action. Of course, our analysis demonstrated association between stimuli (cases, deaths) and the decision to issue a stay-athome order, but not direct causation between the two. We have identified the stimulus that underlies the decision, but we do not know why some governors acted more quickly than others. As the governors seemed to be wired to act according to the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics, we believe that the findings are important for the public to understand how their\nelected officials make important \u2013 life and death- public health decisions. This is ever more important as the states and countries are pondering their decisions how to re-open their economies."}, {"heading": "Legends:", "text": "Figure 1: shows that the number of both cases (a) and deaths (b) is significantly associated with the decision to issue a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order.

Payson\nUniversity of South Carolina University of South Carolina\nMay 13, 2020\nObjectives. The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 poses an unprecedented threat to the health and economic prosperity of the world\u2019s population. Given incomplete reporting of contextual disaggregation in cumulative case data reported by health departments in the U.S., this research links county- and state-level characteristics to the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods. A statistical exponential growth model is estimated to describe the outbreak rate using publicly available county-level outbreak data. County- and state-level effects are simultaneously tested with a multilevel linear model using full maximum likelihood.\nResults. Mirroring findings from international cultural research, collectivism as a value is positively associated with the outbreak rate. The racial and ethnic composition of counties contributes to differences in the outbreak, with Black/African and Asian Americans being more affected. As expected, counties with a higher median age have a stronger outbreak, and so do counties with more people below the age of 18. Higher income, education, and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Contrariwise, obesity is negatively and significantly related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Smoking is negatively related, but only directionally informative. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak, but population density does not give statistical significance. Conclusions. The results show that contextual factors influence the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Because of a high intrastate and intercounty variation in these factors, policy makers need to look at pandemics from the smallest subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented effectively.\nKeywords: COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; Outbreak; Pandemic; Regional differences.\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "First reports of a pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019. The virus was soon after isolated and identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but it proved to be extremely contagious, as the outbreak quickly spread beyond Wuhan. In the U.S., the first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, was reported on January 22, 2020. In the struggle to contain the pandemic, the U.S. Government took unprecedented action, imposing international and domestic travel restrictions, closing businesses, and enacting state-wide stay at home orders and social distancing mandates. However, the number of cases in the U.S. grew to over 593000 as of April 14, and crossed one million on April 28.1 The local popular press and epidemiological research alike are reporting differences in the outbreak, sometimes between neighboring counties (see Figure 1 and 2).2,3 Undoubtedly, a community\u2019s susceptibility to any virus is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to biological determinants, demographic profiles, and socioeconomic characteristics.4 Because these factors vary significantly across the U.S., a considerable intra-country variation in the COVID-19 outbreak does not come as a surprise. For instance, COVID-19 fatalities in New York, an epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., disproportionally affect males and people belonging to older age groups, from Black/African and Hispanic ethnicities, and with certain comorbidities.5 As of May 09, 2020, 53.0% of cumulative COVID-19 data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are missing race and 57.4% ethnicity disaggregation. Because information about many other individual variables is lacking as well, we deploy an ecological analysis using data at both the county- and state-level to determine the risks associated with several contextual factors in contracting the COVID-19 disease. We use a two-level hierarchical linear model with full maximum likelihood to simultaneously test and disentangle county- and state-level effects. We hope our study contributes to various strands of current COVID-19 research leading to a more thorough understanding of the outbreak. First, we note that contextual factors influence the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. at a state- and county-level. Significant variations in the outbreak exist both between states as well as counties within a state.3 We recommend policy makers to look at pandemics from the smallest population possible for an effective implementation of countermeasures and provision of critical resources. Second, we develop an understanding of how cultural differences within the U.S. relate to regional variations in the outbreak, driven by specific psychological functioning of individuals and the enduring effects of cultural differences on the political processes, governmental institutions, and public policies.6,7 Third, we debunk rumors propagated in the popular press that a state\u2019s leadership, as expressed by the political party in control or the gender of its governor, has a statistically significant influence on the outbreak.8,9 Fourth, we identify how the virus affects counties differently, depending on their demographic profile. Income and education are especially important confounds in understanding the outbreak. Fifth, while many personal health factors show up as important confounds for the outbreak, we identify the prevalence of obesity and smoking in counties to be negatively related with the outbreak. Sixth, building on previous studies showing that air\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson\npollution is linked to the death rate, we show that air pollution also contributes to the number of cases."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "In the following, we explain our estimation of the outbreak rate and the reasoning of including certain contextual factors at the U.S. county- and state-levels. Table 1 summarizes our data sources and their provenance.\nOutbreak rate We obtain COVID-19 outbreak data from USA Facts (as of April 14, 2020).1 Since January 22, 2020, this database has aggregated data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state- and local-level public health agencies, confirming them by referencing state and local agencies directly. The 21 cases confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship on March 05 and 06, 2020 are not attributed to any counties in California. For our county-level analysis, we discard cases which USA Facts can only allocate at the state, but not at the county level due to a lack of information. On average, the number of unallocated cases is only 308 per state (as of April 14), but a few states have as many as 4866 (New Jersey), 1300 (both Rhode Island and Georgia), or 1216 (Washington State). Following approaches by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington10 and the COVID-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas at Austin,11 we statistically model the outbreak using the exponential growth equation \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc66, where b is a positive constant called the relative growth rate; it has units of\ninverse time. Going forward, we simply refer to b as the outbreak rate. The shape of the trends in case counts enables us to see differences between counties.12 Solutions to this differential equation have the form \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc61, where a is the initial value of cases y. The doubling time Td can be calculated from the exponential growth rate as \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc51 = ln (2)\n\ud835\udc4f . We calculate the outbreak rate for 1987\nout of 3142 counties in the 50 U.S. states that have a minimum of 10 reported cases as of April 14, 2020. This is a statistical, but not an epidemiological model, that is, we are neither trying to model infection transmission nor estimate epidemiological parameters, such as the pathogen\u2019s reproductive or attack rate. Instead, we are fitting a curve to observed outbreak data at the county level. A change-point analysis using the Fisher discriminant ratio as a kernel function does not show any significant change points in the outbreak, and therefore justifies modeling the COVID19 outbreak as a phenomenon of unrestricted population growth.13 A disadvantage of this statistical approach is that we cannot forecast outbreak dynamics, though we do not require extrapolated data in our work.\nCultural values Culture can be defined as a set of values that are shared in a given social group. While these values are often used to distinguish countries,14,15 more than 80% of cultural variation resides within countries.16 The original North American colonies were settled by people hailing from various countries, who have spread their influence across mutually exclusive areas. Their distinct cultures are still with us today.7,17 Although today\u2019s U.S. states are not strictly synonymous with these cultural areas, there is abundant evidence that political boundaries can serve as useful proxies for culture.18\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson\nOne of the most useful constructs to emerge from cultural social psychology is the individualismcollectivism bipolarity. It has proven useful in describing cultural variations in behaviors, attitudes, and values. Briefly, individualism is a preference for a loosely knit social framework, whereas collectivism represents a preference for a tightly knit framework, in which its members are interdependent and expected to look after each other in exchange for unquestioning loyalty. While the majority of research on individualism and collectivism involves comparing countries,15 we use a collectivism index developed at the level of states solely within the U.S.6 Previous studies have shown that the regional prevalence of pathogens and international differences in the COVID-19 outbreak are positively associated with collectivism.18,19\nInstitutional confounders In addition to culture, we include various institutional confounders at the state-level, such as the political affiliation of a state\u2019s governor, the gender of the governor, and government spending per capita. Government plays a critical role in policy development and implementation, and the state-level differences could influence growth rates of the pandemic.8,20\nRacial composition First systematic reviews about COVID-19 incidences from China relied on ethnically homogenous cohorts.21,22 Ethnically diverse populations, such as in the U.K. and U.S., can contribute to our understanding of effects on different ethnic groups, which may exhibit different socioeconomic, cultural, or lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition and pathophysiological differences in susceptibility or response to infection. Certain vitamin or mineral deficiencies, differences in insulin resistance or vaccination policies in countries of birth may also be contributing factors.22 We include variables measuring the composition of U.S. counties regarding Black/African, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, and Native Hawaiian racial and ethnic groups.\nIncome and education Poverty is arguably the greatest risk factor for acquiring and succumbing to disease worldwide, but has historically received less attention from the medical community than genetic or environmental risk factors. The global HIV crisis brought into sharp relief the vulnerability of financially strapped health systems, and revealed disparities in health outcomes along economic fault lines.23 We include the median household income to measure potential economic disparities between U.S. counties. In addition, we also measure the percentage of population that is not proficient in English and the average math performance of students. Lower educational levels may result in a lower aptitude as it relates to understanding and effectively responding to the pandemic.\nOther demographics Age and gender also play a potential role in a population\u2019s susceptibility. During the aging process, immune functions decline, rendering the host more vulnerable to certain viruses.24 We use the percentage of population below 18 years of age and their median age to determine potential effect of differences in mobility, response, and lifestyle factors. We also control for the percentage of the population that is female. In Italy, one COVID-19 study of 1,591 cases of critically ill people who were admitted into intensive care units showed that about 82% of them were men.25 Other studies have found similar results, all of which point towards the finding that males may be disproportionally affected by COVID-19.26\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson\nPersonal health Good overall personal health is a general indicator for disease resistance. Additionally, the health belief model suggests that a person\u2019s belief in a personal threat of a disease, together with faith in the effectiveness of behavioral recommendations, predicts the likelihood of the person adopting the behavior.27 We use the percentage of the population that reports insufficient amount of sleep, is obese (as defined by a body mass index above 30), and smokes daily. Given the latter two are publicized risk factors for COVID-19, there is a potential for greater caution following the valueexpectancy concepts of the health belief model. Yet, medicinal nicotine has been identified as a potential protective factor against infection by SARS-CoV-2.28,29 We also measure the preventable hospitalization rate (that is, the rate of hospital stays for ambulatory-care sensitive conditions) as a potential indicator of poor personal health checkups; higher levels on the social association rate (that is, the average number of membership associations) are generally associated with more positive mental health and happiness.\nExternal health Previous studies suggest that exposure to pollution can suppress immune responses and proliferate the transmission of infectious diseases,30 and that the COVID-19 mortality rate is associated with air pollution.31 However, the impact of air pollution on the spread of COVID-19 is not yet known.30 We use the 2014 average daily density of fine particulate matter PM2.5 to measure air pollution across U.S. counties, and the percentage of population living in rural areas to account for physical distancing being more prevalent in rural areas. In addition, the food environment index reflects access to grocery stores and healthy foods.\nOther confounders Population density and overcrowding is significant when considering public health crises, facilitating the spread of diseases in developing and developed countries alike.32 As the climate is another highly publicized confounder potentially influencing the COVID-19 transmission rate,33 we also include each county\u2019s average temperature during February and March 2020. To control for potential confounding by temporality of the outbreak, we bring in a variable representing the number of days between January 01 and the 10th confirmed case reported."}, {"heading": "Statistical methods and results", "text": "To simultaneously test county- and state-level effects of contextual factors on the outbreak rate with cross-level interactions, we estimate a two-level linear model using full maximum likelihood in HLM 7.03 (Figure 3). This accounts for potential similarities in counties within the same state.30 We center all predictors around the group mean at level 1 and grand mean at level 2. We first estimate a one-way random effects ANOVA (unconditional model), which has an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.243. That is, more than 24% of the variation in the outbreak rate is between states, and about 76% is within the states and between their counties (see Figure 1 and 2). The variation between states is statistically significant (u0 = 4.50E-04, p < 0.001).

results of the multilevel model in Table 3. Additionally, we perform several robustness tests to inform our results. First, because outbreak rates change over time and their estimation is somewhat sensitive to the starting figure,34 we alternatively calculate it after 10 and 25 cases in the respective unit, finding a high correlation among the rates. When using the outbreak rate calculated after 10 cases, the outbreak date as a control variable changes its sign and loses significance (p = 0.065). Notably, the following coefficients gain significance: government spending (p = 0.064); temperature (p = 0.011). Conversely, the following coefficients lose significance: household income (p = 0.989); food environment (p = 0.144); density (p = 0.709). More importantly, the signs of the coefficients remain the same. Also, the variable outbreak date controls for temporality of the outbreak in the original model (1.912, [1.322; 2.502], p < 0.001). Second, we iteratively include several other contextual variables and logged versions of the variables to assess the robustness of the results. But because it is nearly impossible to establish a complete list of confounding variables, we quantify the potential impact of unobserved confounds (Table 3; impact threshold).35 For instance, the necessary impact of such a confound for air pollution would be 0.043, that is, to invalidate the variable\u2019s inference on the outbreak rate, a confounding variable would have to be correlated with both the outbreak rate and air pollution\nat \u221a0.043 = 0.207. Next, to alleviate concerns that some counties are omitted from the analysis because they are not yet affected by the virus,30 we ask how many counties would have to be replaced with unobserved cases for which the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the contextual variables have no influence on the outbreak rate) in order to invalidate the inference.36 As Table 3 (confound threshold) shows, 43.962% of the counties would have to be replaced with counties for which the effect is zero in order to invalidate the influence of air pollution. In summary, it can be claimed that the influence of the identified contextual variables on the pandemic\u2019s growth rate is reasonably robust. Third, a potential omission of relevant variables can lead to multicollinearity issues, which are generally a serious problem in epidemiological studies.37 Even though HLM 7.03 checks for multicollinearity, we conduct several additional diagnostics to eliminate any potential issues. In the inter-item correlation matrix (Table 2), the average (absolute) correlation is 0.172, and the\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson\nhighest correlation is 0.754, which is below the typical cutoff of 0.8. Most high correlations exist between racial composition and income and education. Additionally, we conduct a linear regression analysis at level 1 in IBM SPSS 26 (R2 = 0.495; without variable math grade; pairwise exclusion of missing values), and find that the variable inflation factor (VIF) never exceeds the threshold of 5 (highest being nonproficiency in English, 4.024). The variance-decomposition matrix also does not show any groups of predictors with high values. Fourth, we rerun our model excluding the 23 counties of the New York metropolitan area. As a COVID-19 hotspot, they could unduly influence our analysis. All signs remain the same, and the following coefficients gain significance: household income (p = 0.009); persons under 18 years (p = 0.038). Fifth, because there is no statistically correct choice for centering decisions in multi-level models,38 we retest our model with raw values. With the exception of the variable collectivism losing statistical significance (p = 0.711), the results are fully consistent with the group- and grand-mean centered predictors in Table 3. Lastly, we are aware that an accurate estimation and comparison of the outbreak rate across units depends on similar testing strategies, test sensitivities, specificities, and reporting of tests performed vs. individuals tested.12,39 Even within the U.S., some states report tests performed and others individuals tested.39 The number of tests administered and the number of confirmed cases therefore correlates to varying extents across states.40 By using a multi-level model in our study, we aim to accommodate such differences between states."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In the absence of national-level data controlled for location and disaggregated by race and ethnicity, demographics, information about comorbidity and other personal health variables, an ecological analysis provides an alternative to measure the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 across the U.S. and among segments of Americans. It may be contrary to expectations that the outbreak rate of a new pathogen, which is able to infect virtually anyone, manifests contextual disparities. But for other conditions, such as HIV and cancer, regional health disparities have been reported before,41,42 and with the current study we show that contextual factors in the U.S. also create a variation in COVID-19 cases. Our analysis indicates that higher outbreak rates can be found in U.S. states characterized by a higher cultural value of collectivism (coefficient 0.998, confidence interval [0.351; 1.645], p = 0.004). As Table 2 shows, collectivistic values are more prevalent in counties that are warmer (correlation with temperature 0.715, p < 0.001) and have a higher percentage of people with a Black/African background (with Black/African American 0.539, p < 0.001). This mirrors findings from international cultural research.15 Conversely, we cannot find any statistical evidence that the government spending, the gender of the governor, or the party in control would be in any way linked to the outbreak. This certainly debunks myths spread by the popular media.43 But a disproportionately stronger outbreak of COVID-19 cases can be found in counties with a higher percentage of Black/African (1.158, [0.725; 1.591], p < 0.001) and Asian Americans (1.305, [0.166; 2.444], p = 0.025), which supports prior infection and mortality studies in the U.S. and U.K.22,44 The former counties are also characterized by a higher rate of sleep deprivation (0.568, p < 0.001) and warmer temperatures (0.533, p < 0.001). The latter have a higher population density\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson\n(0.553, p < 0.001). While we found sleep deprivation to be associated with a higher outbreak rate (1.557; [0.412; 2.702], p = 0.008), a positive influence of population density (0.050, [-0.009; 0.109], p = 0.095) and temperature (0.301, [-0.518; 1.120], p = 0.472) is only directionally informative, but not statistically significant. Conversely, counties with more Hispanic Americans are less affected by the pandemic, with borderline statistical significance (-0.447, [-0.915; 0.021], p = 0.061). We could not find a significant effect for counties with a higher Native American (0.763, [-0.209; 1.735], p = 0.124) or Hawaiian population (1.478, [0.506; 2.450], p = 0.538) though. We see that higher income and education levels are associated with a less aggressive outbreak (household income: -3.854, [-7.437; -0.271]; p = 0.035; nonproficiency in English: 2.090; [0.547; 3.633]; p = 0.008; math grade: -0.002, [-0.004; 000]; p < 0.001). In counties with a higher household income, the obesity rate and the percentage of smokers tends to be lower (-0.518, p < 0.001 and -0.666, p < 0.001 respectively). Conversely, both are negatively associated with the outbreak rate. The effect of the obesity rate is highly significant (-1.093, [-1.828; -0.358], p = 0.004), but the effect of the percentage of smokers is only directionally informative (-0.784, [-3.150; 1.582], p = 0.516). Studies report that people with obesity are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms,45 but, to the best of our knowledge, a link to the infection rate has not yet been established. It could be that people with obesity heed the warnings issued by the CDC, and are extra careful avoiding social contact, in line with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model.27 Other studies report that smoking or medicinal nicotine might be a protective factor against infection by SARS-CoV-2;28,29 our ecological data does not contradict this finding. Many other variables related to good personal health are related to a slower outbreak (social associations: -2.027, [-2.911; -1.143], p < 0.001; sleep deprivation: 1.557, [0.412; 2.702], p = 0.008; preventable hospitalization: 0.001, [-0.001; 0.003], p = 0.207). Regarding age-related demographics, we confirm early observations that counties with an older population are more affected by the outbreak, with borderline significance (median age: 0.657, [-0.033; 1.347], p = 0.062). Notably, the percentage of persons under 18 years is positively associated with the outbreak rate, again with borderline significance (1.066, [-0.014; 2.146], p = 0.053). A possible reason is that younger people physically interact more frequently, closer, and longer with their friends, thus contributing to the spread of the virus. Conversely, we find no effect of differences in gender (0.167, [-0.880; 1.214], p = 0.755). None of these demographic variables are strongly correlated with any other variable. Air pollution is a significant contributor to the outbreak rate (3.329, [1.465; 5.193], p < 0.001), and, concurrently, counties with a rural environment experience a slower outbreak (-0.443, [-0.574; -0.312], p < 0.001). This calls for studies linking air pollution to the lethality of COVID-1930,31 to include the outbreak rate as a potential confounding variable. Contrariwise, a better food environment is associated with a higher outbreak rate (5.996, [1.286; 10.706], p = 0.016). While the food environment index is usually associated with a healthier lifestyle, better access to grocery stores and supermarkets in the vicinity also means more interaction with other people, and thus an increased likelihood of transmission. As a final point, we want to note that we have presented associations between contextual factors and the COVID-19 outbreak which are consistent with the deliberations leading to our research model. However, these associations, even when statistically significant, are not an inference of\nContextual Factors and COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S. Messner & Payson\ncausality. Establishing causal inference is, of course, critical for our understanding of and fight against COVID-19, but this represents a direction for further research using more detailed data at the level of individual patients."}, {"heading": "Conflict of interest", "text": "The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}, {"heading": "Human participant protection", "text": "No humans participated in this study.

Lack of universal testing and death underreporting make between-country comparisons difficult. The country-level determinants of COVID-19 mortality are unknown. Objective: Derive a measure of COVID-related death rates that is comparable across countries and identify its country-level predictors. Methods: An ecological study design of publicly available data was employed. Countries reporting >25 COVID-related deaths until 01/05/2020 were included. The outcome was the mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential predictors assessed were most recently published Demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, median age, average body mass index, smoking prevalence), Economic parameters (Gross Domestic Product per capita; environmental parameters: pollution levels, mean temperature (January-April)), comorbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer), health systems parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10,000 population and international arrivals). Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data. Results: Thirty-one countries were included.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic of proportions similar to the Spanish Influenza of 1918. As of the 1st May 2020, there have been over 224,172 deaths related to COVID-19 infection worldwide.1\nData collated from across the world suggest that the overall case fatality rate is\naround 7%, with country-level estimates ranging between 0.5-14%.2 These figures however are not useful for universal comparison as testing rates also vary by country and there is a lag phase in reported deaths that occur in the community. Consequently, there is wide variation in the reported country-specific death rates which may be attributed to variation in testing rates, underreporting or real differences in environmental, sociodemographic and health system parameters.\nThe only previous ecological study to date assessing country-level predictors of the\nseverity of the COVID-19 pandemic including data on 65 countries3 has found that the cumulative number of infected patients in each country was directly associated with the case fatality rate, whilst testing intensity was inversely associated with case fatality rate. This study found no association between health expenditure and case fatality rate. However, other important country-level predictors were not evaluated and thus their relationship with pandemic severity remains unknown.\nSeveral risk factors for COVID-related mortality have been proposed, including older\npopulation,4 higher population co-morbid burden,5 smoking,6 obesity,7 pollution levels8 and healthcare system performance.9 Furthermore, countries outside China most severely hit by\nthe pandemic were those with a high income, high GDP per capita and well-established healthcare systems, such as Italy, Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the United States.10 In contrast, lower- and middle-income countries reported much lower COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates.10 Whilst these differences may be attributable to case underreporting due to inadequate testing facilities in poorer countries, other factors may also be involved.\nIn this study, we aimed to derive a comparable measure of COVID related death\nrates. In addition, we aimed to assess the determinants for this measure by examining the association between potential country level determinants driven by hypothesis based on currently available evidence and this measure using country level publicly available data and an ecological study design."}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Study Design", "text": "An ecological study design was used.

Prevalent hypertension, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking and ambient air pollution data were obtained from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository of the World Health Organization.18 The world health organisation health index was extracted from the WHO Global Partnership for Education (GPE) paper series published in 2000.19 Country-level total hospital beds per 10,000 population data were extracted from the World Bank Dataset \u201cWorld Bank Indicators of Interest to the COVID-19 Outbreak\u201d.20\nDefinition of outcome and predictors"}, {"heading": "Outcome", "text": "Whilst previous ecological studies of other epidemics have utilised case or death\ncounts as outcome,21 these variables may be prone to bias due to variations in country level control measures including different testing strategies,22 variations in population movement controls and differences in secondary attack rates within community cohorts23. The mean mortality rate was thus chosen as outcome instead, since it is independent of these highly variable parameters and may thus represent a more reliable indicator of the country-level severity of the COVID-19 pandemic\nMean mortality rate was defined as the slope of the mean mortality curve (Figure 1),\nmeasured from the first day when more than 2 COVID-19 deaths were reported until either the mortality curve reached a peak value or the 1st of May 2020, whichever occurred first. Before slope calculation, the mortality curve in each country was smoothed using a locally weighted (Lowess) regression using a bandwidth of 0.4. In order to ensure a good fit of the Lowess regression line, only countries having reported at least 25 daily deaths until the 1st of May 2020 were included. The mean mortality rate thus represents an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve.

It was calculated in the year 2000. The index uses five weighted parameters: overall or average disability-adjusted life expectancy (25%), distribution or equality of disability-adjusted life expectancy (25%), overall or average healthcare system responsiveness (including speed of provision and quality of amenities; 12.5%), distribution or equality of healthcare system responsiveness (12.5%) and healthcare expenditure (25%).

Predictors reaching a P-value <0.3 at univariable level were then included in a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the mean mortality rate outcome: median age, pollution levels, international arrivals, prevalent neoplasms, median BMI, prevalent hypertension, WHO health index, percentage of population living in urban areas and GDP per capita."}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "Table 1 and Supplementary File 1 detail the analysed data for the 31 included\ncountries, including the calculated mean mortality rates.

In the multivariable linear regression model, the only predictor that reached statistical significance was international arrivals, a proxy of global connection."}, {"heading": "Comparison with literature.", "text": "A recently published ecological study analysed the country-level predictors of the\ncase fatality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from 65 countries.3 This study found that upon adjustment for epidemic age, health expenditure and world region, the case fatality rate was significantly associated with increasing cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and decreasing testing intensity.3 Nevertheless, no other country-level predictors were included in this study.\nFurther comparisons can nevertheless be made with data from previous respiratory\nvirus pandemics. Nikolopoulos et al reported a negative association between health expenditure and death rates from the 2009 influenza pandemic in 30 European countries.21 Several other previous studies have also reported associations between airline travel and spread of the H1N1 influenza virus infection.32\nComorbidities may account for differences in mortality rates across countries. A\nstudy among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China showed that patients with any comorbidity, including diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, had poorer clinical outcomes than those without.5 We thus accounted for country-level data on a selection of key comorbidities in our analysis which included prevalent diabetes mellitus, neoplasms, and hypertension. Diabetes mellitus is significantly associated with all\u2010cause and\ncardiovascular disease mortality globally. BMI \u226540kg/m2 has been identified as an\nindependent risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.7 Finally, a recent systematic review on 5 studies from China showed that smoking is likely associated with negative outcomes and progression of COVID-19.6\nInterpretation of findings.\nIn our multivariate model, the only significant predictor for mortality was\ninternational arrivals. Travel restrictions and their effectiveness in containing respiratory virus pandemics remains a contentious subject. In 2007 the WHO published a protocol on \u2018rapid operations to contain the initial emergence of pandemic influenza\u2019, which included recommendations on travel restrictions.33 However, subsequent guidance advises such restrictions are not recommended once a virus has spread significantly.34 A recent systematic review of 23 studies that assessed the effectiveness of internal and international travel restrictions in the containment of influenza demonstrated limited impact from these restrictions. They found that internal travel restrictions delayed pandemic peak by approximately 1.5 weeks, that 90% air travel restriction delayed the spread of pandemics by approximately 3\u20134 weeks but only reduced attack rates by less than 0.02% and that social and economic impacts need to be evaluated.35 However, a systematic review of combination strategies for pandemic influenza response showed that combination strategies including travel restrictions increased the effectiveness of individual policies.36\nThe WHO recommendations for pandemic preparedness and resilience recommends\nthat points of entry into the country should be monitored by focussing on surveillance and risk communication to travellers but falls short of closing down international travel.37 Interestingly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries (such as Thailand) have adopted aggressive international travel screening and isolation policies, which may have led to lower infection rates.38 Our study suggests that travel restrictions have the potential to influence the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and should be part of a structured and rapidly instigated pandemic preparedness plan. Any policy on the restriction of international\ntravel should be developed taking into account the economic and social impacts of such restrictions.\nStrengths and Limitations.\nThe main strength of this study lies in its use of comparable and relevant outcome\ndata derived from contemporary death reporting from countries affected by COVID-19. As testing rates for the virus vary across countries, the incidence or prevalence of the disease cannot be compared between countries. While death from the disease is a hard outcome, the denominator information to calculate death rates make between-country comparisons difficult. In addition, the deaths in the community, particularly in the elderly living in care homes, often go untested and thus firm diagnosis remains impossible. Therefore, in this study we have adopted an outcome that is comparable in terms of the increase in the rate of death, rather than death rates per se. Therefore, this may better represent the spread and seriousness of pandemic in individual countries when comparing countries at different stages of the pandemic. The country-level parameters assessed as potential predictors have all been implicated at some point to be associated with severity and consequently mortality. We however found that the only significant predictor to be total number of international arrivals in the country (2018 figures), signifying transmission of the infection through travel. Although the data was from 2018, there is no reason to believe that international travel figures between countries would be different in early 2020. Our model had a reasonably good fit to the data, explaining around 77% of the between country variation in mean death rates.\nThe main limitation of the study stems from the ecological study design. Despite the\nfact that we did not find any association between comorbidities such as diabetes, cancer\nand hypertension and the mean death rates at country level, it is possible for an individual with any or all of these comorbid conditions to be more susceptible to the infection and consequently at increased risk of dying. Only including countries that had reported at least 25 deaths reduced our sample and consequently the power. This may also result in the regression model overfitting the data. Other explanatory variables associated with COVID19 related mortality may have been missed and some of the covariate data used in our model predates the COVID outbreak and may not be relevant at this time point. Furthermore, as new countries are affected by the epidemic, the virulence of the virus and resistance of the human body may have changed over time which was not accounted for in our model. Lastly, it is possible that the quality of data, especially underreporting of deaths, may have been associated with some of the predictors in our model and thus biased our results."}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Out of all the country-level parameters assessed, international travel was the only\nsignificant predictor of the severity of the first global wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that many of world middle and lower-income countries are showing signs of continued rise in infection rates, international travel restrictions applied early in the pandemic course may be an effective measure to avoid rapidly increasing infection and death rates globally."}, {"heading": "CONTRIBUTORSHIP", "text": "PKM and SB conceived the idea.

The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n=1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced even higher levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. We conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms during lockdown. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e. state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. To prevent stress, authorities should explain containment measures well, highlight positive aspects of the crisis, address worries, and facilitate support.\nKeywords: COVID-19, containment measures, psychological impact, empirical model, stress"}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "COVID-19 evokes stress in patients, healthcare professionals, and relatives (1). The impact\nmay not be limited to those directly affected; health worries and uncertainty are assumed to generate fear, anxiety, and severe stress in the general population (2). Hence, mental health practitioners anticipate a sharp rise in the need for mental health services (3). Some individuals may be more vulnerable to psychosocial consequences; risk factors include mental or physical preexisting conditions, working in healthcare, or social isolation (4,5).\nSwitzerland was among the countries first and most affected by COVID-19 in Europe. To\ncurb the spread of the virus, the Swiss government enacted a set of containment measures: encouraging hygiene, giving shelter-in-place orders, as well as closing borders, child-care facilities, schools, restaurants, bars, leisure facilities, and non-essential shops. Events and gatherings of more than five individuals were banned.\nThese measures directly affect the general population and may come with side effects.\nReduced social interactions are risk factors for mental disorders such as major depression (6), and the containment measures may trigger an economic downturn, thus adding further stress (7). Early studies on COVID-19 observed increased stress levels (8). However, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that determine individual stress in this crisis. We assume that fear of COVID-19 and the local infection rate trigger stress (9,10). Individual, economic, and societal worries are also expected to increase stress levels. Agreement with containment measures, perceived support, (9,11), and being optimistic about the crisis (12), are likely to decrease stress. During the lockdown, we surveyed 1565 individuals in Switzerland online."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "First, we compared the observed stress levels in our sample (M=15.58; SD=6.65) to a\nrepresentative community sample under normal conditions (M=12.57; SD=6.24) (13). A onesample Gauss test showed higher stress levels during the lockdown period, z=19.08, p <.001. The effect (d=.48) is medium to strong.\nIn a second step, we computed multiple comparisons (ANOVA) of different subgroups\n(see Table 1). Women expressed higher stress levels than men, as has been found in non-epidemic situations (14). Young individuals reported the highest stress levels, whereas the levels were lowest for individuals older than 65 years (small to medium effect). The majority of respondents (66%)\nagreed with the measures of the Swiss authorities. These individuals scored lower on stress than individuals who felt that the measures were either not sufficient or too extreme. Individuals who strongly disagreed experienced even more stress (medium effect). Individuals who reported that the lockdown situation also has positive aspects (89.4%) had substantially lower stress levels compared to those who did not see any positive aspects at all (strong effect).\nNo other assessed variable influenced stress (cf. Table 1). Interestingly, individuals\nidentifying as members of a risk group, as well as individuals working in healthcare or in essential shops with customer contact, did not experience more stress than the rest of the population. Also, the expected duration of the pandemic and amount of news consumption had no influence on stress.\nIn a third step, we conducted a path analysis with stress as the target variable. Figure 1\ndepicts the resulting model, showing a good fit.\nIn total, the measured variables explain 30% of variance in the endogenous variable, stress.\nWorries contribute the most to stress, and worries mediate between fear of COVID-19 and stress. Seeing positive aspects of the crisis, as well as agreement with the government\u2019s containment strategy, are correlated, and both mitigate worries and boost perceived support. In addition, positive thinking directly minimizes stress. Perceived support from family, friends, organizations, and authorities mitigates worries and reduces stress."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation strategies increase the\npopulation\u2019s stress level. In our model, fear of the virus is the most important booster of worries and the amount of worries is the most important driver of stress. Agreeing with the authorities\u2019 containment strategy and seeing positive aspects of the crisis are important factors mitigating stress. Correspondingly, feeling that the containment measures are not sufficient or too extreme is\nassociated with more stress. Support provided by family, friends, organizations, and authorities are also important protective factors for stress.\nIn our study, risk factors for high stress levels are a high amount of worries and perceived\nlack of support and, to a lesser extent, high infection rates. Eleven percent of the respondents do not see anything positive about the crisis. This group experiences substantially more stress than individuals who see at least one positive aspect. Although seeing something positive about the crisis may be associated with the individual situation, personality traits, and respondent\u2019s coping behavior (12), our findings indicate that recognizing positive aspects alleviates stress. Our model builds upon existing theories of stress and explains 30% of the variance in stress.\nSurprisingly, members of the risk groups, old respondents and individuals working in\nhealthcare or essential shops with customer contact, did not score higher on stress. One reason could be that extensive protection measures had been mandated. In addition, healthcare providers in Switzerland have so far not been overwhelmed by cases of COVID-19.\nOur model could be useful in understanding and addressing the psychological impact of\npossible new waves of COVID-19 cases and other epidemics. Mitigation measures boost worries and stress, particularly for those individuals who feel that these measures are not sufficient or go too far. Highlighting positive aspects about the crisis and convincing people of the effectiveness and the necessity of containment measures may not only boost compliance, but also decrease stress, since individuals feel protected by the authorities and experience less worries. This, in turn, will hopefully limit the impact on mental health as a consequence of the crisis. Providing support is another important way to mitigate worries, enable coping, and reduce stress.\nMaterials and Methods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "From March 27 to April 26, 2020, a total of 1565 individuals completed the online survey.\nThey were recruited via academic institutions and social media.

We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PPS-10) (10-items) (13, 14). The widely-used\nPSS is based on the stress-related components of unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading life events (e.g. \u201cIn the last month, how often have you been angry because of things that were outside your control?\u201d), (0=never; 4=very often). A PSS score was calculated by summing up all items, with a high score indicating high stress levels. Reliability was high (Chronbach\u2019s alpha = .86).\nAmount of worries. Participants evaluated to what extent they were worried about the\nfollowing aspects (1=not at all; 5=a lot): physical health, mental health, health of family and friends, security, social life, personal needs, financial situation, job security, economic situation, healthcare, and basic supply.

The aims of this investigation were to track changes and risk factors for mental 24 health outcomes during state-mandated quarantine. Adults residing in Brazil (n = 360, 37.9 years 25 of age, 68.9% female) were surveyed at the start of quarantine and 1 month later. Outcomes 26 assessed included perceived stress, state anxiety and depression. Aside from demographics, 27 behaviors and attitudes assessed included exercise, diet, use of tele-psychotherapy and number of 28 COVID-19 related risk factors, such as perceived risk of COVID-19, information overload, and 29 feeling imprisoned. Overall, all mental health outcomes worsened from Time 1 to time 2, 30 although there was a significant gender x time interaction for stress. 9.7% of the sample reported 31 stress above the clinical cut-off (2 SD above mean), while 8.0% and 9.4% were above this cutoff 32 for depression and anxiety, respectively. In repeated measures analysis, female gender, 33 worsening diet and excess of COVID-19 information was related to all mental health outcomes. 34 Changes in diet for the worse were associated with increases in anxiety. Exercise frequency was 35 clearly related to state anxiety (0 days/week > 6 days/week). Those who did aerobic exercise did 36 not have any increase in depression. Use of tele-psychotherapy predicted lower levels of 37 depression and anxiety. In multiple regression, anxiety was predicted by the greatest number of 38\nCOVID-19 specific factors. In conclusion, mental health outcomes worsened for Brazilians 39 during the first month of quarantine and these changes are associated with a variety of risk 40 factors. 41\nKeywords: COVID-19; SARS-Cov-2; Depression; Anxiety; Stress 42\n43\nIntroduction 44\nMental health comprises the set of emotions, thoughts and behaviours that enable individuals to 45 work, cope and deal with problems in everyday tasks (WHO, 2004). Historically, although 46 researchers from the biomedical sciences dedicated more time and resources in the study of 47 physical health, findings from the last 50 years have slowly captured the interest of scientists 48 from diverse fields to look upon mental health to explain somatic diseases, physical functioning, 49 quality-of-life, well-being and work productivity, (Christensen et al., 1999; Prince et al., 2007; 50 Stults-Kolehmainen, Tuit & Sinha, 2014). For instance, mental health is associated with 51 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and premature mortality (Vigo, Kestel, Pendakur et al., 52 2019) with 17% of DALYs attributable to mental health in Brazil and 22% in the United States. 53 Those with worse mental health, such as higher levels of chronic stress, have a greater risk for 54 physical health problems, such as cardiovascular disease (Stults-Kolehmainen, 2013). Poor 55 mental health costs society a great deal of money, in terms of lost productivity, strain on 56 healthcare systems, loss of income and other consequences (Trautman, Rehm, Wittchen, 2016). 57 On the other hand, recent research from the World Health Organization suggests that every one 58 American-dollar spent in mental health care is equivalent to a return of four American-dollars in 59 better well-being and ability to work (WHO, 2016).Thus, a person who has good mental health 60 entails someone who is physically healthy, happy and productive for themselves and the greater 61 functioning of society (Prince et al., 2007; WHO, 2016). 62\nThe recent outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) around the 63 world at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 led to a series of guidelines to avoid mass 64 contamination and limit its lethality (WHO, 2020). Among these recommendations are 65 quarantine, confinement and social distancing (Wilder-Smith & Freeman, 2020). These 66 impositions mean that people cannot walk freely from their homes; they need to keep a 2-meter 67 physical distance from one another on the streets and sick people are obliged to be confined in 68 hospitals or their own homes without any kind of physical proximity to others. These restrictions 69 are intended to benefit the physical health and safety of all people and must be adopted to save 70 lives. Unfortunately, such directives come at a cost to the mental health and well-being a 71 substantial proportion of the population (Rubin & Wessely, 2020). Furthermore, not all 72 individuals in Brazil adhere to quarantine guidelines, obedience of Brazilians to social isolation 73 during quarantine peaked at 63% on March 23rd 2020 and average 47% (INLOCO, 2020), 74 perhaps explaining why Brazil has the highest contagion rate (R0 = 2.81) in the world as of 75 April, 2020 (Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team, 2020). 76\n77\nAn updated systematic review on the effects of social distancing and quarantine on mental health 78 revealed that anxiety, depression, stress, anger, insomnia, hopelessness, and sadness were all 79 increased during those conditions (Brooks et al., 2020). A recent study (Hu, Su et al., 2020) from 80 a cross-national sample (n = 992) in China found that levels of anxiety increased, and 9.6% of 81 the population was anxious at clinically relevant levels. Other behavioural problems also appear 82 during this period; participants in a nationwide survey recently published in China reported 83 nutritional issues, lack of ability to exercise and numerous changes in daily routines and habits 84 (Qiu et al., 2020). Accordingly, psychosocial and behavioural dimensions seem associated under 85 quarantine conditions (Filgueiras & Stults-Kolehmainen, 2020). Similar findings were also 86 depicted in research conducted in other quarantine situations, such as: the Severe Acute 87 Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Canada (Hawryluck et al., 2004), Taiwan (Bai et al., 88 2004) and Hong Kong (Lee et al., 2005), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 89 epidemic caused by another strain of Corona Virus in Korea (Jeong et al., 2016) and the equine 90 influenza epidemic in Australia (Taylor et al., 2008). Altogether, the evidence suggests that 91 quarantine leads to an increase of mental health issues. 92\nIdentifying risk factors that modify the mental health experience of quarantine and social 93 isolation is important. Research among people in normal and healthy conditions has shown that 94 sociodemographic variables, health behaviours and other daily routines are linked to better 95 mental health. Among the most commonly investigated demographic variables are gender 96 (Almeida & Kessler, 1998; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001) education (Steele et al., 2007) and age 97 (Christensen et al., 1999). For health behaviours, a large literature suggests that moderate to 98 vigorous physical exercise from three to five times per week leads to reduced anxiety (Wipfli, 99 Rethorst & Landers, 2008), depression (Craft & Landers, 1998; de Oliveira et al., 2018), stress 100 (Stults-Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014) and other mental health issues (Landers & Arendt, 2007). 101 Similar associations are found with dietary habits; a diet low in fat, sugar or carbohydrate tends 102 to be associated with fewer psychological issues (Molendijk et al., 2018; O\u2019Neil et al, 2014). 103 Aside from these health behaviors, finding and receiving mental health support is imperative for 104 many individuals at risk. Psychologists and other mental health practitioners who provide online 105 or tele-psychotherapy may also help to improve mental health conditions (Varker et al., 2019). 106\nUnfortunately, resources are scarce in every field of the health system, including those for mental 107 health (Qiu et al., 2020). Therefore, it is pivotal to establish a priori where and how to invest 108 those scarce resources. This is a difficult task because the current stressor is highly unique. 109 Quarantine is due to a pandemic of truly global proportions that has reached every level of 110 society, with a long duration and remarkable social upheaval (WHO, 2020). There is no research 111 on the association between psychological, demographic and behaviour variables in the general 112 population during society-wide social isolation. Furthermore, it is a consensus that psychological 113 phenomena, such as stress and depression, are multifactorial with a large amount of variables to 114 consider (WHO, 2004; 2016). In order to help governments, service providers and scientists to 115\nestablish public policies toward resource allocation in mental health during the COVID-19 116 pandemic crisis, this study aimed to fill the gap in the current literature. Three psychological 117 dimensions were queried due to their relevance in the literature: (i) perceived stress (Hawryluck 118 et al., 2004; Qiu et al., 2020), (ii) depression (Brooks et al., 2020) and (iii) state anxiety (Jeong 119 et al., 2016; Rubin & Wessely, 2020). The aims of this investigation were two-fold. First, this 120 research was intended to track mental health changes over two time points during quarantine. 121 The second objective was to associate mental health outcomes with pertinent demographic, 122 behavioural and COVID-19 specific factors. 123\n124\nMaterials & Methods 125\nThe present research is a longitudinal psychosocial study that collected data in two periods: the 126 first week of quarantine decreed by state authorities of the last Brazilian state that adhere to 127 quarantine (Sao Paulo, 2020) and four weeks after this decree. The Ethical Committee of the first 128 author\u2019s institution approved the project under the process #2020.2014-0932-12. Participants 129 were allowed to leave the online questionnaires at any time and procedures obeyed the 130 Declaration of Helsinki. 131\nVolunteers for this study were 360 (248 women, 68.9%) Brazilians or foreigners living in Brazil 132 from 9 States and 23 different cities. This research was conducted in Brazilian Portuguese, so it 133 was necessary to know how to read and write in this language. All participants digitally signed 134 the Term of Consent and agreed to be contacted after the first round of data collection to be part 135 of the second round. A total of 1,849 participants answered the first round, nonetheless, only 360 136 (19.5%) participated in the second round. 137\nThere were four instrument measures adopted: a sociodemographic and attitudinal questionnaire, 138 the Perceived Stress Scale with 10 items (PSS-10), the Filgueiras Depression Inventory (FDI) 139 and the State subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI). The sociodemographic 140 questionnaire had 20 questions in this order: (i) age, (ii) gender, (iii) education, (iv) height, (v) 141 weight, (vi) whether the participant had any physical risk factor for COVID-19, whether he/she 142 used during quarantine (vii) telepsychotherapy, (viii) telemedicine, (ix) online nutritionist and (x) 143 online fitness coach. This questionnaire also asked about exercise habits: (xi) frequency of 144 exercise during quarantine in days, (xii) whether there were changes in the frequency of exercise 145 comparing before and during quarantine (options were \u201cno changes\u201d; \u201cincreased exercise 146 frequency\u201d and \u201cdecreased exercise frequency\u201d) and (xiii) types of exercise (aerobic, anaerobic, 147 both, no exercise). It also collected data regarding diet and nutritional habits: (xiv) possible 148 changes on diet by comparing before and during quarantine; whether the person (xv) gained or 149 (xvi) lost more than 5 kilograms since the beginning of the quarantine. Finally, attitudinal 150 questions were also computed. One question (xvii) asked about the amount of information the 151 participant felt he/she was receiving and the answers were provided in three possible categories 152 to choose from: \u201cToo much information\u201d, \u201cEnough information\u201d and \u201cLittle information\u201d. 153\nAnother three items were informed in a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 \u201cTotally 154 agree\u201d to 5 \u201cTotally disagree\u201d; the items were: (xviii) \u201cDo you feel imprisoned due to this 155 quarantine?\u201d, (xix) \u201cDo you feel you are able to understand what is happening?\u201d, (xx) \u201cDo you 156 trust your own ability to differentiate good from bad sources of information?\u201d. 157\nThe PSS-10 (Cohen & Williamson, 1988) is a 10-item questionnaire that asks individuals about 158 their perception regarding stress-like symptoms. It is answered in a five-point Likert-type scale 159 ranging from 0 \u201cNever\u201d to 4 \u201cVery often\u201d (scores range from 0-40). The population mean is 17.0 160 (SD = 5.02) with a score over 27 indicating excessive stress (Cacciari, Haddad, Dalmas, 2016). 161 The FDI (Filgueiras et al., 2014) is a 20-item scale that asks individuals to grade the level of 162 association between the respondent\u2019s own self-perception and one-word items extracted from 163 depression symptoms listed in the DSM-V in the last fortnight. It is rated in a six-point Likert-164 type scale ranging from 0 \u201cnot related to me at all\u201d to 5 \u201ctotally related to me\u201d (scores range 165 from 0-100). The reference mean is 53.3 (SD = 17.3) with 88 or higher indicating a cut-off for 166 depressive symptomology (Filgueiras et al., 2014). The S-STAI (Spielberg, Gorsuch & Lushene, 167 1970) is a subscale of a broader questionnaire that assess state (one\u2019s current mood state) and 168 trait (dispositional and personality-related traits) anxiety. The focus of S-STAI is the mood state 169 of the respondent who answers questions about own feelings in a four-point Likert-type scale 170 ranging from 1 \u201cnot at all\u201d to 4 \u201cvery much so\u201d (scores range from 0-80). Gender-specific 171 reference means are 36.5 (SD = 21.4) for men and 43.7 (12.6) for women, with cut-offs being 66 172 for men and 69 for women (Pasquali, Pinelli Jr, Soha, 1994). 173\nVolunteers of the present research answered the questionnaires in the Google Forms online 174 platform that was configured in the same order of presentation: 1) Term of Consent, 2) 175 demographic and attitudinal questionnaire, 3) PSS-10, 4) FDI, 5) S-STAI, 6) Thank you page. 176 Those participants who answered \u201cno\u201d to the Term of Consent were addressed to the Thank you 177 page without having any contact with the other questionnaires. First round of data collection 178 (time 1) took place between March 20th and March 25th, 2020, whereas the second round (time 2) 179 happened between April 15th and April 20th, 2020. 180\nAfter data collection, Google Spreadsheets were utilized to consolidate the database and to 181 export it in the format .csv. Then, researchers used SPSS (IBM, version 21.0) to run the analyses. 182 Descriptive statistics of PSS-10, FDI and S-STAI were calculated for each categorical 183 (demographic) variable with exception of those that were answered in Likert-type scales. Due to 184 the large amount of variables collected in an online platform, Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) was 185 calculated for the three scales in time 1 and time 2; results were expected to show \u03b1 > .70. 186 Pairwise t-test comparisons between groups were computed to identify significant differences 187 between the first round (time 1) and second round (time 2) of data collection for the whole 188 sample. A repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to compare within and between groups 189 for each demographic independent variable. Furthermore, prevalence of stress, depression and 190 anxiety-like symptoms were calculated in percentage of participants above the means and cut-off 191\npoints respective to the norms developed in previous studies in the Brazilian sample (Cacciari, 192 Haddad & Dalmas, 2016; Filgueiras et al., 2014; Pasquali, Pinelli Jr & Solha,1994). 193\nA correlation matrix of the PSS-10, FDI and S-STAI results at time 1 and time 2 were developed 194 to identify possible discrepancies, associations and to ensure measure validity. The authors opted 195 to compute three Linear Multiple Regressions (LMR) using the stepwise method to find the 196 strength and ability of independent variables (i.e., demographic, behavioural and attitudinal) to 197 predict PSS-10, FDI and S-STAI total scores in time 2. Total scores of mental health 198 questionnaires in time 1 were put in the first step of the LMR, and the other variables were put in 199 the second step. Categorical items were identified as dummy variables, whereas Likert-type 200 answers were computed as ordinal data. The criterion for keeping a variable in the regression 201 was the same as all other null-hypothesis tests (i.e., pairwise t-test and repeated-measures 202 ANOVA); significance was deemed when p<0.05. The coefficient beta (\u03b2) was inspected to 203 reveal the direction and strength of the association between independent and dependent 204 variables; whereas the coefficient of determination (r2) revealed the amount of variance 205 explained by the model. 206\nFinally, effect-sizes for the t-test of the LMR and the repeated-measures ANOVA (between, 207 within and interaction) were calculated using the software G*Power 3.1 that also provided the 208 interpretation criteria. The t-test effect-size was measured by the Cohen\u2019s d, rule of thumb for 209 this measure is: above 0.20 and below 0.50, the effect is small, above 0.50 and below 0.80, the 210 effect is moderate, above 0.80 the effect is large. The repeated-measure ANOVA effect-size was 211 measured by Cohen\u2019s f and categorization goes as follows: above 0.10 and below 0.30, the effect 212 is small, above 0.30 and below 0.50 the effect is moderate, and above 0.50 the effect is large. 213\nResults 214\nParticipants reported an age average of 37.90 (SD=12.33) years and were in quarantine for 3.52 215 (SD=1.77) days in the first round of data collection and 19.08 (SD=3.86) days in the second 216 round. Regarding Education, 98 volunteers reported to have either begun or finished high school 217 (27.2%), 175 had at least began College (48.6%), 57 were attending to a Master\u2019s course (15.8%) 218 and 30 (8.3%) had begun their PhD. 219\nParticipants reported changes in diet during the second round of data collection in reference to 220 the first round. One hundred and sixteen participants (32.2%) reported to have worsened their 221 diets from time 1 to time 2, 59 (16.4%) reported no significant changes in diet habits, whereas 222 185 (51.4%) answered that they were having a better diet than when they began quarantine. 223\nAt time 1, those reporting no exercise were 219 (60.8%), 1-to-3 days a week N=72 (20.0%) and 224 4 or more days a week N=69 (19.2%). At time 2, no exercise was 69 (19.2%), 1-to-3 days a week 225 N=14 (3.9%) and 4 or more days of exercise N=277 (76.9%). No one reported exercising 7 days 226 a week. This was in contrast to perceptions of change in exercise. One hundred eleven (30.8%) 227 of respondents reported exercising less, 147 (40.8%) reported the same level of exercise and 102 228\n(28.3%) reported more exercise. The percentage of women and men who did tele-psychotherapy 229 was 72.8% and 27.2%, respectively. 230\nEven though data collection used an online platform and participants had to answer a large 231 amount of questions, Scales were reliable according to the adopted criterion (\u03b1 > .70) in both 232 time 1 and 2. The PSS-10 had \u03b1 = .855 in the first round and \u03b1 = .834 in the second round. The 233 FDI presented \u03b1 = .911 and \u03b1 = .954 in times 1 and 2, respectively. The SSTAI showed \u03b1 = .759 234 in the first time period and \u03b1 = .713 in the second time period. 235\nTable 1 depicts average and standard deviation (SD) of PSS-10, FDI and S-STAI stratified by the 236 independent variables at time 1 and time 2. Mental health variables worsened significantly from 237 the first round of data collection to the second, i.e., stress (p = .007), depression (p = .00003) and 238 anxiety (p = .004). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that within-group effects were 239 significant for all outcomes (criterion p < .05) demonstrating that from time 1 to time 2 there was 240 an increase in stress, depression and anxiety. Across all mental health outcome variables, 241 significant between-group effects were observed for the following 3 predictors: 1. gender 242 (women had significantly higher scores than men), 2. changes in diet (participants who felt that 243 their diet worsened reported increased levels of psychological issues), and 3. amount of 244 information (those who reported to receive too much information about COVID-19/quarantine 245 also showed greater mental health dysfunction). Effect sizes ranged from .01 to .51. A gender x 246 time interaction was observed (p = .0000008) for perceived stress. Men did not change in stress 247 level but women had a significant increase (effect size = .28). 248\nBeyond those three variables, between groups significant differences regarding perceived stress 249 occurred for four other variables: number of days of exercise per week, type of exercise, use of 250 online fitness coaching and risk for COVID-19. Regarding depression, statistical differences 251 appeared in four other variables: education, type of exercise, use of online nutritionists and use 252 of tele-psychotherapy. Finally, regarding anxiety, between groups significant differences were 253 shown in two other variables: risk for COVID-19 and use of tele-psychotherapy. Results for the 254 repeated-measures ANOVA are depicted in the supplemental material. 255\n---------------------------------------------------------------- 256\nPLEASE, INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE 257\n---------------------------------------------------------------- 258\nFor perceived stress, 237 (65.8%) and 269 (74.7%) of participants scored above the population 259 mean at time 1 and 2, respectively. Prevalence of excessive stress (>2 SD above reference mean) 260 was 6.9% (IC 95 5.2%-8.6%) in the first round and 9.7% (IC 95 8.2%-11.2%) in the second 261 round. Of the 34 individuals in this category, 94% of these individuals were women. 82% did no 262 exercise at all, but the remaining 18% complete 6 days a week of exercise. Also, 0% utilized 263 tele-psychotherapy. Regarding depression, 224 (62.2%) and 260 (72.2%) of participants were 264 above the reference mean at Time 1 and 2, respectively. High depression (>2 SD above reference 265 mean) had a prevalence of 4.2% (IC 95 3.6%-4.8%) at time 1 and 8.0% (IC 95 7.1%-8.9%) at 266\ntime 2. Participants > 2 SD (n = 24) were mostly women (88%) and did not utilized tele 267 psychotherapy (88%). The number of male participants above the reference mean for state 268 anxiety was 54 (48.2%) and 72 (64.3%) at time 1 and 2, respectively. For women it was 132 269 (53.2%) and 163 (65.7%). Prevalence of excessive state anxiety (>2 SD above reference mean) 270 was 8.7% (IC 95 7.4%-10.0%) in the first round against 14.9% (IC 95 12.3%-17.5%) in the 271 second round. Those > 2 SD had worsening diet (45 of 53 participants) and reported no tele-272 psychotherapy (81%). 273\nCorrelations between mental health variables were all statistically significant, but varied between 274 small and moderate at time (r=.33 - .50) at time 1 and small (r = .20 - .27) at time 2. The 275 intertemporal correlations from time 1 to time 2 for stress, depression and anxiety were .61, .69 276 and .79, respectively. Small correlations were found between different predictor variables, such 277 as exercise frequency and perceived stress (r = -.28); whereas, moderate correlations were found 278 between the same variable between time 1 and time 2 (intertemporal correlations). Tables 3 and 279 Supplemental 2 provide the correlation matrix of the psychological variables. 280 281 ---------------------------------------------------------------- 282\nPLEASE, INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE 283\n---------------------------------------------------------------- 284\nThe linear multiple regression (LMR) model for perceived stress revealed that the dependent 285 variable (PSS-10, time 2) was predicted by the score of the PSS-10 at time 1, number of days of 286 exercise, risk for COVID-19, types of exercise, changes in the frequency of exercise, feeling 287 imprisoned, days in quarantine and gender in order of strength of the coefficient \u03b2. Altogether, 288 those variables explained 56% of the variance. The depression LMR showed that the dependent 289 variable (FDI time 2) was predicted by the score of the FDI time 1, types of exercise, own ability 290 to understand what is happening, level of education and gender respectively. Independent 291 variables explained 33% of the variance of depression in the second round of data collection. 292 Finally, the state anxiety LMR depicted that the dependent variable (S-STAI time 2) was 293 predicted, in order of association, risk for COVID-19, feeling safe, the score of S-STAI time 1, 294 weight loss, changes on diet, amount of information, feeling imprisoned and age. Independent 295 variables of this LMR explained cumulatively 42% of the variance. Table 3 presents the 296 coefficient \u03b2, the t-test statistics, effect-size and coefficient of determination for the three LMR. 297\n---------------------------------------------------------------- 298\nPLEASE, INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE 299\n---------------------------------------------------------------- 300\nDiscussion 301\nThe current investigation provides a unique glimpse into the mental health of Brazilians in the 302 midst of quarantine from the COVID-19 pandemic, a novel, disruptive and society-wide stressor. 303 Findings indicate that a substantial portion of respondents were distressed at both time points, 304\nwith worsening mental health from the initiation of quarantine to a point one month later. More 305 specifically, increases in perceived stress, depression and state anxiety were observed, with a 306 gender x time interaction recorded for stress. Men experienced increases in depression and 307 anxiety over time, but not for perceived stress. Across genders, the number of days in quarantine 308 was linearly related to worse perceptions of perceived stress. Repeated measures ANOVA 309 revealed that 3 factors were all related to worse levels of stress, depression and anxiety: female 310 gender, worsening diet and excess of COVID-19 information. In regression analyses, however, 311 mental health outcomes were influenced by a variety of other demographic, COVID-19 specific, 312 and behavioural factors, such as use of tele-psychotherapy. Exercise-related factors, such as 313 exercise frequency, were the predominate predictors of perceived stress. 314\nA substantial portion of the participants reported levels of stress, depression and anxiety above 315 established means for the population. At time 2, greater than 70% of the sample was above the 316 normative mean for both stress and depression. For anxiety, >60% of both men and women were 317 above the normative mean. More importantly, some participants scored very high for mental 318 health disturbances, especially at time 2. For stress, 9.7% of the sample was above 2 SD at time 319 2, whereas the prevalence according to the Brazilian norms is 6.8% (Cacciari, Haddad & 320 Dalmas, 2016). This was an increase from 6.9% at time 1. Similar trends were seen for 321 depression (4.2% at time 1, 8.0% at time 2; versus a norm of 4.1%) (Filgueiras et al., 2014) and 322 state anxiety (8.7% increasing to 14.9%; versus a norm of 9.4%) (Pasquali, Pinelli Jr & 323 Solha,1994). This is similar to anxiety levels observed in a large sample during quarantine in 324 China (Hu, Su et al., 2020). While the percentage of individuals scoring at these extremes is still 325 relatively low, it potentially represents a huge increase in burden to society when multiplied 326 across the entire population. Mental health initiatives on the national level would have to be 327 scaled up to meet new demand (WHO, 2008). Key to this endeavour would be a) identifying 328 those most at risk and b) properly assessing their condition. 329\nIn the effort to identify those most at risk, pertinent predictors of mental health outcomes were 330 analysed. Interestingly, each mental health indicator was predicted by a varying set of factors. 331 Anxiety was predicted by the greatest number of COVID-19 related factors: feelings of safety, 332 feelings of being imprisoned, risk for COVID-19 and amount of information. In other words, 333 those who felt unsafe, cooped up, at risk for infection and being inundated with information 334 demonstrated higher levels of anxiety. This falls in line with an expansive literature reporting 335 that feelings of anxiety burgeon when people feel under threat, unsafe, and have too many 336 options and an uncertain future (Carreta et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2008). Depression, a typically 337 condition of regrets about the past (Buechler, 2015), was understandably not predicted by 338 COVID-19 related factors. Only \u201cunderstanding what is happening\u201d was a significant inverse 339 predictor. Stress was predicted by feelings of being imprisoned, days in quarantine and risk for 340 COVID-19 and also by a number of exercise factors. 341\nIn general, exercise was associated with mental health outcomes in the expected manner \u2013 more 342 frequent exercise and aerobic exercise being related to the lowest levels of distress. For all 3 343\nmental health outcomes, those with no exercise (0 days per week) had the highest average levels 344 of stress (22.9 at time 1 to 26.4 at time 2), depression (69.0 to 74.6) and anxiety (48.2 to 54.7). 345 These seems to support the previous findings that \u201csomething is better than nothing\u201d (Ekkekakis, 346 2000; Werneck, Oyeyemi, Silva, 2018). In linear regression, perceived stress was related to the 347 greatest number of exercise-related factors: exercise frequency per week, type of exercise and 348 perceived changes in exercise behaviour. Higher frequency of exercise (days/week) were 349 associated with less stress. However, the linear relationship between perceived stress and 350 exercise frequency was small (r = -.28), which is line with previous investigations (Stults-351 Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014). It should be noted that 58.2% of the sample reported that they 352 perceived that their exercise behaviour changed with a month of quarantine (30.8% doing less 353 and 28.3% doing more), which follows the known phenomenon that stressful events can either 354 inhibit or activate changes in exercise behaviors (Stults-Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014). 355 Furthermore, those who perceived that they exercised more frequently from Time 1 to Time 2 356 had less stress. Interestingly, of those very high for stress (< 2SD), 82% do no exercise at all, but 357 the remaining 18% complete 6 days a week of exercise. In LMR analysis, exercise factors 358 explained 13.1% of the adjusted variance in stress. For repeated measures, the results were 359 slightly different, with changes in exercise not being significant, but use of online fitness 360 coaching reaching significance. An interaction was observed in that those who performed 361 aerobic exercise had the lowest levels of depression at both time points. In fact, those who did 362 aerobic exercise did not have any increase in depression. However, the clearest association of 363 exercise frequency and mental health was for anxiety. Those at the highest levels of exercise had 364 the lowest anxiety and each day less was associated with more anxiety. 365\nAside from exercise, there were notable findings for dietary habits and use of tele-366 psychotherapy. Those who rated their dietary habits as becoming worse also had the highest 367 levels of stress, depression and anxiety. Those with the highest levels of anxiety were those with 368 worsening diet at the second time point (effect size for interaction was .37). Those who used 369 online nutrition services had lower levels of depression, but there was no difference for stress or 370 anxiety. Those who utilized online psychotherapy reported lower levels of depression and 371 anxiety. While there is no income data to explain use of online resources, those using online 372 resources were more educated. Thus one might surmise that those from better off demographic 373 groups are less affected partly because of greater access to resources. Given the limited quantity 374 of resources to mitigate mental health impairments during crises, such as pandemic and 375 quarantine, it is crucial to identify the risk factors that may predispose individuals for worsening 376 outcomes. 377\nDespite the progress this study makes in tracking changes in mental health and identifying risk 378 factors, the current research does demonstrate some limitations. First of all, there was no pre-379 quarantine baseline and assessments spanned just a single month. Furthermore, this was a 380 relatively well-off population with higher-educated individuals being over-represented in the 381 sample. There was no measure of adherence to quarantine guidelines. It is possible that those 382 with higher compliance to regulations could be of either higher or lower distress. To lessen 383\nsurvey fatigue for participants, validated measures of exercise and dietary habits, which can be 384 very lengthy, were not utilized. More importantly, the current data needs interpreted with some 385 caution because factors other than quarantine could contribute to changes in the mental health 386 outcomes observed, such as growing political and economic unrest in Brazil (THE LANCET, 387 2020). Also, it should be noted that effect sizes for changes over 1 month were small (Cohen\u2019s d 388 were .25 \u2013 stress, .30 \u2013 depression, and .38 \u2013 anxiety), possibly because in some cases 389 individuals had improved mental health (n = 31; 8.6%) due to quarantine conditions, such as 390 being closer to loved ones throughout the day or being removed from dangerous work 391 environments. Lastly, correlations between instruments at time 1 or time 2 were small \u2013 possibly 392 indicating the uniqueness of the quarantine as a stressor, particularly given the rapidly changing 393 circumstances during this time period (Main, Zhou et al., 2011). 394\n395\nConclusion 396\nThis study provides crucial data needed to understand how pandemic, state-mandated quarantine 397 is related to changes in mental health outcomes. From the time point when quarantine was 398 decreed until 1 month later, worsening perceived stress, depression and anxiety was observed in 399 this sample of the Brazilian population. Moreover, many individuals in the sample reported very 400 high levels of distress (> 2 SD). At the time of writing of this study, the quarantine is still being 401 enforced and cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths on rising rapidly (THE LANCET, 2020; 402 Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, 2020). Future research should continue to track 403 these trends as the crisis unfolds. Analyses from this study identified several risk factors for 404 mental health, including gender (being female), lower education, less exercise, worsening diet 405 and a lack of resources, such as access to tele-psychotherapy. COVID-19 related factors 406 predicted anxiety and stress more so than depression. The implications of these data is clear; 407 mental health worsens with great change, requiring more resources to improve the experience of 408 life in quarantine. The extent to which these can be diligently developed and allocated will 409 depend on a data-driven process such as described here. 410\n411\nAcknowledgements 412\nThe present research is funded by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel 413 Superior (CAPES) of the Ministry of Education of Brazil under the PROAP program. 414\n415\nConflict of interest 416\nAuthors report no conflict of interest. 417\n418\nReferences 419\nAlmeida D, Kessler R. 1998.

By mid-April 2020, the virus had already caused over 1.6 million cases and over 100,000 deaths worldwide [2], placing a substantial burden on national healthcare systems and posing unprecedented challenges for governments and societies. As yet, governmental responses to mitigate the coronavirus epidemic have varied considerably across countries. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, specifically intended to reduce sustained local transmission by reducing contact rates in the general population, have so far ranged from moderate containment measures, such as school closures and cancellations of public gatherings, to drastic measures, such as travel bans and nationwide lockdowns [3]. In Western democracies, individual behaviors, rather than governmental actions, are potentially crucial to control the spread of COVID-19 [4]. Human behavior is in fact a key factor in shaping the course of epidemics [5]. Individuals may spontaneously modify their behaviors and adopt preventive measures in response to an epidemic when mortality or the perception of risk is high, and this may in turn change the epidemic itself by reducing the likelihood of transmission and infection [6, 7, 8].\nHowever, a key problem is a lack of data to assess people\u2019s behavior and reactions to epidemics. Decision-making and the evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions require specific, reliable, and timely data not only about infections, but also about human behavior. Especially in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where medical treatment and vaccination are still only remote options, mitigation and containment mainly rely on massive and rapid adoption of preventive measures [9]. Understanding how the members of different demographic groups perceive the risk, and consequently adopt specific behaviors in response to it, is therefore key to measure the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, design more realistic epidemic models, and enable public health agencies to develop optimal control policies to contain the spread of COVID-19.\nWe seek to narrow this data gap by monitoring individual behaviors and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In March 2020, we launched a crossnational online survey, called the \u201cCOVID-19 Health Behavior Survey\u201d (CHBS), to collect timely data on people\u2019s health status, behaviors, close social contacts, and attitudes related to COVID-19. We recruit respondents through advertisement campaigns on Facebook, that we created via the Facebook Advertising Manager (FAM). This novel approach to recruiting respondents allows us to combine the flexibility of online surveys for rapid data collection, with the controlled environment of targeted advertisement. This makes it possible to recruit a balanced sample across demographic groups, that is approximately representative of the general population, after applying appropriate post-stratification weights [10, 11, 12]. Other similar online initiatives have emerged recently [13, 14, 15, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-national study addressing multiple key factors, ranging from individual behaviors and attitudes to health-related indicators to social contact patterns. Moreover, our sampling approach and continued data collection allows us to compare people\u2019s behaviors across countries that are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess changes in behaviors after pivotal events, such as nationwide lockdowns.\nIn this paper, we present first results based on survey data collected over the period March 13 to April 19, 2020 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Over this period, a total of 66,266 participants completed the questionnaire. Our goal in this paper is to provide insights into the relation between participants\u2019 demographic characteristics and (i) the threat they perceive COVID-19 to pose to\nvarious levels of society, (ii) the confidence they have in the preparedness of different national and international organizations to handle the current crisis, and (iii) the behavioral measures (preventive measures and social distancing measures) they have taken to protect themselves from the coronavirus. From a public health perspective, this information is key to understand the behaviors and attitudes of specific demographic groups in different countries and help guide the decision-making process to design adequate policies to contain the spread of COVID-19.\nIn the following sections, we outline our methodological approach and discuss the innovative aspects of participant recruitment through Facebook advertising campaigns, as well as the statistical adjustments needed to approximate a sample representative of the general population. Then we describe the main features of our sample and present results of the first analyses regarding behaviors and attitudes in response to COVID-19. We close with a discussion and an outlook for the next steps in our broader project."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Study design and data collection", "text": "The CHBS is designed to collect information on respondents\u2019 health behaviors and attitudes related to COVID-19. Participation in the survey is anonymous and voluntary. Respondents can stop participating at any time and can skip questions they feel uncomfortable answering.\nThe questionnaire consists of four topical sections: (i) socio-demographic indicators (age, sex, country of birth, country of residence, level of education, household size and composition); (ii) health indicators (underlying medical conditions, flu vaccination status, pregnancy, symptoms experienced in the previous seven days); (iii) opinions and behaviors (perceived threat from COVID-19, level of trust in institutions, level of confidence in sources of information, preventive measures taken, disruptions to daily routine); (iv) social contact data, i.e. the number of interactions that respondents had the day before participating in the survey in different settings (at home, at school, at work, or in other locations). To facilitate validation and warrant comparability with existing surveys, we included standard questions from several sources, such as the European Social Survey (ESS) [17] regarding socio-demographic characteristics, Ipsos [18] regarding opinions on the coronavirus outbreak, and the Polymod project [19] regarding social contacts. Note that we ask respondents about their behavior and attitudes related to the coronavirus outbreak only if they indicated that they were aware of it. In more detail, we asked respondents how much, if at all, they had seen, read or heard about the coronavirus outbreak, with the answer options \u201cA great deal\u201d, \u201cA fair amount\u201d, \u201cNot very much\u201d, \u201cNothing at all\u201d, and \u201cPrefer not to answer\u201d. Respondents who indicated that they knew nothing at all, or that they preferred not to answer, were not asked any further questions related to the outbreak.\nWe created the questionnaire first in English, and then translated it into the different official languages of the countries in our study, with support from professional translators. We considered country-level differences when adjusting the questionnaire for different countries, where applicable (e.g. differences in the educational system). In the online implementation, the questionnaire is available in both English and the national language(s) of the respective country in which respondents are located. The questionnaire was implemented in the online survey tool LimeSurvey (version 3.22.8+20030) and hosted by the Society for Scientific Data Processing (GWDG). The full English questionnaire (as used in the United States) is reported in Appendix A.\nThe link to the questionnaire is distributed through advertisement campaigns that we created via the FAM. Facebook is currently the largest social media platform, with 2.45 billion\nmonthly active users worldwide as of September 2019 [20]. In the United States, about 69% of adults used Facebook in 2019 [21], with similar penetration rates in Europe, ranging from 56% in Germany to 92% in Denmark [22]. The FAM enables advertisers to create advertising campaigns that can be targeted at specific user groups, as defined by their demographic characteristics (e.g. sex and age) and a set of characteristics that Facebook infers from their behavior on the network (e.g. interests). An increasing number of studies explore the use of Facebook in demographic and health research to recruit participants for online surveys [23, 24, 25]. Two main advantages of this approach are rooted in Facebook\u2019s wide reach and the possibility to directly target members of different demographic groups. Two concerns that are often raised are that in online samples self-selection might lead to bias in results, and that online sub-populations may not be representative of the general population. However, there is increasing evidence that samples obtained from Facebook do not significantly differ from samples obtained from more traditional recruitment and sampling techniques in central demographic and psychometric characteristics, especially if post-stratification weights are applied adequately [10, 12, 26, 27].\nWe created one advertising campaign per country and stratified each campaign by sex (male and female), age group (18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ years), and region of residence (largely following the NUTS classification in Europe and the census regions in US; see Table S4 in the Supplementary Material), resulting in 24 to 56 strata per country, further stratified using six different ad images. Figure S1 in Section 1 of the Supplementary Material illustrates the structure of our Facebook advertising campaigns in the United States. Note that we aggregated the different regions of residence into larger macro-regions, to keep the number of strata in Facebook manageable (see Table S4 for the exact mapping). We launched the campaigns on March 13, 2020, in Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We added Germany and France on March 17, Spain on March 19, the Netherlands on April 1, and Belgium on April 4, 2020. In the period 21-26 March, we were unable to recruit a significant number of participants due to technical issues with the FAM which prevented the delivery of our advertisements."}, {"heading": "2.2 Data pre-processing", "text": "We select participants for our analysis in three steps. First, we include only participants who reported that they lived in the country that the respective advertising campaign and countryspecific questionnaire targeted, and who reported their sex, age, and region of residence (the central variables in our post-stratification weighting approach, see details below). Second, when analysing responses to a given question, we exclude respondents who chose the options \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cPrefer not to answer\u201d. In the analysis reported here, this particularly affects the question about awareness of the coronavirus outbreak (see Section 2.1); however, as Table S2 in the Supplementary Material shows, the share of respondents to whom this applies is less than 1% across countries. Third, given that in calendar week 12 we were only able to collect a small number of completed questionnaires in Spain (less than 100), we excluded these data from our analysis as the sample size would render our analysis unreliable for this period. Note that all period references consider local time zones across countries and regions.\nAfter participant selection, we apply post-stratification weights to the final data set in order to correct for potential issues with non-representativeness in our sample. We use a standard procedure in survey research, in which appropriate weights are computed based on population information from more traditional data sources (e.g. census data). Here we use population data from Eurostat (2019) [28] and the US census (2018) [29]. Specifically, for each stratum i (given by each combination of sex, age, and macro-region) in each country, we compute the fraction\npi and p\u0302i of, respectively, the true population counts Ni and the sample counts N\u0302i, compared to the total population \u2211 i Ni and the total sample size \u2211 i N\u0302i. The weights wi are then defined as wi = pi/p\u0302i, thus giving less weight to groups which are over-represented (wi < 1) and more weight to groups which are under-represented (wi > 1) in the sample. We provide more details about our approach to post-stratification in Section 3 of the Supplementary Material."}, {"heading": "2.3 Data Analysis", "text": "In our analysis, we focus on (i) perception of threat from COVID-19, (ii) confidence in the preparedness of different national and international organizations to respond to this threat, and (iii) behavioral measures taken to protect oneself from the virus. All our analyses are based on the weighted sample, whereas the reported sample sizes refer to the unweighted sample.\nWe asked respondents to rate the threat they perceived COVID-19 to pose for different levels of society (i.e. to themselves, their family, their local community, their country, and the world) on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = very low threat, 5 = very high threat), including the options \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cPrefer not to answer\u201d, which are treated as missing values (Table S3 in the Supplementary Material reports the corresponding sample size for each item). For comparison, we asked respondents to answer the same questions also for the seasonal flu. We normalized respondents\u2019 answers to each item to the range 0-1, meaning that values around 0.5 correspond to moderate perceived threat, whereas 0 and 1 correspond to low and high perceived threat, respectively.\nIn a similar way, we asked respondents to rate the confidence they had in the preparedness and ability of different organizations to effectively deal with the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. doctors and healthcare professionals in their community, hospitals in their local area, health care services in their country, the World Health Organization, their local government, and their national government) on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = not confident at all, 4 = very confident), also including the options \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cPrefer not to answer\u201d, which are treated as missing values (see Table S3 in the Supplementary Material). We normalized answers to the range 0-1, and aggregated responses related to the local health system (doctors and healthcare professionals in respondents\u2019 community and hospitals in their local area) by averaging them across items within respondents.\nFinally, we asked respondents which measures, if any, they had taken to protect themselves from the coronavirus. For this, we showed a list of actions, from which they can choose all that apply. This list includes preventive measures (e.g. washing hand more often), measures of social distancing (e.g. avoided social events), measures of reduced mobility (e.g. avoided public transportation), panic buying (e.g. stockpiling of food), and potential discriminatory actions (e.g. avoided eating in Asian restaurants). See the questionnaire in the Appendix A for the full list of actions. In the analysis, we consider the shares of participants who reported having adopted specific behaviors in response to COVID-19, including: (i) the stockpiling of food and/or medicine; (ii) the use of a face mask; (iii) the increased use of hand sanitizer; (iv) the increased washing of hands; (v) social distancing (if participants selected at least one of the following: avoided shaking hands, avoided social activities, and avoided crowded places); and (vi) the reduced use of transportation (if participants selected at least one of the following: avoided travelling by public transportation, and avoided travelling by taxi).\nIn our analyses, we used non-parametric tests for median comparisons (Wilcoxon test to compare two groups and Kruskall\u2013Wallis test to compare three or more groups) and considered p-values of less than 0.05 to be significant. Data analysis was performed with the programming language Python (version 3.7)."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Participant characteristics", "text": "A total of 66,266 participants completed the survey in Belgium (N=5,520), France (N=6,216), Germany (N=11,030), Italy (N=9,310), the Netherlands (N=4,711), Spain (N=7,145), the United Kingdom (N=8,412), and the United States (N=13,922) in the period between March 13, 2020 (calendar week 11) and April 19, 2020 (calendar week 16). As Table 1 shows, participation by week was high in all countries, with a median number of 1,610 participants per week in Belgium, 1,490 in France, 1,646 in Germany, 1,810 in Italy, 1,743 in the Netherlands, 1,842 in Spain, 1,114 in the United Kingdom, and 2,498 in the United States.\nTable 1 also shows the demographic characteristics of the participants in each country, based on the unweighted sample. The sex ratio is somewhat skewed towards females compared to the overall population, ranging from 63% female in Germany to 71% female in France. In terms of age, older respondents tend to be over-represented, with a median age of 48 years (IQR 31-62) in Belgium, 45 years (IQR 29-61) in France, 40 years (IQR 27-56) in Germany, 39 years (IQR 26-56) in Italy, 55 years (IQR 38-64) in the Netherlands, 49 years (IQR 36-60) in Spain, 56 years (IQR 41-65) in the United Kingdom, and 55 years (IQR 37-65) in the United States. When it comes to education, there is some variation across countries. More specifically, in Belgium (46%), France (71%), Spain (59%), the United Kingdom (46%), and the United States (60%) most respondents attained university-level education, whereas in Germany (62%), Italy (50%), and the Netherlands (58%) most respondents attained secondary-level education.\nAfter applying post-stratification weights, the bias described above is reduced and the sample approximates the shares reported in nationally representative surveys in terms of sex, age, and educational attainment, as shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material.

Overall, threat perception of COVID-19 is highest in Italy with a median value of 0.69 (IQR 0.64-0.76), followed by the United Kingdom with 0.68 (IQR 0.62-0.75), Spain with 0.65 (IQR 0.56-0.82), Belgium with 0.63 (IQR 0.56-0.75), France with 0.61 (IQR 0.56-0.77), the United States with 0.60 (IQR 0.52-0.69), the Netherlands with 0.59 (IQR 0.54-0.71), and lastly Germany with 0.53 (IQR 0.48-0.61). In all countries, there is significant variation in threat perceptions across levels of society (p < 0.001). In particular, the perception of threat increases sharply from the personal sphere (oneself and the family) to more distal contexts, i.e. the local community, the country, and, ultimately, the world1. Considering specifically the perceived threat to oneself and to the world, the latter is on average 32% greater, whereas this difference ranges from 24% in Italy to 37% in the United States.\nApart from these variations at the country level, the threat perception posed by COVID19 is both age- and sex-specific. As shown in Figure 1B, the perceived threat to oneself is\n1 All p < 0.01, except for the perceived threat to the family and the local community in Germany (p = 0.3), and to the country and the world in the United States (p = 0.1)\nconsistently lower for the younger age group (i.e. 18-24) with a median value of 0.37 (IQR 0.32-0.41), and higher for the elderly (i.e. 65+) with a median value of 0.58 (IQR 0.54-0.63). Overall, the perceived threat increases with age, with few notable exceptions, including the perceived threat to the family in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States, the perceived threat to the local community in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States, and the perceived threat to the country and to the world in the United States (all p > 0.06). Importantly, as Figure 1C shows, the perceived threat is significantly higher among women than among men2.\nThe development of threat perceptions over time shows different temporal patterns across countries, as can be seen in Figure 1D. In particular, there is significant variation over time in Germany (p < 0.001), and the United States (p < 0.001). In Germany the perceived threat shows a negative trend, with the median value compared to that of week 12 decreasing by about 4% in week 13, 9% in week 14, 15% in week 15, and 18% in week 16. In the United States the trend changes over time, with the median value compared to that of week 11 increasing by about 20% in week 12, 28% in week 13, and 31% in week 14, but then dropping to being only 17% higher in week 15, and 15% higher in week 16. In France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, the temporal pattern is more mixed, with significant variation over time across levels of society (p < 0.02), except for the perceived threat to oneself in France (p = 0.5), Italy (p = 0.6), and\n2 All p < 0.01, except in Spain for the perceived threat to oneself (p = 0.06), to the family (p = 0.2), and to the local community (p = 0.05)\nthe United Kingdom (p = 0.07), to the family in the United Kingdom (p = 0.06), and to the country (p = 0.09) and to the world (p = 0.2) in France. By contrast, there is no significant variation across weeks for all levels of society in Belgium (p = 0.3), the Netherlands (p = 0.07), and Spain (p = 0.1).\nFinally, Figure 2 compares the threat perception for seasonal influenza (panel A) with that for COVID-19 (panel B). The perceived threat posed by COVID-19 is significantly higher than the perceived threat posed by influenza (all p < 0.001). In more detail, the perceived threat to oneself is on average 51% higher (ranging from 41% in Germany to 61% in Belgium), the threat to the family is 46% higher (40% in the Netherlands to 51% in the United States), the threat to the local community is 44% higher (33% in France to 54% in the United Kingdom), the threat to the country is 64% higher (51% in Germany to 71% in Belgium), and the threat to the world is 55% higher (47% in Italy to 62% in Belgium).

In all countries, there is significant variation across organizations (all p < 0.001). First, respondents\u2019 confidence in the national health system tends to be lower than their confidence in the local health system3. Considering the median values, respondents\u2019 confidence in the national health system is about 13% lower than their confidence in the local health system in Belgium, 19% lower in France, 6% lower in Germany, 6% lower in\n3 All p < 0.007, except Italy (p = 0.2) and the United Kingdom (p = 0.9)\nthe Netherlands, 2% lower in Spain, and 14% lower in the United States. Second, respondents\u2019 confidence in local and national governments differs substantially in all countries (p < 0.04). In particular, their confidence in the national government is about 3% lower than their confidence in the local government in Germany, it is 26% lower in France, 12% lower in Spain, and 31% lower in the United States. By contrast, it is about 1% higher in Belgium, 7% higher in Italy, 6% higher in the Netherlands, and 8% higher in the United Kingdom.\nApart from this variation, several other patterns stand out in the level of confidence by age group and sex. As shown in Figure 3B, overall the elderly tend to be more confident in the preparedness of the various organizations, with the exception of the WHO, in which young adults aged between 18 and 24 years show instead greater confidence. Additionally, the level of confidence is sex-specific across organizations, as can be seen in Figure 3C. Male respondents are more confident in the local or national health systems4, whereas female respondents are more confident in the WHO and in the local government5. As for the national government, instead, confidence is higher among female respondents in Germany (p < 0.001), and Spain (p = 0.01), but it is higher among male respondents in the United States (p < 0.001).\nFigure 3D shows the development of the level of confidence over time. Similarly to the perceived threat shown in Figure 1D, the temporal patterns vary across countries. In particular,\n4 All p < 0.02, except for the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom 5 As for the WHO, all p < 0.002, except for Belgium, France, and Italy, while for the local government, all\np < 0.02, except Belgium, Italy, and the United States\nthere is significant variation across weeks in Germany (p < 0.01), Italy (p < 0.03), the United Kingdom (p < 0.01), and the United States (p < 0.01). While in Germany and in the United Kingdom, the trend is positive with the median value in week 16 being about 7% and 21% higher compared to the first week, on the contrary, in Italy this trend is negative with the median value in week 16 being about 12% lower than in week 11. In the United States, instead, the temporal pattern is more variable, with the level of confidence in the health systems increasing, whereas the level of confidence in the different levels of government diverges. It is higher for the local government (about 8% higher in week 16 than in week 11), while for the national government the trend changes over time, with the median value compared to that of week 11 decreasing by about 3% in week 12, 17% in week 13, and 12% in week 14, but then increasing to being only 7% lower in week 15, and 5% lower in week 16.\nOn the other hand, the temporal pattern in France shows significant variation, except for the local health system (p = 0.09), whereas there is no significant variation in the level of confidence over time in Belgium (all p > 0.07), the Netherlands (all p > 0.08), and Spain (all p > 0.5). Moreover, looking at the level of confidence in the WHO separately, this consistently shows a negative trend in France (about 14% lower in week 16 compared to week 13), Germany (about 13% lower in week 16 compared to week 12), Italy (about 12% lower in week 16 compared to week 11), the United Kingdom (about 7% lower in week 16 compared to week 11), and the United States (about 24% lower in week 16 compared to week 11)."}, {"heading": "3.4 Behaviors in response to COVID-19: Women changed their be-", "text": "havior more than men across all dimensions\nFigure 4 shows the self-reported behaviors broken down by country (panel A), age group (panel B), sex (panel C), and week (panel D).

As for hand hygiene, the share of participants who increased the use of hand sanitizer ranges from about 49% (IQR 46-54) in Germany to about 70% (IQR 68-77) in the United States, while the share of participants who increased washing their hands ranges from about 89% (IQR 85-91) in Germany to about 94% (IQR 91- 96) in Spain. Finally, the most frequently reported behaviors are, respectively, increased social distancing, which ranges from about 93% (IQR 90-95) in the United Kingdom to about 98% (IQR 97-99) in Italy, and the reduced use of transportation, which ranges from about 72% (IQR 68-75) in the United States to about 82% (IQR 78-85) in France.\nMoreover, the share of participants adopting specific behaviors related to COVID-19 shows a variable pattern across age groups in all countries, as shown in Figure 4B. In particular, significant variations in the age distribution is observed in respondents who stockpiled food and/or medicine, increased the use of hand sanitizer, and reduced the use of transportation6. However, there is no significant variation in the age distribution in terms of respondents who engaged in social distancing, increased hand washing, and worn a face mask7.\n6 As for the stockpiling of food and/or medicine, all p < 0.02, except France (p = 0.06). As for the increased use of hand sanitizer, all p < 0.05, except France (p = 0.2), and the Netherlands (p = 0.3). As for the reduced use of transportation, all p < 0.01, except Belgium (p = 0.9), and Germany (p = 0.2). 7 As for the social distancing, all p > 0.3, except Spain (p = 0.02), and the United Kingdom (p = 0.003). As for the increased hand washing, all p > 0.1, except France (p = 0.004). As for the use of a face mask, all p > 0.08, apart from few notable exceptions, including France, Germany, and Italy, where older age groups reported more having used a face mask.\nAs shown in Figure 4C, behaviors related to COVID-19 are sex-specific, with female respondents showing the highest adoption rates for specific behaviors8.\nThe development of behaviors over time shows different temporal patterns between countries, as can be seen in Figure 4D. In particular, the use of a face mask substantially increased over time (all p < 0.001, except Belgium, and the Netherlands), as well as hand hygiene in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States (p < 0.04), and the reduced use of transportation in the United Kingdom (p < 0.001), and the United States (p < 0.001). Social distancing has increased sharply in the United Kingdom (p < 0.001), and in the United States (p < 0.001), whereas it has decreased in Germany (p = 0.001), reflecting different stages of the epidemic and different policies.\n8 All p < 0.05, apart from few exceptions, including the stockpiling of food and/or medicine in Spain, and the United Kingdom, the use of a face mask in the United Kingdom, the increased use of hand sanitizer in Spain, and the United Kingdom, the increased hands washing in Spain, and the increased social distancing in Italy (p = 0.3), and Spain (p = 0.4)."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "Understanding how different demographic groups perceive the risk of COVID-19, and thus adopt specific behaviors in response to it, is key to enable public health agencies to develop optimal intervention strategies to contain the spread of the disease. In this paper, we have presented insights from survey data collected through a cross-national online survey, the COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey (CHBS). The survey is ongoing, and here we presented results based on data collected during the period March 13\u2013April 19, 2020 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this closing section, we summarize the main findings and provide our interpretation in light of the current evidence on the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFirst, we found that the perception of the threat that COVID-19 poses was on average highest in Italy, followed by the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany. Conversely, respondents\u2019 confidence in the preparedness of local and national organizations to deal with COVID-19 was on average highest in the Netherlands, followed by Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Belgium, and France. In particular, Italy was the first most affected country in Europe in terms of numbers of cases and deaths, as well as the first country in Europe to implement a nationwide lockdown on March 11, 2020. This may explain the high threat perceived by the population in this country, and, together with the high confidence in the different health systems and different levels of government, the willingness to adopt preventive behaviors and adhere to social distancing measures.\nAfter Italy, nationwide lockdowns were implemented also in Spain (March 14), France (March 17), Belgium (March 18), the Netherlands (March 24), and the United Kingdom (March 24) to slow the progression of the virus and to prevent overloading the healthcare system [30]. In the United States, instead, restrictive measures were implemented at the state level, starting in California on March 19, 2020. Notably, regarding the United Kingdom and the United States, our data collected before and after lockdown measures were implemented (considering the United States as a whole) allow to observe temporal variation in the self-reported behaviors and attitudes: the perceived threat has increased in the population, along with the adoption of social distancing measures. In the case of the United Kingdom, after the lockdown was implemented, the level of confidence in the health systems and different levels of government sharply increased, possibly reflecting discontent in the population about previously announced strategies. By contrast, the results for Germany are more difficult to interpret. In Germany, somewhat less restrictive measures were implemented on March 22, including school closures, cancellations of public gatherings, and the encouragement of social distancing. However, in contrast to the United Kingdom and the United States, for which we observe a change in the temporal trends only after the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we find for Germany that the share of respondents who had adopted social distancing measures was already high before such measures were implemented, and did not change much after this point. Furthermore, compared to other countries, the level of confidence in the health systems and different levels of government in Germany was high from the beginning of our observation period, and has further increased since then, whereas the perceived threat of COVID-19 has decreased over time. This might be interpreted as a case of spontaneous bottom-up behavioral changes emerging from the population, following high trust in decisions and preparedness of the government. Also, of the European countries considered in this study, Germany had the third highest number of cases (about 140,000), but placed only sixth in terms of deaths (about 4,000) as of April 19, 2020 [31], which might explain the lower perceived risk perception in the\npopulation. Second, we observe a clear pattern in threat perceptions regarding different levels of society, sharply increasing from moderate threat for the personal sphere (threat to oneself and the family) to very high threat for more distal contexts (i.e. the local community, the country, and the world). Yet, even though the perception of threat to oneself among our respondents was comparatively low, we found that a high share of them had increased their hand hygiene. This insight renders it uncertain as to what extent behavior can be straightforwardly linked to perceptions of personal threat. Furthermore, we found that the perceived threat posed by COVID-19 is significantly higher than the perceived threat posed by seasonal influenza. One likely explanation for this is that although seasonal influenza causes regular annual epidemics worldwide [32], the novelty and uncertainty that surround COVID-19 leads risk perception to be substantially higher.\nThird, apart from variation at the country level, we also found sex- and age-specific differences. Looking at the age component, our findings suggest that younger people perceive the threat to themselves lower than older people. This is in line with the evidence that older adults are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19 [33]. By contrast, the age structure in the perceived threat to the family is less pronounced, which suggests that respondents were concerned about their family members, regardless of their own age and the perceived threat to themselves.\nFourth, we also found sex-specific patterns in the data. Specifically, female respondents perceived the threat that COVID-19 poses substantially higher, reported a lower level of confidence in the health system, and were more willing to adopt protective behaviors. Since the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is substantially higher for men [34], we might expect that men are more concerned about it. Our results demonstrate that this is not necessarily true, and fact may have to be considered in the design of future communication campaigns.\nWe gained these insights by using a novel approach to collecting health behavior data in times of a pandemic. We employed Facebook advertising campaigns to continuously recruit a large number of participants for our survey over a long period of time. This approach allows us to target specific demographic groups in a comparative, cross-national approach, and to collect balanced samples to which post-stratification methods can be applied.\nThese advantages notwithstanding, our approach also has some limitations. First, online surveys potentially suffer from bias due to self-selection and non-representativeness of the sample. In the case of Facebook, there is increasing evidence that samples obtained from this social media network are not significantly different in central demographic and psychometric characteristics from samples obtained by more traditional recruitment and sampling techniques [12]. Furthermore, by applying post-stratification weighting, which is a standard procedure in survey research, we can correct for non-representativeness in observable characteristics (but not necessarily for self-selection based on unobservable characteristics), at least at the level of the entire sample. Ideally, in our cross-temporal comparisons, we would apply this approach at the level of the week, to warrant complete comparability of observations over time, but issues of data sparsity complicate this approach. We do not expect this to strongly affect our results, but it should be kept in mind that our weekly results might suffer from somewhat larger bias than our aggregate results.\nSecond, our data collection started at different time points across countries, and also pertains to different points in the trajectory of the pandemic across countries. This also encompasses differences in the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions ordered by local and national governments, and needs to be kept in mind when comparing and interpreting our results across countries.\nThird, the data presented here have the form of repeated cross sections, which enables us to assess changes in the population samples over time, but does not allow us to assess changes within individuals.\nWe are planning to address some of the limitations in the future in the following way. First, we aim to expand our post-stratification weighting scheme, by applying multilevel poststratification, which will enable us to achieve greater consistency among differently sized strata and greater precision in the estimates for population subsets, such as the weekly estimates presented here. Second, we aim to carry out a follow-up survey among participants who agreed to provide their email address for this. This panel perspective offers a unique possibility to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the population in the long run and to assess the impact of loosening the lockdown measures on social contact patterns and health behaviors in a cross-national perspective.\nTo conclude, our work reduces the gap in human behavioral data, by providing timely and accurate data on individual behaviors and attitudes across countries. Our work also illustrates how social media networks, like Facebook, together with appropriate survey designs and statistical methods, offer an innovative and powerful tool for rapid and continuous data collection to monitor trends in behaviors relevant for mitigation strategies of COVID-19. Taken together, the insights gained from our survey data are particularly relevant for policy makers and help design appropriate public health strategies and communication campaigns, and to design realistic epidemic models, which can account not only for the spatio-temporal spread of the infection, but also for accurate data on individual human behaviors."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank all the participants who took the time to voluntarily complete our survey, and the staff and colleagues of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research who contributed to the realization of this project, in particular K.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. Methods: This study was a survey conducted in France between 31 March 2020 and 7 April 2020. We recruited patients in 4 groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Index (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients\u2019 characteristics in order to better identify the one who were the most at-risk. Results: The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD=13,71), 7.96% (141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD=8,14).

Introduction", "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic called for unprecedented policies by governments around the world to counter its spread. Most European countries have implemented social distancing and shelter in place measures. These measures are comparable to generalized quarantine and prevent the spread of the virus by restricting the movement and social interactions of people who are potentially exposed (1). As of May, 3rd, 2.5 billion people are in lockdowns (2). In France, these measures have been in force since 17 March 2020. Several studies have reported the negative effects of quarantine on stress or depression (3\u20135).\nPeritraumatic distress (PD) is defined as the emotional and physiological distress experienced during and/or immediately after a traumatic event. It is associated with a higher risk and severity of PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (6,7). The Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) was created to assess the emotional and physiological experience of individuals during a traumatic event (8). Studies have shown that PDI has a good internal consistency, stability, and validity. PDI items can be grouped into factors that better reflect and predict PD and PTSD: negative emotions (items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 10) and perceived life threat and bodily arousal (items 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13) (9). It has also been shown that a PDI score equal or over 14 was predicting full or partial PTSD six-weeks post-injury (10).\nThe main objective of this study was to assess the effect of the Covid-19 crisis on psychological distress in at-risk patients. The secondary objectives were to describe the patients characteristics that can be used to predict the risk of PD and PTSD. In order to do so, we built an e-cohort consisting of users of 4 medical chatbots designed to support patients with (1) asthma, (2) breast cancer, (3) depression and (4) migraine. A chatbot is a software leveraging artificial intelligence to provide a natural language conversation with a user. They can be use to monitor patients during treatment or to collect patientreported outcomes (11). Vik chatbots, developed by Wefight, have shown their interest in patient support and adherence to treatment (12). They are also able to provide medical information to breast cancer patients with a level of quality comparable to physicians, as shown in the phase 3 randomized controlled trial INCASE (NCT03556813) (13). The \u201cVik Asthm\u201d chatbot is dedicated to information and management of asthma-related symptoms, the \u201cVik Breast\u201d chatbot is specialized in the management\nof breast cancer patients, the \u201cVik Depression\u201d chatbot accompanies patients with symptoms of depression and the \u201cVik Migraine\u201d chatbot is helping patients with chronic migraine.\nPeople with asthma are populations at increased risk of severe viral respiratory infections that can also induce exacerbations. The SARS-CoV2 can induce asthma exacerbations which are a source of additional stress for asthma patients. Initial data shows that asthma patients do not appear to be overrepresented in patients with Covid-19 (14,15). In order to mitigate the lack of pathology control and treatment adherence during travel restrictions, the French government has implemented solutions to facilitate the renewal of treatment in the long term (16). In addition, 60,000 hospitalizations are attributable to asthma every year in France (17). This pandemic also represents a significant concern to cancer patients, who are at high risk of complications due to several predisposing factors (18\u201320). In patients with breast cancer, management must be tailored and cannot be delayed. European countries have increased the use of telehealth systems to reduce the number of hospital visits. In Italy, these changes in care lead to many questions for patients, which can generate severe stress or anxiety (21). The first studies conducted in China following the coronavirus pandemic have shown the impact on the mental health of healthcare workers, with an increased risk of depression and anxiety (22). Patients already diagnosed with depressive disorder could be at a high risk of distress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, migraine is a pathology with a high prevalence: it is estimated to be between 17% and 21% in adults aged 18 to 65 (23) with a sex ratio of 3 women to 1 man (24). Despite its high prevalence, migraine remains an under-diagnosed and under-treated condition in the general population. Migraine can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life (25). Migraines can worsen in times of stress. This period of pandemic can generate a new source of stress and aggravate the pathology."}, {"heading": "2.

Discussion", "text": "The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since brought unprecedented efforts from governments all over the world to limit its spread. These steps have included social distancing and global shutdowns. Their precise consequences on mental health are still unknown. It is currently considered that the risk for mental health is outweighed by the need to prevent infections.\nThe available literature on the mental health consequences of pandemics are more focused on the sequelae of the infection, however other catastrophic events, such as the World Trade Center terrorist attacks, are followed by increase in depression and PTSD cases, substance abuse, domestic violence and child abuse (28). In that regard, the 2006 SARS epidemic also induced an increase in PD and PTSD in patients and clinicians (29). COVID-19 could also have the same effect, specifically because of the strong mitigation strategies that have been enforced all over the world, on a scale never seen before, but also because of the major economic disruptions it has induced (30).\nThe aim of our study was to quantify Psychological Distress and the risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder on a national scale in a country that has been hard-hit by COVID-19, France. Using a chatbot-administered standardized and validated tool specifically designed to rate PD, the Psychological Distress Index (8). We showed that, in 4 groups of patients at-risk to develop PD and PTSD, the prevalence of psychological distress was high (38.06%, n=674). These patients are also at high risk to develop partial of full PTSD six-week after the evaluation, as shown by Bunnel et al. (9). Within those 4 groups of patients, women, unemployed (p=7.16x10-6) and depressed (p=7.49x10-7) patients had significantly higher PDI score. Interestingly, patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588). This could also highlight the potential negative psychological impact of information and/or social networks in the context of such an event.\nOur study is the first to assess PD in patients during a pandemic on a national scale. There are limitations that should be considered when interpreting our results: first, a majority of participants were women (91.25%). This is due in part to the fact that one of the 4 groups explored consisted in breast cancer patients, but it could also show that men are less likely to participate in this kind of online self-reported\nsurvey. This fact could potentially bias the results and specifically the value of the features we found to be associated with a PDI over 14 (predictive of PTSD). Another limitation is due to the sampling technique itself, relying on groups of patients already using the chatbots, excluding patients not using them. This study still holds interesting results because of the large cohort of respondents, the adequate geographical spread across France and the sampling time frame that corresponds to the pandemic peak in France.\nOther studies have been conducted to measure the impact of COVID-19 among the general population. In Italy, Rossi et al conducted a web-based survey on 18,147. They found high rates of negative mental health outcomes three weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown: 37% of the participants declared they had symptoms of PTSD, 17.3% of depression and 20.8% of anxiety. Like in our study, the majority of respondents were women (79.6%).\nOverall, policy makers are rightfully concerned by the potential negative effects on public health of COVID-19, beyond the pandemics itself. In the UK, psychological first aid guidance has been issued by Mental Health UK (31). In France, several psychological support hotlines have been created for healthcare professionals (32) and the general public (33). The precise mental health sequelae of the pandemic are still unknown but should not be neglected. In the coming weeks, months and years, we need to thoroughly investigate these consequences to be able to correctly address them. Specific efforts should be made to lower the risk of PD, depression, suicide, substance abuse and domestic violence, otherwise the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could be even more dire, should they remain unexplored, unaddressed, and ultimately forgotten."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "COVID-19 has a significant impact on psychological distress in patients with breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine: 38% of participants have a PDI equal or over 15.

In early March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and since then, it caused 209 deaths out of 31,938 patients who got infected with this disease [2, 3].\nThe causative agent for COVID-19 has been identified as a new RNA virus from the beta-coronavirus family; the transmission rate of it is considered high because it transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized Covid-19 as a pandemic infection since the respiratory illness caused by the COVID-19 is highly contagious [4] because of the novelty of the virus, fast spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies [5].\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken the deadly coronavirus outbreak gravely even before the ministry of health announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case, for example, it announced the temporary suspension of entry to Makkah and Madinah in February 2020 [6].\nAfter the first confirmed case, the Saudi Arabian government announced series of extreme measures to control the spread of the virus beginning by panned all transport in and out of the Qatif Governorate on March 8, and most recently on April 6, to announcing a 24-hour curfew implemented in the major cities with movement restricted to only essential travel between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. on April 6 [7]. The extremely proactive measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus could contribute to provoking public fear, anxiety and/or depression, which is usually neglected during crisis and pandemic management [8-12].\nCOVID-19 has a severe impact on the physical and mental health of the public during the COVID- 19 outbreak; therefore, we aimed to assess the mental health burden of citizens and residents inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic and to identify potential population(s) who might need psychological intervention."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Study design and study population\nA cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between March 27th and April 27th, 2020, to explore depression and anxiety among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"heading": "Sampling strategy", "text": "A convenience sample of eligible participants was invited to participate in the study.

Participants were excluded if they were: a) below 18 years of\nage; b) unable to understand the Arabic language; and c) unable to participate due to physical or emotional distress.\nDepression and anxiety assessment scales\nPreviously validated assessment scales, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. These screening instruments were frequently used and validated as brief screening tools among various populations for depression and anxiety [13-17]. Also, the following information was collected: participants\u2019 demographics (age, gender, income, education level, employment status, and marital status). Furthermore, participants were asked whether they were worried about being infected with COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members (yes/no question) and whether they had underlying chronic conditions (yes/no question). The PHQ-9 scale is a 9-questions instrument given to participants to screen for the presence and severity of depression [18, 19]. The GAD-7 instrument was used to screen for anxiety [20]. The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 instruments asked the participants about the degree of applicability of each item (question), using a 4-point Likert scale. Participants\u2019 responses ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 means \u201cNot at all\u201d and 3 means \u201cNearly every day\u201d. The PHQ-9 instrument includes 9 items. Items are scored from 0 to 3 generating a total score ranging from 0 to 27.

More than half of them were employed (n= 1,272, 61.1%). Around 12,3% (n= 255) of the participants reported that they have a history of chronic disease. The majority (n= 1,587, 76.3%) of the participants reported that they were concerned about contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members. When participants were asked if they have identified any problems over the past two weeks, to what extent have these problems prevented them from doing their work, looking after their household affairs or dealing with people, around half of them (n= 1,053, 50.6%) reported that they faced difficulties.\nPrevalence of mental health problems\nThe prevalence of depression among the participants was 9.4% (n= 196). The proportions of minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression were 29.6%, 40.9%, 20.0%, 6.2%, and 3.2%, respectively.

Saudi Arabia has exceptional circumstances as it is a hub for millions of foreign workers and pilgrims from across the globe. In response to the pandemic and to combat the spread of the disease, the government took swift decisions and closed the two holy mosques, suspended travels to the country and closed most businesses and limited individuals\u2019 movement. Further, the government is also creating a national narrative to encourage citizens\u2019 adherence to emergency measures to respond to the pandemic [5]. Therefore, this research aimed at assessing the anxiety and depression among people living in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOverall, the findings in this study demonstrated that more than 29.4% of respondents had moderate-to-severe depression, whereas, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe anxiety exceeded 26%. During stressful conditions such as the case with COVID-19 pandemic, fear and anxiety about the disease can be overwhelming that may cause depression and anxiety among adults and even children [25]. The sudden shutdown of services and lockdown of people are predisposing to such conditions particularly when dealing with the unpredictable status of the outbreak. The fear of getting the disease and losing loved ones [26] is another predisposing factor that may result in such a condition. The prevalence rate of moderate-to- severe depression symptoms in this study seems to be considerably higher than that of those reported by the Chinese study that included 1210 respondents during the COVID-19 outbreak (16.5%) whereas comparable rates for anxiety were noted (28.8%) [3]. Also, it was observed that results vary according to the sample size and the used assessment tool. Where in another nationwide study among Chinese people during the pandemic including 52,730 participants revealed a psychological distress prevalence rate of 35% among all respondents. Distress symptoms according to the employed assessment tool included depression and anxiety [27].\nThe study also revealed that non-Saudi residents had significantly higher prevalence rates of depression and anxiety symptoms (p< 0.001) than Saudi individuals. Such results aligned with the percentage of infected cases among the two groups, where, the data showed a pattern in terms of who is more likely to become infected with the new coronavirus. Recent reports showed that among confirmed cases, Saudis account for 19% of total cases while other nationalities account for 81%. These results could be attributed to the status of most non-Saudis in terms of occupation, and residence status. A substantial number of foreign workers are in the labour force who live in heavily crowded areas that in most of it lack the needed social distancing requirements [28]. Previous studies reported that foreign workers experienced the highest level of distress among all occupations. Reasons such as worrying about exposure to coronavirus in public transportation when commuting to and from work, delays in work time, job security, and consequent deprivation of their salary may explain the high-stress level [27]. Such results mandate the government to take and re-enforce specific measures to control the increase of infected cases.\nDepression and anxiety symptoms were more likely to occur in men than in women. Such results are in agreement with other studies that investigated depression and anxiety among the Saudi Arabian population. The results of a study conducted by Al-Khathami and co-workers (2002) reported that the prevalence of minor mental illness was significantly higher in women (22.2%) than men (13.7%) (p =0.0073) (29). Further, the prevalence rate was high in the younger age group which, is in agreement with our study as a higher score of depression was associated with individuals younger than 29 years. Further, the study of Wang et al (2020) revealed that the female gender was significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the COVID19 outbreak and had higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05) (3). Several factors can contribute to women\u2019s higher depression and anxiety prevalence rates including biological sex differences, culture, diet, female hormonal fluctuations, and education [30].\nSociodemographic variables association with depression and anxiety were assessed using logistic regression analysis which showed that individuals above the age of 50 years suffer from higher depressive symptoms also, those who are single or with lower education level. Similar findings were reported by Wang et al (2020) that suggested the association of lower education with a greater likelihood of depression during the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, our findings provided data that suggested public\u2019s levels of anxiety and depression-related symptoms increase among students and unemployment or those with low income. The results were in agreement with previous research that students were more likely to have depression and anxiety during the pandemic [3]. The onset of the pandemic was in the middle of the academic year, which contributed to students' fear of losing the year or occurrence of delays in their studies, besides the lack of confidence in remote learning. The closure and social distancing are anticipated to sustain for longer periods, and this apparently will have a direct effect on low income and unemployed individuals [31], and, therefore. this might put such categories under a higher level of stress that could lead to anxiety and /or depression symptoms.\nThe results of this research emphasized the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of individuals, expressed in depression and anxiety. The findings of this study, in many aspects, were in agreement with those reported during the pandemic in other countries. Therefore, a worldwide collaborative effort is required to develop measures that can address mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and manage it."}, {"heading": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "This study demonstrated several strengths.

Third, it involved a good sample size that was not limited to specific geographical areas in Saudi Arabia. However, this study has several limitations.

INTRODUCTION In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown etiology began to arise in the city of Wuhan, China and the diagnosis of influenza and other Coronaviruses (such as MERS and SARS) were considered but later excluded by laboratory tests1,2 . On 7 th of January, 2020, China announced that the cause of that epidemic was a new Coronavirus strain, later designated SARS-CoV-2 and proven to be present in wild bats2,3,4 . The transmission mode of SARS-nCoV-2 is through respiratory droplets, and they are either a source of direct or indirect contamination 5,6 . This strain presented a basic reproduction number (R0) within a range from 1.4 to 6.5: the highest infection rates in the elderly or in people with underlying pathologies2,7 . Therefore, this means that this strain of virus has a high rate of human-to-human transmission and a person is much more contagious as more symptomatic6,8 . The median age of the symptomatic patients seems to be between 47-59 years even though it can affect individuals of all ages2 . The clinical presentation of COVID-19 has a wide spectrum that ranges from assymptomatic or slightly upper respiratory infection to septic shock6,9,10 . The cardinal symptoms described by the World Health Organization and later integrated in the flowcharts issued by the Dire\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade (DGS) are \u201ccough\u201d, \u201cfever\u201d and \u201cdyspnea\u201d. However, other studies report myalgia, fatigue, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms as other symptoms to be taken into account11,12,14. In a study involving 1099 laboratory confirmed cases, Zhong et al described that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%) and fatigue (38.1%), with sputum, dyspnea, sore throat and headache also being highly reported by the patients13 . This study also mentions that there was a minor percentage of patients who showed gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. Despite the broad spectrum of the disease, Huang et al described that the elderly or those with underlying pathologies such as hypertension, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and cardiovascular diseases had a faster progression of the disease, with a higher rate of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, consequent multiorgan failure and higher rate of death 2,10 . These pathologies, considered as risk factors for COVID-19, were later included in the \u201cNorma de Orienta\u00e7\u00e3o Cl\u00ednica 004/2020\u201d of DGS, as patients with a particular risk of infection and with higher care needs. At the moment, there is no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2, with the treatment being mainly symptomatic and organ support6,10 . Therefore, in the absence of effective specific treatment, there is a range of preventive measures to be taken, such as a correct handwashing, respiratory etiquette, disinfection of surfaces and social isolation and/or social distancing (> 2 meters)2,3,6,14 . These measures are assumed as vital in the control of the mitigation of the pandemic3,14 . To raise public awareness of these measures and health promotion, community empowerment is necessary and the main key for this public health problem. This empowerment through health literacy programs and official campaigns using television, radio and other media has a positive impact, especially in this actual context - outbreaks and/or pandemics15-17. On the 18 th of March, 2020, the State of Emergency was decreed in Portugal, with a Law Decree regulating preventive measures to contain the pandemic mitigation in Portugal. On the 26 th of March, 2020, phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19\u2019s pandemic in Portugal was declared, e.g., chains of community transmission of the virus in the national territory. Thereupon, it arose the need for tighter control and application of preventive measures. Regarding the positive impact of official campaigns and community empowerment with a strong health literacy, we considered it extremely important to study the health literacy of the population in this mitigation phase, in order to understand the flaws that may still exist as well as identifying possible predictors of health literacy concerning this matter. Thus, and since as far as we\u2019re concerned this is the first study focusing on this subject, it will be possible to rectify possible wrong ideas through specific\nintervention strategies aimed at different populations. Also, we hope that this study helps to identify possible errors/flaws of health literacy in a pandemic situation and to avoid them at the early beginning of a possible future pandemic.\n2.

Sample characterization\nThis study comprises a cohort of 222 subjects, with an age range 15-94 years old and a median age of 62 years old. The majority registered an undergraduate level of education and had at least one risk factor for COVID-19 codified by ICP-2 (Table 1).\n3. 2. COVID-19\u2019s Questionnaire\nGlobally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group presented higher relative frequencies of the correct answer along COVID-19\u2019s Questionnaire. However, three exceptions were observed: the Undergraduate Group and the Risk-Group had a high relative frequency stating that COVID-19 has a cure and in mentioning \u201cSocial Isolation\u201d as an important preventive measure to adopt when compared to the Graduate Group and the Non-Risk Group, respectively. Males have higher relative frequency in answering the correct number of SNS24 and in stating that children can get sick and transmit the infection by SARS-CoV-2 when compared to females (Table 2 - Supplementary information).\nThe use of Non-parametric tests (Kruskal Wallis H and Fisher\u2019s Exact Test) demonstrated several statistically significant associations between our variables and the answers given along COVID-19\u2019s Questionnaire (Table 3).\nQuestion 2: Answer \u201cCough\u201d -0.1 0.06 0.22 0.65 <0.01*\nQuestion 2: Answer \u201cDyspnea\u201d 0.03 0.52 1.00 0.14 0.37\nQuestion 3: Answer \u201cCure\u201d - 0.53 0.78 0.02* 0.01*\nQuestion 4: Answer \u201cOther\u201d -0.14 0.20 0.59 1.00 0.01*\nQuestion 4: Answer \u201cRespiratory Etiquette\u201d -0.02 0.84 0.15 1.00 0.46\nQuestion 4: Answer \u201cHandwashing\u201d -0.10 0.85 0.27 0.16 0.12\nQuestion 4: Answer \u201cSocial isolation\u201d 0.04 0.61 0.41 <0.01* <0.01*\nQuestion 5: Answer \u201cStay home and call SNS 24\u201d -0.26 0.02* 0.04* 1.00 0.03*\nQuestion 6: Answer \u201c808242424\u201d -0.18 0.54 0.04* 0.49 0.03*\nQuestion 7: Answer \u201cNo\u201d - 0.84 0.13 1.00 0.09\nQuestion 8: Answer \u201cNo\u201d - 0.70 0.04* 0.81 0.34\nQuestion 9: Answer \u201cNo\u201d - 0.25 0.01* 0.09 <0.01*\nQuestion 1: Answer \u201cNo\u201d - 0.48 0.74 0.40 <0.01*\nQuestion 11:Answer \u201cYes\u201d - 0.88 0.35 0.19 0.22\nQuestion 12: Answer \u201cYes\u201d - 0.92 0.32 0.16 0.53\n*p-value set at 0.05.

QUESTIONS REGARDING THE COURSE OF COVID-19", "text": "When questioned about the symptomatology of COVID-19, 96.85% of individuals stated that they know the symptoms of COVID-19. Indeed , analysing only the 215 individuals who answered \u201cYes\u201d in the first\nquestion, we observe that most of the individuals stated the cardinal symptoms of COVID-19 described in several \u201cNormas de Orienta\u00e7\u00e3o Cl\u00ednica\u201d from DGS (e.g. \u201cFever\u201d, \u201cCough\u201d and \u201cDyspnea\u201d) in relative frequencies >70.00% and that 36.28% stated \u201cOther\u201d symptoms such as \u201cmyalgia\u201d, \u201cheadache\u201d and \u201closs of smell and taste\u201d. Nonparametric tests denote statistically significant associations: \u201cOther\u201d reveal a significant association with \u201cEducation\u201d, with individuals of Graduate Group stating more often other symptoms of the disease; \u201cCough\u201d reveal a significant association with \u201cRisk Factor\u201d, with individuals from Non-Risk Group stating more often this symptom.\nWhen questioned whether COVID-19 only affects old people or not, 90.99% of individuals answered the correct answer. Nonparametric tests reveal a statistically significant association regarding variable \u201cGender\u201d, with females answering more often the correct answer.\nRegarding the two questions about children, there\u2019s a good level of health literacy among our cohort. When questioned if children can get sick, there\u2019s a major dominance of the answer \u201cYes\u201d (88.74%). Nonparametric tests reveal a statistically significant association regarding variable \u201cRisk Factor\u201d, with individuals from \u201cNon-Risk Group\u201d stating more often the correct answer.\nWhen we questioned about the possibility of children transmitting the disease, 83.78% of individuals answered \u201cYes\u201d. No statistically significant associations were observed.\nRegarding the question about the cure of COVID-19, we found a great dispersion of the answers: 41.44% of the subjects refer that COVID-19 has a cure, 33.33% deny it and 25.23% refer that they don\u2019t know whereas this disease has a cure or not.

SOURCE OF INFORMATION", "text": "Regarding the final question, and even though we have a slight dispersion of frequencies of answers, it is obvious that the major source of information about COVID-19 is the television, with 74.77% of individuals reporting that fact. After television, the social networks (10.36%) and other (4.50%) - such as official websites (WHO, DGS and CDC), employers, Town Hall and Guarda Nacional Republicana - have an important role in informing the population about the actual public health problem (Fig. 1).\n4. DISCUSSION According to Portugal's censuses, the population of our cohort comprises 23850 citizens, with a proportion >1 female per male and as well as an undergraduate and older population 18,19 . The characterization of our cohort is compatible with these data.\nGlobally, our results demonstrate a relatively well informed population. Furthermore, females, younger individuals, the \u201cGraduate\u201d and the Non-Risk Groups presented higher relative frequencies of the correct answer throughout our questionnaire. There are some exceptions to this pattern, which we are going to discuss later on this section.\nIn the literature, several studies support our results, reporting age, gender and education as predictors of health literacy. Indeed, S\u00f8rensen et al in their comparative study of the results of European Health Literacy survey (HLS-EU) reported education, age and gender as predictors of low health literacy, along with social status and financial privation. According to their findings, males and older individuals tend to have slightly lower health literacy, while a higher level of education is a strong positive predictor of health literacy20 . Besides, regarding health literacy, several other studies state these gender, age and education significant differences, reporting that an increase in age, being male and lower levels of education usually implies a decrease in health literacy,21- 27 .\nRegarding the presence/absence of risk factors for COVID-19 as far as we\u2019re concerned, there\u2019s no literature available to support the results found in our study. However, we do know that the median age of the Risk Group is higher than the median age of the Non-Risk Group and these differences stated in non-parametric tests along this study may be a consequence of an age bias.\nConcerning the symptomatology, most of the population knows the cardinal symptoms of COVID-19 related by DGS (high relative frequencies >70.00%). Curiously, even though not being reported by DGS, there\u2019s a significant percentage of subjects relating. \u201cOther\u201d symptoms such as \u201cmyalgia\u201d, \u201cheadache\u201d and \u201closs of taste and smell\u201d, described in several articles10,12,13,14,28. This fact may suggest that people do not obtain their information by a single source of information and that they try to search for relevant information.\nThe third question was thus constructed to capture the discord underlying the definition of \u201ccure\u201d. According to Portuguese lexicon, \u201ccure\u201d is defined as \u201cact or effect of self-healing or healing somebody\u201d or \u201chealth recovery\u201d and \u201chealing\u201d being described as \u201crestore health\u201d. However, the answers given along the phone calls highlighted the uncertainty in this definition, emphasizing the insecurity in answering this question. Indeed, throughout this study, most of the people who answered \u201cNo\u201d, justified using sentences such as \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s not a medication targeting the virus\u201d. These findings underline some incongruences and misconceptions. A vaccine is a tertiary preventive measure administered in an individual to confer immunity to a certain infectious disease, which enables an asymptomatic/mild clinical manifestation of it, useful in controlling epidemics29-31. Therefore, it is necessary to demystify the idea that a vaccine is a cure for an infectious disease. Even though there\u2019s not a specific antiretroviral targeting SARS-CoV-2 efficiently approved, there are several reported cases of healed patients, matching with the Portuguese definition of \u201ccure\u201d6,10,28,32. Interestingly, the Undergraduate Group presents a higher relative frequency of the answer \u201cYes\u201d, yet, it wasn\u2019t possible to find any information in literature supporting this finding.\nRegarding the preventive measures to adopt face to COVID-19, overall, the subjects in our study were able to mention them, with the exception of Respiratory Etiquette. In the literature there are several studies that report the importance of handwashing, respiratory etiquette and social isolation in containing epidemics and in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission 28,33 . Indeed, even though Chao Yang reports that there\u2019s no proven efficacy of handwashing in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission 34 , there are several findings that report the opposite. Qing-Xia et al, in a study involving 7 countries, alert to the fact that handwashing significantly slows the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 35 and several other studies showed that a correct handwashing is useful in controlling epidemics as well as SARS transmission 21,35,36. Even though handwashing is an important preventive measure to adopt face to COVID-19, unfortunately, there are findings that show that the correct procedure - as recommended by WHO - isn\u2019t always applied and that some mistakes are observed, as such low frequency in washing hands and not washing hands the enough time 37,38 . Also, Zhang et al conducted a study in Beijing\u2019s population as a post-pandemic assessment and verified that even though people knew the importance of handwashing, they did not apply it14 . In their study, Fung et al also observed a decline of practice of this preventive measure 14 . Therefore, in order to avoid this decline and errors, we must implement methods to successfully achieve a correct preventive handwashing 39 .\nAs well as for other respiratory viruses, respiratory etiquette has a preponderant role in controlling the transmission of an infectious respiratory disease 40-42. Looking at the numbers in our study, the absolute and relative frequencies of subjects who mentioned it as a necessary preventive measure was disappointingly low. Thus, this must be a point to improve in health literacy.\nConcerning \u201cSocial Isolation\u201d, being SARS-CoV-2 an extremely high contagious virus, an effective and important preventive measure to adopt and to contain the pandemic is social isolation 6, 43 . Interestingly and contrary to the other questions, in this question the Risk Group has a higher relative frequency of the preventive measure \u201cSocial Isolation'' than the Non-Risk Group. This fact may be explained by the fact that Non-Risk Group is a younger group. Thus, younger people belong to the proletariat more than older people, having the necessity to leave home for work, which can be a justification to this finding. Regarding the answers obtained in question 7, there are still cases of people who believe it is possible to receive or visit family and/or friends at home. Since this idea may promote the creation of new transmission chains, it is necessary to demystify it, across every single outlier.\nRegarding the right procedure in case of having symptoms, most of the subjects stated that they must stay at home and call SNS 24, as recommended by DGS. Concerning the number of SNS 24, interestingly, males report higher relative frequency of the right answer. This may be explained by the fact that in our population, males have higher rates of education with more educational opportunities19 . Recalling that the Graduate Group has a higher relative frequency of correct answers, this difference between females and males may be explained by this bias. Also, along the phone calls, individuals that belong to the Risk Group - overall, older individuals - referred that they didn\u2019t know the number by heart because their caregivers knew or they had it pointed on a paper. Besides suggesting the lower capacity of older people to memorize numbers, this draws our attention for the important role that caregivers may have in transmitting the proper information to older people.\nRegarding the questions about the epidemiology of COVID-19, there\u2019s a major consensus that this disease affects the elderly and that children either transmit and can get sick. Indeed, concerning all the information already mentioned, the literature states that SARS-CoV-2 may infect individuals of all age ranges, with a more severe clinical manifestation in the elderly and/or people with underlying pathologies6, 10, 44 . Also, concerning the clinical manifestation and transmission in children, throughout this study, some people reported that \u201cchildren can transmit the virus, that\u2019s why grandchildren and grandparents cannot be together\u201d. Indeed, children can get sick and are an important vector of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 6,10 . This fact is especially because if infected they are mainly asymptomatic and have more difficulties in applying the correct procedures of the hygiene measures correctly45, . Interestingly, males reported higher relative frequencies than females in stating that children can get sick and transmit SARS-CoV-2. However, there\u2019s no literature supporting this finding.\nRegarding the use of gloves and/or masks, it is visible a certain hesitation and some myths associated with them, which may be explained by the quantity of contradictory information transmitted concerning these equipment46 . The use of gloves is recommended during procedures associated with aerosol production, in a clinical context46 . Regarding the global use of gloves, its general use is not recommended by WHO, CDC and DGS and may even constitute a false security if people don\u2019t discard them regarding the proper procedure 47 . The use of masks has been under constant study since the beginning of this pandemic, in order to understand whether it prevents the infection by SARS-CoV-2 or not and the literature regarding this matter is very controversial. However, in a recent study, Greenhalgh et al advocate the general use of the mask, regardless of their material, even stating that a simple cotton mask will reduce the amount of transmitted virus by 36 times48 . Indeed, masks are gaining a major role as a community preventive measure and not as an individual preventive measure 35,44,48,49,50. Concluding, even though we observe a relatively well informed population, this is a pandemic of a virus with an elevated Transmission Rate. Thus, biological characteristics as well as individual and communitary behaviours have an impact in its course 10,14,20 and even a single error/mistake may have a\nnegative impact, creating new transmission chains that could have been prevented 32,33,43,44,62. Following this thought, we are looking for the outliers of wrong answers/unfamiliarity of a concept and in order to promote a fruitful health literacy, towards an informed population and avoid an overwhelming unjustified panic, which may lead to more mistakes51,52,53.\nTo pursue this objective, we must take in account the major sources of information and adapt our communication, creating programs/methods in order to reach each specific population 54 . This adjustment to different realities has a positive impact on the population and their behaviour, by promoting community empowerment55 .\nOn a final note, we safeguard that a correct health literacy does not always mean a correct behaviour and that some mistakes can still prevail 53,54 .\n5. CONCLUSION Health literacy is nowadays a critical issue and has an impact in controlling epidemics and pandemics56,57,58.\nIn Portugal we are now in phase 3.2 of mitigation of COVID-19\u2019s pandemic and, even though we have a relatively well informed population, there seems to be some misconceptions of the guidelines57 . As the actual public health situation is a pandemic by a highly infectious virus, every single deviant compliance matters and must be prevented. Thus, our goals were to characterize the population regarding their COVID-19\u2019s health literacy, in order to help create specific intervention strategies aimed at populations with different levels of health literacy.\nAlthough our cohort has a small dimension, it highlights some aspects that can bridge gaps that still remain. We believe it also provides support for future studies and alerts to the necessity of new approaches of communication in order to control not only this pandemic but also possible future pandemics with human-to-human transmission.\nThe main limitation of this work was the size of the database. Also, besides comparison between groups, other tests or applying metrics could have been used, e.g., correlation coefficients such as Spearman\u2019s rank and Pearson\u2019s. Also, a multinomial regression could have been carried out in order to predict the health literacy for an individual. Likewise, a new index variable representing health literacy could have been created, in order to state the level of health literacy of an individual. In further studies, this new variable can be created based on WHO and DGS information, enabling a comparative study of various coefficients, considering criteria and quality adjustment metrics.\n6.

The health anxiety is commonly dealt through behaviors that work in reducing the distress for a short time (Abramowitz & Moore 2007), like frequent visit to clinics or hospitals, undue researching of symptoms through online sites, or continuously asking for reassurance from loved ones. However, in the long term these behaviors are known to further enhance or maintain the anxiety (Helbig-Lang and Petermann 2010). Illness anxiety disorder is although known to be a diagnostic unit itself, health anxiety may still be seen in other psychological illnesses like somatic symptom disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders (APA, 2013). Further it was stated that health anxiety with clinical severity\nis an established phenomenon that cases of health anxiety are high during the time when a disease gets mass media coverage, for example when Ebola outbreak was observed in late 2014.\nWorld Health Organization declared coronavirus as a Pandemic in 2019. The confirmed cases reported across the globe have reached 200,000 patients with 8000 confirmed death cases across 160 countries (World Health Organization Coronavirus disease outbreak webpage). Initially the disease was originated and reported from Wuhan, China, after that in Europe, Italy was hit and the immensely affected the country (Pellino & Spinelli, 2020). The spread of virus is dangerously rapid such that after two weeks of first case, 1000 patients were diagnosed. Another week passed by and the number of patients reached 46000 and until March, 2020, the number of patients was 30,000 and death count was 2500 (World Health Organization Coronavirus disease outbreak webpage and Italian National Civil Protection Department, 2020). Lombardy is so far known to be the most affected region in the world, which forced the local institutes to reset the complete health care system and nationwide lockdown in Italy (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana GU Serie Generale, 2020). Afterwards, Spain declared the state of emergency on 14th March 2020 and announced special health care measures to be taken by the public (Cu\u00e8 CE. Cabinet considering banning all journeys in Spain apart from travel to work or to buy food El Pais 14/03/2020).\nCOVID-19 is known to have spread from China to 26 more countries through the globe. World Health Organization states that COVID-19 does not appear to be as deadly as other coronaviruses like MERS and SARS. However, covid-19 has caused more demises (1871) than SARS and MERS (1632) both despite the notion of being less deadly (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). Mowbray and Beijing (2019), states that coronavirus is more\ncertainly reaching a record level in human history. For the moment death count is being closely monitored and stories of self or forced quarantine are being shared everywhere. Consequently, the risk of health appears to be rather scary and uncontrollable and eventually fuels the epidemic of fear. Gigerenzer (2015), unbalanced and unfiltered information often blurs the sound decision about health.\nResearch has significant empirical support that among the medically sound people, mass hysteria and health anxiety is led by publicizing of disease outbreak (Taylor and Asmundson 2004). Anecdotally, in the clinics and hospitals of Pakistan, it has been seen that number of patients with presentations of OCD or IAD stated concerns for having COVID-19 (Mukhtar, & Mukhtar, 2020). It is vital to understand the psychological factors accompanied by health anxiety as a response to threat of a disease because it can facilitate the treatment plans and preventative strategies for health anxiety (Bish and Michie 2010). Heightened anxiety level can also accompany safety behaviors (like avoidance, overutilization of health resources or excessive washing) that are done to lessen the possibility of illness. Consequently, functional impairment and distress accompanies these safety behaviors and disturbs the natural homeostasis (Olatunji et al. 2011).\nAccordingly, present research was designed during the time when concern of government is high about the psychological factors like fear and safety behaviors accompanied by COVID-19 epidemic because these factors eventually disturb the balance of health resources. The limited body of research is found on the topic of anxiety among students and youngsters as a response to pandemic illnesses like Ebola (Blakey, Reuman, Jacoby, & Abramowitz, 2016), avian flu (Lau et\nresearch we predict a number of constructs that are likely to determine the fear of COVID-19.\nOne of the probable predictors could be general stress like anxiousness or depressive symptoms. According to previously established notions, general stress along with anxiousness and depressive symptoms are strong predictors of physical health deterioration (Scott et al. 2007; Niles et al. 2014) and negative interpretative biases (like catastrophizing) that further enhance anxiety about health and other illnesses (Reif et al. 1998). Second predictor is proposed as dysfunctional beliefs particularly those related to contamination because COVID-19 is known to be transmitted through the bodily fluids. Moreover, the fear of COVID-19 could be the overestimation of severity of contamination during this global outbreak. Third predictor is proposed as propensity to experience disgust against fear of COVID-19 (Cisler et al. 2010; Olatunji and Sawchuk 2005). Heightened response to disgust is potentially important as a predictor of not just contamination aversion but specifically for fear of COVID-19.\nBody vigilance is another predictor against fear of COVID-19, it is defined as tendency to carefully monitoring bodily sensations (Schmidt et al. 1997). Olatunji et al. (2007) suggest that chance to notice an otherwise benign condition and translating them as catastrophic is high among people who frequently and intensively scan their physical appearance or sensations. It was also found in their research that body vigilance is a significant correlate of health anxiety between clinical and no-clinical adults. Furthermore, anxiety sensitivity is a predictor to fear of COVID-19 and safety behaviors because people with high sensitivity to anxiety are known to possess the tendency to misread benign sensations of arousal as a danger alert (Taylor et al. 2007). Specifically, the degree to which a person concentrates on his body sensations like nausea etc, is related to the urges against variety of safety behaviors. Alternatively, according to the\nepidemic, people who possess greater understanding of the disease are less likely to feel anxious as a response to domestic outbreak (APA, 2014).\nAs discussed above, the extent of literature provides suggestions towards the factors that could predict COVID-19 related fear and the consequent behaviors. Hence, it is hypothesized that higher level of general distress, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, contamination cognition, and anxiety sensitivity along with decreased level of factual knowledge about an epidemic can predict COVID-19 related fear and safety behaviors."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Three hundred and ninety undergraduate university students from Pakistan participated in present research.

CFI was specifically constructed for present research and constituted of 9 items. The purpose of developing this inventory was to analyze the fear associated with covid-19. Psychometric properties were analyzed and presented in the following section of preliminary analyses. Items were rated on 5 point likert scale, options stating 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much). The questionnaire was inspired by previously constructed questionnaire for H1N1 (Wheaton et al., 2012). CFI showed satisfactory internal consistency (\u03b1 =.88) for the present sample.\nCorona-19 Checklist for Safety Behaviors (CCSB) . CCSB was developed to inquire about the safety behaviors associated with fear of Covid-19. The checklist constitutes of 9 items. This inquire about the safety behaviors intended to prevent contacting Covid-19, examples include \u201cwashing hands compulsively, continuously checking internet for Covid-19 and avoiding people). This checklist was also inspired by previously constructed questionnaire for H1N1 (Wheaton et al., 2012). Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which they are engaging in activities while having concerns about COVID-19 on a 10-point scale (0=none to 10 extreme amount). The checklist showed satisfactory internal consistency (\u03b1 =.89) for current data.\nDepression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21; Antony et al. 1998). Subjective distress over last few weeks were assessed through three subscales of DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress). The scale constitutes of 42 items originally, but present research used the short form\nrate how each of these 21 statements are applied on them. The rating was done on 4-point likert scale ranging from 0=rarely to 4=very much. The scale showed satisfactory reliability and construct validity for clinical and the non-clinical population in a previous study by Henry and Crawford (2005). For present research the data responses showed \u03b1 = .94\nContamination Cognitions Scale (CCS; Deacon and Maack 2008). CCS is an inventory designed to assess the tendency of respondents to overestimate the chance of contamination from a variety of common objects like stairway railing etc. The items are rated on 0= not at all to 100= extremely. The scale was divided in terms of severity levels into two subscales of severity and likelihood with each subscale consisting of 13 items and total 26 items. For current sample the internal consistency of CCS-L and CCS-S was .95 and .96 respectively.\nDisgust Scale- Revised (DS-R; Olatunji et al. 2007). The revised version of Haidt et al. (1994) of used to analyze the propensity of sample to experience disgust across numerous domains. The objective view of respondents was taken in terms of multiple scenarios like if you see maggots on a piece of bread in an outdoor garbage pail, how disgusting do you find it on a scale of 0=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree. Internal consistency was found satisfactory (\u03b1 = .87) and convergent validity was analyzed previously by Olatunji et al. (2007).\nBody Vigilance Scale (BVS; Schmidt et al. 1997). The scale was designed to analyze tendencies of respondents towards attending anxiety related bodily sensation. First three items of the scales are focused to analyze three dimensions focusing the attention, sensitivity towards change and the duration devoted to monitor body sensations on a scale 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Fourth items separately inquired about fifteen bodily sensations and the extent to which attention is paid\nitem\u2019s score.

The scale was adopted from original version of Reiss et al. (2008). It consists of 18 items that measured beliefs related to dangerousness of anxious thoughts along physical, cognitive, and social domains. The items were rated on 4-point rating scales (0= very little to 4=very much). Previously Taylor et al. (2007), showed satisfactory convergent validity, criterion-related validity and discriminant validity for Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3. For current research, only physical concerns were analyzed because they were related to the aims of this research. The internal consistency of the scale was \u03b1 = .81.\nCovid-19 Fast Quiz (CFQ; Uk\u2019s Independent Fact Checking Authority). CFQ is a ten-item yes or no based measure of knowledge about the Covid-19 and 2019 global outbreak. High score indicated high knowledge about the virus and the outbreak.

Univariate outliers were not observed, however, two multivariate outliers were observed for whom Mahalanobis distances was beyond critical X2 df=8 value of 26.12. Outliers status for multivariate outliers was driven by the infrequent combination of scores on BVS, CCS-L, CCS-S and DASS for two participants. Such multivariate cases were excluded due to chance of bias in regression estimation points and sufficiently large sample.

Moreover, factual knowledge about the covid-19 outbreak was hypothesized to be a significant predictor for decrease in covid-19 related fear and safety behaviors. In order to meet the aims of this research, the researcher designed the measures for covid-19 related fear inventory and an inventory for safety behaviors. The measures were reported to possess acceptable psychometric properties. Variables were tested for correlation among each other and it was found that contamination cognition, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, anxiety sensitivity towards physical concerns and general distress positively correlated with fear and safety behaviors associated to covid-19. However, the hypothesis regarding the relationship between factual knowledge of covid-19 and fear of disease was not significant. The model was tested as a simultaneous regression model and it suggested that overestimation in severity of contamination significantly predict the fear of covid-19 and its associated safety behavior. Sensitivity to physical anxiety significantly determined fear of covid-19 but only marginally predict covid-19 related safety behaviors. Body vigilance was also marginally significant in predicting covid-19 related safety behaviors. Generally, it can be stated that our results partially support our initial hypothesis.\nTill date, researchers have rarely focused on anxious responses to a threat of viral illnesses such as covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan. Given the fact that the country has been exposed to the virus and we were well positioned to identify the predictors of fear and safety behaviors among young adults who are continuously getting information from media coverage about the outbreak in\npsychologists who are continuously dealing with referrals for panic and anxiety symptoms regarding covid-19. The research further highlights the behavioral responses of public towards a threat of pandemic and specially those people who are already vulnerable towards maladaptive responses such as health anxiety. Should a threat of another global panic surface in future, this research could also help in developing preventative programs and the clinical management systems. The results of research highlight that the contamination concern and the physical concerns about anxiety sensitivity might be essential in this experience of covid-19 fear and related safety behaviors such as compulsive hand washing. However, covid-19 related anxiety and behaviors were not found to be related to factual understanding of this pandemic.\nAlong with other psychological determinants, anxiety sensitivity in physical domain, is a significant predictor of Covid-19 fear and safety behaviors. Findings of this research are crosssectional, one of the ways through which anxiety sensitivity contributes to fearful responses against covid-19 is by possible misunderstanding of benign or universal bodily sensations as something threatening. Such a misunderstanding could lead to increased fear because number of bodily sensations that are associated with anxiety often mirror the symptoms of covid-19 (such as nausea) (Zu, Jiang, Xu, Chen, Ni, Lu, & Zhang, 2020). As previously hypothesized by researcher, concerns to severity of contamination predict covid-19 fear and safety behaviors. Covid-19 is indeed an illness with its severity in unpleasant symptoms like myalgia (muscle pain), cough, fever or fatigue (World Health Organization, 2020) but it is also a possibility that increased media coverage led people to overestimate the severity of this disease. Similar pattern was discussed in a research with undergraduate students by Wheaton et al. (2012). They studied the fearful responses of youngsters towards H1N1 pandemic known to be existed from 2009 to\ncoverage and fear of covid-19 and safety behaviors.\nAn interesting exploration by this study is regarding the non-significant relationship of factual knowledge ofcovid-19 and fear and engagement in safety behaviors of covid-19. However, the findings go consistent with the previous research of Moritz and Pohl (2009), where illness related information like statistics of incidence did not show a significant relationship with anxiety related symptoms. Our covid-19 information quiz was taken from an online reliable source for which the psychometric properties were unknown, but the score distribution in our data was without skew or kurtosis and showed normality. Covid-19 is an ongoing pandemic in the world and has been declared as a public health emergency on international level (World Health Organization, 2020). Yet as the National Institute of Health, Islamic Republic of Pakistan, declared it to be a catastrophe in Pakistan, federal government imposed several restrictions throughout the country which include closing of outpatient departments in the hospitals, bans on the intra and inter city public transports as well as the gatherings in public or private places, which rose the concern and fear among general population and made covid-19 fear a greater threat than the covid-19 itself (COVID-19 Daily Situation Report \u2013 NIH Pakistan\", 25 March 2020).\nThe results suggest that the efforts to increase the knowledge of covid-19 outbreak might not alleviate the covid-19 related fear and safety behaviors. This understanding brings some clinical relevance in a way that cognitive models highlighting dysfunctional beliefs like threat overestimation are of great importance as etiological factors for pathological anxiety which needs to be targeted in the individualized management plans (Fergus 2014). As an alternative explanation it can be said that respondents coped with the fear of covid-19 by seeking the\nresearch might seed cognitive interventions by stating that educating an anxiety patient about the epidemic alone, cannot become a strong method against dysfunctional health related beliefs. As the research considered a non-clinical population, future recommendation would be to consider a clinical population with health anxiety of clinical severity in order to see if providing knowledge about the epidemic could mitigate the fear and anxiousness among people.\nThe design of this research was basically inspired by Wheaton et al. (2012), where anxious responses against H1N1 were explored after 2009 outbreak. The authors suggested that likelihood and severity in contamination cognition, health anxiety and disgust sensitivity significantly predicted fear of H1N1. However, it was reported that physical concerns regarding anxiety sensitivity, general distress and body vigilance was not connected to fear of illness (H1N1). Therefore, it can be stated that our result is somewhat in consistency with the previous research of Wheaton and colleagues. It is recommended for future researches that comparison study should be conducted to see the amount of perceived dangerousness, disgusting and controllability for certain outbreaks.\nSome of the limitations of this research should be considered while citing this research in future. Firstly, the participants were undergraduate students from Pakistan, and they were apparently physically and psychologically healthy. Therefore, the findings cannot be applied to individuals with clinical symptoms like OCD or hypochondriasis. Secondly, participants were recruited from undergraduate university students from Pakistan and the results cannot be implicated to all the youngsters from Pakistan with otherwise similar demographic properties because people experience differentiated level of concerns according to the level of incidence in that region. It would be desirable if a similar research with global representation can be conducted in future.\ninflate the associations of variables.\nAt last, the research provides directional conclusions. It is suggested that people with greater concern of contamination are likely to respond fearfully tocovid-19 and that people with higher fear ofcovid-19 are likely to feel contamination concerns. In future, longitudinal research would be of great benefit in determining the predictability of constructs towards health anxiety as a response to global epidemics or threat of serious diseases. Likewise, the chances that safety behaviors could generate or increase covid-19 concerns is important in the light of study suggesting that intentional engagement in health-related safety activities makes individuals more concerned about the risk of contamination (Olatunji et al. 2011). Present research provides data in relevance to understanding psychological pointers for anxious responding to global epidemics."}]}, {"paper_id": "xw70p", "claim2": "We found that national narcissism was strongly associated with the proneness to believe and disseminate conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, accounting for up to 22% of the variance.", "claim3a": "We expect that those who are particularly concerned with defending an idealistic national image \u2013people high in national narcissism\u2013 will show greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories.", "claim3b": "The relationship of national narcissism predicting belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was tested using linear regression.", "claim4": "Participants high in national narcissism agreed more strongly with COVID-19 conspiracy theories (B = 0.51, SE = 0.06, t(291) = 9.21, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.40, 0.62], adjusted R squared = 0.223)", "content": [{"text": "While COVID-19 was quietly spreading across the globe, conspiracy theories were finding loud voices on the internet. What contributes to the spread of these theories? In two national surveys (NTotal = 950) conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom, we identified national narcissism \u2013 a belief in the greatness of one\u2019s nation that others do not appreciate \u2013 as a risk factor for the spread of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that national narcissism was strongly associated with the proneness to believe and disseminate conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, accounting for up to 22% of the variance. Further, we found preliminary evidence that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and national narcissism was linked to health-related behaviors and attitudes towards public policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our study expands previous work by illustrating the importance of identity processes in the spread of conspiracy theories during pandemics.\nKeywords: conspiracy theories, collective narcissism, social identity, COVID-19, public-health\nCollective narcissism predicts the belief and dissemination of conspiracy theories during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\nEarly February 2020, the WHO\u2019s Director-General warned that \u201cwe\u2019re not just battling the virus; we\u2019re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response\u201d1. Indeed, conspiracy theories such as the idea that COVID-19 was intentionally engineered2 that it was a political scheme to control citizens3, or that it was a hoax created by 5G Networks, spread across the globe. In May, \u2018Plandemic\u2019, a video filled with dangerous misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 generated over 8 Million views in less than two weeks4. Misguided by conspiracy theories, people set dozens of 5G cell towers on fire5 and gathered to protest against stay-home-orders instead of adhering to the recommendations of health experts3. Compounded by the fact that falsehoods spread faster and more broadly than the truth on social media platforms6,7 the popularity of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 threatens to increase the virus\u2019 death toll. The current research examines why people believe and share these theories.\nWhile research on the psychology of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic\nitself is still scarce, some work exists on conspiracy theory beliefs related to past pandemics such as the Zika virus outbreak in 2015-16. This research suggests that conspiracy theories indeed tend to spread during public-health crises8,9 and are associated with harmful health-related behaviors (e.g., refs.10,11). Some recent work also identified certain diffusion patterns of conspiracy theories on online social networks during public-health crises7,12. Yet, less is known about the psychological processes that motivate people to spread conspiracy theories during public-health crises. This gap in the literature deserves particular attention given research\nsuggesting that stopping even a small number of people could drastically reduce the spread of medical misinformation13.\nOur paper seeks to address gaps in the literature on the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy\ntheories in multiple countries and better understand the psychological profile of people who disseminate conspiracy theories, particular during public-health crises. We focus especially on identity motives underpinning the spread of conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Research found that social identity motives can promote conspiracy theory beliefs (for a review, see refs. 14,15). Some work suggests that social identity motives may be the key facilitator to those conspiracy theories that directly respond to identity threats posed by socio-political stressors (e.g., political conflicts) and help reinforce positive group identities (see ref. 16). We will examine whether collective narcissism is an important social psychological contributor to the belief and dissemination of COVID-19 conspiracy theories.\nCollective narcissism is an inflated belief in the greatness of one\u2019s ingroup \u2013be it one\u2019s\nnation, religious, or any other social group\u2013 that requires external validation17. People scoring high in collective narcissism tend to be hypersensitive to ingroup criticism18 and rely on outgroup hostility to manage threats to ingroup image19. They also tend to blame others for any ingroup misfortunes20. This may explain why those high in collective narcissism are prone to believe that others are conspiring against their ingroup21-23.\nSo far, research has primarily focused on the association between collective narcissism\nand conspiracy theory beliefs in the context of inter-group conflicts24. Yet, there is reason to expect that collective narcissism is also associated with stronger beliefs in conspiracy theories related to public-health crises like the current COVID-19 pandemic. Public-health crises pose a serious threat to an idealistic image of one\u2019s nation. Pandemics emerge when countries are\nunable to contain the spread of a disease. As such they constitute an existential hazard to the population and may reveal weaknesses in leadership and healthcare to a watching world. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, this threat to national image may be further compounded by the harsh criticism some countries have received for late and insufficient responses to the COVID-19 outbreak25. Together, people high in national narcissism (i.e., collective narcissism measured with respect to one\u2019s national identity) may, more so than others, experience public-health pandemics as a severe identity threat.\nWe argue that the spread of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic, may be\npartly rooted in the urge to manage the threat to an idealistic national image posed by this publichealth crisis. Conspiracy theories respectively deny (e.g., COVID-19 is a hoax) or deflect (e.g., COVID-19 is a Chinese bioweapon) from national failings. Thus, conspiracy theories related to a public-health crisis may serve as a reinforcement of the idealistic image of one\u2019s nation that was threatened by the crisis. We expect that those who are particularly concerned with defending an idealistic national image \u2013people high in national narcissism\u2013 will show greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. These greater beliefs in conspiracy theories may then translate into a greater readiness to further disseminate those conspiracy theories (see ref. 26 on the spread of fake news).\nIn two large national surveys (Total N = 950), one representative sample in the United\nStates (N = 300) and one ideologically balanced sample in the United Kingdom (N = 650), we measured the relationship between national narcissism and the belief and dissemination of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We predicted that national narcissism would be associated with greater belief in conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 (H1). Further, we predicted that national narcissism would be associated with stronger intentions to disseminate conspiracy\ntheories related to COVID-19 (H2) and that this relationship will be mediated by greater belief in these theories (H3). The initial U.S. study was exploratory. The second study provided a preregistered conceptual replication in the U.K.\nIn addition to studying the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, we investigated two\nadditional, and practically important, research questions. First, recent web traffic analysis found that fake news frequently spread through Facebook during the 2016 election27. Thus, we explored whether people high in national narcissism would prefer using any particular social media platform for disseminating COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Further, previous research suggests that greater belief in medical conspiracy theories is related to adverse health-related behaviors and attitudes such as non-compliance with medical treatment plans28 and vaccine skepticism10,11. Given the urgency to understand and promote effective health behavior in the current COVID-19 pandemic, we also explored the relationship between national narcissism, conspiracy theory beliefs, and health-related behaviors and attitudes (Study 2).\nAcross both studies, we found robust support for our three main hypotheses suggesting\nthat national narcissism is associated with the belief and dissemination of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19. Critically, we found that this relationship is distinguishable from related processes including national identification (Study 1 & 2), tendency to judge nonsensical information as profound, and factual knowledge about the pandemic (Study 2). We also found that national narcissism was linked to social media preferences (i.e., preferring to share conspiracy theories on Facebook). Further, exploratory analyses suggested that national narcissism and the belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories are associated with the adherence to health guidelines and the support of policies that are aimed at containing the pandemic."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Study Samples.

Sample size was determined by economic considerations in Study 1 and a-priori power analyses in Study 2 (see methods section). Both studies were conducted online and recruited participants through the crowd-sourcing platform Prolific."}, {"heading": "Measurements and analysis plan.", "text": "Belief and Dissemination Intentions. In both studies, participants read a series of\nstatements, including conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, and rated their agreement and dissemination intentions for each of them. In Study 1, participants read two conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 is a Chinese bioweapon; the COVID-19 pandemic is exaggerated to hurt the Trump administration). Participants also read eight conspiracy theories that were unrelated to the pandemic (e.g., 9/11 inside job) for subsequent robustness analyses. In Study 2, participants read seven conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 is a population control scheme). We also presented participants three factual statements about the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., the U.K. has over 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases) for subsequent robustness analyses. We then averaged agreement with the COVID-19 conspiracy theories to create an index of the participant\u2019s overall belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (Study 1: r(291) = .45, Study 2: \u0251 = .85) and intentions\nto disseminate these theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall intentions to disseminate COVID-19 theories (Study 1: r(291) = .72, , Study 2: \u0251 = .90). Indices of belief and dissemination intentions concerning conspiracy theories unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 1) and factual statements (Study 2) were created correspondingly (\u0251Study1_Belief = .83, \u0251Study2_Knowledge = .24, \u0251Study1_Dissemination = .94, \u0251Study2_Dissemination = .77).\nNational narcissism. National narcissism was measured with short forms of the\nCollective Narcissism Scale created refs.17,46,47 (Study 1: \u0251 = .82, Study 2: \u0251 = .89). Sample item: Not many people seem to fully understand the importance of the United States [Britain].\nAdditional measures for robustness analyses. We measured (non-narcissistic) national\nidentification using a 1-item measure48 in Study 1 and a 5-item measure50 in Study 2 (\u0251 = .94). Sample item: I identify with being American [British]. In Study 1, we also administered the Bullshit Receptivity Scale to measure participants\u2019 tendency to judge nonsensical information as profound29 (\u0251 = .91).\nHealth-related behaviors and attitudes. In Study 2, participants were asked about\nbehaviors and attitudes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we measured participants\u2019 engagement in handwashing and social distancing, and their support for public policies mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Recent work suggests that self-reported health behaviors are highly correlated with objective measures of those behaviors30. We asked participants to report how they would act in four different scenarios. Two of the scenarios captured participants\u2019 rigor in social distancing (e.g., going to a friend\u2019s birthday party invitation, reverse-coded) and the other two participants\u2019 rigor in handwashing (e.g., washing hands before preparing a snack). In addition, we collected two self-report measures on handwashing and social distancing. Responses to the scenarios and self-reports were averaged to an index of the\nparticipant\u2019s overall engagement in handwashing (\u0251 = .69) and an index of the participant\u2019s overall engagement in social distancing (\u0251 = .46), respectively. We also asked about participants\u2019 support for public-policies currently in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., closed schools). Items were averaged to an index of the participant\u2019s overall support of public-policies aimed to limit the COVID-19 pandemic (\u0251 = .81).\nDissemination behavior. After participants reported their beliefs and sharing intentions\nfor each statement, we asked them to choose from a list of online social platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, \u201cother\u201d) where they would be most likely to share their post[s]. In Study 1, participants also indicated which of the presented ideas (i.e., conspiracy theories) they would be most likely to post about online. In both studies, we left it free to the participant whether their posts would be supporting or opposing the idea.\nAnalysis plan. Analyses in Study 1 were conducted post-hoc, after the dataset has been\ncollected. Analyses in Study 2 were pre-registered (osf.io/7vjr2). In both studies, reported belief and dissemination intentions of conspiracy theories were quite low, on average (see methods section). Due to the positive skewness of our data we additionally probed the robustness of our results using bootstrapping. Results converged with the reported results. All variables were measured on a scale from 1 to 5 with higher numbers reflecting stronger manifestation of the construct (e.g., stronger belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, greater engagement in handwashing). All analyses used two-tailed testing.\nBelief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We tested whether national narcissism predicted belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories using linear regression analyses. Consistent with our predictions, we found that participants high in national narcissism agreed more strongly with\nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories (Study 1: B = .51, SE = .06 t(291) = 9.21, p < .001, CI95 = [.40, .62], adjusted R2 = .223; Study 2: B = .24, SE = .03, t(635) = 8.33 p < .001, CI95 = [.19, .30], adjusted R2 = .097). This association explained 22.3% of the variance in Study 1 and 9.7% of the variance in Study 2.\nWe argued that conspiracy theories related to a present pandemic may be understood as a\ndefensive response to image threat and are as such particularly appealing to people high in national narcissism. In Study 1, we tested whether belief in conspiracy theories connected to COVID-19 were empirically distinguishable from other conspiracy theory beliefs and the tendency to judge nonsensical information as profound (i.e., bullshit receptivity29) and entered both variables as predictors into the model. In addition, we entered national identification as a predictor to isolate the unique effects of insecure, narcissistic national identification from secure, national identification17. National narcissism remained a significant predictor of belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (B = .31, SE = .05, t(288) = 5.78, p < .001, CI95 = [.21, .42]) after adjusting for these other variables.\nOne explanation of our findings could be that people high in national narcissism are more\nexposed to misinformation and conspiracy theories and their greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories stems from a lack of knowledge. In Study 2, we tested this possibility and adjusted for participants\u2019 agreement with true facts about the COVID-19 pandemic. As predicted, the effect of national narcissism remained significant when we adjusted for factual knowledge and again for national identification (B = .27, SE = .04, t(633) = 7.78, p < .001 CI95 = [.20, .34]). These analyses suggest that the relationship between national narcissism and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories is empirically distinguishable from other psychological processes\n(find plotted results and additional robustness checks in the supplementary).

Regression tables are displayed for Study 1 [a] and Study 2 [b].\nDissemination of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Prior work suggests that intentions to share misinformation are highly correlated with actual sharing behavior on social media31. Therefore, we tested whether national narcissism predicted participants\u2019 intentions to disseminate COVID19 conspiracy theories using linear regression analyses. As predicted, we found that participants high in national narcissism were more inclined to share COVID-19 conspiracy theories online (Study 1: B = .34, SE = .08, t(291) = 4.27, p < .001, CI95 = [.19, .50], adjusted R2 = .056; Study 2: B = .18, SE = .03, t(635) = 6.88, p < .001, CI95 = [.13, .23], adjusted R2 = .068) which explained 5.6% of the variance in Study 1 and 6.8% of the variance in Study 2.\nWe again sought to isolate the effect of national narcissism from national identification.\nIn addition, we wanted to test the possibility that our findings simply reflect a greater engagement with online social networks of those scoring high in national narcissism. When we adjusted for participants\u2019 national identification (Study 1 & 2), intentions to share conspiracy theories unrelated to COVID-19 (Study 1) and participants\u2019 intentions to share true facts related\nto COVID-19 (Study 2), the effect of national narcissism on intentions to disseminate COVID-19 conspiracy theories remained statistically significant (Study 1: B = .14, SE = .05, t(289) = 2.87, p = .004, CI95 = [.05, .24] ; Study 2: B = .17, SE = .03, t(633) = 5.93, p < .001, CI95 = [.11, .22]). Results are displayed in Fig. 2. This suggests that the relationship between national narcissism and dissemination of COVID-19 conspiracy theories is not a product of greater engagement in online discourse in general.\nWe then tested our prediction that the positive relationship between national narcissism\nand dissemination intentions is mediated by greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories using PROCESS macro v.3.4.1. In both studies, we found evidence for this mediation model (Study 1: B = .20, BootSE = .05, CI95 = [.11, .31], 5000 bootstraps ; Study 2: B = .15, BootSE = .02 CI95 = [.11, .19], 5000 bootstraps).

Regression tables for predicting intentions to disseminate COVID-19 conspiracy theories. National narcissism remains a significant predictor of intentions to disseminate COVID-19 conspiracy theories when adjusting for several covariates (including national identification, dissemination intentions of conspiracy theories unrelated to CVID-19, and dissemination intentions of true facts about COVID19). Regression tables are displayed for Study 1 [a] and Study 2 [b].\nDissemination patterns. Next, we explored whether people high in national narcissism\ngravitate towards specific social media platforms to share their beliefs online. When we asked participants where they would post about the presented statements, the majority of participants chose Facebook (40.3% in Study 1 and 67% in Study 2). Multinomial logistic regressions\nrevealed that national narcissism predicted which platform participants intended to use (Study 1: \ud835\uded82(6) = 12.88, p = .045, Nagelkerke R2 = .05 ; Study 2: \ud835\uded82(8) = 20.77, p = .008, Nagelkerke R2 = .03).\nParticipants scoring high in national narcissism were especially likely to gravitate\ntowards Facebook for spreading their opinions. To formally test this observation, we re-coded platform choice into a binary variable (Facebook = 1, other online platforms = 0). We conducted a binomial logistic regression to predict Facebook choice as a function of national narcissism. Stronger national narcissism was related to a greater likelihood to choose Facebook over other popular social media platforms for sharing posts (Study 1: B = .24, SE = .12, Wald \ud835\uded82(1) = 3.94, p = .047, eB = 1.27 CI95(eB) = [1.00, 1.61], Nagelkerke R2 = .02; Study 2: B = .46, SE = .12, Wald \ud835\uded82(1) = 14.69, p < .001, eB= 1.59, CI95(eB) = [1.25, 2.01], Nagelkerke R2 = .05). In Study 1, we further found that national narcissism was associated with the likelihood to choose to post about a conspiracy theory related to COVID-19 over a conspiracy theory unrelated to COVID-19 (B = .34, SE = .13 Wald \ud835\uded82(1) = 6.51, p = .011, eB = 1.40 CI95(eB) = [1.08, 1.82], Nagelkerke R2 = .03).\nHealth-related behavior and attitudes. Study 2 additionally tested whether national narcissism and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories were linked to health-related behavior and attitudes. More specifically, we examined participants\u2019 engagement in handwashing and social distancing, and their support for public-policies mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Recent research suggests that self-reported social distancing is highly correlated with actual social distancing behavior30. The data were negatively skewed. On average, participants reported very high\nengagement in handwashing and social distancing and strong support for the presented publicpolicies.\nFor our analyses on conspiracy theories, we grouped our COVID-19 conspiracy theories\ninto two categories: (a) Denial \u2013 the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax; and (b) Deflection \u2013 the COVID-19 pandemic is created and/or spread by a powerful group of people. In the light of recent work32 we were open to the possibility that these different types of conspiracy theories would be associated with different health-related behavior and attitudes and conducted separate analyses for these two types of conspiracy theories.\nWe first explored belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as the predictor of behavioral\nintentions. We found that the belief in Denial conspiracy theories was only marginally related to handwashing (B = .10, SE = .06, t(635) = 1.68, p = .093, CI95 = [-.02, .22], adjusted R2 = .003) but was linked to less social distancing (B = -.26, SE = .05, t(635) = -5.41, p < .001, CI95 = [-.35, -.16], adjusted R2 = .043) and lower public-policy support (B = -.27, SE = .05, t(635) = -5.86, p < .001, CI95 = [-.36, .18], adjusted R2 = .050). Belief in Deflection conspiracy theories was related to handwashing (B = .10, SE = .04, t(635) = 2.45, p = .014, CI95 = [.02, .17], adjusted R2 = .008) and linked to less social distancing (B = -.15, SE = .03, t(635) = -4.96, p < .001, CI95 = [-.21, - .09] , adjusted R2 = .036) and lower public-policy support (B = -.14, SE = .03, t(635) = -4.76, p < .001, CI95 = [-.20, -.08], adjusted R2 = .033). Together, both types of COVID-19 conspiracy theory beliefs (Denial and Deflection) were negatively associated with social distancing and public-policy support. Belief in Deflection conspiracy theories was additionally positively associated with handwashing.\nNext we turned to national narcissism as a predictor and found that it was positively\nassociated with handwashing (B = .13, SE = .04, t(635) = 3.70, p < .001, CI95 = [.06, .20],\nadjusted R2 = .020) but did not predict social distancing (B = -.04, SE = .03, t(635) = -1.29, p = .198, CI95 = [-.09, .02] , adjusted R2 = .001) or public-policy support (B = -.04, SE = .03, t(635) = -1.26, p = .209, CI95 = [-.09, .02], adjusted R2 = .001).\nWe tested whether the relationship between national narcissism and handwashing is\nmediated by greater belief in conspiracy theories. We probed a parallel mediation model in which we specified national narcissism as the predictor, belief in the two types of conspiracy theories as the mediators, and handwashing as the outcome. We found no evidence of a mediation (BDenial = .003, SE = .01, CI95 = [-.01, .02] ; BDeflection = .01, SE .01, CI95 = [-.01, .04]; both 5000 bootstrap samples). The relationship between national narcissism and handwashing appeared to be independent of belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Across two studies in different countries, we found a strong and robust relationship between national narcissism and COVID-19 conspiracy theories. National narcissism was associated with stronger belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Further, national narcissism was linked to greater intentions to disseminate COVID-19 conspiracy theories online, which was mediated by greater belief in these theories. We also found that people scoring higher in national narcissism were more inclined to post about conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 than conspiracy theories unrelated to the virus (Study 1) and preferred Facebook over other social networks for sharing their beliefs (Study 1 & 2). We also found that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and national narcissism were related to certain health-related behaviors and attitudes. These findings provide important and novel insights for research on conspiracy theories and national identity and may also hold practical relevance.\nOur study expands previous work on conspiracy theories related to public-health crises\nby examining the role identity processes might play in fostering the spread of these theories. We argued that existential threats of public-health crises may extend to the social self by threatening in-group image (for an overview of identity processes during public-health crises, see ref. 33). We found that insecure and defensive national identification \u2013 national narcissism \u2013 was a powerful predictor of the spread of conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCritically, we accounted for a number of variables which could potentially confound the\nrelationship between national narcissism and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We isolated the belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories from factual knowledge about the pandemic (Study 2) and the tendency to judge nonsensical information as profound (i.e., bullshit receptivity29, Study 1). To our knowledge, we are the first to provide direct empirical evidence that these concepts are not identical (for a theoretical distinction, see ref. 34). Notably, we also found that high national narcissism was related to greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories even after adjusting for participants\u2019 tendency to believe conspiracy theories in general and that it was further linked to a preference for posting about conspiracy theories particular relating (vs. not relating) to COVID-19 (Study 1). These results suggest that conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 are psychologically distinctive from other conspiracy theories and false beliefs. While we are cautious to draw strong conclusions from such correlational findings, we interpret these results as preliminary evidence that conspiracy theories related to a public-health crisis may have unique psychological functions during such crises. One function may be the reinforcement of an idealistic national image.\nOur study adds to the burgeoning research on the spread of misinformation and\nconspiracy theories online (e.g., refs. 6,27). Vast work exists on who believes in conspiracy\ntheories (see refs. 14,15) and how conspiracy theories spread on a system level (e.g., refs. 7,35,36). Less is known about who spreads conspiracy theories, particularly during public-health crises. We identified national narcissism as a risk factor that might contribute to the dissemination of conspiracy theories online. Exploratory analyses in both studies found that Facebook was the most popular platform to share one\u2019s beliefs \u2013 especially \u2013 amongst people high in national narcissism. While more work is needed to replicate and extend our findings to real online sharing, this finding might eventually offer guidance in how to allocate resources for the fight against misinformation.\nOur findings also advance research on collective narcissism. For instance, research on\ncollective narcissism has mainly focused on how belief in conspiracy theories implicating outgroups constitutes a strategy to manage inter-group conflicts (e.g., ref. 21). Our work provided initial evidence that during a pandemic people high in national narcissism seem to be drawn to conspiracy theories specifically about this pandemic, potentially to manage induced national image threat. These results suggest that, in the sphere of collective narcissism, public-health crises may evoke psychological processes analogous to inter-group threats. This may suggest that conspiracy theory beliefs are a generalized maladaptive ingroup defense strategy amongst people high in collective narcissism. Our research also provides evidence that the relationship between national narcissism and belief in conspiracy theories mediates intentions to disseminate these theories. This finding may inform how collective narcissism advances societal movements including neo-fascist political movements (for a review, see ref. 37).\nOur results suggest that the belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was associated with\nlower engagement in social distancing and support for public-policies. For handwashing, we found that behavioral intentions diverged based on the specific types of COVID-19 conspiracy\ntheories. While belief in Deflection conspiracy theories (i.e., the virus was intentionally created and/or spread) was related to greater engagement in handwashing, belief in Denial conspiracy theories (i.e., the pandemic is a hoax) was unrelated to handwashing. These results dovetail with previous work linking conspiracy theory beliefs to distrust of authorities (refs. 31,41), noncompliance with social norms (refs. 39,40), and a stronger need for control and agency31. Social distancing and public-policies related to COVID-19 require social cooperation and the compliance with norms and government orders (see ref. 33). In contrast, handwashing is often private and self-guided. While there are many ways to interpret these results, we speculate that participants with stronger belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories were more hesitant to adhere to social distancing guidelines and to support related public-policies in part because both were prescribed by authorities. Yet, those of them who were still aware of the threat posed by COVID19 were nevertheless receptive for health guidelines that maintained a sense of agency (handwashing).\nSimilarly, we found that national narcissism was positively associated with handwashing\nbut did not correlate with social distancing and support for public policies. These results may reflect greater autonomy concerns associated with collective narcissism42. To the extent that handwashing is a convenient, self-protection measure while the adherence to social distancing and public-policies is rather inconvenient yet protects the community, our results are also consistent with recent work showing that collective narcissism is linked to prioritizing one\u2019s personal needs42,43 and the protection of the ingroup\u2019s image over the care and loyalty for fellow citizens 20,44,45.\nWe would like to stress that all results are correlational. Though we suspect that national\nnarcissism motivates the belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and translates into health-\nrelated behaviors and attitudes than the reverse, more work is needed to justify such a conclusion. We should also note that beliefs in conspiracy theories were quite low, on average. As such, our work is best understood as examining people who depart from a norm of skepticism towards conspiracy theories. Further, our results are specific to the context of COVID-19. It remains an open question whether these results generalize across different types and times of public-health crises. At the same time, we believe that studying the spread of medical conspiracy theories during an actual pandemic also adds unique value to our work and may offer insights into a particularly dangerous moment for the spread of misinformation."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Ultimately, we hope that our studies are not only relevant for researchers but also for practitioners. Yet, little is known about how to increase or decrease the link between collective narcissism and conspiracy theories. Therefore, we urge future research to examine if focusing on the protection of the national image influences the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, and the implications of these associations for public-health communication. For instance, underscoring that the national in-group is in some way disadvantaged in fighting the pandemic might increase the need to assert the image of the group and further fuel conspiracy theories49. Conversely, public-health messages might benefit from stressing that the adherence to health guidelines and policies also helps protect the nation\u2019s image. Exploring such and other interventions could help limit the current \u2018infodemic\u20191."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Samples. Study 1 was exploratory using an ad-hoc sample of 300 U.S. participants recruited between 10th and 12th of March, 2020. The sample was nationally representative for age, gender, and race of an adult population (146 female, 144 male, 3 other; 25 Asian, 47 Black or African American, 200 White, 21 other; MAge= 44.41, SDAge= 16.11). Seven participants failed our attention check and were excluded from the analyses. The total sample size was 293. We conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analysis in which we specified the number of tested predictors as one (national narcissism) and total number of tested predictors as four (national narcissism plus three adjustment variables: national identification, belief/dissemination intentions of conspiracy theories unrelated to COVID-19; bullshit receptivity). Alpha was set to .05 and power to .80. With these parameters, our sample size was sensitive to detect an effect size of f2 = .027.\nStudy 2 served as a conceptual replication. We recruited a sample of 650 U.K.\nparticipants on April 28, 2020 (440 female, 193 male, 4 other; 15 Asian, 11 Black or African American, 589 White, 22 other; MAge= 37.20, SDAge= 12.40). The sample was balanced in its ideological beliefs approximated by a 50-50 split in participants who voted Leave versus Remain in the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum. Data of two participants was deleted due to missing consent. Eleven participants failed the attention check and were excluded from all analyses. The total sample size was 637. We conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analysis in which we specified the number of tested predictors as one (national narcissism) and total number of tested predictors as three (national narcissism plus two adjustment variables: national identification, knowledge/dissemination of true facts about COVID-19). Alpha was set to .05 and power to .80. With these parameters, our sample size was sensitive to detect an effect size of f2 = .012. Study 2 was pre-registered (osf.io/7vjr2). For the exploratory measurements (i.e., dissemination behavior,\nhealth-related behaviors and attitudes), we pre-registered the analysis plan but were agnostic to the results. For all other analyses, we pre-registered analysis plans and predictions. Note that our initial, pre-registered analyses in Study 2 distinguished between belief in conspiracy theories claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax (Denial conspiracy theories) and conspiracy theories claiming that COVID-19 is created and/or spread by a powerful group of people (Deflection conspiracy theories). Both types showed similar patterns in their relationships with national narcissism and we report aggregated results. Separate analyses and results are reported in the supplementary.\nIn both studies, we observed no outliers, defined as participants whose responses to the\ndependent variables exceeded 3 standard deviations above or below the mean. Further, in both studies, the patterns of results did not change when we analyzed all participants."}, {"heading": "Procedure and Measurements.", "text": "Belief and Dissemination Intentions. In both studies, participants read a series of statements and rated their agreement (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree in Study 1; 1 = not at all to 5 = very much in Study 2) and dissemination intentions (1 = not at all to 5 = very much in Study 1 & Study 2) for each of them.\nIn Study 1, participants read two conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOne conspiracy theory claimed that the pandemic was a hoax (COVID-19 pandemic is exaggerated by the media to hurt the Trump administration) and one conspiracy theory claimed that the pandemic was caused by humans (China created COVID-19 as a bioweapon). Participants also read eight conspiracy theories that were unrelated to the pandemic (e.g., 9/11 was an inside job). We averaged agreement with the two COVID-19 conspiracy theories to\ncreate an index of the participant\u2019s overall belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (r(291) = .45, M = 1.95, SD = 1.07). Intentions to disseminate the COVID-19 conspiracy theories were averaged to an index of the participant\u2019s overall intentions to disseminate COVID-19 conspiracy theories (r(291) = .72, M = 2.14, SD = 1.41). Indices of belief and dissemination intentions concerning conspiracy theories unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic were created correspondingly ( \u0251Belief = .83, MBelief = 1.90, SDBelief = .77 ; \u0251Dissemination = .94, MDissemination= 2.07, SDDissemination = 1.19).\nIn Study 2, participants read seven conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19\npandemic. Two conspiracy theories claimed that the pandemic was a hoax (e.g., COVID-19 is a coverup for the harmful effects of 5G radiation), two conspiracy theories claimed that COVID19 was engineered by humans (e.g., COVID-19 is a bioweapon), and three conspiracy theories claimed that COVID-19 was intentionally spread by humans (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry spreads COVID-19 for financial gains). We grouped these conspiracy theories into two categories. The first two conspiracy theories were categorized as Denial conspiracy theories. The remaining five conspiracy theories were categorized as Deflection conspiracy theories. Participants also read three factual statements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We created three different types of belief indices and three different types of dissemination indices for the COVID-19 conspiracy theories. First, we averaged agreement with all COVID-19 conspiracy theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (\u0251 = .85, M = 1.64, SD = .71) and averaged intentions to disseminate these theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall dissemination intentions of COVID-19 conspiracy theories (\u0251 = .90, M = 1.31, SD = .62). Second, we averaged agreement with the two Denial conspiracy theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall belief in Denial conspiracy theories (r(635) = .57, M = 1.21,\nSD = .54) and averaged intentions to disseminate these theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall dissemination intentions of Denial conspiracy theories (r(635) = .61, M = 1.16, SD = .53). Third, we averaged agreement with the five Deflection conspiracy theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall belief in Deflection conspiracy theories (Cronbach \u0251 = .84, M = 1.82, SD = .84) and averaged intentions to disseminate these theories to an index of the participant\u2019s overall dissemination intentions of Deflation conspiracy theories (Cronbach \u0251 = .89, M = 1.37, SD = .71). Indices of belief and dissemination intentions concerning factual information about the COVID-19 pandemic were created correspondingly ( \u0251Belief = .24, MBelief = 3.27, SDBelief = .76 ; \u0251Dissemination = .77, MDissemination = 1.89, SDDissemination = .99).\nAcross all belief and dissemination indices that we created, higher scores reflected\nstronger manifestation of the measured construct (e.g., stronger belief in Deflection conspiracy theories). Notably, belief and dissemination intentions of COVID-19 conspiracy theories were on average very low in both studies.\nDirectly after responding to the statements, participants specified which online platform\nthey would choose if they were to post about these statements. Participants selected from a list of popular platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, \u201cother\u201d). In Study 2, they also had the option to choose \u201cI don\u2019t post things\u201d. In Study 1, participants additionally saw a list of the conspiracy theories they just read and indicated which of the ideas they would be most likely to post about online. In both studies, we left it free to the participant whether their posts would be supporting or opposing the idea.\nNational narcissism. National narcissism was measured with a short 3-item version47 (\u0251 =\n.82, M = 2.10, SE = .99) of the Collective Narcissism Scale17 in Study 1 and the 5-item version46 (\u0251 = .89, M = 2.32, SD = .92) in Study 2.\nAdditional measures for robustness analyses. We measured national identification using\na 1-item measure in Study 1 (I identify with being American; 48 M = 3.90, SD = 1.1849) and a 5- item measure in Study 2 (\u0251 = .94, M = 3.54, SD = 1.03). Study 1 further administered a scale that captured people\u2019s tendency to judge nonsensical information as profound (Bullshit Receptivity Scale29). This scale presents a number of nonsensical statements and asks participants to evaluate how \u201cprofound\u201d each statement was (sample statement: Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena). Participants in both studies also responded to a series of demographic questions including age, gender, race, education, political ideology, and party support, and vote in the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum (Study 2), and whether they or close others have been infected by COVID-19 (Study 2). Robustness analyses including these variables are reported in the supplementary.\nHealth-related behavior and attitudes. Study 2 included measures of participants\u2019\nengagement in health-related behaviors (handwashing and social distancing) and attitudes towards public-policies mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Participants read four scenarios. Two scenarios captured participants\u2019 engagement in social distancing (e.g., going to a friend\u2019s birthday party, reverse-coded) and two scenarios captured participants\u2019 engagement in handwashing (e.g., washing hands before preparing a snack). For each scenario participants indicated how likely they were enacting a certain behavior (1 = definitely, 2 = probably not, 3 = maybe, 4 = probably, 5 = definitely not). In addition, participants indicated how often they washed their hands on an average week and how frequently they left the house for reasons other than grocery shopping, exercising, medical needs, and taking care of a pet (1 = not very frequently to 5 = very frequently). Responses to the handwashing scenarios and self-reported frequency of handwashing were averaged to an index of the participant\u2019s engagement in handwashing (\u0251 = .69, M = 4.17, SD = .82). Responses to the social distancing scenarios (both\nreverse-coded) and self-reported frequency of non-compliance with social distancing guidelines (reverse-coded) were averaged to an index of the participant\u2019s engagement in social distancing (\u0251 = .46, M = 4.50, SD = .66). Further, we presented participants four public-policies currently in place in the U.K. to limit the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., closed schools). Participants indicated how much they supported each policy (1 = not at all to 5 = very much). Responses were averaged to an index of the participant\u2019s overall support of public-policies that limit the spread of COVID-19 (\u0251 = .81, M = 4.60, SD = .64). For both behavioral indices, higher scores reflected more engagement in the measured behavior. Higher scores in the policy support index reflected stronger overall support for public-policies that limit the spread of COVID-19. The data were negatively skewed. Means for both behaviors and policy support were on average very high indicating that participants overall supported health-related guidelines and public-policies.\nWithin each scale, the presentation order of items was randomized. The presentation\norder of all scales was randomized. Demographic questions were always presented last. At the end of each survey, participants responded to a simple attention check.\nData availability.

Since it is documented that conspiracy theories negatively affect vaccination intentions, these beliefs might become a crucial matter in the near future. We conducted two cross-sectional studies examining the relations between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, vaccine attitudes and intention to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available. In an exploratory study 1 (N = 409), two subdimensions of COVID19 conspiracy theories were robust predictors of negative attitude toward vaccine science. These results were replicated and extended in a pre-registered study 2 (N = 396). Moreover, we found that COVID19 conspiracy beliefs (among which, conspiracy beliefs about chloroquine), as well as a conspiracy mentality (i.e., predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories) negatively predicted participants\u2019 intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the future. Interestingly, none of the conspiracy beliefs referred directly to the dangers of the vaccines, nor to pharmaceutical companies. Last, we observed a strikingly high level of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Implications for the pandemic and potential responses are discussed based on existing literature.\nKeywords: Conspiracy beliefs; Conspiracy mentality; Vaccination; Covid-19; Chloroquine.\nsignificant social and political events and circumstances with claims of secret plots by two or more powerful actors\u201d (Douglas et al., 2019, p.4). These beliefs tend to appear in social crisis situations, which are times of heightened collective uncertainty and fear (van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). It has been proposed that these beliefs are responses to psychological needs (Douglas, Sutton, & Cichocka, 2017; Klein & Nera, 2020), and might constitute attempts to understand complex, otherwise hardly understandable and predictable threatening situations (Franks, Bangerter, & Bauer, 2013; van Prooijen, 2019). Hence, it is not surprising that conspiracy theories have flourished with the COVID-19 pandemic, and that medical misinformation spreads at a spectacular rate (Kouzy et al., 2020). Interestingly, conspiracy theories also surged during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic (Spinney, 2017) and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak (Bangerter et al., 2012).\nConspiracy theories may also influence the course of a crisis that initially favored\ntheir appearance. Indeed, conspiracy theories have consequences, notably in the health domain (Douglas, Sutton, Jolley, & Wood, 2015; Van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018). For example, exposure to anti-vaccines conspiracy theories decreases vaccination intention (Chen, Zhang, Young, Wu & Zhu, 2020; Jolley & Douglas, 2014). A Big Data analysis even suggests that distrust of vaccines, which is fuelled by conspiracy theories, may have had a negative impact on the worldwide measles immunization rate (Mavragani & Ochoa, 2018). Moreover, there is evidence that belief in conspiracy theories is associated with a generic belief system, so that the endorsement of some conspiracy theories is a powerful predictor of the endorsement of others, even those that are seemingly unrelated (Swami et al., 2011). As a result, authors have proposed that belief in conspiracy theories is symptomatic of a \u201cmonological belief system\u201d (Goertzel, 1994), or \u201cconspiracy mentality\u201d (Moscovici, 1987;\nbeliefs unrelated to vaccination (e.g., about JFK, Martin Luther King, the Moon Landing, \u2026) is also associated with negative attitudes toward vaccination (Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Oberauer, 2013).\nHowever, these studies were conducted before the sanitary crisis that the world is\ncurrently experiencing. Replicating past results in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is needed for at least two reasons. First, replication is necessary to establish the validity of frequentist statistical inferences (Krueger, 2001), which is the overwhelmingly dominant statistical approach in the psychological literature (Blanca, Alarc\u00f3n & Bono, 2018). Second, given that research in psychology is in a post-replication crisis era (Anvari & Lakens, 2018), advice from psychological science must be taken with great caution, especially in a situation such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Ijzerman et al., 2020). In this context, replication studies might strengthen social psychological knowledge (Rosenfeld, 2020) and constitute a safety baseline needed to build evidence-based policies and effective sanitary guidelines.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories may foster distrust\ntowards health authorities and their recommendations, which could potentially seriously impede efforts to put an end to the pandemic. In the short term, respect for containment behaviour guidelines (e.g., washing hands, social distancing, \u2026) is crucial to limit the spread of the pandemic, because the development of a treatment (including a vaccine) could take months (World Health Organization, 2020). However, in the long run, the development and distribution of a vaccine against COVID-19 might be a necessary step to put an end to the pandemic (Le et al., 2020). In this research, we examine how the endorsement of various COVID-19 conspiracy theories is predictive of two vaccine-related outcomes: attitude toward vaccination science (study 1 and 2), conceptually replicating Lewandowsky, Gignac, &\navailable (study 2), conceptually replicating Jolley & Douglas (2014).\nStudy 1\nIn Study 1, our goal was to explore the relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy\nbeliefs and attitudes toward vaccines science.

The study was conducted online and disseminated on\nFacebook, Twitter and Linkedin from March 19 (i.e., two days after the official beginning of the lockdown in France) to March 27. In total, 609 participants participated in the survey. Two hundred participants were removed from the data for not completing the questionnaire, failing the attention or seriousness checks, or being under 18 years old. The final sample was constituted of 409 participant (299 women and 3 \u201cother\u201d, Mage = 28.4 , SD = 11.4, min = 18, max = 72), which is above the threshold of N = 250 requested to achieve correlations stability (Sch\u00f6nbrodt & Perugini, 2013). For a given power of .90, this sample size enabled us to detect correlations of r = .16 with two tailed tests.\nMaterials. For each scale, participants were asked to give their response on a 5-point\nscale ranging from Strongly Disagree (coded 1) to Strongly Agree (coded 5).\nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories. 9 items were designed to capture the\nendorsement of some COVID-19 conspiracy theories currently popular in France (Conspiracy Watch, 2020). Given the wide variety of COVID-19 conspiracy theories (Van Bavel et al.,\nthreatening specified outgroups (three items, e.g. \u201cCOVID-19 is a bacteriological weapon used by the Chinese Communist Party to create panic in the West\u201d), conspiracy theories involving unspecified threatening (i.e., not referring to any foreign country outgroups (three items, e.g. \u201cIndustrials will use the coronavirus pandemic to justify higher prices and make a profit\u201d), and conspiracy theories involving members of the national ingroup (three items, e.g. \u201cThe French government uses the current pandemic to keep quiet significant reforms and challenges\u201d). Some authors have emphasized the theoretical and empirical relevance of distinguishing between national ingroup and outgroup conspiracy beliefs (e.g. Cichocka, Marchlewska, Golec de Zavala & Olechowski, 2015). Exploratory factor analysis revealed a two factor structure yielding a satisfactory fit, CFI = .95, TLI = .94, RMSEA = .09, one consisting of the three \u201cspecified outgroup\u201d and two \u201cunspecified outgroup\u201d items (\u03b1 = .88), and one combining the three \u201cingroup\u201d items and one \u201cunspecified outgroup\u201d (\u03b1 = .77). The two factors were correlated, r = .53, p < .001. Out of convenience, the dimensions were labeled \u201coutgroup conspiracy beliefs\u201d and \u201cingroup conspiracy beliefs\u201d, respectively. Only the \u201coutgroup\u201d dimension was significantly associated with political orientation, r = .25, p < .001, so that right wing participants endorsed these beliefs more than the left.\nAttitude toward vaccination. We translated into French the 5-items scale (1\nreverse coded) developed by Lewandowsky and colleagues (2013). We used three items due to length restrictions (e.g. \u201cI believe that vaccines are a safe and reliable way to help avert the spread of preventable diseases\u201d, \u03b1 = .83).\n(M/F/Other), and political orientation on a scale ranging from 1 (far left) to 9 (far right), with the possibility to tick \u201cother\u201d.\nResults and discussion\n[ insert table 1 ]\nDescriptive statistics and correlations between variables are displayed in table 1. We\ncarried out a hierarchical regression analysis to examine whether belief in the two dimensions of COVID-19 conspiracy theories predicted attitudes toward vaccination. Gender and age were controlled for at step 1, and COVID-19 conspiracy theories were introduced as independent variables at step 2. Since the two factors of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were substantially correlated both to each other and to attitudes toward vaccines, they were first tested as predictors in separate regressions. Attitudes towards vaccines were negatively predicted by both \u201coutgroup\u201d conspiracy theories, \u03b2 = -.45, 95% CI[-.36; -.54], t = -10.16, p < .001, and \u201cingroup\u201d conspiracy theories, \u03b2 = -.41, 95% CI[-.32; -.49], t = -10.16, p < .001. Finally, in a model integrating both dimensions as predictors, the effect remained significant for both the \u201cingroup\u201d factor, \u03b2 = -.23, 95% CI[-.13; -.33], t = -4.61, p < .001, and the \u201coutgroup\u201d factor, \u03b2 = -.33, 95% CI[-.22; -.43], t = -6.37, p < .001.\nHence, regardless of their specific content, the more participants endorsed COVID-19\nconspiracy beliefs, the less likely it was that they held a positive attitude toward vaccination. This result is congruent with past research showing that endorsement of conspiracy theories is related to negative attitudes toward vaccination (Lewandowsky et al., 2013).\nWe designed a second study to first replicate and strengthen results from study 1.\nSecond, we examined if COVID-19 conspiracy theories were also a negative predictor of the intention to be vaccinated against the disease in the future in an attempt to conceptually replicate Jolley and Douglas (2014). Third, we wanted to examine if these outcomes - attitude toward vaccination and intention to be vaccinated - were also negatively predicted by belief in conspiracy theories surrounding (hydroxy)chloroquine. Lamberty & Imhoff (2018) showed that the conspiracy mentality predicts a preference for alternative therapies over biomedical therapies. Chloroquine is a well-known anti-malarial drug has been promoted by the French infectious disease expert Didier Raoult as an effective treatment for COVID-19 (a claim which has not yet been confirmed by any empirical evidence), and a recent poll reports that 59% of the French population believes this treatment to be effective (IFOP, April 2020). Many chloroquine advocates argued that pharmaceutical companies want to discredit this treatment because it would jeopardize the potential profits of a future cure. The use of this drug to treat COVID-19 extends beyond French borders, as Donald Trump reported in midMay that he was taking hydroxychloroquine \"to protect himself\", despite warnings from the FDA and Facebook\u2019s deleting a video of Ja\u00efr Bolsonaro praising the drug (Reuters, May 8 & 18, 2020). Thus, following Van Bavel et al. (2020) who hypothesized that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs may be associated with a heightened interest in alternative remedies, we expected conspiracy beliefs to predict support for chloroquine treatment.\nSeveral previous research studies found a conspiracy mentality to be related to\nnegative attitudes toward vaccination (Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Oberauer, 2013) and with positive attitudes toward alternative remedies (Lamberty & Imhoff, 2018). Conspiracy\nintending individuals or groups for important societal phenomena\u201d (Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah, & Imhoff, 2014). It is conceptually distinct from conspiracy beliefs measured by means of inventories such as the COVID-19 and chloroquine conspiracy beliefs scale we used in the present studies. In Study 2, we measured conspiracy mentality to explore its relation to attitude toward vaccine science, attitude toward chloroquine and intention to vaccinate against COVID-19.\nWhereas Study 1 was exploratory, Study 2 aimed at testing a set of pre-registered\nhypotheses (see: https://osf.io/x43na/?view_only=531273ec519a4914a52bd5577f6c68f5). First, we hypothesized that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs would be a negative predictor of both pro-vaccination attitudes and vaccination intention. Moreover, we hypothesized that the same pattern would be observed with chloroquine conspiracy theories as a predictor. Finally, we hypothesized that pro-chloroquine attitude would be positively predicted by both COVID19 conspiracy theories and chloroquine conspiracy theories. Lastly, we included conspiracy mentality as an exploratory measure."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "Sampling and procedure. The study was disseminated online both among students\nwho were awarded course credit for answering, and on social media in order to diversify the sample, from April 17 to April 25. 469 participants participated in the study, out of which 396 remained (280 women and 6 \u201cother\u201d, Mage = 26.1, SD = 10.3, min = 18, max = 70) after excluding participants who did not comply to the exclusion criteria (cf pre-registration form). For a given power of .90, the sample size enabled us to detect correlations of r = .16 with two tailed tests.\ntheir response on a 5-point scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (coded 1) to Strongly Agree (coded 5). Attitudes and conspiracy theories about chloroquine, as well as vaccination intention, were pretested in an online preliminary study (N = 81, see the supplementary materials in the OSF repository for further details).\nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories. We used the same scale as in Study 1, and added\na conspiracy theory about the creation of the coronavirus by a famous French laboratory (\u201cCoronavirus has been created and patented by the Pasteur Institute in the early 2000s\u201d). Since both factors had similar relations to the outcomes in Study 1, all items were averaged into a single COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs score (\u03b1 = .84).\nChloroquine conspiracy theories. We designed a 6-items scale to assess\nparticipant beliefs in popular \u201cpro-chloroquine\u201d conspiracy theories (e.g. \u201cPharmaceutical industries, together with the government, avoid chloroquine based treatment diffusion to protect its financial interests\u201d, 88).\nConspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ). General conspiracy beliefs were\nmeasured with a validated French translation of the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ; Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah & Imhoff, 2013, translation by Lantian, Muller, Nurra, & Douglas, 2016), a 5-item measure designed to assess an individual's tendency to engage in general conspiracist ideation (e.g. \u201cI think that many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about\u201d, \u03b1 = .84) . Participants rated how true they thought a given item was on an 11-point scale (from 0% = \u2018Certainly not\u2019 to 100% = \u2018Certain\u2019).\ncoded) to measure participants\u2019 attitudes towards chloroquine medical treatment for COVID19 (e.g. \u201cThis treatment is to date the most effective one against COVID-19\u201d, \u03b1 = .88). Items were introduced by a paragraph introducing the question of chloroquine (\u201cWe hear a lot about the potential of a drug, chloroquine, to cure COVID-19 [...] what is your opinion on the topic?\u201d).\nAttitude toward vaccination. We used the full 5-items scale (e.g. \u201cVaccinations\nare one of the most significant contributions to public health\u201d, \u03b1 = .84) developed by Lewandowsky et al. (2013).\nVaccination intention. We adapted the single item used by Jolley and Douglas\n(2017), to assess behavioural intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. We asked participants what they would do if a COVID-19 vaccine were developed and validated by the health authorities, and they had the opportunity to be vaccinated next week. Participants answered on a scale ranging from 1 (\u201cI would definitely not be vaccinated under any circumstances\u201d) to 7 (\u201cI would be vaccinated without any hesitation\u201d).\nSociodemographic measures. Participants reported their age, gender\n(M/F/other), and political orientation.\nResults\n[Insert table 2]\nConfirmatory analyses. To test our hypotheses, we carried out hierarchical\nregression analyses that controlled for age and gender at step 1 (see table 3). As can be seen in the table, all of our hypotheses were corroborated, as COVID-19 and chloroquine\nintention to get vaccinated for the disease in the future. Last, both types of conspiracy beliefs positively predicted a pro-chloroquine attitude.\n[insert table 3]\nExploratory analyses. We also tested the extent to which conspiracy mentality,\nrather than belief in specific conspiracy theories, predicted the three outcomes (see Model 3 in Table 3). Conspiracy mentality had the same relations as COVID-19 and chloroquine conspiracy beliefs with vaccine attitudes, intention to be vaccinated, and pro-chloroquine attitudes.\nLast, we examined the extent to which the effect of conspiracy beliefs on the\noutcomes held when controlling for participants\u2019 conspiracy mentality. Note that COVID-19 and chloroquine conspiracy beliefs were treated as independent variables in separate models. When controlling for conspiracy mentality at Step 1 (as well as gender and age), vaccine attitudes were still positively predicted by COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, \u03b2 = -.33, 95% CI[-.42; -.22], t = -6.60, p < .001, and chloroquine conspiracy beliefs, \u03b2 = -.49, 95% CI[-.58; -.40], t = -10.74; p < .001. Intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 was still negatively predicted by COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, \u03b2 = -.20, 95% CI[-.31; -.11], t = -4.02, p < .001, and chloroquine conspiracy beliefs, \u03b2 = -.34, 95% CI[-.44; -.24], t = -6.84, p < .001. Last, the effect also remained significant for attitudes toward chloroquine, as they were still positively predicted by COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, \u03b2 = .19, 95%CI [.08; .29], t = 3.58, p < .001, and chloroquine conspiracy beliefs, \u03b2 = .58, 95% CI[.49; .67], t = 13.13, p < .001.\nFurthermore, contrary to our expectations, we did not find a strong ceiling effect for\nthe vaccination intention scale (M = 4.72; SD = 1.80). Strikingly, 22% of the sample (N =\nthat they would \u201crefuse vaccination without hesitation\u201d.\nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nOur results are congruent with past research and suggest that when a vaccine against\nCOVID-19 becomes available, conspiracy theories, regardless of their specific content, might become a serious sanitary issue. Also alarming is the fact in our sample, more than one participant out of five leaned toward refusal of the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine, even though it was described as having been approved by the health authorities (however, we did not specify if the vaccine was refunded by social security or not). This is congruent with data showing that the French population is extremely distrustful of vaccines (Ward, PerettiWatel, Bocquier, Seror & Verger, 2019). If a coronavirus vaccine were available, 26% of French people would refuse to be vaccinated according to a longitudinal study of a representative sample (Yamey et al., 2020). This proportion, measured for the fifth time since the start of the CoConel survey (27 March), remains very stable.\nIn our studies, COVID-19 conspiracy theories were substantially and negatively\nrelated to both positive attitudes toward vaccination science and intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the future. This relationship was observed for all the types of conspiracy beliefs considered, namely, conspiracy theories accusing foreign powers, conspiracy theories involving the French government, and conspiracy theories pertaining to chloroquine treatments and a conspiracy mentality.\nWe wish to emphasize that none of the conspiracy beliefs or conspiracy mentality\nitems referred to the dangers of vaccines. Hence, regardless of their content, belief in COVID19 conspiracy theories, as well as a conspiracy mentality, seem to be associated with a\ncongruent with the idea that conspiracy beliefs are underpinned by a generic belief system which is characterized by negative attitudes towards powerful groups (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014). It therefore conceptually replicates research conducted before the pandemic (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018; Jolley & Douglas, 2014; Lewandowsky et al., 2013).\nAlthough our samples were not representative of the French population, with an\noverrepresentation of female participants and those describing themselves as politically leftwing. However, according to a recent poll conducted on a French representative sample, conspiracy beliefs are higher among men and right-winged participants (Conspiracy Watch, 2019). Thus, one can infer that the results of the present studies might not be overestimated because of sampling error. Further research is however needed to assess the generalizability of our results to different contexts, especially in non-western culture, since the pandemic is a worldwide crisis, in order to determine whether the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and vaccination rejection of vaccination is Western-specific or has some kind of universality. Such a replication effort to delineate the consequence of conspiracy beliefs for vaccination will hopefully allow a fruitful development of remediation tools to cope with the harmful feature of the infodemic (Zarocostas, 2020).\nPrevious research has shown several ways to reduce the detrimental consequences of\nconspiracy beliefs. First, Jolley and Douglas (2017) tested ways to reduce directly the influence of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs on vaccination intention. Their findings indicate that anti-conspiracy arguments can restore hypothetical intention to vaccinate children, but only when the corrective message was presented before conspiratorial discourses. As for Chen and collaborators (2020), they observed that pre-existing knowledge about the HPV vaccine nullified the impact of exposure to anti-vaccines conspiracy theories on HPV vaccination\nthe corrective message beforehand for efficiently restoring vaccination intention. Their results indicate that both corrective messages presented before and after the conspiracy content helped in reducing the related beliefs. Altogether, these results emphasize the relevance of both proactive information and misinformation correction initiatives before the public is exposed to misinformation, and debunking efforts after exposure, to reduce the impact of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. To minimize the spread of misinformation, recent research indicates that nudging people, by simply asking them to think about whether or not information is true, is efficient in preventing them from sharing false information (Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang & Rand, 2020).\nBesides these concrete intervention possibilities, a more generic recommendation could\nbe to to develop interventions aiming at fostering analytical thinking (Swami & Barron, 2020; Swami, Voracek, Stieger, Tran & Furnham, 2014) and scientific reasoning (Cavojova, \u0160rol and Miku\u0161kov\u00e1, 2020). The former has been shown to reduce conspiracy beliefs, while the latter is associated with positive vaccines attitudes.\nIn conclusion, past literature as well as the present research, provide theoretical and\nempirical reasons not to underestimate the potential sanitary harm of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. While our research does not measure participants\u2019 actual behaviour, the robustness and magnitude of the reported results, as well as the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy as a global phenomenon in France, should encourage academics, policy makers, health authorities, and journalists to start working on concrete initiatives to tackle this issue.\nAnvari, F., & Lakens, D.

We examined whether irrational beliefs predict adherence to COVID-19 guidelines as well as susceptibility to such misinformation. Irrational beliefs were indexed by cognitive intuition, Type I error cognitive biases, COVID-19 knowledge overestimation, and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Participants (N=407) reported (a) how often they followed guidelines (e.g., handwashing), (b) how often they engaged in pseudoscientific practices (e.g., consuming garlic, colloidal silver), and (c) their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conspiratorial beliefs consistently predicted all three outcomes. Cognitive intuition and knowledge overestimation predicted lesser, while cognitive biases predicted greater adherence to guidelines. Cognitive intuition and cognitive biases predicted greater use of pseudoscientific practices. Our results highlight the irrational beliefs predictive of COVID-19 related health behaviors, with conspiracy theories proving to be the most detrimental.\nKeywords: COVID-19 Health Behavior, Pseudoscience, Conspiracy Theories, Cognitive Biases, Knowledge Overestimation\nPractices During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWith the developing coronavirus pandemic, societies are forced to introduce new\nmeasures to curb the infection rate. This means that, among other things, ordinary people are asked to adopt enhanced protective health behaviors, such as social distancing and frequent handwashing. However, along with these official recommendations, people are exposed to medical misinformation and unverified content pertaining to COVID-19, which have proliferated rapidly through social media (Depoux et al., 2020; Kouzy et al., 2020; Mian & Khan, 2020; Zarocostas, 2020). In fact, we are \u201cnot just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous\u201d (WHO, 2020). Pseudoscientific recommendations such as consuming garlic, drinking ginger tea or rinsing nose with saline, became so pervasive that the WHO (n.d.) had to officially debunk the claims about their effectiveness. Certain pseudoscientific practices (PSPs) are extremely dangerous \u2013 for example, more than 700 Iranians were reported dead of methanol poisoning falsely believing it was a miracle cure for COVID-19 (Associated Press, 2020). Another \u201cvictim\u201d of the infodemic is the COVID-19 vaccine, which is still in development. Even amid the pandemic, the topic of vaccination has provoked an online backlash (e.g., Mooney, 2020). Given the grave consequences of vaccination refusal, such as failure to reach herd immunity, it is important to understand why some people might be reluctant to get immunized.\nBoth adherence to official public health recommendations and the use of PSPs might be\nembedded in a set of irrational beliefs. We refer to irrational beliefs as an umbrella term that covers beliefs which lack a solid evidence base or defy principles of normative rationality (\u017de\u017eelj & Lazarevi\u0107, 2019). In this study, we explored whether people who differ in their predisposition\nfor COVID-19. More precisely, whether irrational beliefs such as cognitive intuition, susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases, overestimation of one\u2019s own COVID-19 knowledge, and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories predict adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, use of PSPs, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available. While cognitive intuition and cognitive biases can be seen as general, content-independent types of irrational beliefs, knowledge overestimation \u2013 a miscalibration error resting on a discrepancy between objectively measured and self-estimated knowledge \u2013 and belief in conspiracy theories \u2013 potential source of false knowledge about a particular subject \u2013 are content-laden irrational beliefs pertaining to a specific event or a class of events. The effect of each irrational belief on the chosen health behaviors was examined together with the three other types of irrational beliefs to discern its relative predictiveness.\nCognitive intuition is often assessed with the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick,\n2005), which consists of three items that lead most people to answer quickly and incorrectly. Previous research has shown that misleading intuitions predict paranormal beliefs (Pennycook et al., 2012; St\u00e5hl & van Prooijen, 2018) as well as religious beliefs (Pennycook, Fugelsang, & Koehler, 2015; Shenhav et al., 2012). In the health domain, cognitive intuition was related to beliefs about the effectiveness and self-reported use of complementary and alternative treatments both before (Browne et al., 2015; McPhetres & Pennycook, 2019; see also Lindeman, 2011) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Erceg et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020). However, recent findings on the relation between CRT performance and adherence to official COVID-19 guidelines are mixed \u2013 while some found a negative relation (Stanley et al., 2020), others failed to establish any link (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Erceg et al., 2020; Pennycook et\nlesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H1a), greater use of PSPs (H1b), and weaker intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (H1c).\nCognitive biases, as systematic departures from what is normatively defined rational\nbehavior, can be viewed as yet another broad category of irrational beliefs. Although they have been proven to be predictive of some paranormal (Bressan, 2002; Pennycook et al., 2012; \u0160rol, 2020; van Prooijen et al., 2017) and pseudoscientific beliefs (Pennycook, Cheyne et al., 2015; Redelmeier & Tversky, 1996; \u0160rol, 2020), cognitive biases remain underexplored in the domain of both PSPs and adherence to public health guidelines. The list of cognitive biases is considerably heterogeneous and ever evolving (Kahneman & Frederick, 2005; Pohl, 2004; Stanovich, 2009; Teovanovi\u0107 et al., 2015). Therefore, in our study, we opted to include only a subset based on a general tendency to make a type I error, that is, to make false conclusions on relations between unrelated phenomena. These biases included illusory correlation detection, base-rate neglect, gambler\u2019s fallacy, and hot-hand fallacy. We expected that a higher susceptibility to such cognitive biases would predict lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H2a), greater use of PSPs (H2b), and weaker intention to get vaccinated (H2c).\nKnowledge overestimation is typically calculated as a difference between self-estimated\nand objectively estimated knowledge on a certain subject (Ackerman et al., 2002; Harvey, 1997; Kleitman & Stankov, 2001; Kruger & Dunning, 1999; Stankov, 2000). Pennycook and colleagues (2017) showed that intuitive individuals tended to be more overconfident on the CRT, rating themselves as relatively reflective, despite their test scores showing otherwise. Thus, it is their non-reflexivity prevents them from recognizing their ignorance (see also Dunning, 2011; Kruger & Dunning, 1999). Disagreement between self-assessed and objectively assessed\n2004), which carries obvious negative implications for people\u2019s safety. In this study, we expected that higher levels of COVID-19 related knowledge overestimation would predict lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H3a), greater use of PSPs (H3b), and weaker intention to get vaccinated (H3c).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis and, as such, a fertile ground for\nconspiracy theories (Gon\u00e7alves-S\u00e1, 2020; van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). This aspect of the infodemic might be especially dangerous since medical conspiracy theories have been consistently associated with a range of risky health behaviors including less sunscreen use, not getting annual check-ups or vaccinations, less contraceptive use, and HIV medication nonadherence (e.g., Bogart et al., 2010; Jolley & Douglas, 2014; Oliver & Wood, 2014; Setbon & Raude, 2010; Thorburn & Bogart, 2005). However, recent studies examining the relation between belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and self-reported adherence to recommended behaviors have produced inconsistent results. While some found a relation with adherence to health guidelines (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020; see also Swami & Barron, 2020), others did not (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; see also Plohl & Musil, 2020). Furthermore, conspiracy theories might be predictive of some, but not other types of recommended protective behaviors \u2013 for example, believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was related to less social-distancing but unrelated to personal-hygiene behaviors (Pummerer & Sassenberg, 2020). As for pseudoscientific practices, it was shown that people more prone to conspiratorial thinking were more likely to endorse claims related to the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medical treatments in general (Lamberty & Imhoff, 2018; Lobato et al., 2014; Pennycook, Cheyne et al., 2015) and that they reported greater use of PSPs to prevent contracting coronavirus (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020;\nconverging evidence suggesting that conspiracy theories are predictive of PSPs, more studies are needed to explore their influence on adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. We expected that stronger beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories would predict lesser adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H4a), greater use of PSPs (H4b), and a weaker intention to get vaccinated (H4c).\nIn sum, the present study builds upon emerging research on evidence and non-evidence\nbased COVID-19 related recommendations by examining the predictiveness of different irrational beliefs for COVID-19 related health behaviors in a single design. We will examine if both content-independent (i.e., cognitive intuition and susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases) and content-laden irrational beliefs (i.e., overestimation of one\u2019s own COVID-19 knowledge and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories) are relevant for adherence to official COVID-19 guidelines, use of PSPs, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.\nMethods"}, {"heading": "Sample and Procedure", "text": "We recruited a total of 754 participants via a snowball procedure and through social\nnetworks (Facebook and Viber groups), between April 10 and April 22. The final sample (N = 407) included participants who did all of the following: fully completed the questionnaires, accurately responded to all three attention check items, and confirmed that they did not search for information online while completing the questionnaires. The mean age of participants was 34.88 years (SD = 12.81). Females were overrepresented in the sample (76.9%), as were participants with higher education: about 0.5% of participants completed elementary school, 42.5% completed high-school, 30.2% completed undergraduate studies, and 26.3% completed graduate studies. The questionnaire was administered in Serbian language.\navailable at https://osf.io/qk9nf/."}, {"heading": "Instruments and Variables", "text": "Cognitive Intuition was assessed via the CRT (Frederick, 2005), consisting of three items\nwhich cue a fast but incorrect response (we initially tried out three additional tasks, but decided to use the ones in the original version). One example of an item is the following question: \u201cA racket and a ball cost 1100 RSD [Serbian currency] in total. The racket costs 1000 RSD more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\u201d. Although the correct answer is \u201c50 RSD\u201d approximately 40% of participants answered \u201c100 RSD\u201d. A total score was calculated as a sum of intuitive responses (\u03b1 = .63).\nType I Error Cognitive Biases were measured with six heuristics-and-biases tasks which\ntap into peoples\u2019 tendency to erroneously recognize relations between unrelated phenomena. They were represented with two covariation detection problems as measures of illusory correlation (Smedslund, 1963), two base rate problems (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and two probability judgment tasks measuring hot-hand fallacy (Gilovich et al., 1985) and gambler\u2019s fallacy (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). We calculated the total score as the average of biased responses across tasks (\u03b1 = .52).\nBelief in COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories Scale was developed for the purpose of this\nstudy. It consisted of 13 items representing most popular conspiracy theories circulating in digital media and conversations on social networks (e.g., \u201c5G electromagnetic field exposure played a role in the coronavirus pandemic\u201d). Response options ranged from 1 (Completely Disagree) to 5 (Completely Agree). The scale was highly reliable (\u03b1 = .90). We averaged responses for the 13 items to form a total score.\nstandardized scores of subjectively estimated and objectively assessed knowledge. Subjective estimation of knowledge relating to COVID-19 was represented with a single item (\u201cHow would you rate your knowledge about the new coronavirus?\u201d) on a scale ranging from 1 (Insufficient) to 5 (Excellent). Objective knowledge was assessed using a previously developed test (Lep et al., 2020), which consisted of nine true or false statements relating to COVID-19 (e.g., \u201cThe coronavirus is transmitted through respiratory droplets\u201d); the total score was summed and ranged between zero and nine.\nAdherence to COVID-19 Guidelines was measured with 12 items based on the official\nWHO and the Serbian Ministry of Health COVID-19 guidelines (\u03b1 = .69). Five items related to newly introduced (e.g., social distancing) or enhanced (e.g., thorough handwashing) health behaviors, in the previous two weeks, rated on a scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). Additional seven items referred to behaviors recommended to be avoided during the outbreak (e.g., visiting other households or attending social gatherings). Participants rated the frequency of these behaviors in the previous two weeks by entering a number. These seven items were multiplied by -1 so that higher scores would always correspond to greater adherence to recommended practices. To convert into a common metric, all item scores were standardized. To handle outliers, z-values above 3.29 were winsorized. A total score was calculated as an average of all 12 items.\nUse of PSPs related to COVID-19 was assessed via a 12-item scale created for the\npurpose of this study (\u03b1 = .73). Five items were based on the list of common myths indicated on the WHO website (WHO, n.d.), while the remaining seven were based on PSPs against COVID19 commonly reported in digital media outlets. Participants rated how often they used PSPs in\nfrom 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). We averaged the participants\u2019 responses for all 12 items to create a total score.\nVaccination intention was assessed by asking participants to rate their willingness to\nreceive a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available at that time. The scale ranged from 1 (Definitely would not) to 5 (Definitely would).\nResults\nThe dataset (https://osf.io/cpe5t/) and analysis code (https://osf.io/5rabw/) are available at\nthe OSF.\nTable 1 shows descriptives for health related behaviors during the pandemic. Frequencies\nregarding adherence to COVID-19 guidelines indicate that 76.7% (n = 312) of the participants reported adhering to at least three out of five newly introduced or enhanced health behaviors often or very often. As for behaviors that were recommended to be avoided (e.g., visiting other households), as much as 27.8% (n = 113) of participants reported always avoiding all of them. In terms of use of PSPs, responses were more diverse. While 67.6% (n = 275) of participants reported having used at least one PSP often or very often, 11.3% (n = 46) had rarely or never used any of the listed PSP. Finally, although 49.1% (n = 200) of participants reported they would definitely or probably receive a COVID-19 vaccine, a significant percent (26.8%; n = 109) of participants stated they definitely or probably would not.\nDescriptive statistics and bivariate correlations between all measured variables are\npresented in Table 1. Regarding content-independent beliefs, even though participants did not produce many intuitive responses on the CRT, they showed moderate susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases. As for content-laden irrational beliefs, participants moderately endorsed\n191. Eight out of twelve zero order correlation coefficients between four types of irrational beliefs and the three health behaviors were statistically significant (ps < .05), all in the expected direction.\n[Table 1 about here]\nTo further test the hypotheses, that is, to discern the predictive power of a single variable\nin the set when the effects of others were controlled for, we ran three multiple regression models with adherence, PSPs, and vaccination intention as outcome variables. Cognitive intuition, susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases, Overestimation of COVID-19 knowledge, and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories served as predictors (see Table 2).\nThe model predicting adherence to COVID-19 guidelines had relatively low explanatory\npower (F(4,402) = 7.78, R2 = .07, p < .001). As expected, cognitive intuition, overestimation of COVID-19 related knowledge, and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, negatively predicted adherence to COVID-19 guidelines (H1a, H3a, and H4a respectively). Contrary to our hypothesis (H2a), susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases positively predicted Adherence to COVID-19 guidelines.\nWhen it comes to use of PSPs, susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases,\noverestimation of COVID-19 related knowledge, belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories significantly contributed to the model, explaining 14% of the variance (F(4,402) = 16.89, R2 = .14, p < .001). This suggested that those with more biased thinking, knowledge overestimation and beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories were more likely to follow pseudoscientific advice, which is in line with H3b, and H4b, but not with H2b.\n1 Since scores on all variables had a non-normal distribution, we re-ran all the analyses on normalized scores using Blom\u2019s transformation. Results of the analyses on normalized scores are detailed at https://osf.io/8nfz2/.\nvariance, that is, 29% (F(4,402) = 41.89, R2 = .29, p < .001). In line with H4c, belief in COVID19 conspiracy theories negatively predicted COVID-19 vaccination intentions, suggesting that those endorsing COVID-19 conspiracy theories may be less likely to get vaccinated when a vaccine becomes available. Contrary to our expectations (H2c), we observed that susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases positively contributed to the model, suggesting that those that were more prone to cognitive biases may be more likely to get vaccinated against the virus. To make sure that the inclusion of a vaccine-related conspiracy in the total score (i.e., \u201cOne should be careful when a vaccine against coronavirus is developed because no one knows what they will inject in us\u201d) did not artificially increase the predictivity of the model, we conducted a sensitivity analysis omitting this question. This model accounted for 26% of the variance (F(4,402) = 35.2, p < .001), corroborating the robustness of the relation between Beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and COVID-19 vaccination intentions.\nAcross all regression models, Belief in COVID-19 conspiracies and type I error cognitive\nbiases were the most consistent predictors of health behaviors related to COVID-19.\n[Table 2 about here]\nTo gain more insight about the relations between outcome variables, and to make sure\nthat the significant regression models were not the result of p-value inflation, we conducted a canonical correlation analysis, a multivariate type of the general linear model (Thompson, 2005). The results are presented in Table 3, suggesting that two out of three canonical correlations were significant.\n[Table 3 about here]\nconspiracy theories and, to a much lesser extent, susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases and cognitive intuition, on the one hand, and weaker COVID-19 vaccination intentions and greater use of PSPs, on the other. These results indicate that vaccination hesitancy and use of PSPs have relations with intuitive and biased thinking and belief in conspiracy theories. This component explained more than 10% of the variance across the two sets of variables. Moreover, the proportions of explained variance support the examination of irrational beliefs as predictors of health behaviors.\nThe second canonical function reflects the relations between a greater susceptibility to\ntype I error cognitive biases and lesser COVID-19 knowledge overestimation, on the one hand, and a higher rate of acceptance of all available preventive practices, on the other. This suggests that following all types of health practices is related to a greater susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases and lesser COVID-19 knowledge overestimation. However, since this component explained only 3% of the variance across the variable sets, this finding should be interpreted with caution.\nDiscussion\nWe found that health behaviors related to COVID-19 \u2013 adherence to COVID-19\nguidelines, use of PSPs, and intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19 \u2013 were all predicted by irrational beliefs to some degree.\nBelief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was the most consistent predictor of each type\nof health behavior. This is in line with previous findings showing positive relations between conspiratorial thinking and use of PSPs (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Oliver & Wood, 2014), nonadherence to medical or public health recommendations (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020; Oliver &\nstrengthens the view of conspiratorial beliefs as a part of \u201ccontaminated mindware\u201d (Rizeq et al., 2020; Stanovich et al., 2016) or unwarranted beliefs detrimental to one\u2019s rational thought process, thus influencing decisions that may lead to detrimental health outcomes. In our study, the relation between conspiratorial beliefs and unwillingness to get vaccinated against COVID19 was particularly strong. Importantly, this relation held even the total score in this model deliberately excluded vaccination conspiracy theory, leaving instead a number of theories about the origin of the virus and political abuse of the health crisis that do not necessarily lead to vaccine refusal. For example, it may be possible that a person believes that the virus was fabricated in a laboratory, but still considers it dangerous and is willing to protect themselves with a vaccine. Our data, however, show that even such beliefs are related to a weaker vaccination intention. This could be due to a more general assumption common to both phenomena: that key information, such as the truth about the harmfulness of vaccines or about the source of pandemic, is hidden from the general public and that one cannot trust official sources (Wood et al., 2012; Luki\u0107 et al., 2019).\nOther irrational beliefs were also somewhat predictive of the health behaviors. While\nType I error cognitive biases were directly related (zero order correlation) only to PSPs, after controlling for other irrational beliefs in the regression analyses, they positively predicted each health behavior. This seemingly surprising finding may be due to the cost asymmetry between false-positive and false-negative errors (Haselton & Buss, 2000) particularly in critical situations such as a global pandemic. More precisely, the cost of a type II error \u2013 refraining from preventive practices that may result in an avoidable COVID-19 infection \u2013 could be perceived as higher than the cost of a type I error \u2013 following ineffective practices. Thus, the susceptibility\nassociated with opting to uncritically pursue any health recommendation.\nWe also found that, to a lesser degree, those that rely on cognitive intuition and follow\ntheir \u201cgut feelings\u201d may be more susceptible to pseudoscientific advice as well as being more relaxed when it comes to following evidence-based recommendations. Finally, those who overestimated their COVID-19 knowledge reported lesser engagement in recommended behavior, but were also somewhat less prone to using PSPs.\nBoth content-laden and content-independent irrational beliefs were to some degree\npredictive of COVID-19 health behaviors. Conspiratorial beliefs regarding COVID-19, as a content-laden irrational belief, was most strongly tied to all three types of behaviors; however, susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases also proved to be significant for all three outcomes, after controlling for other predictors. This is important, as the effects of content-independent irrational beliefs may have the potential to be generalized to various types of behaviors, beyond the pandemic. However, the relative power of content-independent beliefs to predict health outcomes, in comparison to content-laden ones, remains to be studied further.\nOf note, adherence to COVID-19 guidelines was the most weakly predicted health\nbehavior. A relatively modest predictive power of irrational beliefs on adherence to COVID-19 guidelines might be due to ceiling effects that have likely resulted from lockdown policies and campaigns (e.g., #StayAtHome), both world-wide and locally. This has left people with fewer behavioral choices, particularly with regards to social distancing. On the other hand, engaging in PSPs was optional and may have permitted greater influence of intrinsic dispositions, including irrational beliefs, on health behaviors. Similarly, at the time of data collection, there was no vaccine developed against COVID-19, meaning that no vaccination policies were in place. In\nThis may have led to a greater influence of intrinsic dispositions on the outcome.\nStrengths, limitations, and suggestions for future work\nOur study adds to the existing literature in several ways. First, we put together a\ncomprehensive battery of irrational beliefs to predict health behaviors, which allowed us to compare their predictive power. Second, we examined different types of health behaviors pertaining to evidence-based and non-evidence-based recommendations related to the COVID19 pandemic. In addition, the instruments we developed for their assessment proved to be discriminative and reliable. Third, the fact that the data were collected during the peak of the pandemic (Serbia Coronavirus, n.d.) adds to their validity.\nSeveral limitations merit comment. The fact that only behaviors included in official\nguidelines were assessed, precluded other preventive behaviors, such as wearing masks or gloves. Importantly, the guidelines were supported by lockdown policies, which may have reduced the variability and influence of irrational beliefs on these behaviors. In addition, the health behaviors were self-reported. Future studies could examine observed behaviors (e.g., assessing social distancing using location tracking apps) to increase the confidence attached to the current findings. This study addressed the question of content overlap between predictors (irrational beliefs) and criteria (health behaviors). To further disentangle the differential effects of content-laden and content-independent beliefs, following studies need to include more diverse representatives of both types of beliefs and compare their relative contribution. This may be useful to inform future interventions targeting beliefs \u2013 for example, the relative importance of targeting cognitive belief systems versus health communication regarding a particular content.\nnegatively skewed indicating that the test was easy for the participants. This was likely due to heavy media coverage of COVID-19 and that people were continuously learning about the virus. Nonetheless, this and other assessments included in our study revealed meaningful relations between irrational beliefs, namely conspiratorial thinking, and relevant health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe rapid proliferation of COVID-19 related misinformation through social media\n(Depoux et al., 2020; Kouzy et al., 2020; Mian & Khan, 2020; Zarocostas, 2020) may have the potential to substantially impact health outcomes. We propose that future interventions should focus on conspiracy theories, which, in our study, were detrimental for a range of preventive health behaviors. Some of the promising interventions to counter science misinformation and conspiracy theories include presenting people with factual corrections (e.g., Porter et al., 2018; Porter et al., 2019), combining factual corrections with personal/social narratives (Lazi\u0107 & \u017de\u017eelj, under review), \u201cinoculating\u201d them by presenting anti-conspiracy information prior to conspiracy theories (e.g., Jolley & Douglas, 2017), and exposing misleading argumentation techniques (e.g., Roozenbeek & van der Linden, 2019)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "A starting point for social and behavioral sciences to mitigate the effects of global\npandemics (Van Bavel et al., 2020) is to understand the psychological underpinnings of health behaviors during the course of the crisis. Our study highlights that people prone to a particular set of irrational beliefs are less likely to follow official COVID-19 guidelines and more likely to engage in PSPs. Once again, and strongly corroborating our hypotheses, conspiracy theories have shown to pose a serious threat to public health \u2013 one that demands future attention to\nintuition and COVID-19 knowledge overestimation was less robust, but mostly in line with initial expectations. Somewhat unexpectedly, susceptibility to type I error cognitive biases predisposed people to engage in any type of preventive behavior, whether it is evidence-based or not. Together, the findings show that irrational beliefs are an important factor to consider when tailoring behavioral health policies, especially in a global health crisis.\nAckerman, P. L., Beier, M.

Health-related beliefs included: the anti-vaccination attitudes, conspiracy beliefs\nrelated to the COVID-19 disease, and some generic epistemically suspect beliefs related to\nhealth. Scientific reasoning predicted generic pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs related\nto health and also conspiracy beliefs related specifically to COVID-19. Crucially, scientific\nreasoning was a stronger independent predictor of unfounded beliefs (including anti-\nvaccination attitudes) than general analytic thinking, however, its role in the health-related\nbehaviors was more modest.\nKey words: scientific reasoning, analytic thinking, conspiracy beliefs related to COVID-19,\nanti-vaccination attitudes, preventive behavior, COVID-19\nreasoning not only for dealing with global challenges, such as climate change and its consequences but also for their informed decision-making related to consumer behavior or health. But never has the importance of scientific reasoning been so crucial as in the current crisis launched by the COVID-19 outbreak in more than 100 countries.\nPeople are presented with statistics, medical terms, new insights both by experts and nonexperts from various fields ranging from virology to economics, they are more than ever invested in watching closely the process of finding the cure/vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus, all in the context of great uncertainty. However, as always in times of crisis, many false and ambivalent information occur and people need to sift through them and make important decisions regarding their safety and safety of others. It has been already shown that scientific reasoning is linked to lesser susceptibility to cognitive biases and unfounded beliefs (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020) and lower belief in the efficacy of alternative medicine (\u010cavojov\u00e1 & Ersoy, 2019b). Building on this line of work, we examined the effect of scientific reasoning on a broader range of health-related behavior and beliefs in the context of the recent COVID19 outbreak.\nScientific reasoning vs. knowledge of science\nFirst, we should make clear that by scientific reasoning we do not mean simply having more science knowledge. Rather, we use the term scientific reasoning to signify the ability to understand methods and principles of scientific inquiry and skills required to formulate, test and revise theories and reflect the process of generating evidence; or, more specifically, as the \u201capplication of the methods or principles of scientific inquiry to reasoning or problem-solving situations\u201c (Zimmerman, 2007, p. 173, see also Koslowski, 1996; Kuhn & Franklin, 2007; Wilkening & Sodian, 2005). In this sense, scientific reasoning is a subset of critical thinking\nscientists only. Although the majority of people will not earn their living by doing science, to be scientifically literate (i.e. to be able to reason scientifically) is beneficial when we want to properly function in society (Trefil, 2008). This is true especially now when we need to distinguish reliable information related to the outbreak of COVID-19 from disinformation and engage in effective preventive measures against it.\nAlthough studies directly examining the role of scientific reasoning and scientific literacy in actual health-decisions are rather rare, there is ample evidence that people with better scientific reasoning hold beliefs more consistent with the scientific consensus. For example, more scientifically literate people were more likely to believe that vaccines and genetically modified foods are safe; to believe in human evolution; or to believe in the Big Bang theory (Drummond & Fischhoff, 2017).\nA positive relationship between scientific reasoning and holding more beliefs consistent with scientific consensus may be because people who are interested in science, have generally more knowledge about science. Research, indeed, suggests that this is the case. People with better scientific reasoning tend to have also more science-related knowledge (Dieckmann & Johnson, 2019; Downs et al., 2008; Drummond & Fischhoff, 2017; Kayg\u0131s\u0131z & G\u00fcrkan, 2018). On the other hand, the relationship between knowledge of science facts (e.g. to know how much time it takes for Earth to revolve around the Sun, or what is an atom) and scientific understanding (e.g. to understand the principles of gravity and how they apply to the movement of planetary bodies) is not so straightforward \u2013 while the two are correlated, their correlations are modest at best (Johnson, 2003). This also suggests that assessing science understanding only through the knowledge-based tests has its limits. This issue was addressed recently by Drummon and Fischhof (2017) who devised the Scientific Reasoning Scale (SRS), consisting of eleven short scenarios designed to measure a person\u2019s ability to evaluate\nhave good psychometric properties and it was successfully used and validated also in nonEnglish speaking countries (Ba\u0161n\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., n.d.; Kayg\u0131s\u0131z & G\u00fcrkan, 2018).\nMore importantly for the present study \u2013 besides having more general scientific knowledge, people with better scientific reasoning could also better interpret numerical information regarding the effectiveness and side effects of certain drugs (Drummond & Fischhoff, 2017). It suggests that people with better scientific reasoning do not simply know more scientific facts or conform more to scientific consensus, but that they can use the probabilistic and numerical information to make more informed choices about over-counter medication or health-related advice.\nIn a recent study, Drummond and Fischhoff (2019) found that priming scientific reasoning leads participants to evaluate evidence more critically. In the follow-up study they included another condition \u2013 priming general analytical thinking \u2013 but this time neither priming scientific reasoning nor priming analytical skills had any effect on myside bias. They concluded that when we want people to engage critically in evaluating evidence, it is not enough to rely on their general critical thinking skills, but their specific knowledge about scientific methodology is needed. Thus, in this paper, we will measure participants\u2019 level of analytic thinking as well as their scientific reasoning and we expect that scientific reasoning will be a better predictor of various health-related behaviors and beliefs.\nScientific reasoning and unfounded beliefs\nUnderstanding science by having more knowledge and/or better scientific reasoning skills is also reflected in more positive attitudes toward science and less epistemically suspect beliefs, i.e. paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific beliefs (e.g. Pennycook et al., 2015; \u0160rol, n.d.). This was shown in two studies using the SRS, in which scientific reasoning correlated\nsuspect beliefs (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020). Although the connection between epistemically suspect beliefs and health-related behavior might not be visible, holding more unfounded and anti-science beliefs, especially those related to pseudoscientific treatments, can lead to poorer health choices. Wrong choices related to health care can have fatal consequences, as documented by health-related complications and deaths of children when parents refused vaccination and antibiotics (Liliana Barbacariu, 2014; Saint-Victor & Omer, 2013), when conventional treatment was refused or delayed (Bostr\u00f6m & R\u00f6ssner, 1990; S. B. Johnson et al., 2018), or when downright harmful treatment was chosen (Farrington et al., 2018; Robbins, 2010). On the other hand, people with higher scientific reasoning skills believe less in the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine and use it less often (\u010cavojov\u00e1 & Ersoy, 2019a).\nThe more obvious connection between scientific reasoning and health-related behavior is visible when we look at vaccination as one example of health-related behavior. Scientific reasoning had a small positive effect on three facets of vaccine acceptance (Sarathchandra et al., 2018).\nThus, although we expect that scientific reasoning will predict attitudes toward vaccination in our sample, we were interested also in another related question. There is a very low percentage of people who get voluntarily vaccinated against preventable diseases, such as seasonal flu (about 5 % in Slovakia), despite it being covered by health insurance companies, so we wondered whether people will change their attitudes toward vaccination. Therefore, in this study, we also examine the question, whether people with negative attitudes toward vaccination would be eager to take vaccination against COVID-19 if it were available.\nSimilarly to the concept of science literacy, Zeyer (2012) introduces the concept of health literacy, which addresses the connection between science understanding and health-related behaviors more directly. He claims that health literacy is inherently knowledge-based and that this reveals a strong link between scientific literacy and health literacy. Neter and Brainin (2019) examined the relationship between health literacy and health outcomes in 80 published studies and they found a consistent negative association between health literacy and mortality, a positive association between health literacy and medication management/adherence, and other diverse health-related behaviors such as physical exercise, vaccinations, cancer screening, self-care, appointment keeping, or using an inhaler.\nBased on this indirect evidence related to scientific reasoning and health-related behavior, we expected that people with higher scientific reasoning will engage in generally recommended preventive behavior and there will be few differences between preventive behaviors during the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and preventive behavior against seasonal diseases, such as flu. This was based on the reasoning that generic preventive measures, such as eating more fruits and vegetables and exercising, are generally valid as increasing the immune system and that people with better scientific reasoning would understand the necessity of a healthy lifestyle better. We also expected that scientific reasoning will predict engaging in less questionable preventive behaviors, such as drinking strong alcohol as a disinfectant due to a better understanding of the working of the immune system and the spreading of disease. Lastly, we expected that scientific reasoning will not predict recommended preventive measures, as these we pushed forward by authorities and thus following them was likely influenced more by contextual factors irrespective of scientific reasoning.\nrange of health-related beliefs and behaviors over and above the general analytic thinking ability. We included beliefs and behaviors related to health in general as well as some that were specifically related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Among health-related beliefs, we examined the attitudes toward vaccinations, conspiracy beliefs related to the origin, spread and potential cure of the COVID-19 disease, and some generic epistemically suspect beliefs related to health. Furthermore, we asked participants about the preventive measures they take regarding the current COVID-19 disease threat and asked them whether they took the same preventive measures in the past against the common flu. Based on the evidence outlined above, we expected scientific reasoning to be a better predictor of these beliefs and behaviors that general analytic thinking ability.\nMethods"}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The data were collected as part of a larger study on beliefs and behaviors related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. In a previous study (\u0160rol et al., 2020), we focused on feelings of anxiety and lack of control regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and their relationship to an increased endorsement of various epistemically suspect beliefs. Neither scientific reasoning nor healthrelated behaviors \u2013 which are the focus of the present study \u2013 were analyzed there. The present sample consisted of 976 participants who filled in the online survey created in Qualtrics either through a query on social media or via an invitation from a participant recruitment agency.\nHowever, as 193 of these participants did not pass attention check controls, their data were therefore omitted from all further analyses. The final sample consisted of 783 participants (417 female, 363 male, 3 preferred not to disclose their gender) who filled in the questionnaire\nbetween 13th and 22nd March 20201. Participants were aged between 18 \u2013 84 years (M = 42.00, SD = 16.84).

The rest of the sample either finished high school without a diploma (4.7%) or attainted only elementary education (2.6%)."}, {"heading": "Materials", "text": "Descriptive statistics and internal consistency estimates for all materials can be found in Table 1.\nScientific reasoning and general analytic thinking ability.\nScientific reasoning. Scientific reasoning abilities were measured using items based on the Scientific reasoning scale by Drummond and Fischhoff (2017). For the present study, we used six items that were developed by Ba\u0161n\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. ( n.d.) and which measured these six validity threats: blinding, causations vs correlation, confounding variables, construct validity, control group, ecological validity, random assignment to conditions. For example, the \u201ccausation vs correlation\u201d item was about increasing birth rate (A researcher wants to find out how to increase natality. He asks for statistical information and sees that there are more children born in cities that have more hospitals. This finding implies that building new hospitals will increase the birth rate of a population. Agree/Disagree). This shorter version of SRS was used because it was shown to be more reliable in the Slovak population than the original 11-item SRS (Ba\u0161n\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., n.d.).\n1 During this period, there were 32 \u2013 185 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Slovakia. On the 16th of March the Slovak government initiated harsh preventive actions which gradually started to take place. These included limiting all personal foreign travel, compulsory quarantine for people who came from abroad, closing of schools and most non-essential shops and services.\nevoked compelling but wrong intuitive responses. Three of the items were taken from the original Cognitive reflection test by Frederick (2005), but we changed their content to reduce the possibility that participants were already exposed to the items and knew their correct answers. The other three items were taken from the verbal version of the Cognitive reflection test (Sirota et al., 2019). The items of the cognitive reflection test are often used as indicators of the analytic thinking ability (e.g. Bronstein, Pennycook, Bear, Rand, & Cannon, 2018; Pennycook & Rand, 2019). The sum of correct answers on the six items was used as a measure of participant\u2019s analytic thinking ability."}, {"heading": "Health-related beliefs:", "text": "Coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Participants were given 10 statements that described various conspiracy theories or typical conspiracist ideas concerning the outbreak, spread, and potential cure of the new coronavirus. The average rating on a 5-point scale on these ten items was used as the endorsement of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs.\nCoronavirus-specific knowledge. Besides coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs, we were interested in whether participants will be able to distinguish between true and false information about COVID-19, so we also included eight knowledge items (4 true, 4 false). These items were intermixed with the coronavirus-specific conspiracy belief statements and participants responded to them using the same 5-point scale. We calculated the average rating on four true knowledge items and the average rating on four false knowledge items.\nGeneric health-related epistemically suspect beliefs. To measure the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect beliefs, we selected 8 items for mostly pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs related to health from a questionnaire of epistemically suspect beliefs by \u0160rol (n.d.). The items dealt with the effectiveness of various alternative treatments (homeopathy, reiki, oral use\npharmaceutical industry. Participants were asked to rate their agreement with the statements on a 5-point scale. We used average rating on the eight items as a measure of generic health-related epistemically suspect beliefs.\nAnti-vaccination attitudes. Ten items were used to measure negative attitudes toward vaccination. Six were adapted from Wallace et al. (2019) and four items were constructed by the authors. Participants indicated their agreement on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores indicated stronger anti-vaccination attitudes.\nSelf-reported behavior related to health:\nVaccination. We asked participants whether they are vaccinated against the flu. 8.4 % indicated that they were vaccinated, 10.6 % indicated that they intended to get vaccination but did not manage to do it before it was too late and 81 % of participants were not vaccinated. Because of the low percentage of vaccinated participants, for the further analyses, we joined into one category both those who received flu shots and those who intended to get flu shots. Also, participants had to indicate whether they would get a vaccination against the new coronavirus if the vaccination had been available, on a 5-point scale (1 = definitely yes, 5 = definitely no).\nPreventive behavior. We measured preventive behavior by two sets of questions. First, we asked participants to indicate what preventive measures they take specifically against the coronavirus and then we asked them to indicate what preventive measures they take usually against seasonal diseases, such as flu. Each set contained the same 19 behaviors (washing hands for at least 20 seconds, coughing into tissues, disinfecting surfaces, etc.) and participants answered either \u201cyes\u201d (1) or \u201cno\u201d (0). Based on the participants\u055a answers we calculated two scores for both coronavirus-specific and general preventive behaviors in this\nhome and, if possible, work from home), 9 items for non-standard or scientifically unfounded measures (e.g. I drink at least 52% alcohol as a disinfectant). The percentage of individual preventive behaviors that our participants engaged in are in the Appendix A.1.\nThe relationships among the main variables in the study are first examined through the correlation analysis. We inspect the correlations between scientific reasoning, analytic thinking, epistemically suspect beliefs (specifically related to coronavirus, as well as more general healthrelated unfounded beliefs), anti-vaccination attitudes, and preventive behaviors (recommended, as well as unfounded). Next, we present multiple linear regression analyses conducted to test whether the outcome variables (beliefs related to health, preventive behavior) can be predicted by scientific reasoning over and above general analytic thinking ability.\ncognitive predictors (scientific reasoning and analytic thinking) correlate with health-related beliefs and knowledge and with self-reported health-related behavior.\nCorrelations between scientific reasoning & analytic thinking and health-related beliefs & knowledge\nOur main interest was in correlations of scientific reasoning with our outcome variables. As expected, scientific reasoning correlated negatively with coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs, general health-related unfounded beliefs, and anti-vaccination attitudes. The same pattern of negative correlations occurred with general analytic thinking, however, all observed\nbetween scientific reasoning and accepting false facts about coronavirus as true, and the same pattern was observed with analytic thinking. On the other hand, correctly accepting coronavirus facts as true correlated positively only with scientific reasoning, albeit weakly, while there was no correlation with analytic thinking. Generally, people were able to correctly identify the most facts about coronavirus, as reflected in descriptive scores in Table 1, but the stronger correlation with scientific reasoning may suggest that more scientifically sophisticated people looking for more detailed information about coronavirus and thus were able to better recognize facts from false information.\nCorrelations between scientific reasoning & analytic thinking and self-reported healthrelated behavior\nScientific reasoning also correlated negatively with non-standard preventive measures both against coronavirus and flu to a similar extent (r = \u2013.21 and r = \u2013.28, respectively), but it also correlated negatively with recommended measures against both against coronavirus and flu, although in this case, the correlation was much stronger for flu than coronavirus (r = \u2013.30, r = \u2013.08, respectively). Again, correlations with analytic thinking showed a similar pattern with only one exception \u2013 there was no correlation between analytic thinking and recommended measures against coronavirus.\nNegative correlations between scientific reasoning and preventive behavior were surprising, especially in the case with flu. However, the reason for these results is probably the period2 when data were collected. The data collection was launched on March 13th, when only the\n2 It should be also noted that this period was also marked by transition of power after general election that took place on February 29, when no cases of COVID-19 were reported in Slovakia.\ninformation was presented in media \u2013 for instance regarding the protective use of facial surgical masks. While the first information in mainstream media was that WHO does not recommend wearing surgical masks for self-protection, as soon as on March 16th the Slovak government issued a requirement to wear surgical masks at all public places. Thus, the negative correlation between scientific reasoning and recommended behavior can reflect the reluctance of more scientifically sophisticate people to engage in global panic by challenging some of the recommended measures as not effective, while less scientifically sophisticated people might accept more measures without question. Moreover, we suspect that while the reported behavior against the coronavirus is quite reliable, the reported behavior against seasonal diseases might be biased by the ongoing situation. For example, 30.6 % of people reported that they wear masks not to infect others also during flu season, but it was hardly possible to see anyone with a mask in the public during the previous years. Therefore, for further analyses, we chose only non-standard preventive behavior against coronavirus.\nWe also performed t-tests to analyze the differences in scientific reasoning and analytic\nthinking between those who got or intended to get vaccinated against the flu and those who did not. We did not find any significant differences in scientific reasoning (t = 0.72, p = .472) nor general analytic thinking (t = -.0.83, p = .405) between the two groups.\nInterestingly, neither we found any correlation between scientific reasoning and analytic thinking and the hypothetical question about willingness to get a vaccination against coronavirus was the vaccination available. This caught our attention and we performed several more exploratory analyses. We found a strong correlation between anti-vaccination attitudes and reluctance to take hypothetical vaccination against coronavirus (r = .45, p < .001), which suggests that people are quite consistent and generalize their reservations against vaccination also to the hypothetical new vaccination against coronavirus.\nWhile correlational analyses above showed that both general analytic thinking and scientific reasoning play a role in measured health-related beliefs and preventive behavior, they were mutually correlated. Next, we wanted to examine whether the general analytic thinking and scientific behavior will both independently predict health-related beliefs. To reduce the number of analyses, we computed a composite score for health-related beliefs. For the first regression analysis, the composite score was calculated as the average score of all items comprising the three scales (coronavirus-specific conspiracy theories, health-related epistemically suspect beliefs and anti-vaccination attitudes). The composite score showed excellent internal reliability (M = 2.12, SD = .69, \u03b1 = .93). For the second regression analysis, as an outcome variable, we used only non-standard preventive behaviors against coronavirus, because of the problems with the self-reported behavior described earlier.\nIn our regression analyses (Table 3) analytic thinking together with scientific reasoning explained 21.2 % of total variance for health-related beliefs and 5 % of total variance for nonstandard preventive behavior. Crucially, scientific reasoning emerged as a stronger predictor in comparison with analytic thinking in both regression analyses. This suggests that even though the effect of scientific reasoning seems to be stronger for epistemically suspect beliefs\nthink analytically.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we examined the effect of scientific reasoning on a broader range of healthrelated behavior and beliefs in the context of the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The most important finding of our study is that scientific reasoning predicts not only general pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs related to health \u2013 as was shown already in previous research (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; \u010cavojov\u00e1 & Ersoy, 2019b) \u2013 but also conspiracy beliefs related specifically to COVID-19. Crucially, scientific reasoning was a stronger independent predictor of unfounded beliefs (including anti-vaccination attitudes) than general analytic thinking. This result brings further support for the model of rationality proposed by Stanovich (2011) in that knowledge and understanding of science is at least as important as the propensity to engage in analytical thinking. Similarly, as other previous studies (\u010cavojov\u00e1 et al., 2020; Drummond & Fischhoff, 2019) we showed that scientific reasoning mindware is indispensable and it predicts health-related beliefs and behavior over the general tendency to think analytically.\nMore scientifically sophisticated people could better navigate through the constantly updating information about the coronavirus and evaluate which information are more likely to be true and what are conspiracy theories, as reflected by negative correlations with coronavirusspecific conspiracy beliefs and general health-related unfounded beliefs. They also showed fewer anti-vaccination attitudes and the knowledge of how vaccination works could probably help them to understand the news about the new coronavirus better.\nDeeper understanding probably led also to a lower number of unfounded preventive behaviors \u2013 such as drinking 52% alcohol to disinfect \u201cfrom the inside\u201d, spraying chlorine around, or\ndecrease superstitious thinking and false analogies that form the bases of many harmful treatments (like drinking industrial bleach to get rid of internal parasites and viruses).\nOn the other hand, higher scientific reasoning also led to a lower number of recommended preventive measures, such as wearing masks, disinfecting household surfaces, and staying home. The observed negative relationship between scientific reasoning and self-reported preventive behavior has several possible explanations. It should be noted that the data collection took place during the most turbulent time in Slovakia \u2013 the outbreak of COVID-19 intersected with the transition of power from one government to the next and as the numbers of positively diagnosed patients began to increase, the new measures were introduced almost every day.\nThus, the negative relationship between scientific reasoning and the number of self-reported recommended preventive measures taken against COVID-19 could reflect the skepticism of more scientifically sophisticated people against some of the measures and reluctance to engage in panicky behavior. While some reports in the media stressed the emergency of the situation by pointing to a total number of deaths and situation getting out of hand in Italy, more cautious voices stressed the relatively low mortality rate by comparing the numbers to death rates caused by other diseases, such as flu and TBC. Understanding the numbers better and ability to evaluate the scientific evidence may lead scientifically more sophisticated people to rationalize their theories about the virus or to underestimate the risk of the virus, which is in line with other evidence for motivated reasoning in more sophisticated participants, when it comes to emotionally hot topics, such as politics and climate change (Kahan et al., 2012; Lodge & Taber, 2007).\nThis explanation could be supported also by our results related to vaccination behavior (getting a flu shot and eagerness to get vaccinated against the coronavirus). Interestingly, even\nno difference in scientific reasoning (and general analytic thinking) between those who got or intended to get vaccinated against the flu this year and those who did not. It suggests that probably other factors \u2013 either emotional or contextual \u2013 are more important in the decision to get vaccinated. It may also reflect relatively low perceived risk of contracting the flu. Similarly, neither higher scientific reasoning nor general analytic thinking was related to the eagerness to get vaccinated against the new coronavirus if such vaccination would be possible. These results suggest that perceived risk of contracting the disease and experience severe symptoms may be more important for considering voluntary vaccinations.\nAnother possible explanation is that our way of measuring preventive behaviors was not reliable enough, as participants only indicated \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d answers and in just a few days some of the preventive behaviors became the social norm irrespective of personal attitudes toward that norm. Thus, the number of self-reported preventive behaviors can reflect more contextual than individual factors.\nThis is also the main limitation of our study that due to the evolving situation we need to take the results about self-reported preventive behavior with caution. At the same time, we consider it also the main strength of our research, because it offers a glimpse of how scientific reasoning is useful during crisis times like we are currently experiencing, as it enables people to evaluate new evidence and not to fall prey to conspiracy theories and beliefs. Our findings have relevant consequences also for science education as they highlight the necessity of having sufficient scientific \u201cmindware\u201d to be able to navigate in the sea of rapidly updating information and evidence \u2013 not only for laypeople but even more so for decision-makers, who should understand the need to base the policies and protective measures on relevant scientific evidence.\nThe Authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}, {"heading": "Kayg\u0131s\u0131z, G.

The present study assessed the stressful impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, identifying possible mediators of perceived stress (sociodemographic variables and stable psychological traits). High levels of perceived stress were found in the Italian population. Being female, having low income and living with other people were associated with higher levels of stress.

About 80% of the population recover with no special treatment (asymptomatic or mild pneumonia)2, while recent data confirmed that older people (>60 years old)3 and persons with previous specific medical conditions are more likely to develop serious respiratory distress that can lead to death (3-4%)4. The virus spreads very easily from person to person and, at the time of writing, no drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19, the disease associated to SARS-Cov-25,6. SARS-Cov-2 was identified for the first time in the Chinese region of Wuhan in December 20196. Between December 2019 and April 2020, COVID-19 spread throughout the world, causing more than 2,300,000 infections and over 150,000 deaths7. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic8. To contain the number of the victims and prevent a collapse of the healthcare system, most countries\u2019 national governments imposed strict restrictions on citizens\u2019 freedoms, forcing people infected by the virus into self-isolation, and requiring everyone (infected or not) to stay at home, allowing movements in public only for reasons of absolute necessity. Among Western countries, the Italian government was the first to apply such restrictions, following Asian countries like China and South Korea, which were the first to deal with the COVID-19 emergency7. On 8 March 2020, the first \u201cred zones\u201d in Italy were locked down9. A few days later, the Italian government locked down the entire country, imposing10: i) self-isolation for everyone testing positive for SARS-Cov-2, even if asymptomatic and for anyone (e.g. roommates, family members) in close contact with them; ii) closure of all public places, including schools, restaurants, parks, and shopping centres; iii) the suspension of work activity or the activation of working from home, except for professional categories providing work essential for the community (e.g., healthcare, grocery stores, gas stations, law enforcement, production of basic\nnecessities); iv) a ban on leaving the home except for important reasons. As concerns the last point, only the following activities were considered sufficiently important: going to work (only for people providing one of the aforementioned essential services); grocery shopping (just one person per family with restricted frequency); health care needs; taking pets outside; jogging (these last three activities were later further restricted, allowing movement only within 200 metres from home to prevent people from using them to evade the restriction to stay at home)."}, {"heading": "The psychological impact of the pandemic", "text": "A few weeks after the spread of COVID-19 in China, the first scientific studies investigating the psychological impact of the outbreak highlighted that a significant percentage of the Chinese population reported mild to severe psychological impacts of the event (53.8%) with negative consequences on mental health such as anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress11,12. More broadly, the literature on the mental health response to infection outbreaks reports that pandemics are extremely stressful events, as people find themselves having to cope with totally unexpected, ambiguous and uncertain situations13. Two main aspects affect people\u2019s mental state during pandemics. The first regards danger, i.e. the fear of contagion, which can lead to an increment in the perceived threat and sometimes to panic, behavioural contagion and emotional epidemic14,15. In this, a significant role is played by overexposure to the media: while the media can contribute to conveying a correct perception of the risk to the public, promoting healthy behaviours16, it can also generate confusion, psychological distress and panic, due to the broadcasting of speculative data and disturbing images17. The second aspect regards the multiple and rapid changes that occur in social, working and familiar habits, due to the self-isolation and social distancing measures imposed18,19. The longer the duration of self-isolation, the more frustration and boredom, along with concerns about infection, were identified as the major stressors during the isolation period18. Moreover, the importance of\nproviding adequate information on restrictive measures has been highlighted, to ensure that selfisolation is perceived as a voluntary and altruistic choice rather than a constraint imposed by law18. Well-documented psychological reactions to epidemics are emotional distress, anxiety-related behaviours, sleeping disorders, fear, anger, depression, health concerns, a sense of powerlessness and uncertainty14,19\u201324. Furthermore, studies examining the long-term consequences of infectious epidemics have shown that some individuals go so far as to develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)13,25. One review indicated that post-traumatic stress symptoms may even persist for three years after the epidemic has ended18,23.\nStress is defined as an adaptive psycho-physical reaction in response to a physical, social or psychological stimulus, called \u201cstressor\u201d26. Stress-related responses are cognitive, emotional, behavioural and physiological. Depending on the type, timing and severity of exposure to stressful stimuli, stress may be a potential risk factor for a number of diseases, including psychiatric and cardiovascular ones27\u201331. An emergency like the COVID-19 outbreak can rightly be considered a severe stressor as a new and unexpected situation with serious potential effects on the health of oneself and one\u2019s loved ones that is combined with social restrictions14. Nevertheless, events are not, in and of themselves, the precipitating cause of pathology and illness behaviour. The perception of stress, i.e. the degree to which one considers the situation as being stressful, accounts more for the varying responses to potentially stressful events32. In this sense, it might be important to implement strategies to detect vulnerable persons early and to promote effective prevention programs in order to treat them rapidly and limit future negative psychological outcomes. Therefore, identifying possible psychosocial risk and resilience factors for psychological distress due to the COVID-19 emergency is a significant step for health prevention and promotion33.\nRisk and protective factors of psychological outcomes of the pandemic Studies related to the impact of COVID-19 in the Chinese population found that the psychological reaction to the outbreak was mediated by sociodemographic variables (e.g., gender, age, education\nlevel and social connections)11,12,24,34,35. Sociodemographic risk factors for psychological distress included gender (female), age (18-30 or >60 years old), student status, education level, perception of the public health system, specific physical symptoms (e.g. coryza, cough, sore throat, headache) and a low reported level of health11,24,34. Considering just the student population, having an infected parent, economic hardships or delayed academic activities increased the risk of developing anxiety symptoms12. On the other hand, protective sociodemographic factors against psychological distress were: receiving accurate information (e.g., health information on the epidemic) and adopting preventive measures11. For Chinese students, living in urban areas, a stable family income, living with parents and good social support were found to be protective factors against anxiety12.\nIn addition to sociodemographic factors, a number of psychological constructs may also mediate individual reactions to a pandemic. Many studies have outlined the role of certain dispositional traits in modulating people\u2019s responses to stressful events. One of the most highly studied resilience factors is the coping strategy. Coping is defined as one\u2019s effort to solve personal and interpersonal problems in order to seek to master, minimize or tolerate stress and conflicts36. Distinct coping strategies are associated differently with emotional response37, physiological stress response38 and self-efficacy39,40. Investigations into the role of coping strategies in facing virus outbreaks found coping style influenced the perceived risk of contagion and vaccination intentions among Canadian adults during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic41. Coping strategies were also found to be associated with post-traumatic outcomes within the general population visiting community health care services during the national outbreak of SARS in Singapore23. As concerns emotional self-regulation and adaptation between self and the world, self-control may represent a significant protective factor. Empirical evidence indicates that people with high dispositional self-control have better outcomes in both psychological adjustment and impulse control42, suggesting that good self-control mitigates the influence of a negative environment.\nSimilarly, perceived control over life outcomes has been shown to be positively related to wellbeing and health-related quality of life, and negatively associated with emotional distress when faced with stressful events43,44. In this regard, the \u201clocus of control\u201d45 is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Another significant factor influencing both personal risk perception of the epidemic threat and compliance with self-isolation restrictions might be Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC)46. Individual differences in CFC reflect \u201cthe extent to which people consider the potential distant outcomes of their current behaviours and the extent to which they are influenced by these potential outcomes\u201d46. A meta-analysis indicated that CFC is an important construct to consider in research on health behaviours, as it is associated with intended and actual engagement in three health-related behaviours: health risk, health promotion and illness preventive behaviour47. Finally, among individual difference variables that might influence people\u2019s reactions to COVID19, personality traits deserve attention. Several studies have highlighted an association between the Big Five personality traits48 and various health behaviours, such as sedentary behaviour49, sexual health50, physical activity51 and alcohol involvement52.\nAs reported above, several studies have investigated the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the Chinese population. However, it is important to remember that each country differs from others in many respects, such as social, cultural, political and economical aspects, to name just a few. Consequently, psychological responses may also vary within different contexts and communities, revealing peculiar qualitative and quantitative psychological reactions and psychological needs. For this reason, the present work analyses the psychological impact of the COVID-19 emergency in one Western country, Italy. It is worth noting that this is the first time since the last century that many Western countries are facing pandemic and mandatory self-isolation. The first aim of this study was to investigate the stressful impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and of the subsequent restrictions\nimposed by the Italian government. The second aim was to investigate the association between certain stable psychological traits and people\u2019s psychological distress to the emergency. To this end, participants were tested for coping strategies, self-control, consideration of future consequences, locus of control and personality traits. Sociodemographic variables were also considered as mediators. Moreover, with the final goal of anticipating treatment and improving the targeting and effectiveness of preventive interventions, we developed a predictive model for individual psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of high or low perceived stress levels."}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "An ad hoc online questionnaire was designed to investigate the relation between behavioural and psychological reactions to the COVID-19 emergency and individual psychological traits. The questionnaire was organized in different sections that assessed the following:\n\u2022 sociodemographic data: gender, age, education, cohabitation status, number of cohabitants,\nemployment status before and during the lockdown, family/cohabitation monthly income\n\u2022 health condition: presence of pathologies enhancing the risk for COVID-19\n\u2022 contact history with COVID-19: personal screening status (swab), possible personal positivity\nstatus and disease course (hospitalization), positivity status and hospitalization of close people, loss of close people having died of COVID-19\n\u2022 perception of the risks related to COVID-19: risk perception of contracting and transmitting\nCOVID-19, estimated possibility of avoiding COVID-19 infection, degree of concern for loved ones, degree of attention to physical symptoms\n\u2022 perception of changes to daily life: degree of perception of change to emotional life, family life,\nsocial life, work and daily life in general, and degree of feeling a limitation of personal freedom\n\u2022 need for psychological support\n\u2022 influence of the media and of active searches for information: frequency of actively seeking\ninformation on COVID-19, main source of information\n\u2022 compliance with restrictive measures: going out only when necessary, taking a walk in defiance\nof the ban, going grocery shopping unnecessarily in defiance of the ban\n\u2022 attitudes toward the future: perspective on the future resolution of COVID-19, considering\nCOVID-19 an opportunity for growth\nAn English version of the entire set of questions is available in the following repository: 10.5281/zenodo.3753552.\nSubsequently, six standardized questionnaires were administered:\n\u2022 The Italian Version of the ten-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)53. This is the most widely\nused psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. Subjects were asked to answer ten questions on the frequency of stressful situations during the last month on a fivepoint scale (from 0=\u201cNever\u201d to 4=\u201cVery often\u201d)54,55. Examples of items are: \u201cIn the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?\u201d, \u201cIn the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?\u201d. Higher scores indicate higher levels of experienced stress. Moreover, in the present study, the score corresponding to 1.5 SD above the Italian population average score53 was used as a cut-off to divide participants into two classes: low level (Male PSS-10 score < 24.35; Female PSS-10 score < 24.55) and high level (Male PSS-10 score \u2265 24.35; Female PSS score10 \u2265 24.55) of perceived stress.\n\u2022 The Italian Shortened Version of the Coping Orientations to the Problems Experienced (COPE-\nNVI-25)56. This is a multi-dimensional inventory assessing individual differences in coping styles using 25 items rated on four-point scale, ranging from 1 (\u201cI usually don\u2019t do this at all\u201d) to 4 (\u201cI usually do this a lot\u201d)57. The instrument distinguishes five different scales\ncorresponding to five different coping styles: social support, avoidance strategies, positive attitude, problem solving and turning to religion58. Example of items are: \u201cI admit to myself that I can\u2019t deal with it, and quit trying\u201d (avoidance strategies), \u201cI try to grow as a person as a result of the experience\u201d (positive attitude). Higher scores in each scale indicate higher use of that specific coping strategy. In this study, the scales were also grouped into two major categories: functional coping and dysfunctional coping. According to the literature, positive attitude and problem solving are considered functional coping styles, as they are associated with selfefficacy, less distress, major psychological wellbeing, better quality of life and better ability to handle stress. On the other hand, social support, avoidance and turning to religion are considered dysfunctional coping styles, as they are not correlated with psychological wellbeing. Avoidance strategies, in particular, are associated with emotional distress and reduction of quality of life56,58.\n\u2022 The Italian translation of the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS)42. This instrument measures\nindividual differences in the dispositional capacity for self-control using 13 items rated on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (\u201cNot at all\u201d) to 5 (\u201cVery much\u201d). Examples of items are: \u201cI do certain things that are bad for me, if they are fun\u201d and \u201cI am able to work effectively toward long-term goals\u201d. Higher scores in the BSCS indicate a higher capacity for self-control and are correlated with better psychological adjustment, better interpersonal skills and better emotional responses42. In this paper, two subscales, reflecting two structure factors, were also taken into account: General self-discipline (GSD, nine items) and Impulse control (IC, four items)59,60. The first subscale measures a tendency to be disciplined and engage in effortful control, while the second measures resistance to short-term rewards or temptations to realize long-term objectives59,60.\n\u2022 The Italian translation of the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFC)46. This is a\ntwelve-item scale using five-point ratings, ranging from 1 (\u201cextremely uncharacteristic\u201d) to 5 (\u201cextremely characteristic\u201d) assessing the extent to which people emphasize the short-term or\nlong-term consequences of their current behaviours and the extent to which they are influenced by imagined outcomes. Examples are \u201cI consider how things might be in the future and try to influence those things with my day-to-day behaviour\u201d and \u201cI am willing to sacrifice my immediate happiness or well-being in order to achieve future outcomes\u201d. Individuals scoring highly on the CFC scale typically focus on the future implications of their behaviour, whereas those with a low score on the CFC typically focus more on their immediate needs and concerns46.\n\u2022 The Italian Short Version of the Locus of Control (LOC) Scale61. This is a twenty-item\nquestionnaire developed to measure people\u2019s generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement rated on dichotomous options (\u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d) similar to the original Rotter\u2019s Internal-External locus of control scale45. Examples are: \u201cTo do well in life, luck is more important than commitment\u201d, \u201cIn sports, the best always wins in the long run\u201d. Subjects with an internal locus of control (higher score in Internal LOC Scale) tend to attribute outcomes they achieve in life, and events in general, to their behaviours, whereas those with a prevalent external locus of control (higher score in External LOC Scale) tend to attribute events to fate, to others or to other external causes45,62.\n\u2022 The Italian Version of the ten-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10)63. This instrument assesses\npersonality traits according to the Five Factor approach64. It uses ten items rated on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) to 5 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d) to measure five dimensions of personality: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism (or, if reversed, emotional stability) and openness65. Examples are: \u201cI see myself as someone who is outgoing, sociable\u201d (extraversion) and \u201cI see myself as someone who tends to be lazy\u201d (conscientiousness). The higher the score on a scale, the more that specific dimension represents a characteristic trait of the subject\u2019s personality.\nThe complete list of 74 variables that were extracted from the responses to the questionnaire is reported in supplementary information. The experiment was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki."}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Data were collected between 20 and 31 March 2020. Participants were recruited online through a request on social media to join the research. They were asked to complete an anonymous online questionnaire regarding their personal experience with the COVID-19 emergency and their mental state. Inclusion criteria were: living in Italy at the time of data collection and being of age of majority. All participants were required to read and provide informed consent before beginning the online questionnaire. They received no compensation for participation. Two thousand seventy-two volunteers took part in the study. Of the 2072 participants, 19 were excluded for responding to the questionnaire twice, keeping only the first response of each of these participants. The final sample consisted of 2 053 participants, of which 1 555 females, 480 males and 18 \u201cother\u201d. The average age was 35.81 (SD=13.19, range 18-83) and the average education level was 15.35 (SD=3.43, range 5- 21). A more detailed description of the demographic characteristics of the sample is provided in the supplementary information. It has been calculated that a sample size of 2053 is sufficiently large to achieve, in a linear multivariable regression analysis with 18 predictors, at least a statistical power (1-\u03b2)=0.90, given a significance level \u03b1=.05 and an effect size 0.36466. Data are available in the following depository: 10.5281/zenodo.3753552."}, {"heading": "Data analysis methodology", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Statistics", "text": "Data analysis was performed using JASP software67. The one sample t-test (t, two-sided) was performed in relation to the PSS-10 score to determine whether the sample true mean (\u03bc) was statistically different from the known population mean (m0).\nWe ran a multivariable regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the PSS-10 score and the independent variables that have been hypothesized having an impact on the level of perceived stress. The collinearity assumption was checked before running the model. The analysis was performed using the stepwise variable selection method. This approach identified the predictors when their individual association with the outcome (PSS10) was significant (p<0.05). Results were reported using unstandardized coefficients, as recommended by Friedrich68. Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation (r) was adopted (or the point-biserial correlation (rpb) when one of the two variables was dichotomous) to further investigate the strength of the relation between each independent variable, especially those not explored by previous studies, and the level of perceived stress. The significance threshold of the p-value was set at .05, being explicit when the value was <.01 and <.001. Confidence intervals were also reported. The normality of the distribution of all variables was checked by examining the distribution plots and Q-Q plots and calculating the values of skewness and kurtosis (a distribution was considered normal when skewness was within the range [- 2, 2] and kurtosis was within the range [-7, 7]69. Note that the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test were not taken into account as this test is notoriously affected by large sample size, giving significant results even for very small deviations from normal distribution70). Based on these criteria, all the investigated variables met the normality assumption. Finally, to avoid multiple comparison issues, we employed a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach71,72. This machine regression method selected a small subset of predictors that had a significant association with our continuous outcome, considering the complex correlation structure of the independent variables. As in the multivariable linear regression, this method provides an association between each variable with the outcome, but differently from the linear models, it shrinks the coefficients to zero when the variables are not associated with the endpoint. We implemented LASSO using the R-package HCDI, (R version 3.6.3). To enhance the consistency of our results, we computed 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each estimate with\n1,000 bootstraps. The tuning of the LASSO parameter, which controlled for the amount of regularization applied to the estimates, was selected by 10-fold Cross-Validation."}, {"heading": "Classification models", "text": "Recently, researchers in different scientific fields, including clinical and social sciences, have emphasized how it can be useful to focus on prediction rather than explanation when data are analysed73. Attention to predictive models has increased mainly thanks to the significant spread of machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with training algorithms on samples of data (training set) in order to make predictions on completely new data (test set) without being explicitly programmed74. As concerns psychology, machine learning techniques are particularly useful to predict human behaviour, including high-risk behaviours, in order to improve the effectiveness and targeting of prevention75. One of the main advantages of using ML is that, unlike traditional statistics, it makes it possible to build very complex models considering many predictors (or independent variables). A second benefit is that it makes it possible to make inferences at the individual level, while traditional statistical methods focus on the group level. In brief, ML models make it possible to predict the behaviour of the individual subject, so that attention can be paid to the most critical individuals73. In this paper, ML algorithms are trained on psychosocial data to identify people who are more likely to show a high level of perceived stress during the COVID-19 emergency, and who are also at greatest risk of future development of psychological symptoms, including post-traumatic symptoms. For this purpose, the participants were split into two classes: high level vs. low level of perceived stress. The \u201chigh level of perceived stress\u201d class included participants who obtained a PSS score of more than 1.5 SD above the Italian population mean (n=393), respectively for males and females. Conversely, the \u201clow level of perceived stress\u201d class included participants performing no more than 1.5 SD above the Italian population normative value in the PSS-10 (n=1642). It should be remembered that participants who responded \u201cother\u201d to the gender question (n=18) were\nexcluded from this analysis, as Italian normative values for the PSS-10 are available only for males and females separately53. As ML models are built to fit the data, it is important to test how an existing model fits new unseen data. So, part of the data (training set) is generally used to train and validate the model, while another part (test set) is set aside to test the model accuracy on new examples that have never been seen by the ML classifier74,76. This procedure guarantees the generalization of the model and increases the replicability of results77,78. In this work, 20%74,76 of the participants were randomly chosen and retained as test set. Therefore, the training set consisted of 1628 participants (314 with a high level of perceived stress and 1314 with a low level of perceived stress) and the test set consisted of 407 participants (79 with a high level of perceived stress and 328 with a low level of perceived stress). First, a feature selection was performed. This is a widely used procedure in ML and consists of selecting the best subset of predictors in order to maximize model accuracy79. It makes it possible to remove redundant and irrelevant features and to increase model generalization by reducing overfitting and noise in the data80. A good strategy for feature selection is to identify the subset of features containing ones highly correlated with the class to predict, but that are not correlated with each other79. This procedure was performed here using the Correlation-Based Feature Selector (CFS) used in WEKA 3.981. Through running this algorithm, the best predictors were identified. The class imbalance problem was addressed while running the classification algorithms. The ratio between participants with a \u201chigh perceived stress level\u201d and participants with a \u201clow perceived stress level\u201d is 1:4. It is known that ML methods work best with balanced datasets, and require that class imbalance be accounted for especially when available training examples are limited, a condition that is frequently met by datasets of a large number of domains, including health and clinical psychology82. Having a different number of instances in the two classes may lead to the overall correct classification of the examples of the majority class and the complete misclassification of the instances of the minority class. At the same time, it is equally important to\nbuild the model on a sample that is representative of the population, maintaining a proportion of the classes that reflects its real distribution82. One strategy to overcome these limits consists of altering the relative costs associated to misclassifying the minority and the majority classes, so that it compensates for the imbalance ratio of the two classes83. Here, the ML algorithms were set in such a way that an error made by the algorithm in classifying the minority class (high perceived stress level) weights four times more than an error in classifying the majority class (low perceived stress level). The cost-modifying strategy has been shown to provide better results than other methods in addressing the class imbalance problem, such as random oversampling of the minority class or random undersampling of the majority class83. Moreover, it should also be noted that, for the goal of this task, it is more beneficial to obtain a lower number of false negatives rather than false positives or having a model with high sensitivity rather than high specificity. In other words, it is more important to not miss people at risk than to treat people who are not at risk. Then, different ML models were trained and validated on the training sample (n=1628) through a ten-fold cross-validation procedure using WEKA 3.9 software81. The different algorithms (Logistic regression84, Support Vector Machine85, Na\u00efve Bayes86, Random forest87) were chosen to be representative of different classification strategies to ensure that the results were stable across classifiers and did not depend on specific model assumptions (details on ML classifiers parameters are reported in supplementary information). K-fold cross validation is a resampling procedure that seeks to reduce variance in the model performance estimation with respect to using a single training set and a single validation set, reducing model overfitting. Ten-fold cross-validation consists of portioning the sample in k=10 subsets (folds), using nine of them to train the model and the last one to validate its accuracy. This procedure is repeated k=10 times, leaving one fold out each time as a validation set88. The final metrics of the model is obtained by averaging the metrics obtained in the k=10 validation subsets. Finally, the models developed from ten-fold cross validation were tested on the test sample (n=407)."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The main results obtained by the data analysis are reported in this section. A more complete descriptive analysis of each variable, including the composition of the high vs. low perceived stress samples, is reported in supplementary information.\nPerceived stress in response to the COVID-19 emergency On the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the average score of the entire sample of participants was 18.81 (SD=6.25). Analysing males\u2019 and females\u2019 responses separately (note that participants who responded \u201cother\u201d to the question on gender were excluded from this analysis due to a lack of normative data), males obtained an average score of 16.71 (SD=6.91) and females obtained an average score of 19.44 (SD=6.79). To determine whether the mean of the sample statistically differed from the Italian population normative value (males: average=15.2, SD=6.1; females: average=16.3, SD=5.5)53 a one-sample t-test was run separately for male and female groups. Statistically significant results emerged for both males (t(479)=4.79, p<.001, d=0.22, 95% CI for Cohen\u2019s d [0.13, 0.31]) and females (t(1554)=18.21, p<.001, d=0.46, 95% CI for Cohen\u2019s d [0.41, 0.51]). The items of the PSS-10 showing a greater increase in participants with a high level of perceived stress (1.5 SD above the population mean) are those related to the loss of control over one\u2019s life (M=3.09, SD=0.80) and the frequency of feeling nervous or stressed (M=3.51, SD=0.60) (see supplementary information for an item-by-item analysis)."}, {"heading": "Multivariable regression analysis", "text": "A first multiple regression analysis was run including the sociodemographic variables that recent literature11,12,24,34,35 show may have an impact on the level of perceived stress during a pandemic. The PSS-10 score was set as the dependent variable, while gender (be male), age, education, monthly income, number of family members and student status (be student) were entered as covariates. The final model accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in the level of perceived stress (R2\n= .103, Adjusted R2 = .101, F-change(1,2029) = 12.009, p<.001). All of the aforementioned variables, except for be student, were found to contribute to the level of perceived stress. Results are reported in Table 1.\nTo better understand the role of stable psychological traits in predicting the level of perceived stress (PSS-10 score), a second multiple linear regression was run, adding to the previous model the score to the five coping styles measured by the COPE-NVI-25 (COPE positive, COPE problem, COPE avoidance, COPE religion and COPE support), the CFC score, the BSCS total score, the internal locus of control score measured by the LOC scale (internal LOC) and the scores for the five personality traits measured by the BFI-10 scale (BFI-10 agreeableness, BFI-10 conscientiousness, BFI-10 emotional stability, BFI-10 extraversion and BFI-10 openness). This second model accounted for a larger proportion of the variance in the level of perceived stress (R2 = .364, Adjusted R2 = .360, F-change(1,2022) = 5.509, p<.05) compared to the previous one. BFI-10 emotional stability, COPE positive, age, BCSC total score, gender (be male), COPE avoidance, CFC score, internal LOC, number of family members, COPE support, monthly income and BFI-10 conscientiousness were found to be significant predictors of the level of perceived stress during the COVID-19 epidemic (see Table 2).

Results of the correlations between the PSS-10 score and each variable are extensively reported in the supplementary information.\nRelation between perceived stress and sociodemographic variables The results showed a statistically significant negative correlation between the PSS-10 score and gender (being male: rpb=-0.17, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.21, -0.13]), education years of education: r=0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [-0.09, -0.003]), and age (r=-0.26, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.30, -0.22]). Analysing people over 60, who have higher risks associated to COVID-19 infection, the results highlighted that being over 60 negatively correlates with the PSS-10 score (rpb=-0.15, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.20, - 0.11]). To investigate whether the lower level of stress of participants over the age of 60 could be related to a lower risk perception of these subjects, the relation between age and the reported perception to being at risk of COVID-19 (1= \u201cnot at all\u201d , 5= \u201cvery much\u201d) was tested, obtaining a statistically significant positive correlation (r=0.13, p<.001, 95% CI [0.08, 0.17]). As concerns social variables, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between the PSS-10 score and living alone instead of with family or roommates (rpb=-0.09, p<.001, 95% CI [- 0.13, -0.05]). Moreover, the number of family members (or cohabitants) was positively correlated\nwith the PSS-10 score (r=0.13, p<.001, 95% CI [0.09, 0.17]). Finally, the results indicated that family/cohabitation monthly income is negatively correlated with the PSS-10 score (r=-0.08, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.04]). With respect to employment status before the COVID-19 emergency, a statistically significant negative correlation emerged between the PSS-10 score and being a public employee (rpb=-0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.01]), a freelancer (rpb=-0.10, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.15, -0.06]) and retired (rpb=-0.13, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.08]), while a positive correlation emerged between the PSS10 score and being a student (rpb=0.19, p<.001, 95% CI [0.15, 0.23]). Regarding employment status during the COVID-19 emergency, the results demonstrated that there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the PSS-10 score and working from home (rpb=-0.06, p<.05, 95% CI [- 0.11, -0.01]) and a significant positive correlation between the PSS-10 score and being home from work temporarily without pay (rpb= 0.07, p<.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.12]).\nRelation between perceived stress and health condition The results highlighted a statistically significant positive correlation between being affected by pathologies enhancing the risk of contracting COVID-19 (immunosuppression, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, cancer and diabetes) and the PSS-10 score (rpb=0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [0.002, 0.09]). Analysing the above-mentioned pathologies separately, a significant correlation with the PSS-10 score emerged only for immunosuppression (rpb=0.08, p<.001, 95% CI [0.04, 0.12]) and pulmonary diseases (rpb=0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [0.004, 0.09]). No statistically significant results were obtained for other pathologies.\nRelation between perceived stress and contact history None of the variables investigating the history of contact with COVID-19 were found to be significantly correlated with perceived stress (PSS-10 score): having been tested for the virus (rpb=0.04, p=.087, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.08]), having tested positive for the virus (rpb=0.06, p=.703, 95% CI [-0.25, 0.35]), knowing people having tested positive for the virus (rpb=-0.03, p=0.190, 95% CI [-\n0.07, 0.01]), knowing people having been hospitalized for complications due to COVID-19 (rpb=0.04, p=.065, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.003]), and knowing people having died due to COVID-19 (rpb=0.001, p=.979, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.04]). However, note that just 0.34% of the sample tested positive for the virus, and none of them required hospital care.\nRelation between perceived stress and risk perception (appraisal) A statistically significant positive correlation was found between risk perception (perception of being in danger for COVID-19, 1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5= \u201cvery much\u201d) and the PSS-10 score (r=0.16, p<.001, 95% CI [0.12, 0.20]). Conversely, a negative correlation emerged between the perception of being able to avoid the virus (1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5= \u201cvery much\u201d) and the PSS-10 score (r=-0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.01]). Moreover, the PSS-10 score was positively correlated with the perception of being a risk for others (1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5= \u201cvery much\u201d; r=0.08, p<.001, 95% CI [0.04, 0.13]) and with the degree of concern for loved ones (1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5= \u201cvery much\u201d; r=0.22, p<.001, 95% CI [0.18, 0.26]). Finally, the results highlighted a statistically significant positive correlation between the degree to which participants pay more attention than usual to physical symptoms (from 1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5= \u201cvery much\u201d) and the PSS-10 score (r=0.24, p<.001, 95% CI [0.20, 0.28]).\nRelation between perceived stress and perception of change in daily life A statistically significant positive correlation was found between the PSS-10 score and the degree (from 1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 10= \u201cvery much\u201d) of perception of change in various aspects of daily life: emotional life (r=0.25, p<.001, 95% CI [0.21, 0.29]), family life (r=0.20, p<.001, 95% CI [0.15, 0.24]), social life (r=0.15, p<.001, 95% CI [0.10, 0.19]), work (r=0.10, p<.001, 95% CI [0.06, 0.14]) and daily life in general (r=0.20, p<.001, 95% CI [0.16, 0.24]). A statistically positive correlation was also found between the amplitude of perception that the restrictive measures adopted by the Italian Government limit personal freedoms (from 1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 10= \u201cvery much\u201d) and the PSS10 score (r=0.22, p<.001, 95% CI [0.18, 0.26]).\nRelation between perceived stress and psychological traits A statistically significant negative correlation emerged between the PSS-10 score and functional coping styles (positive attitude and problem solving; r=-0.32, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.36, -0.28]), high self-control (r=-0.32, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.36, -0.28]) and internal locus of control (r=-0.16, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.21, -0.12]). Conversely, a positive correlation was found between the PSS-10 score and dysfunctional coping styles (social support, avoidance, turning to religion; r=0.15, p<.001, 95% CI [0.11, 0.20]). Moreover, as concerns personality traits, the PSS-10 score was negatively correlated with high agreeableness (r=-0.18, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.13]), high conscientiousness (r=-0.21, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.25, -0.16]), high emotional stability (r=-0.47, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.51, -0.44]) and high extraversion (r=-0.10, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.15, -0.06]). Finally, no statistically significant associations were found between stress (PSS-10) and the consideration of immediate/long-term future consequences (CFC scale; r=-0.03, p<.124, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.01]).\nRelation between perceived stress and need for support As concerns the need for support, it should be pointed out that a statistically significant positive correlation emerged between the PSS-10 score and the degree to which participants think that psychological support could be useful for facing the emergency (1= \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5= \u201cstrongly agree\u201d): r=0.48, p<.001, 95% CI [0.45, 0.52]. Moreover, the need for support was associated with the score obtained on the different coping style scales of the COPE-NVI-25: COPE positive =-0.17, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.21, -0.13], COPE problem r=-0.06, p<.05, 95% CI [-0.10, - 0.01], COPE support r=0.20, p<.001, 95% CI [0.16, 0.24] and COPE avoidance r=0.14, p<.001, 95% CI [0.10, 0.19], except for COPE religion r=0.01, p=.620, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.05].\nInfluence of the media and the active search for information The results showed a statistically significant positive correlation between the frequency of actively seeking information on COVID-19 (0= \u201cnever or almost never\u201d, 1= \u201cless than once a day\u201d, 2= \u201conce a day\u201d, 3= \u201cmaximum twice a day\u201d, 4= \u201cthree to five times a day\u201d, 5= \u201call day long\u201d) and the\nPSS-10 score (r=0.17, p<.001, 95% CI [0.13, 0.22]). Moreover, the analyses highlighted a relation between the PSS-10 score and the main source of information: seeking information from highly reliable sources (accredited sources like the WHO, Italian Ministry of Health, etc.; rpb=0.03, p=0.267, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.07]), seeking information from moderately reliable sources (traditional media like newspaper, television, etc.; rpb=-0.08, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.04]), seeking information from poorly reliable sources (social media, friends, etc.; rpb=0.09, p<.001, 95% CI [0.05, 0.13]). Finally, it is important to note that a statistically significant positive correlation emerged between the frequency of actively seeking information on COVID-19 and the degree to which people pay more attention than usual to their physical symptoms (from 1 to 5; r=0.28, p<.001, 95% CI [0.24, 0.32]). The following results emerged when analysing the correlation between the degree to which people pay more attention than usual to physical symptoms and the main source of information: seeking information from highly reliable sources rpb=-0.06, p<.01, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.02], seeking information from moderately reliable sources rpb=0.02, p=.483, 95% CI [- 0.03, 0.06] and seeking information from poorly reliable sources rpb=0.07, p<.01, 95% CI [0.02, 0.11].\nRelation between perceived stress and compliance with restrictive self-isolation measures Analysing compliance with the restrictive measures imposed by the Italian government, the results showed a statistically significant correlation between the PSS-10 score and some of the variables testing adherence to the government\u2019s rules: going out only when necessary (\u201cyes\u201d: rpb=-0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.01]), taking walks in defiance of the ban (\u201cyes\u201d: rpb=0.06, p<.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10]) and going grocery shopping unnecessarily in defiance of the ban (\u201cyes\u201d: rpb=0.06, p<.01, 95% CI [0.02, 0.10]). A statistically significant correlation between non-adherence to the rules by taking walks in defiance of the ban and the appraisal that restrictive measures are a limitation of personal freedom also emerged: taking a walk in defiance of the ban (\u201cyes\u201d: rpb=0.10, p<.001, 95% CI [0.05, 0.14]. Moreover, adherence to the government\u2019s rules was associated with\nthe score obtained for the BSCS (total score): going out only when necessary (rpb=0.07, p<.01, 95% CI [0.02, 0.11]), taking a walk in defiance of the ban (rpb=-0.13, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.08]) and going grocery shopping unnecessarily in defiance of the ban (rpb=-0.17, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.21, - 0.12].\nRelation between perceived stress and attitudes toward the future Statistically significant results emerged from the correlation between the perspective on the future resolution of the COVID-19 crisis (the emergency 1= \u201cwill end in two weeks\u201d, 2= \u201cwill end in one month\u201d, 3= \u201cwill last several months\u201d, 4= \u201cit will not be resolved until a vaccine is discovered\u201d) and the level of perceived stress (PSS-10 score): r=0.05, p<.05, 95% CI [0.004, 0.09]. Moreover, a statistically significant negative correlation emerged between the PSS-10 score and the degree to which the participants believe that the emergency could be an opportunity for growth (1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree): r=-0.15, p<.001, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.10]. This attitude was found to be correlated with the score obtained for the different coping style scales of the COPENVI-25: COPE positive r=0.36, p<.001, 95% CI [0.32, 0.40], COPE problem r=0.12, p<.001, 95% CI [0.08, 0.16], COPE religion r=0.07, p<.01, 95% CI [0.03, 0.11], COPE support r=0.15, p<.001, 95% CI [0.10, 0.19] and COPE avoidance r=-0.07, p<.01, 95% CI [-0.11, -0.03]."}, {"heading": "LASSO regression", "text": "A LASSO regression model has been run adding as predictors the independent variables (n=53) that, according to the correlation analysis, resulted significantly correlated with the perceived level of stress (PSS-10 score, see supplementary information), plus the stable psychological traits measured by the psychological tests. The results are visualized in Figure 1 and extensively reported in supplementary information.\nMachine learning classification models Ultimately, 74 variables from the entire questionnaire were considered to be perceived stress predictors. The entire list of predictors, along with their description, is provided in the\nsupplementary information. Of these 74 variables, the following 15 were identified as the best pool of predictors by the correlation-based feature selection procedure: age, monthly income, information search, attention to symptoms, emotional life change, general life change, need support, growth opportunity, COPE avoidance, COPE positive, COPE functional, BSCS total score, BSCS GSD, BSCS IC, BFI-10 emotional stability. Using these predictors, various ML algorithms were trained and tested according to the procedure described in the data analysis section. Classification results on the test set are reported in Table 4, where predictive performance is quantified by the following metrics: ROC area, accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure (F1 score). It is worth noting that the classifiers showed a ROC area ranging from 0.76 to 0.82 in the test set. However, the random forest highlighted a lower sensitivity (recall) for the \u201chigh perceived stress\u201d class compared to the other classifiers, making it a weaker model than the others for the purposes of prediction."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The current study measured the impact of the COVID-19 emergency, investigating the role of sociodemographic variables and stable psychological traits to predict the perceived stress level in response to the epidemic. The results confirmed that the COVID-19 crisis is perceived as a stressful experience: in the present sample, the level of perceived stress was higher than that of the general population in a non-emergency condition. Indeed, almost one-fifth of the sample scored above the normative data. These results are in line with Chinese literature on the psychological impact of COVID-1911,12 and to international literature on epidemic outbreaks14. The mean values in the\nsingle items of the PSS-10 suggest that, in addition to feeling nervous and stressed, feeling unable to control one\u2019s personal life is the feeling accounting most for perceived stress. This suggests that the unpredictability and uncontrollability characterizing the pandemic outbreak situation play a significant role in perceived stress during the crisis. Consistent with this, participants declared that the emergency had a strong impact on average on their daily routines. Limitations to personal freedom and changes to emotional were found to have a great impact on personal well-being and psychological distress. As regards risk appraisal, respondents feel quite able to avoid the virus on average. From the correlation analysis emerged that those with a higher risk perception are more likely to experience psychological distress. This appears to be independent of both direct and indirect contact history with the infection: indeed, having been infected or knowing infected people was not associated with higher levels of perceived stress, as might be expected. This result might further suggest that, rather than the infection per se, what people deem and feel as most threatening is the low sense of predictability and controllability related to a so-called \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d. Consistent with this, the greater the stress, the more people are also concerned about the health of their loved ones (see correlation analysis). As concerns health condition, only having immunosuppression is predictive of a higher level of perceived stress. With regard to restrictive self-isolation measures, the results of the present study highlight the stressful impact of the government\u2019s rules, indicating that people who consider the restrictive measures a limitation of their personal freedom and with low self-control are more likely to perceive higher levels of stress and to violate the rules. Consistent with other studies18, these results indicate the importance of adequate information on the utility and collective advantages of the restriction in order to actively involve people in the compliance decision. Note that almost 11% of respondents (see supplementary information) report going out only when necessary, but also going for walks in defiance of the ban. Thus, further investigations on the characteristics of this subsample and the effect of the social desirability would be worthwhile.\nAs regards the sociodemographic variables, the current study suggests that being female is associated with higher levels of stress. This result is consistent with previous literature indicating gender differences in the psychological response to COVID-1924,89 and other epidemics90, and is also in line with the normative data of the general population. On the contrary, higher income was associated with lower levels of perceived stress. This result is consistent with previous studies on this topic as well24,34; higher income might be associated with less concern about the economic effects of self-isolation or with more comfortable housing solutions. In the present sample, being older was associated with lower levels of stress. These findings might appear surprising, since they contradict the results obtained by the studies on the Chinese population24,34 and the fact that being older is a risk factor for higher COVID mortality. However, in a developmental perspective, several studies indicated that there are age-related differences and changes in patterns of coping and locus of control that are reflected in older adults\u2019 higher selfcontrol and emotional self-regulation compared to younger participants92\u201394. In this sense, older people seem to feel less threatened by the virus, despite appraising the situation as risky like younger ones, as found in the present research. Note that older people might also be more used to staying at home, so their daily routine might be impacted less by the mandatory self-isolation. Data from previous investigations on age differences in the stress response to the SARS epidemic are also inconsistent95,96: socio-political and cultural aspects, such as differences in elder care services/policies, might account for these discrepancies among the studies. As concerns education, its role in predicting the level of perceived stress did not clearly emerged in this study. Indeed, previous researchers have found mixed results: according to recent studies on the Chinese population24,34, education did not seem to affect mental health, while data from a Spanish sample89 and from previous studies on psychological adjustment to SARS91 confirmed an association between a higher level of education and mental health. Living alone or living with few family members were other protective factors for perceived stress. We might argue that all these conditions both convey a sense of protection from contagion and offer continuity with pre-epidemic economic\nand social conditions. Moreover, when cohabiting with family members, the aforementioned concern for loved ones might further contribute to increase perceived stress among people living with others. Media exposure was an important issue. Most of the sample (about 62%) reported seeking information on the epidemic more than once a day: during uncertain times, it is natural to seek information, trying to make sense of things and gaining some sense of control. However, in line with previous studies97\u201399, the current research confirms the importance of limiting \u201cmedia overload\u201d and of choosing reliable information. Indeed, a positive association was found between the frequency of information searches and perceived stress. Moreover, while consulting accredited sources of information was not related with stress levels, consulting unreliable sources was related with higher odds of perceiving distress. Interestingly, a further interplay between the search for information style, perceived stress and a \u201chypochondriac-like\u201d reaction was found: the higher the frequency in seeking information and the more unreliable the source of information, the greater the attention to physical symptoms; while the lower the frequency in seeking information and the more reliable the source of information, the lower the attention to physical symptoms. This result suggests the importance of implementing appropriate media education programs during epidemics in order to prevent the detrimental consequences of media overload on psychological distress. Similar to other psychological tendencies, such as \u201ccyberchondria\u201d100, dysfunctional media search might affect only more vulnerable people, i.e. those seeking reassurance and control. As concerns psychological variables, emotional stability was found to be an important protective factor. According to the Five Factors Model64, people with high emotional stability are able to remain calm in response to stressful situations and to view problems in proportion to their importance. As a result, they tend to worry about problems to a lesser extent than people with low emotional stability101. Many studies have found an influence of emotional stability in buffering stress responses to adverse events102,103. Conscientiousness and agreeableness also seemed to predict psychological distress due to the COVID-19 emergency. Individuals who score highly on\nagreeableness measures tend to dislike being involved in arguments or conflict with others and tend to be less suspicious of other people. They generally seek to pacify and mediate. In this sense, agreeable people might be more flexible and accepting when faced with unexpected and undesired situations, such as restrictions and changes to daily routines. Conscientious people are more likely to perceived lower levels of stress (see correlation analysis). According to literature, they are more aware of their actions and tend to exhibit more goal-oriented behaviours. In this sense, in times of self-isolation, they might have a greater tolerance to frustrations and impositions than less conscientious people. Unconscientious people, on the contrary, tend to engage in more impulsive behaviours101. Moreover, previous studies indicated that conscientiousness may influence adaptive behaviours especially in health-related programs104,105. In the present study, higher levels of dispositional self-control predicted lower levels of psychological distress in response to the COVID-19 emergency and greater adherence to the restrictions imposed. Given the restrictions to personal freedom and social life imposed during selfisolation, personal self-control skills may play a determining role in tolerance to restrictions. This result further suggests that self-regulatory processes may have a strong influence on directing people\u2019s responses to the outbreak. The results regarding dispositional self-control are consistent with those regarding the emotional stability trait of the Big Five Model. These dimensions are often correlated110: this specific pattern of results may indicate the importance of personal skills like calm, emotional balance and sense of acceptance, rather than inhibitory processes. In this sense, practices enhancing emotional stability and acceptance, such as mindfulness training, could be useful in reducing the stressful impact of the emergency111,112. The results concerning coping styles are also in line with this. Besides confirming the protective effect of functional coping styles and the adverse impact of dysfunctional ones the results of the present study indicate that people who use a positive attitude as a coping strategy, in particular, are much less likely to experience psychological distress during the emergency, showing high rates of appraising the emergency as an opportunity and feeling a low need for psychological support. On\nthe contrary, people using avoidance strategies were more likely to experience higher levels of stress. These results are consistent with previous literature on the relation between coping and response to epidemics23,41,113,114. In the current study, consideration of future consequences was found to predict psychological response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This may suggest that during the emergency it is as relevant how people differ in focusing on the future implications of their behaviour as is the internal attitude that people use to cope with the future: in a situation of strong uncertainty, thinking about future perspectives may become a source of stress because it increases concerns. This results is consistent with previous studies that indicate associations between individual differences in CFC and personal abilities in self-control115. The results on the dispositional locus of control indicate that people with an internal locus of control are less likely to be stressed. Again, the results suggest that the more people are inclined to confidently rely on themselves, the better they cope with uncertainty and changes. Several studies indicate an association between internal locus of control and self-efficacy and emotional stability116,117. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated a relation between internal locus of control and positive appraisal of emerging infectious disease outbreaks90. Overall, the results of the present study identify some population subgroups that may be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 emergency. Using a pool of 15 psychosocial variables, it is possible to identify a good percentage of the people who developed a high level of stress to the COVID-19 pandemic with a sensitivity up to 0.734 (predictive models\u2019 ROC area is between 0.76 and 0.82). This may allow the development of targeted prevention and intervention programs. Self-regulatory skills were shown to be a protective factor (emotional stability, internal locus of control, selfcontrol), indicating the importance of raising awareness of these issues during the emergency, and of possibly offering training and education to increase personal abilities in these areas (e.g. mindfulness programs). It would also be important to limit further sources of confusion, uncertainty\nand anxiety. In this sense, particular attention should be paid to the issue of appropriate information in order to enhance people\u2019s sense of control and manageability."}, {"heading": "Limits and future perspectives", "text": "We acknowledge that the current study is characterized by some shortcomings that should be considered when interpreting its findings. First, the participants were recruited through an online link that was posted and advertised on social media: online advertising guarantees the possibility of recruiting large samples, but may not guarantee sample representativeness. Second, all our investigations relied on an online self-reported questionnaire: the online format guarantees anonymity, but does not allow verification of the reliability of responses and participant understanding of the questions. Third, although many of the predictor variables were quite stable sociodemographic characteristics and psychological traits, the cross-sectional research design of the present study could not unequivocally confirm causal relationships between the factors being considered and perceived stress. Hopefully, the present research improves our understanding of some of the possible risk factors and protective factors that may influence people\u2019s stress response to the COVID-19 outbreak. It is worth noting that the data in the present study are from an Italian population. Therefore, they were inevitably influenced by specific contextual and socio-cultural aspects. Further investigations involving people from different countries might deepen our understanding of the generalizability of the results and the effective influence of psychological traits. Future research could also invest effort in investigating the interplay and mutual interrelationships between single protective and risk factors. These further understandings could lead to the implementation of more targeted and then more effective prevention and intervention programs. Finally, work is needed identifying protective factors and risk factors for psychological responses during the post-epidemic period and in understanding the longitudinal psychological impact of disease outbreaks."}, {"heading": "9.

In many countries around the world, individuals are required to reduce physical contact to others outside one\u2019s household (social distancing; Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, & Hollingsworth, 2020). Additional measures include curfews, quarantines, and closing of non-essential stores, schools, and universities. As many universities declared a suspension of classroom teaching and switched to online teaching, the lives of students have changed drastically. While social distancing measures may successfully slow down the spread of the infection and relieve the public health systems (Glass, Glass, Beyeler, & Min, 2006), they may eventually increase the social isolation of students and affect their mental health. Being under a lot of pressure to perform academically, students are prone to developing mental health problems (Mikolajczyk et al., 2008). In line with recent (unpublished) studies, we thus examine the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on a student population (e.g., Fried, Papanikolaou, & Epskamp, 2020; Romero-Rivas & Rodr\u00edguez-Cuadrado, 2020). Specifically, we ask two questions: how the COVID19 crisis affects the social networks between students, and how changes in students\u2019 social networks and daily life affect students\u2019 mental health.\nWe investigate changes in social integration and mental health (depressive symp-\ntoms, anxiety, loneliness, and stress) of N = 212 students in two undergraduate study programs in Switzerland. At the time of data collection (early April 2020), universities had switched to online education, non-essential shops were closed, and social gatherings were restricted to groups of at most five people. Furthermore, in-person socializing with others beyond co-residents was advised against in Switzerland.\nIntegration in multiplex social networks is examined within the community of\nstudents and beyond, including social contacts in the household, family, and friendship circles.

We investigate the longitudinal associations between social networks and mental health markers with three pre-registered hypotheses predicting decreased social integration, higher survival chance of stronger, overlapping social ties, and mixed effects of the crisis on mental health (osf.io/4g98p).

Social relationships are conduits of social support (Cohen, Underwood, & Gottlieb, 2000). In times of crisis, social support may be more important than ever. But at the same time, physical proximity and opportunities for interaction are important in developing and fostering social ties (Doreian & Conti, 2012; Festinger, Schachter, & Back, 1950). As face-to-face interactions and random encounters are minimized due to the social distancing measures, it is likely that individuals focus on those relationships that are spatially close, most meaningful, or most established. Those may partly be found outside the student community, for example, in the household, in the family, and within established friendship circles (Bolger & Eckenrode, 1991).\nIn this article, we take into account multiple dimensions of social relations.\nWe assess change in five self-reported social networks within the student community: pleasant interactions, friendships, emotional support, informational support, and costudying. We chose those networks as they differ in function, intimacy, and stability. We assume that stronger relationships will be characterized by an overlap in multiple dimensions (V\u00f6r\u00f6s & Snijders, 2017)."}, {"heading": "STUDENTS UNDER LOCKDOWN 5", "text": "We hypothesize that students at the time of the COVID-19 crisis nominate fewer\nfellow students than before in multiple dimensions of their social networks (H1a).

It is unclear, however, to what extent these findings are comparable to the less severe distancing measures implemented under COVID-19.\nChanges in social networks due to the COVID-19 crisis may directly affect in-\ndividuals\u2019 mental health. Most individuals have a fundamental motivation to socially interact (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). A reduction of social interactions, as is likely to be caused by the crisis and distancing measures, can lead to lower mental health (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001; Ryan & Deci, 2000).\nA number of COVID-19-specific stressors could further affect individuals\u2019 mental\nhealth. Among those are worries about one\u2019s own physical health, the health of others, the potential economic impact, and \u2013 in the case of students \u2013 the impact of a changed educational environment on the progress of their studies and future job market opportunities. However, some individual stressors may be reduced at the time of crisis, as society slows down (Rosa, 2014).

Here, participants could still name fellow students but also others, for example, a partner, family members, housemates, colleagues, or friends. Translated versions of all personal network items used in our analyses are available in the Supplementary Materials.\nRespondents were prompted to fill in pseudonyms that they would recognize for\nup to 10 individuals (personal network size).

First, they were asked whether they have had any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, which they answered with a multiple choice list of symptoms. Following this, participants were asked whether someone they are close to is in an at-risk group, with a yes/no response.

We include\nthe number of individuals named in the personal network questions (personal network size; ranging between zero and ten). Further, physical isolation in personal networks is captured by whether one is not living with someone who they indicate as being important since the lockdown (isolated household variable). We evaluate how often individuals have face-to-face contact with an important individual (minimal physical contact; measured as the maximum reported amount of face-to-face contact among all individuals in the personal network). Additionally, the mean level of emotional support provided by the individuals in the personal network is included (mean emotional support). Furthermore, two other specific COVID-19-related items were used to explore changes in mental health, specifically: at-risk status of close others and adherence to the federal health administration\u2019s guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease.\nFourth, demographic and personal attributes were included to understand\nwhether certain demographic categories or sub-populations might be particularly at risk beyond other factors: non-Swiss nationality, single relationship status, female gender, and extraversion.\nFinally, covariates were included for all measures of mental health in September\n2019 to prevent biases due to previous poor mental health.

The expected within-person decrease in outdegree between the two time points is examined by one-sided, paired-samples t-tests. The expected increase in proportion of out-isolates is examined within-group by McNemar\u2019s test (McNemar, 1947) with continuity correction to account for a low number of observations. Further qualitative and structural differences in the network are examined through use of multiplex network visualizations. While this strategy allows for identification of changes, it does not distinguish between change due to general trends within the cohort, or changes brought about by the COVID-19 crisis and social distancing measures.\nTo build stronger evidence of the effects related to the COVID-19 crisis, we also\ncompare the current-year cohort, Major I (N = 86) in April 2020, to the previous-year cohort (N = 54) in April 2019 in between-cohort tests.

Positive values in the dependent variables indicate that the April 2020 scores were higher than those of September 2019. Given the high number of candidate variables relative to the sample size, we apply stepwise backwards selection procedure to preserve statistical power (Draper & Smith, 1998). In this procedure, first, a fully specified model is estimated. Then, the independent variable with the highest p-value is removed and the model is being reestimated. The removal of variables is continued until there is no independent variable with a p-value higher than a certain cutoff (in our case this is .30).

Students reported on average 0.80 fewer interaction partners and 0.46 fewer study partners. These differences are found to be significant using onesided, paired t-tests (Interaction: t(211) = 4.15, p < .001; Co-study: t(211) = 3.60, p < .001) among students who participated in both data collection waves (N = 212). Hence, with regards to pleasant interaction and co-study networks, we find support for hypothesis 1a (students nominate fewer fellow students). Friendship networks appeared to remain stable, while informational support and emotional support nominations slightly increased. Panel B shows the proportion of students who did not name a single contact in each of the networks (out-isolates). The proportion is significantly higher in the study network. Instead of 22.6% of the students 39.2% now report not to have a study partner (McNemar\u2019s \u03c72(1) = 21.81, p < .001). Hypothesis 1b (more students are socially isolated) is thus supported only for the co-study network. The network comparisons indicate that functional social networks between students (interaction and studying) decreased in density, while friendship and support networks remained stable.\nPanel C and D of Figure 1 show the results of comparisons between the so-\ncial networks of those students who were in Major I (N = 86) to the students from the same study program in the previous year (N = 54). In both cases the data were collected in April of the third study year, once in 2019 and once in 2020 (during the COVID-19 crisis). The direction is similar to the within-cohort comparison: Students in the semester affected by COVID-19 reported less contacts in each network, except for emotional support (Panel C), and were more likely to indicate that they were isolated, thus did not have a single contact in each of the five social networks (Panel D). The differences between the two cohorts reflect similar patterns of differences. Pleasant interaction and co-studying networks were significantly lower in outdegree, but no significant differences were found in the proportion of outisolates (using one-sided, independent-sample t-tests of lower outdegree in the current year compared to previous, Panel C; Interaction: t(112.07) = 1.73, p = .043;\nSTUDENTS UNDER LOCKDOWN 18\nFriend: t(101.23) = 1.46, p = .074; Co-study: t(89.09) = 1.80, p = .038; Info. support: t(121.45) = 0.85, p = .199; Emot. support: t(125.08) = 0.00, p = .499; and one-sided, independent-sample z-tests of greater proportion of isolates in the currentyear cohort in Panel D; Interaction: \u03c72(1) = 1.74, p = .093; Friend: \u03c72(1) = 0.23, p = .316; Co-study: \u03c72(1) = 0.37, p = .271; Info. support: \u03c72(1) = 1.64, p = .100; Emot. support: \u03c72(1) = 0.36, p = .275).\nFigure 2 visualizes the reported interaction networks between students at the\ntime of the COVID-19 crisis. As a consequence of the university lockdown and Swiss policies on social distancing, only few face-to-face interactions were reported by students (Panel A).

The relative network density and overlap between them is shown in a Venn diagram in Figure 2.

Seventy-five percent of the physical interactions were overlapping with any of the digital communication networks.

Paired t-tests indicate that since September 2019 the students became more depressed (Mdiff = 4.44, SE = 0.50, t(208) = 8.89, p <\nSTUDENTS UNDER LOCKDOWN 22\nAnxiety\nStress\nLoneliness\n.001), slightly more anxious (Mdiff = 0.60, SE = 0.24, t(208) = 2.47, p = .014), more stressed (Mdiff = 2.67, SE = 0.40, t(208) = 6.64, p < .001), and more lonely (Mdiff = 0.13, SE = 0.02, t(208) = 5.59, p < .001). Similar negative trends were also observed for comparisons with data collected one year earlier (April 2019) and the person mean of the past ten waves (see Figure 4). Only the comparison of the April 2020 anxiety score with the person mean of past waves was not significant (M = 0.33, SE = 0.18, t(267) = 1.91, p = .057).

Figure 3a-c in the Supplementary Materials shows the mean trajectories and 95% confidence intervals of different mental health measures for those waves that were assessed at the same time with regards to the study progress. In most waves, the two cohorts did not differ significantly from one another (i.e., overlapping 95% Confidence Intervals). Only with regards to stress there appears to be a difference: the previous year\u2019s cohort seems to be more stressed in general. The trends seem aligned through time, indicating seasonal and study-related factors that affect both cohorts. However, it appears that depression, stress, and loneliness (but not anxiety) at the time of the COVID-19 crisis worsen above the general trend, and that the co-studying outdegree (but not the interaction outdegree) decreases more than the general trend. These differences, however, are not statistically significant, as indicated by overlapping confidence intervals.\nIn sum, the descriptive results of the COVID-19 items support the expectation\nthat some aspects of students mental health decrease (e.g., social isolation, general worries) while other stressors (e.g., Fear of Missing Out, student competition) are reduced during the COVID-19 crisis, as proposed in Hypothesis 3. The overall levels of mental health in comparison with the September 2019 wave show a clear decreasing trend. It is possible that partly these trends are unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis, as no significant differences with regards to mental health are found in a between-cohort comparisons, conducted on a smaller sub population.\nExplaining changes in mental health\nHere, we describe the results of regression analyses on the change of mental\nhealth dimensions between September 2019 and April 2020 using a variety of explanatory variables including COVID-19-specific stressors, social networks between"}, {"heading": "STUDENTS UNDER LOCKDOWN 24", "text": "students, personal social networks, and demographic variables.\nStudents who participated in the September 2019 and April 2020 surveys re-\nported an average increase in depressive symptoms of 4.70 (SD = 7.21, total scale range 0-60), an increase in anxiety of 0.75 (SD = 3.47, total scale range 0-21), an increase in stress of 2.76 (SD = 5.78, total scale range 0-40), and an increase in loneliness of 0.14 (SD = 0.33, total scale range 1-4).\nTable 3 shows the results of backwards-selected regression models predicting\nthese differences. Estimates of the full models as well as bivariate correlations of all independent variables with the dependent variables are reported in the Supplementary Material Table 2 and Table 3. For reasons of parsimony, in the following, mainly the significant predictors are discussed. It should be noted that this is an exploratory analysis, not intended to provide evidence for particular hypotheses. The results are discussed by each of the four predictor categories: the COVID-19 related stressors described above, measures of social integration in the social networks between students, measures of personal network integration, and demographics variables.\nThe results on COVID-19 related stressors indicate that students who worry\nmore about their family and friends are more likely to become more depressed (b = 1.54, t(130) = 2.68, p = .008) and more stressed (b = 0.96, t(159) = 2.19, p = .030). Worries about one\u2019s future career contributed to higher levels of anxiousness (b = 0.45, t(164) = 2.22, p = .027) and stress (b = 1.36, t(159) = 3.69, p < .001). The presence of personal problems that were usually suppressed was a strong positive predictor of an increase in depression (b = 4.10, t(130) = 6.03, p < .001), anxiety (b = 1.49, t(164) = 6.31, p < .001), and stress (b = 0.93, t(159) = 2.01, p = .047). No other COVID-19 related stressors was associated with changes in mental health. Although social isolation and worries about the economy increased since the COVID19 crisis (see Table 2), these factors did not predict changes in mental health in this multivariate regression model (for details see Table 3).\nST U D EN T S U N D ER LO C K D O W N 25 Table 3 Results of backwards-selected regression models predicting changes in depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness between September 2019 and April 2020 Variable Depression change Anxiety change Stress change Loneliness change Intercept 1.26 [-2.13, 4.65] 0.55 [-0.22, 1.33] 4.93*** [2.69, 7.17] 0.53*** [0.34, 0.72] COVID-19 items Feeling socially isolated 0.60 [-0.42, 1.62] 0.53 [-0.24, 1.29] Feeling of missing out FoMO 0.52 [-0.31, 1.36] \u22120.59 [-1.18, 0.01] Worries about family and friends 1.54** [0.40, 2.67] 0.36 [-0.07, 0.79] 0.96* [0.10, 1.83] 0.05 [-0.00, 0.10] Worries about own health \u22120.81 [-1.97, 0.36] 0.04 [-0.03, 0.12] Worries about economics 0.04 [-0.01, 0.08] Worries about own financial situation Worries about future career 0.45* [0.05, 0.84] 1.36*** [0.63, 2.09] Problems usually suppressed 4.10*** [2.75, 5.44] 1.49*** [1.03, 1.96] 0.93* [0.01, 1.85] 0.05 [-0.01, 0.10] Student support \u22120.52 [-1.37, 0.33] \u22120.39 [-1.00, 0.21] Student competition 0.04 [-0.01, 0.09] Any COVID-19 symptoms 0.71 [-0.14, 1.55] Someone in risk group Strict adherence (ref. not strict) 1.85 [-0.26, 3.96] 0.60 [-0.22, 1.42] Student Social Networks Out-isolate friendship \u22122.46* [-4.57, -0.36] 0.27* [0.01, 0.53] Out-isolate pleasant interaction 2.22* [0.09, 4.35] 2.90 [-0.82, 6.61] \u22120.14 [-0.39, 0.10] Out-isolate emotional support \u22121.32 [-3.05, 0.42] Out-isolate informational support 2.38*** [1.08, 3.69] 0.14 [-0.01, 0.29] Out-isolate co-study \u22120.08 [-0.18, 0.03] (table continues on next page)\nST U D EN T S U N D ER LO C K D O W N 26 Table 3 Results of backwards-selected regression models predicting changes in depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness between September 2019 and April 2020 (continued) Variable Depression change Anxiety change Stress change Loneliness change Personal Network Network size (centered) \u22120.42 [-0.85, 0.01] \u22120.13 [-0.30, 0.04] \u22120.17 [-0.49, 0.15] \u22120.03* [-0.05, -0.01] Isolated household 3.19* [0.16, 6.23] \u22120.11 [-0.26, 0.03] Minimal physical contact (centered) \u22120.33* [-0.57, -0.08] \u22120.49 [-0.98, 0.01] Mean emotional support (centered) \u22121.14* [-2.21, -0.07] \u22120.24 [-0.66, 0.18] \u22120.07** [-0.12, -0.02] Demographics Study Major 2.93* [0.71, 5.15] Single (ref. in relationships) 1.23 [-0.37, 2.83] 0.10* [0.00, 0.20] Extraversion (centered) \u22121.03 [-2.54, 0.48] Being female (ref. male) 3.05* [0.65, 5.46] 1.32** [0.40, 2.24] 2.04* [0.20, 3.88] 0.15** [0.04, 0.26] Non Swiss \u22121.38 [-3.52, 0.75] Controls Depression previous wave \u22120.32*** [-0.50, -0.14] Anxiety previous wave \u22120.58*** [-0.72, -0.45] Stress previous wave \u22120.45*** [-0.58, -0.33] Loneliness previous wave \u22120.34*** [-0.45, -0.23] R2 0.42 0.48 0.40 0.29 Notes.

Social isolation is associated with changes in anxiety: Being an out-isolate (i.e., having no outgoing ties) in the friendship network in April 2020 was predictive of lower levels of anxiety (b = \u22122.46, t(164) = \u22122.31, p = .022), while being an out-isolate in the interaction network (b = 2.22, t(164) = 2.06, p = .041) and the informational support network (b = 2.38, t(164) = 3.60, p < .001) was predictive of higher levels of anxiety. It should be noted that the subset of students who were isolated only in the friendship network but not in the interaction and information support network is very small (N = 4). Thus, for most students isolation in student social networks is associated with an increase in anxiety. Further, being an out-isolate in the friendship network is associated with increasing loneliness trajectories (b = 0.27, t(161) = 2.05, p = .042). Characteristics of personal networks assessed during the COVID-19 crisis are also associated with changes in mental health. Individuals with smaller personal networks appear to become more lonely (b = \u22120.27, t(161) = \u22122.48, p = .014). Those students who live alone (i.e., are isolated from their personal network in their household) are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptoms (b = 3.19, t(130) = 2.08, p = .039), and those who interact less with individuals in their personal network tend to be more anxious (b = \u22120.33, t(164) = \u22122.60, p = .010).

The Swiss government had further implemented a number of social distancing measures and individuals were demanded to stay at home. We compare measures on social networks and mental health to (i) those of the same students seven months earlier (prior to the COVID-19 outbreak; within-person comparison) and (ii) those collected in a different student community with the same study progress (final undergraduate year) at the same university and in the same study program exactly one year earlier (between-cohort comparison).

Overall, most students remained well-integrated after two weeks of physical distancing and it appeared that while face-to-face interaction was unattainable, digital communication was very common.

These findings are in line with H3, that students perceived both positive and negative changes due to the situation. In between-cohort comparisons of mental health measures no significant differences were observed, although the trends appear similar.\nFinally, we identify factors affecting negative and positive mental health pro-\ngressions.

In addition to supporting protesters\u2019 action, President Donald Trump urged all governors to open up the country\u2019s economy. This echoed the eager of many Republican governors regarding the reopening of the businesses with the argument of the importance of recovering the economy. By contrast, most Democrat governors showed more reluctance with regard to the relaxing of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, claiming the necessity to pursue sanitary policies against the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. As for the American partisans, on April 22 2020, 55% of Republicans against 88% of Democrats supported the stayat-homes orders (see Martina et al., 2020). The debate on the priority given to either the public health or the economy is not new in American politics. Indeed, Republicans are reputed to emphasize the importance of applying policies related to economic growth, while Democrats are more often associated with the emphasize on the importance of pursuing health care policies (e.g., Cornwell et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "1.1 Impact of Political Ideology on Social Reasoning", "text": "Political ideology, defined as a \u201cset of beliefs about the proper order of society and how it can be achieved\u201d (Erikson & Tedin, 2003, p. 64) or as \u201cthe shared framework of mental models that groups of individuals possess that provide both an interpretation of the environment and a prescription as to how that environment should be structured\u201d (Denzau & North, 1994/2000, p. 24), is thought to guide people\u2019s social reasoning according to specific philosophies of life (e.g., Jost et al., 2009). Ideology, which is usually categorized in terms of left-right (or liberalismconservatism) orientations, gathers knowledge patterns of interconnected beliefs, representations and values (e.g., Erikson & Tedin, 2003) and patterns of interconnected epistemic, relational and existential needs (e.g., Jost et al., 2003, 2009). People cannot think and behave in a total consistency with the ideological views belonging to their ideology, since the ideological corpus as well as people\u2019s interests may slightly change over time, situations and contexts (e.g., Jost et al., 2009). However, people often reason in line with \u201ca subset of core values or principles that, for all intents and purposes, may be considered ideological in the sense of being broad postures that explain and justify different states of social and political affairs\u201d (Jost et al., 2009, p. 311). For instance, a meta-analysis conducted on 88 studies (Jost et al., 2003) revealed that political ideology was consistently associated with threat management. More specifically, its results showed that threat-related variables (e.g., death anxiety, fear of threat) were positively related to conservatism, while openness-related variables (e.g., open-mindedness, threat tolerance) were positively related to liberalism. It was also found that death anxiety and perceived dangerousness were positively associated with conservatism (Jost et al., 2003), and that conservatives scored higher on dispositional death anxiety than did liberals (Jost et al., 2007)."}, {"heading": "1.2 COVID-19 Fingerprint in the Political Ideology-Social Reasoning Link", "text": "Beyond the structural contents of political ideology, the acquisition of political reasoning would necessitate the absorption of ideological thinking conveyed by political elites, in the sense that people who perceive themselves as conservative (or liberal) would be likely to adopt social reasoning that are conventionally considered as right-of-center (or left-of-center) (e.g., Federico\n& Schneider 2007; Jost et al., 2009; Lavine & Gschwend 2006). For instance, studies revealed that people identifying themselves as conservative, relative to those identifying themselves as liberal, displayed more positive attitudes toward social gatherings (e.g., Carney et al., 2006; Jost et al., 2008). This echoes the news in the United States showing the greater tendency of conservatives to protest against the physical social distancing and stay-at-home orders.\nInterestingly, even though conservatives would be more likely to experience the\nexistential need to avoid threat, the current news in the United States suggest that the need to avoid the economic crash threat would have overshadowed the need to avoid the death threat related to the COVID-19 virus in conservatives. We then presume that the controversial political position endorsed by conservatives would result from the endorsement of moral disengagement views aiming at legitimating injurious conduct by palliative language (Bandura et al., 2001). Republican elites have recently used several communication strategies that could have made personally or socially acceptable anti-stay-at-home arguments. For instance, President Donald Trump minimized the stay-at-home violation by highlighting the defensive nature of the protesters\u2019 misconduct (\u201cThey\u2019re suffering... they want to get back\u201d, see Burnett & Slodysko, 2020); Bandura et al. (2001) called \u201cminimization of the harm\u201d such a communication strategy. President Donald Trump also contrasted the misconduct with more important inhumanities (\u201cMore people are going to die [\u2026] Our country has to get back to work, otherwise it\u2019s going to be very hard to start it up again\u201d, see Delaney, 2020); a strategy that Bandura et al. (2001) called \u201cadvantageous exonerative comparison\u201d. Lastly, President Donald Trump ignored or distorted the harmful consequences of the anti-stay-at-home policy (\u201cI\u2019m sure that we have doctors that would say, \u2018let\u2019s keep it closed for two years, let\u2019s close it up for two years\u2019\u201d, see Delaney, 2020); a strategy called \u201cmisrepresenting the harm\u201d (Bandura et al., 2001). In the same way as systemjustifying beliefs (e.g., Napier & Jost, 2008; Tyler, 2006), such palliative language intends to activate the deference of citizens and, thus, to generate more (or less) positive (or negative) feelings (e.g., Bandura et al., 2001; Napier & Jost, 2008).\nTherefore, we assume that, relative to Democrats, Republicans would be more (or less)\nlikely to experience positive (or negative) feelings with regard to the COVID-19 virus since they would have developed the view that the virus would be less threatening for the human life. Such a view would have the function to encourage the desire of reopening the businesses through disengaging views."}, {"heading": "1.3 Research Objectives", "text": "The present study aimed at testing the influence of political ideology on perceived biological COVID-19 threat, perceived societal COVID-19 threat, and perceived social gathering acceptability. This study also aimed at examining whether the political belongingness of the state\u2019s governor to a given political party may affect the variables under study, and this directly and through the interaction with people\u2019s political ideology. In addition, the study aimed at testing the covariate (mediating) effect of perceived biological COVID-19 threat in the links of political ideology with perceived societal COVID-19 threat and perceived social gathering acceptability. Our hypotheses are the following:\nHypothesis 1: Political ideology may differentiate the way people view the COVID-19 virus, in the sense that Republicans should be less scared by the virus than would Democrats, during the COVID-19 period.\nHypothesis 2: We expected Republicans, relative to Democrats, to perceive social gathering as more acceptable and less risky for the society, during the COVID-19 period. Hypothesis 3: We expected that Republicans staying in a state governed a Republican would be the least scared people during the COVID-19 period, given their stronger exposure to Republicans\u2019 language palliative. In addition, Democrats staying in a state governed by a Republican should be the most scared people during the COVID-19 period, given their potential expectation that the Republican governor would prematurely end the social distancing and stay-at-home orders. Hypothesis 4: We expected political ideology to affect perceived social gathering acceptability and perceived societal COVID-19 threat through perceived biological COVID-19 threat, during the COVID-19 period. In order to test these hypotheses, the research was designed to differentiate people\u2019s\npolitical ideology in terms of either Republican or Democrat.

This study also aimed at examining whether types of political belongingness (Republican Party and Democratic Party) of the state\u2019s governor could influence, directly and through the interaction with political ideology, perceived COVID-19 threat and perceived social gathering acceptability. Furthermore, this study attempted to see whether perceived COVID-19 threat could account for the link between political ideology and perceived social gathering acceptability. To this end, the research designed aimed at exposing participants to a banned social gathering scenario and at categorizing participants according to Political Ideology and Governor\u2019s Political Belongingness.\nThe factorial analysis revealed that perceived biological COVID-19 threat and perceived\nbiological COVID-19 threat referred to the same variable at the study time. This suggests that the biological nature (i.e., threatening for the human organism) and the societal nature (i.e., rapid spreading of the virus and high risk of the society) of the COVID-19 threat could not be separated at the study time maybe because no vaccine was found yet. Moreover, the ANOVA analyses revealed that levels of perceived COVID-19 threat were lower in Republicans than in Democrats (see Table 2 and Figure 1), while the levels of perceived social gathering acceptability were higher in Republicans than in Democrats (see Table 2 and Figure 1) (hypotheses 1 and 2 supported). These results suggest that, relative to Democrats, Republicans would be not only less scared of the COVID-19 virus, but also more willing to gather themselves (despite the ban) and thus to get back to the \u201cnormal\u201d social life. However, no Political Ideology \u00d7 Governor\u2019s Political Belongingness interaction effect was found, running counter the view that Republicans (or Democrats) staying in a state governed a Republican might be the least (or most) scared people (hypothesis 3 unsupported). This result suggests that the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d debate would essentially occur at the country level, rather than at the state level.\nThe ANCOVA analyses revealed that political ideology influenced perceived social\ngathering acceptability through perceived COVID-19 threat, in the way that Republicans (or Democrats) would be more (or less) inclined to partake in illegal social gatherings because they would be less (or more) scared of the COVID-19 virus (hypothesis 4 supported). Interestingly, the analyses also indicated that, if this covariate effect concerned both Republican and Democratic ideologies, the covariate effect appeared to mostly rely on the Republican ideology. In other words, the relationship between political ideology, perceived biological/societal COVID19, and perceived social gathering was essentially rooted in the Republican ideology. This asymmetry (between types of ideology) may be explained by the diversity of impactful palliative language (e.g., minimization of the harm, misrepresenting the harm) that was recently communicated by Republican political elites, notably President Donald Trump (see Burnett & Slodysko, 2020; Delaney, 2020). These communication strategies may have encouraged Republican partisans to endorse moral disengagement views with regard to the importance of maintaining stay-at-home orders via moving away from the threatening conception of the COVID-19 virus. This echoes, indeed, the saying of the Ohio Senate candidate, Melissa Ackison (Republican Party), that she has \u201cno fear whatsoever\u201d of being contaminated by the COVID-19 virus (see Burnett & Slodysko, 2020).\nIn all, grounded in the sanitary, social and economic context of the COVID-19 pandemic\ncontext in the United States, this study suggests that, relative to Democrats, Republicans would be more inclined to get back to work and normal physical social life because they would be less afraid of being contaminated by the COVID-19 virus, thus echoing the current political debates occurring at the national level. However, this study has limitations. Chief among them is that we did not control the diversity of moral disengagement views, which would have given a glimpse about their implications. Therefore, further studies should take into account their potential roles when investigating the links between types of ideology, perceived COVID-19 threat, and social gathering acceptability during the COVID-19 time.

This research examined how conspiracy mentality may affect compliance with\npreventive health measures necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and the underlying motivations to comply.\nDesign and Method. We conducted two cross-sectional studies (Study 1 N = 762, Study 2 N =\n229) on a French population, measuring conspiracy mentality, compliance with preventive health measures, and perceived risks related to COVID-19. We also measured motivations to comply with preventive measures in Study 2.\nResults. We show that people high in conspiracy mentality are likely to engage in non-\nnormative prevention behaviours (Study 1), but are less willing to comply with extreme preventive behaviours that are government-driven (Study 2). However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non-normative prevention behaviours.\nConclusions. Our studies showcase how people high in conspiracy theorizing may\n(dis)engage with prevention behaviours, but that perceived risk and motivation to protect oneself could increase these individuals\u2019 compliance.\nKeywords: COVID-19; conspiracy mentality; preventive health behaviours; perceived risk;\nmotivation\nLooking out for Myself: Exploring the Relationship Between Conspiracy Mentality, Perceived\nPersonal Risk and COVID-19 Prevention Measures\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus SARS-\nCoV-2 (commonly known as COVID-19) a pandemic (WHO, 2020). At the time of writing, there have been over 2 million confirmed cases worldwide (Dong et al., 2020). Preventive health measures to curb the spread of the virus, implemented by governments around the world, include recommendations of barrier gestures (i.e. frequent hand washing, avoiding shaking hands) to enforced lockdowns where residents are unable to leave their homes except for essential travel (\u00ab Coronavirus: recommendations \u00bb, 2020; Decree regulating movements, 2020). Whilst there are likely to be numerous contributors to (dis)engagement with preventive health measures, one important potential factor could be conspiracy theorizing where people believe power actors are plotting something sinister concerning the virus. In the current research, we explored the relationship between conspiracy mentality and normative (i.e., government-driven) and nonnormative (i.e., not government-driven) preventive behaviours to tackle COVID-19. We also focused on the role of perceived risk of COVID-19 and motivations for preventive behaviours. We examined how the perception of personal risk and the motivation to protect oneself may enhance both normative and non-normative preventive behaviours among people with higher conspiracy mentality. The Psychology of Conspiracy Theories\nConspiracy theories are defined as explanations for events that implicate secretive and\npowerful groups, who cover-up information to suit their own interests (Douglas et al., 2017). Conspiracy theories develop around significant events, such as the death of Princess Diana, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, or the Zika virus (Douglas & Sutton, 2008; Klofstad et al., 2019; Swami et al., 2010; Wood, 2018). COVID-19 provides an ideal context for conspiracy theories to develop, as they tend to arise in threatening moments of crisis that breed uncertainty (van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). Indeed, a range of COVID-19 conspiracy theories exist, such as the proposal that the virus is a bio-\nweapon engineered by the CIA or that it was introduced to make money from its vaccine (Conspiracy Watch, 2020; Duncan, 2020).\nBelief in conspiracy theories is common. A 2019 study found that 43% of French people\nbelieve that health officials are hiding negative effects of vaccines and 27% believe in the Illuminati (Ifop, 2019). In a recent survey on conspiracy beliefs surrounding COVID-19, 26% of French respondents believe it was created in a lab (Ifop, 2020). Researchers consistently find that endorsing one conspiracy theory is strongly predictive of endorsing many others (e.g., Swami et al., 2010, 2011), even when those conspiracy theories are mutually exclusive (Wood et al., 2012). These findings have led several scholars to argue that a general world view \u2013 a conspiracy mentality \u2013 may underpin conspiracy beliefs (e.g., Bruder et al., 2013; Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; Moscovici, 1987). Viewing the world as full of conspiracies can promote belief in conspiracy theories about specific events, like COVID-19.\nSubscribing to conspiracy beliefs can impact citizens in significant ways (see van Prooijen &\nDouglas, 2018). For example, researchers have found that exposure to conspiracy information can reduce intentions to engage in politics (Jolley & Douglas, 2014a). However, others have discovered that conspiracy theories can motivate people to become politically active (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018). In resolving these contradictions, Imhoff et al. (2020) have recently shown that endorsing a conspiracy worldview both decreases intentions to engage in normative (legal) political acts (e.g., voting), and at the same time, increases non-normative (illegal) political acts (e.g., violent protest). They argue that conspiracy beliefs may lead people to disengage from normative methods of interacting with society and thus, non-normative actions become the best option.\nIn a similar vein, Lamberty and Imhoff (2018) found that conspiracy mentality predicted a\npreference for alternative rather than biomedical therapies perceived as promoted by high power institutions. Indeed, in an experimental study, a (fictional) biomedical approach was rated more positively by those high in conspiracy mentality when the approach was supported by a powerless\n(vs. powerful) agent. Other studies have also demonstrated conspiracy beliefs lead to a lower respect of prevention and cure measures using biomedical therapies (e.g., HIV and child vaccination; Bogart & Thorburn, 2005; Jolley & Douglas, 2014b). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that people who subscribe to conspiracy theorizing are more likely to engage in non-normative behaviours, because such behaviours are often supported by the low-power underdog rather than a high power entity, such as the government. It is theoretically plausible, therefore, that individuals high in conspiracy mentality may prefer non-normative preventive behaviours to stop the spread of COVID-19, and be less supportive of normative, government driven measures. Risk Perception and Conspiracy Mentality\nWhilst conspiracy theorizing may discourage people from following normative prevention\nbehaviour, perception of greater risk could suppress this effect. Previous work has showcased that conspiracy believers are motivated by self-interests (e.g., Cichocka et al., 2016) and adopt selfserving behaviours (e.g., Jolley et al., 2019). Klofstad et al. (2019) found conspiracy beliefs were positively correlated with increased concern about Zika. Subscribing to conspiracy theories has also been shown to be associated with psychological factors that could increase feelings of personal risk, such as paranoia (Bruder et al., 2013). One of the defining features of paranoia is increased perceptions of hostility and interpreting ambiguous information in a negative light (Combs et al., 2013), which could result in people high in conspiracy mentality perceiving greater risks to themselves associated with COVID-19.\nConspiracy theories also appeal to people who are high in narcissism (Cichocka et al., 2016).\nPeople high in narcissism express less empathy towards others (Watson & Morris, 1991) and feel their own lives are more important than other people\u2019s (Campbell & Foster, 2007). As a result, conspiracy theories can motivate people to want to protect themselves. For example, people who are high in conspiracy theorizing are more likely to accept political violence towards high powered agents, such as the government, in order to protect themselves (Uscinski & Parent, 2014). Thus, people with heighted conspiracy mentality may only be motivated by the risks associated with\nCOVID-19 if they perceive it as affecting their own health, rather than that of people in society at large. Risk Perception and Preventive Health Behaviours\nThe perception of risk has long been studied in the field of health psychology as a necessary\nmotivator of preventive health behaviours (van der Pligt, 1998), ranging from condom use to dental hygiene (Sheeran et al., 2014). Relevant to the current study, a meta-analysis of 34 studies found a moderate positive correlation between perceived risk of infection and the decision to vaccinate (Brewer et al., 2007). Furthermore, perceived risk increased the decision to vaccinate during the swine flu (A/H1N1) pandemic of 2009 - 2010 (Setbon & Raude, 2010). Vaccination is a preventive, self-protective health behaviour with similar aims to the barrier gestures and confinement orders currently being used to combat COVID-19. Thus, we predict that perceived risk will increase the selfprotective, preventive behaviours that are currently available to individuals. In sum, conspiracy mentality is likely to increase the perceived risk from COVID-19, which may then translate into compliance with preventive health behaviours, but only with the goal of protecting oneself. Current Research\nIn two studies, we tested whether conspiracy mentality predicts engagement in non-\nnormative preventive behaviours, whilst decreasing willingness to engage in normative, government-driven, behaviours to tackle COVID-19. We also explored the role of perceived risk to self and self-serving motivation to protect oneself from COVID-19. Four hypotheses were proposed:\nHypothesis 1: Conspiracy mentality will be positively associated with non-normative\npreventive behaviours (Study 1).\nHypothesis 2: Conspiracy mentality will be negatively associated with normative preventive\nbehaviours (Studies 1 and 2).\nHypothesis 3: The perception of personal risk will act as a mediator between conspiracy\nmentality and non-normative preventive behaviour (Study 1).\nHypothesis 4a: Conspiracy mentality will increase the perception of personal risk, which will\nact as a suppressor between conspiracy mentality and normative preventive behaviour (Study 1).\nHypothesis 4b. Conspiracy mentality will increase the perception of personal risk, increasing\nthe motivation to protect oneself, which will act as a suppressor between conspiracy mentality and normative preventive behaviour (Study 2).\nStudy 1\nThis study was conducted on March 9, 2020 in France. At this point there were 1,412\nconfirmed cases in France, 30 deaths had been reported (Dong et al., 2020), and only gatherings of more than 1,000 people were prohibited (Measures to fight against Covid-19, 2020) Additionally, barrier gestures (not kissing or shaking hands) were strongly recommended by the government as ways to stop the spread of the virus (\u00ab Coronavirus: recommendations \u00bb, 2020). Thus, not shaking hands and not kissing were the normative preventive behaviours at this point. However, certain people were also beginning to take more extreme non-normative measures, such as no longer going to public places. Study 1 aims to study the link between conspiracy mentality, risk, and the adoption of both normative and non-normative social distancing behaviours. We hypothesize that conspiracy is linked to more non-normative preventive behaviours (H1) but to less normative preventive health behaviours (H2). Moreover, we predict that the perception of risk for oneself may lead individuals to adopt more preventive behaviours, resulting in a mediation effect for non-normative behaviours (H3) and a suppressor effect for normative behaviours (H4a). Method Participants\nWe recruited 762 French participants (665 women, 93 men, 4 others), aged between 18 and\n67 years (M = 23.89, SD = 9.96) by posting the questionnaire to Facebook groups associated with different French towns, universities, and political groups. Due to the quickly changing situation around governmental recommendations on COVID-19, all data were collected on the same day. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which demonstrated that the study is suitably powered to detect\nat least a small two-tailed correlation (|r| = .07), with an alpha of 0.05% and a power of .80 (G*Power; Faul et al., 2007).

After giving consent, participants answered questions on conspiracy mentality, risk perception regarding COVID-19, prevention behaviours adopted, and sociodemographic information.1 Measures\nConspiracy Mentality. Five items (from Bruder et al., 2013; used in French by Lantian et al.,\n2016) measured conspiracy mentality, on an 11-point scale ranging from 1 = 0% - Certainly not, to 11 = 100% - Certain. Though its psychometric properties are adequate, Swami et al. (2017) recommend assessing Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire\u2019s structure whenever a global score is to be computed. A principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation indicated the presence of two factors, explaining 75% of the total variance. The first factor, which we called scepticism, included two items: \"I think that many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about.\"; \"I think that politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions.\", r = .59, p < .001. The second factor, which we called conspiracy, included three items: \"I think that government agencies closely monitor all citizens.\"; \"I think that events which superficially seem to lack a connection are often the result of secret activities.\"; \"I think that there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions. \", \u2375 = .81. Since the objective of this article is to study the impact of conspiracy, we will focus on this dimension for the analyses and discussion that follow.2\nPerceived Risk. The perceived risk of contamination of the French population (\"What\npercentage of the French population could be contaminated by COVID-19 this year?\"), of personal contamination (\"What is the percentage risk of you being contaminated with COVID-19 this year?\")\nand of death (\"If you were contaminated, what would be the percentage risk that you would die from COVID-19? \") were measured by single items, as a percentage (from Setbon & Raude, 2010).\nPreventive Health Behaviours. Participants were asked to indicate for seven social\ndistancing behaviours the extent to which they were engaging in these behaviours compared to before the coronavirus crisis, on a scale ranging from 1 = Much less than before to 9 = Much more than before. Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation confirmed the presence of two factors. The first factor referred to normative prevention behaviours (\"kissing someone\"; \"shaking hands\"), r = .78, p < .001. The second factor referred to non-normative prevention behaviours (\"talking to people\"; \"taking public transportation\"; \"going to a restaurant\"; \"going to a gathering in a closed place\"; \"going to a gathering in an open place\"), \u2375 = .78. The scores were reversed so that a higher score corresponds to more adoption of preventive behaviour. Results Links Between Conspiracy, Perceived Risks and Preventive Behaviours\nThe means, standard deviations, and correlations are reported in Table 1 (data from both\nstudies are available at: https://osf.io/ucf4m/?view_only=f99a04d4d20f4b63ae4344bcc9ec591e). Conspiracy was positively correlated with the adoption of non-normative prevention behaviours (supporting H1). In contrast, no association was observed with the adoption of normative prevention behaviours (not supporting H2). Furthermore, conspiracy was associated with a greater perception of risk of contamination of the French population, personal contamination, and risk of death (supporting H3 and H4a).\n[INSERT TABLE 1]"}, {"heading": "Indirect Effects of Conspiracy on Preventive Behaviours through Perceived Risks", "text": "We next wanted to test whether a greater perception of self-risk on the part of higher\nconspiracy believers could explain the adoption of non-normative prevention behaviours (H3), and\nalleviate the disengagement in normative prevention behaviours (H4a). To do so, we conducted a mediation analysis simultaneously considering the perceived risk of contamination of the French population, of the self, and the risk of death as mediators. This analysis was conducted with PROCESS (Hayes, 2013, model 4) with a bootstrap of 5000 and a confidence interval of 95%.3\nThis analysis conducted on normative prevention behaviours showed an indirect effect of\nconspiracy through perceived risk of personal contamination, but not through perceived risk of contamination of the French population or through perceived risk of death, cf.

The hypothesized indirect effect of self-perceived risk was observed, with the adoption of non-normative behaviours explained by increased perception of risk of death (H3). However, H2 was not supported: conspiracy mentality was unrelated to the adoption of normative prevention behaviours. Nevertheless, H4a was supported; there was an indirect effect of conspiracy on normative prevention behaviours via risk of self-contamination. These results suggest that the higher people\u2019s conspiracy mentality, the more likely they are to adopt preventive behaviours when they perceive a risk to themselves. Furthermore, our results partially confirm that conspiracy believers are more likely to adopt non-\nnormative prevention behaviours, but not normative ones. The second study further explores the link between conspiracy mentality and the adoption of extreme prevention behaviour made normative by law (confinement). Furthermore, in order to confirm that conspiracy believers may be more inclined to adopt prevention behaviours for their personal benefit, we measured individuals\u2019 motivations to comply with confinement.\nStudy 2\nStudy 2 was conducted during the first week of total confinement in France. The\ngovernmental confinement order started on March 17 at 12:00pm (Decree regulating movements, 2020), following an exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases. On March 18th there were 9,134 confirmed cases and 244 deaths (Dong et al., 2020). French citizens were ordered to leave their houses only for essential items, required to complete a form stating the purpose of the trip and show it to any public safety officials that questioned them. At this point, behaviours like staying away from public places/transportation, thus obeying the confinement order, became normative. The second study examines the link between conspiracy mentality, risk, motivation for obeying the confinement order, and the adoption of normative preventive health behaviours, in this situation, compliance with confinement. We hypothesized that conspiracy mentality would be linked to less respect of confinement (H2), but that nevertheless, the perception of personal risk could lead to self-protective motivation to obey the confinement order (H4b). Method Participants\nWe recruited 229 French participants (177 women, 51 men, 1 other), aged between 18 and\n74 years (M = 26.91, SD = 12.46). All data was collected between 18th and 23rd March, the first week of confinement. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which demonstrated that the study is suitably powered to detect at least a small two-tailed correlation (|r| = .13), with an alpha of 0.05% and a power of .80 (G*Power; Faul et al., 2007)."}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "Participants were recruited in the same manner as Study 1. After giving consent, participants\nwere asked questions about conspiracy beliefs, the perception of risk related to COVID-19, various elements related to confinement, and sociodemographic information.4 Measures\nVariables From Study 1. We used the same items to measure conspiracy mentality, \u2375 = .86,5\nperceived risk of contamination for the French population, personal contamination, and death.\nConfinement Compliance. Compliance with the confinement rule was measured by a single\nitem \"To what extent do you comply with the confinement measures (limiting movement, limiting social contact)? \"on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = Not all, to 7 = Very Much.\nMotivation to Comply with Confinement. Five motivations were proposed, introduced by\nthe question \"What are your reasons for respecting these measures?\". For each motivation, participants had to answer using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = Not at all, to 7 = Very Much. The motivations were to protect: oneself (\"To protect myself from COVID-19\"); one's close relatives (\"To protect my close relatives (family, friends)\"); vulnerable people (\"To protect people at risk (the elderly, people with certain chronic diseases)\"); French people (\"To protect all French people\"); humanity (\"To protect humanity\"). Results Links Between Conspiracy, Perceived Risks, Motivations and Confinement Compliance\nThe means, standard deviations, and correlations are reported in Table 2. Supporting H2,\nconspiracy was negatively correlated with compliance with confinement. In addition, conspiracy was linked to a higher perceived risk of death, but not to other risks (of contamination of the French population and personal contamination, H4b). Furthermore, conspiracy was linked to a motivation to respect confinement in order to protect oneself, but was not linked to any other motivation (to protect one's relatives, vulnerable people, the French population or humanity, H4b).\n[INSERT TABLE 2]"}, {"heading": "Indirect Effect Through Perceived Risk and Motivation to Comply With Confinement", "text": "We hypothesized an indirect effect of conspiracy mentality on compliance with confinement\nthrough perceived risk to self and motivation to protect oneself, that may alleviate the negative link between conspiracy and compliance with confinement (H4b).

Considering the correlations presented above, we tested the serial mediation model with conspiracy as the predictor, perceived risk of death followed by the motivation to protect oneself as mediators, and compliance with confinement as the dependent variable (Hayes, 2013, model 6), with a 5000 bootstrap and a 95% confidence interval. The indirect effect via perceived risk of death and motivation for oneself was significant, cf. Figure 3. The path through the perceived risk of death only, or through motivation for oneself only, were not significant.\n[INSERT FIGURE 3]"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Study 2 supported H2, that conspiracy mentality is linked to less compliance with\nconfinement measures. The results also provided support for H4b, showing an indirect effect between conspiracy beliefs and compliance with confinement via perceived risk of death and selfmotivation. This indirect effect alleviated the negative link between conspiracy and non-normative behaviour, and thus led conspiracy believers to adopt more normative prevention behaviours.\nThis study therefore complements Study 1 by confirming that people with a heighted\nconspiracy mentality are less inclined to adopt more extreme and legal normative preventive behaviours. In addition, Study 2 supplements Study 1 by showing that the indirect link through the perception of risk is also underpinned by a motivation to protect oneself.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present research examined the impact of conspiracy mentality on the adoption of non-\nnormative (i.e., not government-driven) (H1), and normative (i.e., government-driven) behaviours (H2). Study 1 provides support for H1: those higher in conspiracy theorizing adopt more nonnormative social distancing behaviours, whereas unexpectedly, no link is observed with the normative behaviours (disconfirming H2). However, in Study 2, we do find support for H2 when the normative behaviour is extreme: people who have heightened conspiracy mentality are less likely to comply with confinement. Conspiracy mentality is, therefore, associated with engagement with nongovernment driven behaviours, and there is evidence to suggest it reduces extreme governmentdriven preventive behaviour.\nWe also examined the factors and motivations underlying the adoption of preventive\nbehaviours, particularly perceived risk to self (H3 and H4) and motivation to protect oneself (H4b). Hypotheses were supported: the adoption of preventive behaviours among people with a higher conspiracy mentality was associated with a perception of risk for oneself. Indeed, Study 1 showed that perceived risk of death mediated the link between conspiracy mentality and non-normative behaviours. An indirect effect through perceived risk of personal contamination also contributed to reinforcing the link between conspiracy and normative behaviours. In Study 2, conspiracy mentality was associated with the perception of risk of death, and thus the motivation to protect oneself, contributing to an increased link with confinement compliance. Conspiracy Mentality and (Dis)Engagement in Extreme Behaviours\nWe demonstrate that a key factor in whether people high in conspiracy mentality engage\nwith COVID-19 preventive behaviour is the normative context of that behaviour (i.e., who recommends the behaviour). We found that preventive behaviours, such as avoiding social gatherings, were supported when they were not government-driven (Study 1); but when they were government-driven, those high in conspiracy mentality disengaged (Study 2). Although the effect sizes found in our studies were small, our studies test in a real context the influence of the source\nrecommending prevention health behaviours. When these behaviours are not advocated by the government, people with a strong conspiracy-mentality adopt them, but quickly disengage as soon as they become official, government recommendations. This finding supports previous work that has found people high in conspiracy mentality engage in counter-normative behaviours (e.g., extremist protest) but not in normative behaviours (e.g., voting, Imhoff et al., 2020). By mobilizing similar nonnormative behaviours in Study 1, which became normative in Study 2, our studies shed new light on the impact of the source of preventive behaviours. Thus, people with a greater conspiracy mentality may also adopt behaviours that are beneficial and effective in terms of prevention (the unofficial behaviours in Study 1) if they are not defended by an official authority.\nAdditionally, an unexpected factor seems to influence our results: the extreme nature of the\npreventive behaviour. At the time of Study 1, the normative, government-driven behaviours were simply to stop shaking hands and kissing, relatively common behaviours. However, non-normative behaviours in Study 1 (avoiding public places), which became normative behaviour in Study 2 (confinement), were extreme. Previous research has linked conspiracy mentality with the desire to feel different from others (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2017; Lantian et al., 2017). Desire for uniqueness leads individuals to adopt atypical behaviours (Lynn & Snyder, 2001). Perhaps, then, uniqueness seeking may lead conspiracy theory endorsers to only engage with extreme health behaviours, engagement in non-normative behaviours or disengagement in normative behaviours, but may not affect common, everyday behaviours. The Role of the Perceived Threat and Motivation to Protect Oneself\nWhilst those who subscribe to conspiracy theories disengage with government supported\nbehaviours, we also demonstrate, for the first time in literature to our knowledge, that increases in perceived risk, specifically of death, is linked to greater adoption of government-driven behaviours. This perception of risk reinforces engagement in non-normative preventive behaviours and attenuates disengagement with normative ones. Furthermore, when asked about their motivations for obeying the confinement order, those higher in conspiracy beliefs were more willing to act to\nprotect themselves. Thus, these findings are important because they provide insight into the factors, notably protecting oneself, that may lead to the adoption of effective prevention behaviours among people who are least likely to adopt them.\nHighlighting the risk to others is generally advocated to increase health behaviours (e.g.,\nPechmann et al., 2003). A recent study compares the use of an anti-smoking prevention message focusing on death or social loss (Martin & Kamins, 2019) and shows the social motivation is more effective. Our results suggest an inverse process in people with a conspiracy mentality. Although conspiracy mentality is not particularly related to death anxiety (Bruder et al., 2013), death risk could nevertheless be a driving force motivating one to protect oneself and thus engage in preventive behaviours in threatening contexts. Thus, highlighting the risk to oneself should not be neglected as a method of convincing people with a higher conspiracy mentality to engage in preventive health behaviours. This finding may be particularly useful to policy makers when they consider the best communication message to present health behaviours to the public. For example, if policy makers were to consider minimizing the mention of \u2018governmental authority\u2019 in promoting preventive health behaviours, this could increase the likelihood of compliance by those high in conspiracy mentality. Moreover, compliance may also be increased for those high in conspiracy mentality if emphasis is placed on personal risk."}, {"heading": "Limitations and Future Research Directions", "text": "Although our findings are important, there are some limitations. For example, we used\nmainly single-items measures to keep the questionnaire as short as possible. Although single-items are reliable and widely used in health research (e.g., Brewer et al., 2007), they can decrease the variance of responses (Loo, 2002). Other studies should use multi-item scales to provide complementary results. Moreover, we included a range of preventive behaviours, which guided by factor analyses, grouped the behaviours into normative and non-normative behaviours. However, we did not include any extreme non-normative behaviours - such as the use of bleach which has\nbeen suggested as a way to treat COVID-19 by conspiracy theorists (Broderick, 2020). We did not include these behaviours in the questionnaire as we did not wish to suggest to participants that such alternatives should be considered as a treatment for the virus. Moreover, we did not include questions related to specific conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. Similarly, we did not want to introduce COVID-19 conspiracy theories at a time of crisis (see van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017); thus, we examined conspiracy mentality more broadly, which predicts belief in real-world conspiracy theories (Douglas et al., 2019).\nIn both studies, we uncover a robust, but small effect between conspiracy mentality and\npreventive behaviours. Although the effects are small, we argue that even a small effect could make a large difference when dealing with exponential infection rates. Whilst we have tested our hypotheses in two studies, our findings are based on correlational data, thus, we are unable to examine cause and effect. We considered the conspiracy mentality as a predictor of risks, and this model seem to correspond to our data better than alternative models positioning risk as a predictor of conspiracy (cf. Footnote 3). However, it is also plausible that there are multiple cause-effects links between the variables we studied. It is also possible that another variable influences both conspiracy and perception of risks. Future research could examine the links between conspiracy theorizing and risk using experimental methods to determine causal effects and provide further evidence concerning the size of such effects.\nFuture research could also examine the links between conspiracy beliefs and risk in other\ncontexts. At the time of data collection (March 2020), coronavirus was a close and direct threat, where there was an actual risk to French citizens. Perhaps in a country where coronavirus was a distant threat, and thus, the actual risk was significantly lower, the link between conspiracy mentality, risk and behaviours could be different. Indeed, the suppression effect of risk may not be evident for those high in conspiracy mentality in these countries. It is, therefore, important to understand the boundary conditions of risk in relation to conspiracy theories. In a similar vein, future research could examine how risk impacts conspiracy believers\u2019 engagement in other contexts, such\nas engaging with vaccine uptake and HIV prevention. Such investigations would extend our understanding of risk and conspiracy theorizing. Conclusion\nIn summary, our work has uncovered a link between conspiracy mentality and preventive\nbehaviours to curb the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate that conspiracy mentality is linked to engagement in non-normative prevention behaviours, but reduces compliance with extreme normative prevention. However, the perceived risk to oneself acts as a suppressor, whereby conspiracy mentality is associated with perceiving greater risk, that then results in engagement in normative behaviours. Our results make an important contribution to understanding the role that conspiracy mentality and the perception of risk can play in individuals\u2019 health behaviour responses to a worldwide epidemic.\nReferences\nArr\u00eat\u00e9 du 9 mars 2020 portant diverses mesures relatives \u00e0 la lutte contre la propagation du virus\ncovid-19 [Order of 9 March 2020 laying down various measures to fight the spread of the covid-19 virus], Pub.

When danger is to the self as well as to others two estimates are generated: the risk to oneself and the risk to others. As these estimates likely differ, it is unclear how exactly they drive a response. To answer this question, we studied a large representative sample of Americans facing the COVID-19 pandemic at two time points (N1=1145, N2=683). We discover a paradoxical duality: a tendency to be optimistic about one\u2019s own risk of infection (private optimism) while at the same time to be pessimistic about the risk to others (public pessimism). These two estimates were found to be differentially related to affect and choice. First, private optimism, but not public pessimism, was associated with people\u2019s positive feelings. The association between private optimism and positive affect was mediated by people\u2019s sense of agency over their future. However, negative affect was related to both private risk perception and public risk perception. Second, people predominantly engaged in protective behaviors based on their estimated risk to the population rather than to themselves. This suggests that people were predominantly engaging in protective behaviors for the benefit of others. The findings are important for understanding how people\u2019s beliefs about their own future and that of others are related to protective behaviors and wellbeing.\nKeywords: Pandemic, Decision-making, Optimism, Well-being, Affect, Risk\nThe human tendency for optimism has been well documented (Seligman, 2011; Sharot, Korn, & Dolan, 2012; Taylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower, & Gruenewald, 2000; Weinstein, 1980). For example, people tend to overestimate their financial prosperity (Calderon, 1993) and marriage longevity (Baker & Emery, 1993), while underestimating their risk of disease and other hardships (Weinstein, 1987). What is surprising about such observations is that, anecdotally, people also tend to express pessimism regarding the state of their country, the world and the human race. In general, people are not as optimistic about others\u2019 prospects (Perloff & Fetzer, 1986; Kuzmanovik, Jefferson & Vogeley 2015). The question then arises: when faced with a threat to the self and to others, how would such diverging estimates of risk drive human response? It has been suggested that optimism is related to happiness (Dember & Penwell, 1980) and inversely related to depression and anxiety (Garret et al., 2014; Korn, Sharot, Walter, Heekeren, & Dolan, 2014; Strunk, Lopez, & DeRubeis, 2006). If, however, people express private optimism alongside public despair would the respective effects cancel each other out, or would one factor dominate the other? With regards to behavior, a person\u2019s estimates of vulnerability and future prospects will guide decision making (Krieger, Murray, Roberts, & Green, 2016). For example, underestimating risk of disease leads to reduced medical screenings (Krieger et al., 2016). Yet, a person\u2019s predictions about the vulnerability of society may too drive behavior, especially in cases when a person\u2019s own behavior can help protect others. The consequences of private optimism, side-by-side public pessimism, on people\u2019s well-being and behavior are currently unknown. The possible existence of this paradoxical duality - private optimism alongside public pessimism - raises a second unresolved question: how can we explain such disconnect? We test the hypothesis that the dissociation is related to people\u2019s sense of agency. People tend to feel more optimistic about things they believe they can control (Zakay, 1984). Often this sense of control is overestimated (Langer, 1975; Tobias-Webb et al., 2017). Nevertheless, if people believe their fate is in their own hands they are more likely to believe they can steer the wheel in the right direction. At the same time, people likely acknowledge they have limited control over the fate of their country, or the health and safety of their fellow citizens. Thus, they may be less confident those elements are heading in the right direction. To shed light on the relationship between perception of risk (to the self and other), affect and choice we recorded people\u2019s estimations of danger during the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic. As the pandemic touched most of humanity it made it possible to examine the questions outlined above across a large and diverse population. To that end, we surveyed a representative sample of 1145 Americans across 30 States during March 26-29, 2020, as stay at home orders were being issued across the US (Experiment 1). We then surveyed 683 of them again a month later while all states were under lockdown (Experiment 2 \u2013 April 23-25, 2020). The second survey allowed us to examine if the results of Experiment 1 hold one month into lockdown and also test for changes over time. We tested for the paradoxical existence of private optimism and public pessimism; whether it could be explained by considering people\u2019s sense of agency; and how private optimism and public pessimism were related to people\u2019s well-being and behavior. Understanding the latter was\nparticularly important as governments worldwide were having to strike a balance between ensuring compliance with behavioral regulations to slow the spread of the virus (e.g., socialdistancing, frequent handwashing) and maintaining citizens\u2019 well-being during a time of uncertainty."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Participants, Experiment 1.

In addition to the questions that formed this study, additional information was gathered as part of parallel studies conducted by members of our lab. These focused mostly on habits, personality, psychopathology and other opinions regarding the crisis. We detail the additional information gathered in supplementary material. Below we detail the information gathered via the online survey which is part of the current study. Demographics: Participants indicated their age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, household income, health insurance satisfaction, political orientation, whether they had children and their current place of residence. The latter enabled us to calculated the level of restrictions in the participant\u2019s location (see below). State restrictions. Using information available from each state\u2019s government websites we quantified the level of restrictions in each participant\u2019s state on the date they completed the survey. In particular, we assigned one restriction point to each of the following restrictions and then summed up the points for each state/date: 1) school closure, 2) places of worship closure, 3) non-essential businesses closure, 4) prohibition of social gatherings, 5) prohibition of outdoor walks and runs, 6) official \u201cStay at Home\u201d Order issued. A higher number indicates more restrictions. Relative Private Optimism. Participants were asked to indicate: \u201cRelative to others of your age and gender do you think you are less/more likely to get COVID-19?\u201d on a scale from 1 (much less likely) to 5 (much more likely). Assessing one\u2019s risk relative to others has often being used in the literature as a measure of optimism (Weinstein, 1980). For regressions, mediations and graphs we reverse scored participants\u2019 responses such that high numbers will indicate high private optimism and low numbers low private optimism (that is a 1 became a 5, a 2 became 4 and so on). Public Pessimism. Participants were asked to indicate: \u201cDo you think COVID-19 presents a real danger to the health of the human population?\u201d using continuous visual analogue scale from 0 (not really) to 100 (extreme danger). High numbers indicate public pessimism. Happiness. Participants were asked two question to assess their happiness: (i)\u201cTaken all together, how happy are you with your life these days? Mark your rating relative to the least and most happy time of your life.\u201d Participants were asked to respond on a continuous visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (least happy time of your life) to 100 (most happy time of your life). (ii) \u201cThink about right now. How happy are you at this moment?\u201d. Participants were asked\nto respond on a continuous visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (very unhappy) to 100 (very happy). Results are the same regardless of which question we look at. Thus, we report results of the first question here and of the second in the supplementary. Anxiety. We assessed general anxiety using the short version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Marteau & Bekker, 1992). Compliance measures. Participants rated on a continuous visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (none at all) to 100 (a lot): a) \u201cHow much effort do you make to wash your hands regularly?\u201d; b) \u201cHow much effort do you make to socially distance yourself from others?\u201d; c) \u201cHow much effort do you make to avoid touching your face?\u201d, as well on a continuous visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (zero) to 100 (many times) d) \u201cIn the past week how many times have you been to another person's house ?\u201d; e) How many days this week have you been closer than 1 meter to another person (except those you live with)?\u201d. Items d) and e) were reverse coded to compute a mean score of compliance. Sense of agency. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing sense of agency (Lachman & Weaver, 1998). The questionnaire comprises of two sub-scales; personal mastery and perceived constraints. The personal mastery sub score quantifies a person\u2019s sense of efficacy or effectiveness in carrying out goals. The perceived constraints sub-score quantifies to what extent a person believes there are obstacles or factors beyond one\u2019s control that interfere with reaching goals. To get one score reflecting sense of agency we first inversed the score on the second scale, such that a higher score reflects less perceived constraints. We then averaged the two sub-scores such that a higher score reflects a higher sense of agency. LOT-R.

To rule out that the findings in Experiment 1 were a result of assessing perceptions of \u201cinfection risk\u201d vs. \u201cdanger\u201d rather than assessing perception related to the self vs. the human population, we changed the question assessing \u201cpublic pessimism\u201d.

To quantify behavioral compliance, we averaged each participant\u2019s scores on all compliance questions (see above). Three separate linear regressions were run to assess the effect of relative private optimism and public pessimism on compliance, anxiety, and happiness controlling for all demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, household income, healthcare insurance satisfaction, political orientation, level of education, children, state restrictions). The same regressions were run again with sense of agency as an additional predictor. We also performed two separate regressions to predict relative private optimism and public pessimism from all demographics and two separate regressions to predict relative private optimism and public pessimism from sense of agency controlling for all demographics. Mediation analyses were performed (Baron & Kenny, 1986) to assess the relationship between sense of agency, private optimism, public pessimism and the dependent variables. A multilevel modelling approach was used (Preacher, 2015).

We found clear indication of relative private optimism and public pessimism in our sample. In particular, on average participants perceived their own likelihood of getting COVID-19 to be significantly lower than of others their age and gender (M=2.80, SD=0.88, t(1144)=1805.51, p<0.001). On a population level this result indicates an optimism bias (that is expectations are more optimistic than reality). This is because our representative sample as a whole is unlikely to be less susceptible than others their age and gender to COVID-19. For each individual participant, however, one cannot assert whether the perception that one is less likely to be infected with\nCOVID-19 than others is optimistically biased (that is positive expectations that are unrealistic) or simply optimistic (that is positive expectations of future probabilities which can be realistic or unrealistic). As expected, trait optimism, assessed via the LOT-R scale, which measures optimism about one\u2019s own future, was positively correlated with our measure of private optimism (r(1143)=0.138, p<0.001), but not public pessimism (r(1143)=-0.002, p=0.955). Alongside relative private optimism participants exhibited public pessimism. In particular, on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being the greatest danger to humanity, participants rated the danger COVID-19 poses to the health of the human population as high (M=74.48, SD=20.08), and significantly greater than midscale (t(1144)=41.25, p<0.001). There was a weak correlation between our measures of relative private optimism and public pessimism (r(1143)=0.24, p<0.001). To examine if private optimism was related to people\u2019s sense of agency over their own life we asked subjects to complete the Sense of Control Scale (Lachman & Weaver, 1998), which examines people\u2019s sense of mastery and perceived constraints. As hypothesized, sense of agency was strongly related to relative private optimism. A linear model predicting relative private optimism from sense of agency controlling for all demographic factors revealed a significant effect for sense of agency (\u03b2=0.09, p<0.006, Figure 2a). In contrast, a linear model predicting public pessimism from sense of agency controlling for all demographic factors did not reveal a significant effect for sense of agency (\u03b2=-0.04, p=0.174, Figure 2b). In terms of demographics, females, older individuals and Democrats were all more likely to express both private pessimism (Betas from a model predicting private optimism including all demographic factors and sense of agency: Political Orientation: \u03b2=0.13, p<0.001; Age: \u03b2=-0.11, p=0.001; Gender: \u03b2=-0.08, p=0.008, Figure 2a) and public pessimism (Betas from a model including all demographic factors and sense of agency: Political Orientation: \u03b2=-0.25, p<0.001; Age: \u03b2=0.11, p<0.001; Gender: \u03b2=0.11, p<0.001, Figure 2b).\npublic pessimism. Regressors are ordered from the strongest to the weakest. **p<0.001, ***p<0.0001, Error Bars SEM.\nThus far we have shown private optimism side by side public pessimism in relation to the health threat of COVID-19. The former was strongly associated with people\u2019s sense of control over their life. We next examine how private optimism and pubic pessimism were related to well-being (happiness and anxiety) and behavior. The relationship between private optimism and happiness is mediated by a sense of agency. We were interested whether and how relative private optimism and public pessimism influence peoples\u2019 sense of happiness in times of crisis. We thus asked our participants to indicate \u201chow happy are you with your life these days?\u201d on a scale from least happy time of my life to most happy time of my life. In general, participants indicated that they were significantly less happy relative to other times of their live (M=48.28, SD=24.60, t(1144)=2.37, p<0.018). Interestingly, while relative private optimism had a significant positive relationship with happiness (Beta from a model predicting relative happiness from relative private optimism, public pessimism and all demographic variables as controls revealed a significant effect for relative private optimism \u03b2=0.09, p<0.007, Figure 3a & b), public pessimism did not (Beta from the same model \u03b2=-0.01, p<0.649, Figure 3a & c). It seems that the belief that one is relatively immune to COVID-19 protected people\u2019s sense of happiness during the crisis (and vice versa), but believing COVID-19 is a threat to the health of the human population did not significantly affect happiness. Adding \u201csense of agency\u201d into the previous model predicting happiness revealed that sense of agency was the variable most strongly associated with happiness. Interestingly, the standardized Beta coefficient signifying the relationship between sense of agency and happiness (\u03b2=0.31, p<0.001) was more than double the size than that of participants\u2019 income and happiness (\u03b2=0.13, p<0.001), which was the next strongest variable associated with happiness. In addition, age, political orientation and satisfaction with health insurance were also related to happiness (age: \u03b2=0.10, p=0.003; political orientation \u03b2=0.06, p=0.059; satisfaction with health insurance \u03b2=0.09, p=0.006) as was relative private optimism (\u03b2=0.06, p=0.045). Those with a sense of agency, relative private optimism, higher income, older individuals, and those satisfied with their health insurance were all less likely to report a negative influence on their happiness due to the COVID19 crisis (Figure 2d). We note that all these factors were included in one model and thus the results indicate independent effects of each variable.\nTo examine if the relationship between relative private optimism and happiness was mediated by participants\u2019 sense of agency, we computed a mediation model, controlling for all demographic variables (see Methods). Indeed, sense of agency partially mediates the effect between relative private optimism and happiness (Figure 3e). This is apparent as when controlling for sense of agency the relationship between relative private optimism and happiness remained significant but reduced in size (total effect: \u03b2=0.09, p=0.007, path c\u2019: \u03b2=0.06, p=0.045). Bootstrapping revealed that the indirect effect was indeed significantly different from 0 (\u03b2=0.02,\np=0.01 [0.01, 0.05]). Relative private optimism was positively related to sense of agency (path a: \u03b2=0.08 p=0.01) and sense of agency predicted happiness when relative private optimism was accounted for (path b: \u03b2=0.30, p<0.001). We did not find evidence for the reverse mediation, that is relative private optimism did not mediate the relationship between sense of agency and happiness (total effect: \u03b2=0.31 , p<0.001; path c\u2019: \u03b2= 0.31, p<0.001; path a: \u03b2=0.08, p=0.01; path b: \u03b2=0.30, p<0.001 , bootstrapped indirect effect: \u03b2=0.01, p=0.08 [-0.0004, 0.01]. The findings suggest that private optimism is related to happiness not only because positive expectations can directly induce positive feelings, but also because private optimism is related to a sense of agency which in itself increases happiness.\nshows that (e) sense of agency partially mediated the relationship between private optimism and happiness. Regressors are ordered from the strongest to the weakest. *p< 0.05, **p<0.001, ***p<0.0001, Error Bars SEM.\nPrivate optimism and public pessimism are related to anxiety. Thus far we showed that relative private optimism, but not public pessimism, was associated with happiness during the COVID-19 crisis. We next examined if these factors were related to a negative affective state \u2013 anxiety, which we measured using the short version of STAI (Marteau & Bekker, 1992). We found that pessimism, both private and public, were strongly associated with high anxiety (Betas in a model including all demographics, relative private optimism: \u03b2=0.13, p<0.001, Figure 4a & b, public pessimism: \u03b2=0.13, p<0.001, Figure 4a & c). This was true also if we added sense of agency into the model, which in itself was negatively associated with anxiety and was the strongest predictor of it (\u03b2=-0.31, p<0.001). In addition, younger individuals, females, Caucasians, individuals with lower income, people not satisfied with their health insurance and Democrats were more anxious (age: \u03b2=-0.17, p<0.001; gender: \u03b2=0.11, p=0.001, ethnicity: \u03b2=0.07, p=0.018, income: \u03b2=-0.06, p=0.049, satisfaction with health insurance: \u03b2=-0.07, p=0.019, political orientation: \u03b2=0.06, p=0.037, Figure 4d).\nTo examine if the relationship between relative private optimism and anxiety was mediated by participants\u2019 sense of agency, we computed a mediation model as described above (Figure 4e). We found that relative private optimism predicts anxiety (total effect: \u03b2=-0.13, p<0.001). When controlling for sense of agency, this effect remained significant but reduced in its effect size, indicating a partial mediation (path c\u2019: \u03b2=-0.10, p<0.001). Relative private optimism was positively related to sense of agency (path a: \u03b2=0.08 p=0.01); those who expressed more optimism expressed more sense of agency. Third, sense of agency predicted anxiety when relative private optimism was accounted for (path b: \u03b2=-0.31, p<0.001). Bootstrapping revealed a significant indirect effect of relative private optimism on anxiety (\u03b2=-0.02, p=0.01 [-0.05, -0.005]). We did not find evidence for the reverse mediation \u2013 that is, private optimism did not mediate the relationship between sense of agency and anxiety (total effect: \u03b2=-0.31 , p<0.001; path c\u2019: \u03b2=0.31, p=0.001; path a: \u03b2=0.08, p=0.012; path b: \u03b2=0.30, p<0.001 , bootstrapped indirect effect: \u03b2=-0.01, p=0.015 [-0.02, 0.00]. Moreover, there was no evidence for sense of agency mediating the relationship between public pessimism and anxiety (total effect: \u03b2=0.13, p<0.001; path c\u2019: \u03b2=0.13, p=0.001; path a: \u03b2=-0.03, p=0.41, path b: \u03b2=-0.30, p<0.001 , bootstrapped indirect effect: \u03b2=0.01, p=0.45[-0.01, 0.03]. The findings suggest that private optimism is related to anxiety not only because positive expectations can directly reduce anxiety, but also because private optimism is related to a sense of agency which in itself reduces anxiety.\nPerception of global risk, rather than private risk, are strongly associated with behavioral response.\nThe above results show that private and public pessimism about COVID-19 are related to anxiety during the crisis. We next examined whether they are also associated with people\u2019s behavioral response to the crisis. To that end we assessed participants\u2019 self-reported compliance with the\nbehaviors advised (or ordered) by government officials in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We found that compliance was high. Participants\u2019 reported putting effort into social distancing, frequent hand washing and avoidance of face touching (respectively: t(1144)=180.39, p<0.001; t(1144)=151.66, p<0.001, t(1144)=83.03, p<0.001, Supplementary Figure 1a). Moreover, they were unlikely to have visited other people\u2019s homes in the last week or to have come within 1 meter of people outside their own residence (respectively: t(1144)=187.15, p<0.001; t(1144)=96.74, p<0.001, Supplementary Figure 1a).\nWe averaged participants\u2019 scores on all these measures such that each participant had one score\nreflecting behavioral compliance. We found that while public pessimism was strongly related\nwith behavioral compliance (Beta in a model including relative private optimism, public\npessimism and all demographic controls \u03b2=0.35, p<0.001, Figure 5a & c), relative private\noptimism was not (\u03b2=0.04, p=0.189, Figure 5a & b). Adding sense of agency into the model did\nnot alter the results, which in itself was not related to behavioral compliance (\u03b2=-0.05, p=0.101,\nFigure 5d). In addition, older individuals and females were more likely to comply (Age: \u03b2=0.14,\np<0.001, Gender: \u03b2=0.12, p<0.001, Figure 5d). The relationship between public pessimism and\nbehavioral compliance could not be explained by high anxiety alone, as even when we add\nanxiety into the model the effect of public pessimism on behavioral compliance remains\nsignificant (Betas in a model including private optimism, public pessimism, anxiety and all\ndemographic controls Anxiety: \u03b2 =0.03, p=0.28, Public pessimism: \u03b2=0.35, p<0.001).\nThese results suggest that while relative private optimism was related positively to happiness and negatively to anxiety, surprisingly it was not associated with behavioral compliance. Public pessimism on the other hand, was associated with behavioral compliance. It seems that participants\u2019 strong view about COVID-19 being a danger to the human race provided the key reason to change behavior to protect the human population."}, {"heading": "Results, Experiment 2", "text": "In Experiment 1 we found divergent effects of private optimism and public pessimism on happiness and behavioral compliance and converging effects on anxiety. To assess private optimism in Experiment 1 we asked participants about their risk of getting infected relative to others.

It is possible that assessing perceptions of \u201cinfection risk\u201d vs. \u201cdanger\u201d was driving the results rather than assessing perception related to the self vs. the human population.

Thus, once again we find that relative private optimism was related positively to happiness and negatively to anxiety, but surprisingly it was not significantly related to behavioral compliance. Once again, sense of agency was associated with private optimism (\u03b2=0.18, p<0.001, Supplementary Figure 2a) and mediated its effects on happiness (bootstrapped indirect effect is significant: \u03b2=0.08, p=0.001 [0.03, 0.12], Supplementary Figure 3e) and anxiety (bootstrapped indirect effect is significant: \u03b2=-0.09, p<0.001 [-0.14, -0.04], Supplementary Figure 4e). The only main divergence between Exp 1 and Exp 2 was that in Exp 2 sense of agency was related also to public pessimism (\u03b2=-0.11, p=0.004, Supplementary Figure 2b). This finding may be explained by the narrative adopted by governments encouraging their citizens to take precautions in order to protect others. People with a high sense of agency may thereby consider the risk to others as lower due to the protective measures they adopt. Experiment 2 shows that relative private optimism and public pessimism are robust irrespective of the exact phrasing of questions and time periods.

First, a month in, anxiety was lower than it was when states were just entering lockdown (Experiment 1: M=46.67, SD=15.57; Experiment 2: M=44.4, SD=15.86; t(682)=5.31, p<0.001, Figure 6a). This result aligns with past studies showing that humans adapt well to adversities and environmental change (Bonanno et al., 2002; Bonanno, Wortman, & Nesse, 2004; Brickman, Coates, & Janoff-Bulman, 1978; Dijkers, 1997; Frederick & Loewenstein, 1999). Participants experienced an increase in their sense of agency (Experiment 1: M=24.32, SD=6.79; Experiment 2: M=24.90, SD=7.75; t(682)=1.92, p=0.055, Figure 6e) and perceived the danger of COVID-19 to humanity as less than they did at the beginning of lockdown (Experiment 1: M=75.54, SD=20.51; Experiment 2: M=70.96, SD=24.79, t(499)=5.21, p<0.001, Figure 6d). They exhibited stable happiness (Experiment 1: M=47.53, SD=24.86; Experiment 2: M=48.56, SD=24.46 t(682)=1.29, p=0.196, Figure 6b) and private optimism (Experiment 1: M=2.78, SD=0.88; Experiment 2: M=2.80, SD=0.88; t(682)=0.39, p=0.70, Figure 6c)."}, {"heading": "Discussion.", "text": "Perceptions of risk can drastically diverge when estimating risk to the self and to others. Here we show that both estimates matter for people\u2019s response, yet in different ways. Surveying a representative sample of Americans over two timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic we found that people expressed private optimism along with public pessimism. People believed they were at significantly lower risk of getting infected than others their age and gender and that their risk of infection, in absolute terms, was somewhat low. At the same time, they believed the risk of infection to \u201ca person\u201d was somewhat high, and posed a significant danger to the health of the human race. We refer to the first finding as \u201cprivate optimism\u201d and the second as \u201cpublic pessimism\u201d.\nWe reveal that private optimism and public pessimism have diverging associations with wellbeing and behavior. First, private optimism but not public pessimism was related to people\u2019s happiness. Individuals who believed they were less at risk than others were happier. However, believing humanity was facing great danger was unrelated to people\u2019s happiness. This suggest that expectations regarding one\u2019s own future are more important for people\u2019s positive affect than expectations regarding the future of humanity. At the same time, both were related to\nnegative affect. This suggests that while perception of public risk relates mostly to negative affect, perception of private risk relates to both positive and negative affect. The relationship between private risk perception and affect (both happiness and anxiety) was found to be mediated by people\u2019s sense of control. Consistent with the notion that a sense of agency drives optimism, individuals who believed they have control over their outcomes were more likely to believe they were at lower risk of being infected. People who believe they have the freedom to make their own fate by controlling their actions would likely believe they can make the right choices to reduce the likelihood of being infected. Those beliefs were strongly associated with people\u2019s happiness, in accordance with suggestions that a sense of control is related to well-being (Langer & Rodin, 1976). At the beginning of the crisis sense of agency was not related to public pessimism, which fit our assumption that even if people believe they can master their own destiny they are unlikely to believe they can control the fate of their species. Surprisingly, however, a month into the crisis an association between a person\u2019s sense of agency and public pessimism emerged. One possible interpretation of this result is related to the narrative adopted by governments encouraging their citizens to take precautions in order to protect others. We speculate that people with a high sense of agency may thereby consider the risk to others as lower due to the protective measures they adopt. Intriguingly, the likelihood that individuals changed their behavior to mitigate risk was related to people\u2019s views regarding the danger the virus posed to people in general, but not significantly related to whether they believed they themselves were at high risk. That is, people who believed the virus posed a great danger to humanity reported putting greater effort in social distancing, hand washing and avoiding touching their faces. This effect remained even when controlling for anxiety and replicated across both time points. We thus speculate that the main motive for behavioral change was reducing the risk to the population as a whole, rather than the risk to the self. This finding, as well as all other main findings, replicate across our two experiments despite using slightly different phrases of key questions. We tested the same participants across the two timepoints - at the beginning of the crisis when states were moving into lockdown (Experiment 1) and a month later when all states were under lockdown (Experiment 2). This enabled us to document changes across time. Consistent with the notion that humans adapt well to adversities and environmental change (Bonanno et al., 2002, 2004; Brickman et al., 1978; Dijkers, 1997; Frederick & Loewenstein, 1999) we observed a positive change in well-being. A month into lockdown anxiety was lower than it was when states were just entering lockdown. Moreover, participants experienced an increase in their sense of agency and perceived the danger to humanity as less than they did at the beginning of lockdown. Private optimism and happiness remained stable. Here we examined people\u2019s perception of a specific threat \u2013 a global pandemic. There is reason to believe, however, that the paradoxical existence of private optimism and public pessimism will generalizes to other threats. For example, following the financial collapse of 2008 polls showed that people expressed pessimism about the financial future of their country while simultaneously expressing relative optimism about their own financial prospects (Ipsos MORI, 2008). With\nregards to climate change, people express relative optimism about the likely effects of climate change in their own region, but pessimism with regards to the effects on their nation and the planet as a whole (Dunlap & Gallup, 1993). Future studies are needed, however, to examine whether the effects on well-being and behavior reported in this study generalize to other threats such as war, financial collapse and climate change. The results of such studies would be important for predicting the impact of such threats on people\u2019s well-being and for understanding when and why people are likely to change their behavior to mitigate risk. For example, similar to the findings reported here, it is possible that the likelihood that people make \u201cgreen choices\u201d is related to their belief that climate change poses a threat to humanity, regardless of whether they believe it poses a personal risk. Such knowledge can be useful for advocates and policy makers in framing information to encourage individuals to select actions that protect themselves and others from natural and man-made threats."}, {"heading": "Declaration of Interests", "text": "The authors declare no competing interests."}]}]
