    "abstractText": "Is nonconscious goal pursuit useful in novel environments? The prevalent view of automaticity and control implies that an unconscious mode of goal pursuit can only reproduce formerly learned actions, and therefore that its usefulness in novel environments is very limited. Our results demonstrate that this conclusion is not always warranted, as nonconscious goal pursuit facilitated participants\u2019 learning of the structure of completely novel environments. Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism\u2019s nonconscious goals. To what degree can people count on unconscious processes to pilot them toward the future they desire, that is, toward their goals? Successfully attaining one\u2019s goals (defined here as desired end states) depends critically on one\u2019s sensitivity to the ever-changing environment and its affordances. Because of the environment\u2019s complexity, however, the crucial task of identifying goal-relevant structures is far from trivial. In the study reported in this article, we examined whether nonconscious goal pursuit (NCGP) can increase the likelihood of learning goalrelevant structures in the environment, thereby boosting the likelihood of goal attainment. One answer to the question we have posed may come from recent dual-system models of reasoning. These models share an all-encompassing assumption that there are two qualitatively different mental systems, one that is associative and one that is rule based (e.g., Evans, 2003; Sloman, 1996; Strack & Deutsch, 2004; but see Keren & Schul, 2007; Osman, 2004). The rulebased system has the ability to reason, deliberate, formulate strategies, and pursue them, and is generally assumed to require consciousness and mental resources. The associative system, in contrast, is assumed to operate automatically, triggering elements from past experience by way of spreading activation. Given these pervasive models, it seems natural to conclude that consciously controlled goal pursuit is delegated to the rulebased system, and hence this form of goal pursuit is viewed as productive, deliberative, and flexible, and as involving intention and conscious monitoring (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2002). Similarly natural is the conclusion that NCGP is delegated to the associative system, and hence this form of goal pursuit is viewed as reproductive, unintentional, and inflexible. Indeed, this is the spirit of recent models of NCGP (e.g., Bargh, 1990; Kruglanski et al., 2002), which adopt the theoretical view that NCGP is based on unintentional and nonconscious reproductions of past associations. Put differently, these models assume that a nonconscious goal can trigger an action (broadly defined) if that action has formerly been chosen to attain that goal. Accordingly, the lion\u2019s share of past research on NCGP has concentrated on overlearned (i.e., strongly associated) means and goals. For example, Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, and Troetschel (2001) found that people who had been primed with the goal of achievement invested more effort than those who had not been so primed (see also Stajkovic, Locke, & Blair, 2006); Aarts, Gollwitzer, and Hassin (2004) found an increase in the help given to people of the opposite sex when the goal of obtaining sex was activated; and Fishbach, Friedman, and Kruglanski (2003) found that people were more likely to refrain from sweet temptations when the goal of dieting was indirectly triggered than when no goal was triggered.

For a system that is very limited in its conscious processing ability (Kahneman, 1973) yet hasmany concurrent goals, such a limitationmay even be detrimental. Our study, then, examined whether this restriction on NCGP can be rejected. Are nonconscious goals beneficial in situations that require mastering novel environments? THE PRESENT RESEARCH Based on the arguments we have just discussed, our general hypothesis was that NCGP can help people achieve their goals even in novel environments, that is, in environments with which they have no prior experience. In particular, we investigated the hypothesis that NCGP can facilitate learning the structure of novel environments. To do this, we examined how NCGP influences performance on implicit-learning tasks. Research on implicit learning has established that humans can learn and use complex patterns of information without intending to learn them and without being aware of the patterns (e.g., Nissen & Bullemer, 1987; Reber, 1967, 1993; for a recent review, see Frensch & R\u00fcnger, 2003). In fact, humans\u2019 ability to learn relations implicitly seems to exceed their ability to process this type of information consciously (cf. Halford, Baker, McCredden, & Bain, 2005). Traditionally, implicit learning was assumed to be a bottomup, unselective, data-driven process (e.g., Cleeremans, 1993; Hayes & Broadbent, 1988). Therefore, researchers assumed it was not influenced by an individual\u2019s goals (cf. Lewicki, Hill, & Czyzewska, 1992). Recent evidence, however, suggests that selective attentionmay play a role in implicit learning (Jiang&Chun, 2003; Jim\u00e9nez & M\u00e9ndez, 1999; Turk-Browne, Junge, & Scholl, 2005). These findings, together with the conjecture that attention is influenced by goal-driven prioritization of information processing (e.g., Eriksen & Hoffman, 1972; Posner, 1980), suggest to us that implicit learning could be affected by the organism\u2019s NCGPs. We hypothesized that NCGP can enhance implicit learning and conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. In both, we examined whether priming an achievement goal affected performance on an implicit-learning task. To prime this goal, we used the \u2018\u2018unrelated experiments\u2019\u2019 paradigm (Chartrand & Bargh, 1996). Briefly, following completion of a first \u2018\u2018experiment\u2019\u2019 (in actuality, a goal-priming procedure), participants were presented with \u2018\u2018the second experiment\u2019\u2019\u2014an implicit-learning task.

            "text": "environments? The prevalent view of automaticity and control implies that an unconscious mode of goal pursuit can only reproduce formerly learned actions, and therefore that its usefulness in novel environments is very limited. Our results demonstrate that this conclusion is not always warranted, as nonconscious goal pursuit facilitated participants\u2019 learning of the structure of completely novel environments. Specifically, two experiments, using markedly different implicit-learning paradigms, demonstrated facilitation of implicit learning when the goal of achievement was primed. We propose that nonconscious goal pursuit can facilitate not only reproductive operations, but also productive ones, and that implicit learning is sensitive to the organism\u2019s nonconscious goals.\nTo what degree can people count on unconscious processes to pilot them toward the future they desire, that is, toward their goals? Successfully attaining one\u2019s goals (defined here as desired end states) depends critically on one\u2019s sensitivity to the ever-changing environment and its affordances. Because of the environment\u2019s complexity, however, the crucial task of identifying goal-relevant structures is far from trivial. In the study reported in this article, we examined whether nonconscious goal pursuit (NCGP) can increase the likelihood of learning goalrelevant structures in the environment, thereby boosting the likelihood of goal attainment.\nOne answer to the question we have posed may come from recent dual-system models of reasoning. These models share an all-encompassing assumption that there are two qualitatively\ndifferent mental systems, one that is associative and one that is rule based (e.g., Evans, 2003; Sloman, 1996; Strack & Deutsch, 2004; but see Keren & Schul, 2007; Osman, 2004). The rulebased system has the ability to reason, deliberate, formulate strategies, and pursue them, and is generally assumed to require consciousness and mental resources. The associative system, in contrast, is assumed to operate automatically, triggering elements from past experience by way of spreading activation.\nGiven these pervasive models, it seems natural to conclude that consciously controlled goal pursuit is delegated to the rulebased system, and hence this form of goal pursuit is viewed as productive, deliberative, and flexible, and as involving intention and conscious monitoring (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2002). Similarly natural is the conclusion that NCGP is delegated to the associative system, and hence this form of goal pursuit is viewed as reproductive, unintentional, and inflexible. Indeed, this is the spirit of recent models of NCGP (e.g., Bargh, 1990; Kruglanski et al., 2002), which adopt the theoretical view that NCGP is based on unintentional and nonconscious reproductions of past associations. Put differently, these models assume that a nonconscious goal can trigger an action (broadly defined) if that action has formerly been chosen to attain that goal.\nAccordingly, the lion\u2019s share of past research on NCGP has concentrated on overlearned (i.e., strongly associated) means and goals. For example, Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, and Troetschel (2001) found that people who had been primed with the goal of achievement invested more effort than those who had not been so primed (see also Stajkovic, Locke, & Blair, 2006); Aarts, Gollwitzer, and Hassin (2004) found an increase in the help given to people of the opposite sex when the goal of obtaining sex was activated; and Fishbach, Friedman, and Kruglanski (2003) found that people were more likely to refrain from sweet temptations when the goal of dieting was indirectly triggered than when no goal was triggered.\nStill, given the dynamic nature of human environments (whether in the physical, the social, or the mental realm), strictly Address correspondence to Baruch Eitam, Ran R.

For a system that is very limited in its conscious processing ability (Kahneman, 1973) yet hasmany concurrent goals, such a limitationmay even be detrimental. Our study, then, examined whether this restriction on NCGP can be rejected. Are nonconscious goals beneficial in situations that require mastering novel environments?"

            "text": "Based on the arguments we have just discussed, our general hypothesis was that NCGP can help people achieve their goals even in novel environments, that is, in environments with which they have no prior experience. In particular, we investigated the hypothesis that NCGP can facilitate learning the structure of novel environments. To do this, we examined how NCGP influences performance on implicit-learning tasks.\nResearch on implicit learning has established that humans can learn and use complex patterns of information without intending to learn them and without being aware of the patterns (e.g., Nissen & Bullemer, 1987; Reber, 1967, 1993; for a recent review, see Frensch & Ru\u0308nger, 2003). In fact, humans\u2019 ability to learn relations implicitly seems to exceed their ability to process this type of information consciously (cf. Halford, Baker, McCredden, & Bain, 2005).\nTraditionally, implicit learning was assumed to be a bottomup, unselective, data-driven process (e.g., Cleeremans, 1993; Hayes & Broadbent, 1988). Therefore, researchers assumed it was not influenced by an individual\u2019s goals (cf. Lewicki, Hill, & Czyzewska, 1992). Recent evidence, however, suggests that selective attentionmay play a role in implicit learning (Jiang&Chun, 2003; Jime\u0301nez & Me\u0301ndez, 1999; Turk-Browne, Junge, & Scholl, 2005). These findings, together with the conjecture that attention is influenced by goal-driven prioritization of information processing (e.g., Eriksen & Hoffman, 1972; Posner, 1980), suggest to us that implicit learning could be affected by the organism\u2019s NCGPs.\nWe hypothesized that NCGP can enhance implicit learning and conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. In both, we examined whether priming an achievement goal affected performance on an implicit-learning task. To prime this goal, we used the \u2018\u2018unrelated experiments\u2019\u2019 paradigm (Chartrand & Bargh, 1996). Briefly, following completion of a first \u2018\u2018experiment\u2019\u2019 (in actuality, a goal-priming procedure), participants were presented with \u2018\u2018the second experiment\u2019\u2019\u2014an implicit-learning task.\nEXPERIMENT 1: LEARNING TO CONTROL A DYNAMIC SYSTEM"

            "text": "Upon arriving at the lab, participants were informed that the experimental session consisted of two \u2018\u2018unrelated experiments.\u2019\u2019 The first was introduced as a pilot test in which participants were asked to perform a word-search task. Specifically, participants were given a 10 10 array of letters in which they had to search for 13 target words. In the goal-priming condition, 7 of these words were associated with achievement (ambitious, aspiration, competition, excellence, first, race, andwin). In the control condition, these words were replaced by motivationally neutral ones (carpet, diamond, farm, hat, table, topaz, and window). After completing this task, participants in both groups were thanked and introduced to what was described as the second experiment, in which they were given an implicit-learning task.\nImplicit-Learning Task. The task was modeled after one used by Berry and Broadbent (1984, Experiment 1). A simulation of a dynamic system was presented to participants as a sugar factory, and in each of the 60 trials, participants were asked to reach a production level of 9,000 T of sugar by controlling the number of employees in the factory. Critically, participants were not given the rule that relates the number of employees to sugar production.1 Because the system was dynamic, learning was a necessary condition for attaining the target production value consistently. Participants in past research showed a gradual improvement in their ability to reach the target\u2014that is, they showed learning\u2014but could not fully verbalize the nature of the relationship even after hundreds of trials (e.g., Stanley, Mathews, Buss, & Kotler-Cope, 1989). For this reason, learning in this task is considered largely implicit.\nAwareness Probes. After participants completed the implicitlearning task, we assessed their knowledge of the relation between the number of employees and the factory\u2019s production (henceforth, the structure). Previous research with this paradigm utilized two different methods of assessing knowledge (e.g., Berry & Broadbent, 1984, 1987), and we used both. First, we asked participants to describe, in their own words, what determined sugar production. They were offered a monetary bonus for a correct description. These descriptions were scored on the following scale: 05 no knowledge, 15 partial knowledge, 25 complete knowledge. Next, participants were given five prediction problems. Each provided information about the current production and number of employees and the required target production for the next trial. The task was to determine the number of employees needed to achieve the target. Participants\n1If n is the current trial, then the rule relating the number of employees to production of sugar was {2 [number of employees on trial n] [tons of sugar on trial n 1] 1 noise}, where the noise was equal to 1,000 times 1, 0, or 1 (chosen randomly).\n262 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat EMORY UNIV on April 19, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nwith perfect knowledge of the rule should have been completely successful. Therefore, this measure of explicit knowledge ranged from 0 (no correct answer) to 5 (all answers correct).\nParticipants also answered items about their motivation. Two of these items assessed their explicit motivation to perform the task: \u2018\u2018How important was it for you to succeed in this task?\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018How important was it for you to find a strategy that would allow you to control the factory?\u2019\u2019 The third item assessed participants\u2019 intention to learn the structure by asking them how important it was to \u2018\u2018learn the rule by which the factory operated.\u2019\u2019 Ratings were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important).\nFinally, three items assessed whether participants believed the cover story, and whether they had any suspicion regarding the priming manipulation. First, they were asked to speculate, in their own words, on \u2018\u2018the purpose of the word-search task\u2019\u2019 (which served as the priming manipulation). Next, they were asked \u2018\u2018whether there was anything noteworthy in the wordsearch task,\u2019\u2019 and last, they were asked directly whether the word-search task had affected their performance on the sugarfactory task in any way."

In each trial of the SRT task, participants were shown a circle that appeared in one of four possible locations on a horizontal line on a computer screen. They were instructed to indicate the circle\u2019s location by pressing one of four keys (\u2018\u20183,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u20185,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u20187,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u20189\u2019\u2019). The circle disappeared immediately after the response, and the next circle appeared 200ms later. An error was signaled by a red \u2018\u2018X\u2019\u2019 that appeared in the center of the screen and remained until the participant responded correctly.\nThe task began with a practice block in which the location of the circle was randomly determined. The purpose of this block was to familiarize participants with the task and to discourage them from attempting to learn the sequence explicitly (cf. Reed & Johnson, 1994; Seger, 1997). Next, participants underwent four training blocks. Critically, in these blocks, the sequence of locations in which the circle appeared was fixed. (If \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 indicates the left-most location and \u2018\u20184\u2019\u2019 the right-most, the sequence was 1324323432; see Stadler, 1992). This sequence was repeated five times per block. All blocks were 50 trials long.\nFollowing the four training blocks, participants engaged in three test blocks (50 trials each). In the first and third blocks (henceforth, random blocks), the locations of the circle were randomly determined.2 In the second test block, however, locations followed the fixed sequence used during learning (cf. Seger, 1997).\nIn this paradigm, participants are instructed tomerely react to the individual circles. Nothing in the instructions or the explicit structure of the task indicates the existence of a learnable underlying structure. Hence, learning in this paradigm is considered unintentional.\nAwareness Probes. After participants completed the SRT task, we assessed their awareness and explicit knowledge of the learned sequence. First, they were asked to describe the sequence in their own words (Seger, 1997). These verbal descriptions were scored using slight modifications of Seger\u2019s (1997) scoring criteria. Then, after being informed that the locations were displayed in a fixed sequence, participants were requested to generate a sequence of 10 locations that would follow the fixed sequence (cf. Destrebecqz & Cleeremans, 2001). These locations were indicated graphically. A computerized scoring algorithm assessed the level of fit between each of the generated sequences and the actual sequence used in the training blocks, yielding a knowledge score that ranged from 0 (no knowledge) to 10 (full knowledge).3\nThree items assessed participants\u2019 explicit achievement motivation. First, they were asked to rate how important it was for them to respond quickly. Second, they were asked to rate how important it was for them to respond accurately. A third item asked participants how important it was for them to succeed. A fourth item assessed participants\u2019 intention to learn the sequence, asking how important it was for them to \u2018\u2018learn the rule by which the stimulus locations were determined.\u2019\u2019 All ratings were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important).\nIn addition, participants answered questions measuring their awareness of the goal priming.

As in Experiment 1, participants\u2019 improved learning in the priming condition was not accompanied by an increase in their motivation or in their explicit knowledge.\nTraditionally, implicit learning was considered to be an automatic, unintentional process that is blind to the organism\u2019s goals. In other words, researchers assumed that one implicitly learns structures of the environment whether or not these structures are relevant to one\u2019s goals (e.g., Hayes &Broadbent, 1988). Recently, however, this view has been challenged: It has been shown that implicit learning occurs only for goal-relevant dimensions (Eitam, Schul, & Hassin, 2007; Jime\u0301nez & Me\u0301ndez, 1999; Turk-Browne et al., 2005; see also Frensch & Ru\u0308nger, 2003). The current results lend further support to the emerging view that implicit learning is a motivated process: We manipulated an internal state and showed that implicit learning is affected by the organism\u2019s goals.\nHow do goals affect implicit learning? Currently, few studies provide data to guide an answer to this question, but we offer the following speculation. Past research has suggested that attention plays a role in implicit learning (Jime\u0301nez &Me\u0301ndez, 1999; TurkBrowne et al., 2005; but see Jiang & Leung, 2005). We speculate, therefore, that NCGP of the kind we examined here has access to the regulation of attention, so that processing of goalrelevant information is prioritized. Future research should examine this possibility, and test whether the cognitive system actively searches for goal-relevant structures in the environment and whether such structures are prioritized after being identified as goal relevant.\nWewould like to emphasize two theoretical implications of the current results. First, the results suggest that current models of NCGP should be expanded in a way that will allow them to go beyond reproduction of past associations. Although the current results suggest that NCGP can recruit implicit-learning mechanisms, the exact nature of this recruitment\u2014and hence, the exact nature of the proposed expansion\u2014awaits further investigation. Furthermore, it may well be the case that implicit learning is not the only way in which NCGP can enhance adaptation to changing environments (cf. Hassin, Bargh, & Zimerman, in press). Some of us have previously argued that NCGP can recruit working memory (Hassin, 2005; Hassin, Aarts, Eitam, Kleiman, & Custers, in press).\nSecond, our results suggest that NCGP, which has traditionally been ascribed to the associative reasoning system, can perform functions ascribed to the rule-based system. This suggests that the demarcation between the rule-based and associative systems may not be as clear as previously thought, and calls into question the usefulness of that dichotomy.\nTo conclude, the results of these two experiments reveal an unconscious process that has both an advantage over conscious processing and an ability to serve the organism\u2019s current goals. Such unconscious processes may be responsible for far more of human ability than is yet recognized.\nAcknowledgments\u2014The article is based on parts of the first\nauthor\u2019s dissertation, which was supported by a Golda Meir\nfellowship to the first author and by Israeli Science Foundation\nGrants 846/03 and 1035/07 to R.R.H. and Grant 371/04 to\nY.S.
