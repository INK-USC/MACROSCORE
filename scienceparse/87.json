    "abstractText": "Four studies investigate the role that stereotype threat plays in producing racial distancing behavior in an anticipated conversation paradigm. It was hypothesized that the threat of appearing racist may have the ironic effect of causing Whites to distance themselves from Black conversation partners. In Study 1, participants distanced themselves more from Black partners under conditions of threat, and this distance correlated with the activation of a \u201cWhite racist\u201d stereotype. In Study 2, it was demonstrated that Whites\u2019 interracial distancing behavior was not predicted by explicit or implicit prejudice. Study 3 provides evidence that conceiving of interracial interactions as opportunities to learn may attenuate the negative consequences of threat for Whites. Study 4 found that Whites have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat and that this awareness may mediate the relationship between threat and distance. These results are discussed within a broader discourse of racial distancing and the possibility that certain identity threats may be as important as prejudice in determining the outcomes of interracial interactions.",

            "text": "The Space Between Us: Stereotype Threat and Distance in Interracial Contexts\nPhillip Atiba Goff The Pennsylvania State University\nClaude M. Steele Stanford University\nPaul G. Davies University of British Columbia, Okanagan\nFour studies investigate the role that stereotype threat plays in producing racial distancing behavior in an anticipated conversation paradigm. It was hypothesized that the threat of appearing racist may have the ironic effect of causing Whites to distance themselves from Black conversation partners. In Study 1, participants distanced themselves more from Black partners under conditions of threat, and this distance correlated with the activation of a \u201cWhite racist\u201d stereotype. In Study 2, it was demonstrated that Whites\u2019 interracial distancing behavior was not predicted by explicit or implicit prejudice. Study 3 provides evidence that conceiving of interracial interactions as opportunities to learn may attenuate the negative consequences of threat for Whites. Study 4 found that Whites have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat and that this awareness may mediate the relationship between threat and distance. These results are discussed within a broader discourse of racial distancing and the possibility that certain identity threats may be as important as prejudice in determining the outcomes of interracial interactions.\nKeywords: stereotype threat, racial bias, racial discrimination, social distance, prejudice\nMuch of contemporary research on racial prejudice and discrimination must contend with a paradox. Namely, in the last half century, researchers have found a consistent decline in the expression of anti-Black racial attitudes and a similarly robust maintenance of Black\u2013White racial inequality (Bobo, 1983). Many researchers have explained this paradox by assuming that contaminated \u201chearts\u201d or \u201cminds\u201d are the necessary precondition for racial disparities. Each of these contemporary theories about racial discrimination locates the problem of racial inequality within individual agents and assumes that if there is racism, there must be racists. The present research adopts a more contextual approach to racial inequality and discrimination in order to explain the paradox of diverging racial attitudes and outcomes.\nRather than assuming that contaminated \u201chearts and minds\u201d are solely responsible for racial discrimination, in the present research we hypothesized that one\u2019s concern with appearing prejudiced might have the ironic and unintended consequence of causing racial harms. Of note, research on intergroup contact has frequently assumed that making racially egalitarian values important to an individual is a significant step toward prejudice reduction\n(Allport, 1954). Yet we predict that this same prosocial concern may contribute to racial distancing under conditions where an egalitarian individual becomes concerned with being seen as prejudiced. There is some research to support this hypothesis.\nA growing literature suggests that individuals are aware that they may be negatively stereotyped as racially prejudiced (i.e., Dunton & Fazio, 1997; Plant & Devine, 1998; Vorauer, Main, & O\u2019Connell, 1998). For example, Vorauer and her colleagues have demonstrated that White Canadians spontaneously frame interracial interactions in terms of how they may be stereotyped (Vorauer et al., 1998; Vorauer, Hunter, Main, & Roy, 2000). In a series of experiments examining the relationship between White Canadians and indigenous Canadians, Vorauer and her colleagues demonstrated that White Canadians\u2019 impressions of an interracial interaction and of their out-group partner were influenced by the degree to which they felt they had been stereotyped as prejudiced (Vorauer et al., 1998). Similarly, White Canadians expected to be stereotyped as prejudiced when anticipating interactions with indigenous Canadians (Vorauer et al., 2000).\nIn line with these findings, the present research investigates the possibility that for Whites, the fear of being stereotyped as racially prejudiced by a Black conversation partner may lead individuals to distance themselves from their partner. That is, the fear of being labeled prejudiced could lead to racial distancing.\nA Brief History of Racial Distancing\nPsychologists began studying race relations by examining racially avoidant behaviors and attitudes (Samelson, 1978). This so-called \u201crace psychology\u201d (Duckitt, 1992) focused research on \u201cracial preferences,\u201d the ostensibly natural desire of individuals to\nPhillip Atiba Goff, Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University; Claude M.

Edward Bogardus, who helped pioneer this research, measured racial preference through an index of avoidance attitudes and behaviors. Subsequent researchers, however, disputed Bogardus\u2019s claim that these racial preferences were natural or rational. Psychologists began to study the same outcomes, now labeling them as prejudices, stereotyping, and discrimination (Duckitt, 1992; Samelson, 1978). As psychologists made the shift from race psychology to a psychology of prejudice and discrimination, avoidant behavior became a measure of racial antipathy.\nPerhaps because the study of avoidance and the study of prejudice share a common birthplace, contemporary researchers do not generally distinguish between the two concepts. Research on nonverbal discrimination (Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002; Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1974), reactions to nonconscious stereotyping (Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, & Jetten, 1994), and aversive racism (Gaertner & Dovidio, 1986) have used physical avoidance alternately as evidence of prejudice and a measure of discrimination. Consequently, distancing is often treated as if it were interchangeable with group stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.\nHowever, intergroup distancing may also stem from factors other than prejudiced attitudes. In such contexts, group harms could still be observed even when prejudiced attitudes are weak or nonexistent. That is, to borrow a phrase from the sociologist Bonilla-Silva (2003), there may be \u201cracism without racists.\u201d Therefore, it may be important to analyze intergroup avoidance for its own sake, apart from its use as a measure of prejudice. In the present research, we hypothesize that the stereotype that Whites are racist may contribute interracial distancing even absent interracial animosity. We use stereotype threat theory as a model for this prediction (Steele, 1992).\nA Stereotype Threat Approach\nStereotype threat is the sense of threat that can arise when one knows that he or she can possibly be judged or treated negatively on the basis of a negative stereotype about one\u2019s group (Steele, 1992, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1995). Though primarily applied to the domains of academic achievement, stereotype threat has also been applied to such domains as athletic performance (Stone, Lynch, Sjomeling, & Darley, 1999) and women\u2019s professional aspirations (Davies, Spencer, Quinn, & Gerhardstein, 2002). Stereotype threat requires that an individual be highly identified with a domain, that the individual believe he or she is being evaluated, and that the self-concept be implicated in that evaluation (Steele & Aronson, 1995). In the present research, it is hypothesized that Whites may experience stereotype threat in interracial contexts on the basis of a perception that they could be stereotyped as racist in those contexts.\nResearch by Frantz and colleagues has provided evidence that stereotype threat can have an ironic effect of increasing Whites\u2019 implicit pro-White bias on an implicit association test (Frantz, Cuddy, Burnett, Ray, & Hart, 2004). That is, under conditions where White participants feared being stereotyped as racist, their scores on an implicit association test showed an increased bias in favor of Whites and against Blacks. And, although Richeson and Shelton (2003) do not frame their research in terms of stereotype threat, they have demonstrated a number of behavioral conse-\nquences of Whites\u2019 concern with being seen as prejudiced in interracial interactions. Notably, these effects can be both negative\u2014in particular, decrements in working memory (Richeson & Shelton, 2003; see also Schmader & Johns, 2003)\u2014or positive, such as when highly prejudiced Whites are rewarded by Blacks for making great efforts to correct for their racism (Shelton, Richeson, Salvatore, & Trawalter, 2005). Still, little research has examined the behavioral consequences of stereotype threat for Whites in interracial interactions.\nWe hypothesized that Whites under stereotype threat in interracial contexts would distance themselves from anticipated interaction partners. It is important to note that this stereotype threat approach to interracial distancing is distinct from the \u201chearts and minds\u201d approach. That is, because a stereotype threat account of interracial interactions is definitionally a situationist account, we do not expect that traitlike measures of prejudice\u2014either external or internal\u2014will predict distancing effects. This prediction is a departure from previous research suggesting that implicit prejudice is responsible for nonverbal behaviors in interpersonal settings (e.g., Dovidio, 2001; Dovidio et al., 2002). However, previous research in this area has not simultaneously manipulated threat and measured implicit prejudice. We propose that in cases where Whites experience stereotype threat, this experience may overwhelm preexisting racial attitudes, rendering those attitudes devoid of predictive power. That is, the importance of the situation may trump the importance of individuals\u2019 characteristics when predicting discrimination. This is not, of course, intended to deny the importance of individual differences in prejudice. Rather, it is meant to foreground the relatively underexplored role of situational factors in producing disparate racial outcomes.\nOverview of Studies\nStudy 1 was designed to test the primary hypothesis: that racially tense conversations with Black partners would produce stereotype threat among White participants and in turn would produce physical distancing. Study 2 used the same paradigm to test an alternative hypothesis of the findings in Study 1: that the patterns of avoidance and stereotype activation were due not to stereotype threat but rather to a general anxiety about potentially tense conversations. Study 2 was also designed to replicate another boundary condition of stereotype threat, namely that stereotype threat occurs in conditions where the self is implicated by the stereotype but not in conditions where the self is not implicated (Steele, 1992, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1995).\nStudy 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that shifting participants\u2019 evaluative frameworks could reduce the experience of stereotype threat. It was hypothesized that giving participants learning goals would attenuate the negative consequences of stereotype threat by reducing the evaluative implications of stereotype-confirming behavior. Finally, Study 4 was designed to gauge participants\u2019 conscious access to the experience of stereotype threat. It was hypothesized that Whites\u2019 experience of stereotype threat in interracial interactions was a \u201chot\u201d process and not reducible to \u201ccold\u201d cognitive processes.\nStudy 1\nStudy 1 was designed to examine the effect of stereotype threat on the preferred social distance of White participants in an ex-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npected interracial contact. The principal hypothesis was that when the stereotype of racism was relevant to a potential interaction\u2014 that is, when participants expected to discuss a threatening topic\u2014 Whites would distance themselves from Black partners more than White partners. Under such conditions, it was further hypothesized that stereotype activation would positively correlate with the degree of avoidance."

Women were not included as participants in this study. Previous research has shown that threat and anxiety influence mixed-gender proximity preferences differently than samegender proximity preferences (Ugwuegbu & Anusiem, 1982). Because \u201cBlackness\u201d is most commonly mentally represented by \u201cBlack males\u201d (Goff, Thomas, & Jackson, in press), it was reasoned that Black males would produce the strongest effects. Therefore, only men were recruited for ostensibly same-gender dyads.\nThis experiment took the form of a 2 (race of partners: Black vs. White) 2 (conversation topic: love and relationships vs. racial profiling) between-subjects design. The chief dependent measures were the physical distance participants put between themselves and their conversation partners and the degree to which stereotypes related to their racial identity were cognitively activated by the experimental conditions."

            "text": "Word-stem completion. We hypothesized that participants who were talking about racial profiling would sit farther away from Black partners the more threatened they felt. To measure threat (and rule out the possibility that general White identity or anxiety was driving the effect), we measured the activation of three distinct concepts: White racial identity, negative stereotypes about Whites as racist, and general social anxiety. To measure the activation of these concepts, we used a word-stem completion task similar to that employed in previous stereotype threat research (e.g., Steele & Aronson, 1995). Ten words were chosen for each category\u2014White racial identity, negative stereotypes that Whites are racist, and social anxiety\u2014from pretests involving 157 Stanford undergraduates. In our pretest, 127 participants simply listed words associated with one of the categories. The 25 most common words for each category were then selected and given to 30 participants. These 30 participants rated each word for how strongly related it was to its category. The 10 highest rated words in each category were then selected as target words. All words are listed in the Appendix. These target words were randomly intermixed with 60 filler words that could not be completed as words that would fit any of the three category concepts, creating a sheet of 90 total word stems.\nFor the purpose of analysis, the number of target words a participant completed in each category was recorded. Of those words, the number of target words the participant filled out in a category-relevant manner (e.g., RACIST as opposed to RACKET) was counted. Last, the number of target words filled out in a\ncategory-relevant manner was divided by the total number of target words the participant had completed. This ratio, then, is the measure of concept activation.\nFaces. To convey the race of the participants\u2019 prospective partners, we showed participants Polaroid pictures of their ostensible partners. Pictures of Black and White men were selected from a data set of 20 Polaroids, each of which was rated on stereotypicality and attractiveness. Two Black faces and two White faces were selected such that the Black faces were neither reliably more attractive (M 3.50) than the White faces (M 3.46) nor reliably more stereotypically Black (M 4.57) than the White faces were stereotypically White (M 4.50).\nDistancing measurement. The principal hypothesis was that participants would sit farther away from Black partners than White partners when participants felt under threat of confirming the negative group stereotype. In order to measure this, we asked participants to arrange three chairs\u2014one for themselves and two for their two prospective partners\u2014so that the three of them could have a \u201ccomfortable conversation.\u201d Participants under the stereotype threat of possibly being seen as racist might put more distance between their own chair and the chairs of their two partners when they anticipate their partners are Black as a means of distancing themselves from the interaction. However, another factor could also affect the distance measure: a dispositional preference for some level of distance between all three individuals involved.\nIf participants positioned themselves far away from their partners, then the configuration of chairs would look like there was an odd person out (the isosceles triangle pictured in Configuration 1.1 in Figure 1). However, participants who were dispositionally more comfortable with larger interpersonal distances might also create distance between themselves and their partners. This configuration would look quite different from one created by anxiety specific to the partners and the situation and would look more like the equilateral triangle pictured in Configuration 1.2 in Figure 1. Therefore, to capture the first of these patterns\u2014without the second\u2014we developed a distance index in which the average distance between the participant and his prospective conversation partners (AB distance in Figure 1) was analyzed, covarying for the total distance the participant put between all three chairs (ABC distance in Figure 1). This calculation allows one to capture a participant\u2019s motivation to reduce possible tension, controlling for his individual proximity preferences. That is, by covarying for the total distance between the three chairs, we were able to measure the relative \u201codd-person-out\u201d effect. Individuals who sat close to one partner and far from the other would score similarly to someone who sat equidistant from both partners. Likewise, individuals who sat equally close to both partners but sat the partners far away from each other would score lower than individuals who sat themselves and their partners equidistant from each other. This odd-person-out index gives an estimate of the degree to which the participant\u2019s chair placement reflected specifically a desire to distance himself from the potential interaction partners.\nIt was hypothesized that participants expecting to talk with Black partners about racial profiling would place their own chairs farther away from the chairs of their partners than would participants in any of the other conditions. To further ensure that participants were sitting farther away from their partners rather than in some other configuration (see Figure 1), we computed another index in which Distance C was subtracted from the average of\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nDistances A and B. If participants were distancing themselves from their partners, then [(A B)/2] \u2013 C would be positive. If participants were sitting in some other configuration, then this index would be 0 or negative.\nIn fact, participants who expected to speak with two Black partners about racial profiling scored positively on this index (M 1.74), whereas those who anticipated speaking to Black partners about love and relationships (M \u20131.59) and those who anticipated speaking to White partners about either topic (racial profiling, M \u2013 0.55; love and relationships, M \u2013 0.43) scored negatively. This suggests that participants sat farther away from their partners in the Black/racial-profiling condition and not in any other condition. As the distance scores presented in Figure 2 show, this is precisely what was observed."

After administering the consent and demographic forms, the experimenter took the participant\u2019s picture with a Polaroid instant camera and placed it between two other pictures, ostensibly of the two partners with whom the participant would later have a conversation (no conversation would actually take place).

Pretesting revealed that expecting to talk to two Black males\u2014probably in light of their limited numbers in the student body\u2014tended to arouse suspicion in our participants, especially when they learned that the topic of conversation was racially charged. To combat this suspicion, we told participants that they were participating in an experiment on \u201cdiverse conversations\u201d in which the gender and racial makeup of the groups were manipulated to create diversity. Unfortunately, pretesting also revealed that White participants reported being threatened at the mere mention of diverse conversations. In light of this finding, it was expected that stereotype activation would not differ by condition.\nTopic selection. Participants then chose a topic slip, without looking, from a grab bag. In reality, all slips in the bag stated that the conversation topic would be either racial profiling in the racial profiling condition or love and relationships in the love and relationships condition. Participants were then told that they would be discussing the topic they had picked from the bag.\nDistance measurement. After the topic was selected, participants were given a \u201ccognitive engagement task\u201d\u2014in actuality, the word-stem completion task\u2014ostensibly to ensure that they were taking the conversation and experiment seriously. Participants were asked to complete the task as quickly as possible by finishing each word stem with the first word that came to mind. After 6 min, the word-stem completion sheet was collected, and participants were escorted to the room where the conversation would purportedly take place. Upon arriving, the experimenter feigned frustration at the fact that the three chairs were lined up in the corner of an otherwise featureless room. The experimenter apologized for the inconvenience and then asked participants to set up the chairs \u201cso that the three of [them could] have a comfortable conversation\u201d and instructed them to \u201ctake a seat\u201d in one of the chairs after they had arranged them. The experimenter then left the room, ostensibly to retrieve the other two partners for the conversation. After 1 min, the experimenter returned to the room, probed the\nparticipants for suspicions, thoroughly debriefed them, and thanked them for their participation."

In this condition, the more that words associated with White racism were activated, the farther participants placed their chairs from Black participants.\nNext, a regression analysis was conducted to test whether the relationship between stereotype activation and distance was significantly different in the Black/racial-profiling condition than in all other conditions. In order to perform this test, we created contrast weights for the Black/racial-profiling cell and the other three cells (3, \u20131, \u20131, \u20131). The regression on AB distance, then, included these contrast weights, stereotype activation, and the interaction between the two as predictors, using ABC distance as a covariate. The regression revealed that the relationship between activating the White racist stereotype and participants\u2019 AB distance was significantly stronger in the Black/racial-profiling condition than in all other conditions, B .69, t(77) 2.03, p .05, 2 .05. This suggests that participants\u2019 AB distance was uniquely moderated by worry about being perceived as racist in the Black/racial-profiling condition."

            "text": "In support of the primary hypothesis, participants who were assigned to discuss racial profiling with two Black partners distanced their partners more than did participants in any other condition. In addition, activation of the White racist stereotype remained constant across conditions and was related to distance only for participants who anticipated talking with two Black partners about racial profiling. In this condition, there was a significant correlation between activation of the stereotype and distance such that the more participants activated the stereotype of the White racist, the farther they sat from their anticipated partners. Of note, stereotype activation and distance were related only under conditions of threat. This provides initial support that stereotype threat is an appropriate lens through which to interpret these findings.\nThough these results are consistent with a stereotype threat approach, there is no direct evidence that this pattern is due to a threat to the self. One might argue that a White individual talking with two Black partners about racial profiling does not experience stereotype threat but rather may simply fear that the conversation may become tense or contentious. The resultant aversion to the situation, manifested through increased distance, might therefore reflect an attempt to reduce the contentiousness of the conversation rather than reflecting any threat to the self.\nAdditionally, because Study 1 did not include any measurements of prejudice, the role of implicit or explicit prejudice remained unexplored. Though the random assignment of participants to conditions means it is statistically improbable that the observed pattern of data was due entirely to participants\u2019 levels of internal prejudice, the degree to which internal prejudice could moderate these effect is an important issue to examine. Therefore, Study 2 was designed to test the hypothesis that the self must be threatened\nin order to produce the observed distancing behavior and that prejudice has little role in producing distance in this context.\nStudy 2\nThe first goal of Study 2 was to test directly the hypothesis that the pattern of distance observed in Study 1 resulted from threats to the self. It was again hypothesized that stereotype activation and distance would be related only when participants felt threatened. To test these hypotheses we dropped the love and relationships topic, and racial profiling became the only topic assigned in all conditions. One condition, therefore, was a replication of the racial profiling condition from Study 1. In addition, a condition was added where participants were given instructions immediately before being led to the conversation room (i.e., immediately after completing the word-stem task). The experimenter informed participants that they would be assigned an opinion, be asked to read it aloud, and argue from that perspective during the conversation. Participants were informed that their partners would be explicitly told that the opinions read and argued were assigned and not those of the participant.\nThe language of the opinion was taken from a focus group session where White undergraduates were asked to report the types of arguments they might adopt that would create the largest degree of racial tension with Black students on the topic of racial profiling. Stanford undergraduates rated this opinion as a pro-racialprofiling stance in pretesting.\nHaving students read this pro-racial-profiling position allowed for a strong test of our hypothesis. If participants were simply afraid of taking potentially racist perspectives and, thus, causing contention, being forced to read the opinion might make them all the more likely to sit far away from their prospective Black partners. Therefore, if participants sat equally close to Black and White prospective partners, it would not be because they had been supplied with a position that either was easy to defend or itself defused the racial tensions in the situation.\nTo test the hypothesis that internal prejudices, either explicit or implicit, were not predictive of distance, we had participants complete measures of prejudice before arriving for the anticipated conversation. This allowed for the possible moderating effects of prejudice to be examined.\nThe principal hypothesis of Study 2 was that participants would distance themselves from Black partners more than from White partners when voicing their own opinion but not when reading an assigned opinion. As in Study 1, it was further hypothesized that stereotype activation would positively correlate with distance only under conditions of stereotype threat. Last, it was hypothesized that stable prejudice (both explicit and implicit) would have little if any influence on distance and would not attenuate the relationship between stereotype activation and distance."

            "text": "Study 2 demonstrated that the results of Study 1 were not due only to participants\u2019 reluctance to engage in potentially uncomfortable conversations, and that internal prejudice played little if any role in the observed findings. By directly testing the hypothesis that threats to the self are a necessary part of a stereotype threat phenomenon, in Study 2 we sought to replicate and extend the findings of Study 1. In Study 2, stereotype threat produced a pattern of data such that White participants sat farther away from Black partners than from White partners when discussing racial profiling. Additionally, stereotype activation was related to distance only when participants expected to discuss racial profiling with Black partners. However, when participants were assigned an opinion and their selves were \u201cremoved\u201d from the situation, there was no difference in the degree to which they distanced themselves from their Black or White participants, nor was there a relationship between stereotype activation and distance. Stereotype activation was related to distance only when participants experienced a threat to the self, which supports a stereotype threat interpretation of the data.\nIn addition, neither explicit prejudice, as measured by the MRS, nor implicit prejudice, as measured by the IAT, predicted distance in any condition. Nor did either measure of prejudice moderate the relationship between stereotype threat and distance. Beyond supporting the initial hypothesis that situational threats play a more important role than internal prejudices in predicting behavior it appears that internal prejudices played virtually no role in predicting behavior under conditions of stereotype threat.\nSurprisingly, participants\u2019 scores on the MCP did not predict distancing behavior. One would imagine that those who are most motivated to control the expression of racial prejudice would be the most identified with an antiracist identity and, therefore, be most threatened by the possibility of being seen as racist. How-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\never, there is some evidence to suggest that those who are most identified with being seen as nonprejudiced are also least likely to see threats to the self in interracial contexts. Plant (2004), for instance, found that Whites who were high in motivation to control prejudice also had more positive expectations of interracial interactions when no additional threat was introduced. If that were true of participants in Study 2, then they may have been motivated to expect a positive interaction at the same time that a negative one would be most threatening to their self-concept. Similarly, Vorauer and Ross have demonstrated that those who were most invested in positive intergroup interactions imagined that they were most transparent to an out-group partner (Vorauer & Ross, 1999). This feeling that their true, nonracist self was visible impaired their ability to accurately judge their own behavior.\nThough participants\u2019 motivation to control prejudice was not predictive, the measure of interethnic anxiety was predictive of distance under conditions of stereotype threat, suggesting that general anxiety did contribute to distancing behavior. This finding is consistent with previous literature that suggests that stereotype threat produces increased anxiety whether that anxiety is measured via nonverbal expression (Bosson, Haymovitz, & Pinel, 2004), blood pressure (Blascovich, Spencer, Quinn, & Steele, 2001), or social facilitation (O\u2019Brien & Crandall, 2003). No factors were found to attenuate the relationship between stereotype activation and distancing behavior.\nStudy 3\nWork by Dweck and her colleagues suggests that if ability is conceptualized as an entity (i.e., one simply has it or does not), then poor performance can be seen as an indication that one is inadequate within that domain (Dweck, 1996; Hong, Chiu, & Dweck, 1995). Such a framework is called an implicit entity theory of the domain. However, if ability is conceptualized as learnable and protean, then it stands to reason that doing poorly on a test would not serve as stereotype confirming evidence (Hong, Chiu, & Dweck, 1995). Such a framework is called an implicit incremental theory of the domain. Although the work of Dweck and her colleagues has been shown to have effects on academic perseverance (Dweck, 1996; Hong et al., 1995), a shift in evaluative framework has not yet been proven to reduce stereotype threat in an experimental setting.\nHowever, Vorauer and Turpie (2004) did find evidence that increased evaluative concerns can lead low-prejudiced dominant group members to react negatively toward stigmatized out-groups. Across three studies, Vorauer and Turpie found that when dominant group members were concerned with being evaluated in terms of their privileged social position, it created a \u201cchoking\u201d effect for those who were identified with being nonprejudiced. Vorauer and Turpie discussed these results in terms of intergroup contact and did not measure stereotype activation. Therefore, although their findings are consistent with stereotype threat, a direct application of the theory to these contexts has yet to be attempted.\nStudy 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that a shift in evaluative framework might eliminate the negative consequences of stereotype threat\u2014in this case, within interracial situations. Our rationale was that just as women taking a math test might assume that ability is entitative, so too might Whites in an interracial conversation believe that racial sensitivity is entitative. Being\nnegatively evaluated (either doing poorly on a math test or being seen as racist) with an entitative evaluative framework would result in a strong threat to one\u2019s self-concept. If, on the other hand, one has an incremental theory of the stereotyped domain, then it is less likely that a negative evaluation would be threatening to one\u2019s sense of self. Study 3, therefore, tested the hypothesis that when Whites frame interracial contact in terms of an incremental theory, stereotype threat is eliminated.\nThe primary hypotheses of Study 3 were, first, that in the absence of learning goals, participants would sit farther away from Black partners than from White partners. This was not expected to be the case in the presence of learning goals. Second, as in Studies 1 and 2, it was hypothesized that stereotype activation would be positively correlated with distance under conditions of stereotype threat and, as in Study 2, that no other measurements of prejudice or identity would moderate this relationship.\nHaving already examined the relationship between explicit and implicit prejudice on distance, we included a measure of Black stereotype activation. This was intended to rule out the possibility that whereas stable prejudices might not predict differences in participants\u2019 distance scores, context-specific activation of negative Black stereotypes would."

Study 3 also found support for the hypothesis that shifting the evaluative framework from entitative to incremental can reduce the impact of stereotype threat. There was no evidence that internal prejudice (either explicit or implicit), Black stereotype activation, or motivation to control prejudice contributed to or attenuated the principal findings. Post hoc analyses did find that several factors contributed to participant distance scores. Interethnic anxiety was predictive of participant distance scores. However, none of these factors attenuated the relationship between stereotype activation and distance, suggesting that a stereotype threat framework is still an appropriate one.\nThe robust nature of the principal distance and stereotype activation findings having been demonstrated, there remained a number of outstanding questions. First, the degree to which participants have conscious access to their experience of stereotype threat remained to be tested. Second, Studies 1\u20133 used a paradigm wherein participants either were in racially heterogeneous groups or had lone in-group status. Although this allowed us to covary out individual differences in proximity preference, it introduced the possibility that observed differences in distance were due in part to participants\u2019 \u201ctwo on one\u201d status. Last, Studies 1\u20133 did not incorporate any real interaction between participants and partners. Study 4 was designed to assess whether participants had conscious access to stereotype threat, to assess whether their solo status contributed to the observed distance findings, and to test the phenomenon\u2019s viability when participants actually met their interaction partner.\nStudy 4\nThere were three goals in Study 4. The first was to explore the hypothesis that stereotype threat is consciously accessible. The second was to eliminate the hypothesis that the observed pattern of distance scores in Studies 1\u20133 was due primarily to a \u201csolo\u201d effect rather than to stereotype threat. The third was to ensure that the findings observed in Studies 1\u20133 generalized when participants met the conversation partner. To rule out the possibility that the pattern of distance scores observed in Studies 1\u20133 was due entirely\nto any solo effects, we told participants in Study 4 that they would converse with only one partner, rather than two. This partner was the same Black confederate in all conditions, who participants met shortly before completing the primary dependent variable measures. In order not to arouse suspicion prior to participants\u2019 completing self-report measures asking about their experiences regarding stereotype threat, Study 4 was, like Study 1, a one-session study."

Coders read each participant\u2019s thought-listing task and coded each participant as either a 1 (if he had listed at least one stereotype-relevant thought) or 0 (if he had listed no stereotype-relevant thoughts).

The confederate arrived shortly after the participant and asked whether there was time before the study began to go to the bathroom. The experimenter asked the confederate to wait until the topic had been selected. The participant and confederate then drew slips of paper out of a grab bag one at a time. Each slip had one of five conversation topics on it. After each had drawn one slip, they looked at both and compared. If they had drawn the same slip, they would discuss that topic. If they had drawn different slips, they would place both slips back into the bag and draw again until they both drew the same slip at the same time. In one condition, only \u201cracial profiling\u201d was written on more than one slip, and in the other, only \u201clove and relationships\u201d was written on more than one slip, thus ensuring that the experimenter could decide what topic would be discussed.\nAfter the topic had been chosen, the confederate entered the conversation room, where there was one chair at the center of the room and one chair in the corner. The confederate placed his jacket and book bag on the chair at the center and excused himself to the bathroom. The experimenter then instructed the participant to move the chair in the corner so that \u201cyou and your partner can have a comfortable conversation\u201d while the experimenter retrieved the rest of the study materials. After a short time, the experimenter returned with a thought-listing task and asked the participant to complete it in the next 5 min \u201csince your partner has not returned yet.\u201d After 5 min, the experimenter returned, collected the thoughtlisting task, and handed the participant the ESTS, explaining that he should complete the scale \u201cwhile I go look for your partner.\u201d After completing the ESTS, participants were probed for suspicions, fully debriefed, and thanked for their participation.\nStudy 4 included three specific hypotheses. First, in the absence of learning goals, we expected that participants would sit farther away from their partner when talking about racial profiling than when talking about love and relationships. There would, however, be no such difference when learning goals were present. Second, because the same Black confederate was used in all conditions, we hypothesized that participants would spontaneously generate more stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts when discussing racial profiling, regardless of the presence or absence of learning goals. It was further hypothesized that participants would score higher on the ESTS when discussing racial profiling as opposed to love and relationships. Third, we hypothesized that in the absence of learning goals, participants\u2019 scores on the ESTS would mediate the relationship between topic discussed (racial profiling vs. love and\nrelationships) and social distance. However, this would not be the case in the presence of learning goals."

As hypothesized, participants who anticipated discussing racial profiling were as likely to generate stereotype-threat-related thoughts when learning goals were present (50%) as when learning goals were absent (50%).

To test this hypothesis, we submitted participants\u2019 distance measures to a 2 2 ANOVA with learning goals (present vs. absent) and stereotype-threat-relevant thought listings (present vs. absent) as the predictor variables. Because only 1 participant who was assigned to talk about love and relationships listed a stereotype-threat-relevant thought, the analysis was restricted to participants assigned to talk about racial profiling. This analysis revealed a main effect of learning goals condition, F(1, 24) 7.59, p .01, 2 .24, that was qualified by the predicted two-way interaction, F(1, 24) 7.46, p .01, 2 .24.

When learning goals were present, however, participants who expected to discuss racial profiling sat equally close when they generated stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts (M 45.21) and when they did not generate such thoughts (M 45.12).\nThese findings suggest that participants spontaneously generate stereotype-threat-relevant thoughts and that the generation of these thoughts is related to distance in the absence of learning goals. However, given the fact that no participants who anticipated discussing love and relationships generated threat-relevant thought listings in the absence of learning goals, it was not possible to test the potential mediational role of these thought listings. Additionally, a continuous variable might be better able to capture the relationship between an individual\u2019s subjective experience of threat and distance than would the mere presence of a threat-\nrelevant thought listing.

Because this mediator variable was placed after the primary dependent variable, it can be argued that it is improper to test for mediation, as the study does not have a conventional mediational design. However, recent analytic strategies have defied this convention (Keller & Dauenheimer, 2003).\nWhen Keller and Dauenheimer (2003) found that there was no a priori reason that their dependent variable should influence their mediator variable, they compared the mediational pathways as they hypothesized, as well as \u201creverse\u201d\u2014that is, switching the mediator and dependent variables in the analyses. If this reverse mediation is a less compelling statistical model for the data than the mediational model proposed by the researchers, then the design irregularity is overlooked.\nIn the present research, there was no reason to believe, a priori, that positioning one\u2019s chair would influence the level of stereotype threat one reported. Therefore, the data were submitted to a reverse mediational analysis, with conversation topic as the independent variable, distance as the mediator variable, and explicit stereotype threat score as the dependent variable.

Additionally, participants demonstrated access to their subjective experiences of stereotype threat, and reports of this experience were, in turn, predictive of behavior.\nGeneral Discussion\nRacial prejudice and racial distancing are not the same thing. Though both may lead to racial harms, they can do so via different mechanisms and it is possible for one to exist in the absence of the other. The four studies presented here provide support for the hypothesis that stereotype threat may cause Whites to distance themselves from Blacks. This distancing was unrelated to racial prejudices, either implicit or explicit. When White participants expected to discuss a racially contentious topic with Black partners, the threat of appearing racist caused them to physically distance themselves from those partners in each of the four studies. Both stereotype activation (Studies 1\u20133) and stereotype-threatrelevant thoughts (Study 4) were positively related to distance, such that the more White participants thought about the stereotype, the farther away they moved. However, neither implicit nor explicit measures of prejudice predicted this pattern of distancing (Studies 2 and 3), and no measure of prejudice moderated the role of stereotype threat on distance. Identifying which contexts can overwhelm individual differences in racial attitudes and under what conditions would be a worthy project in light of these results.\nAlso deserving further investigation is the question of subjective experience. Study 4 lends support to the hypothesis that individuals may consciously experience stereotype threat (Marx & Goff, 2005). Although this does not resolve the debate about the relative role of \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d processes in producing performance decrements (Schmader & Johns, 2003; see Wheeler & Petty, 2001), it does suggest that there is an underexplored qualitative component to this phenomenon. The subjective experience of stereotyped targets, therefore, deserves consideration in future research on the topic.\nThe present research also explores new facets of stereotype threat theory. These studies are the first to apply stereotype threat to interracial interactions. These findings suggest a promising salve for the negative consequences of stereotype threat, namely, learning goals (Dweck, 1996; Hong et al., 1995). In Studies 3 and 4, participants who were given learning goals were made to feel that their situation was less evaluative. Participants were therefore protected from the negative consequences of stereotype threat. This suggests an exciting direction for future stereotype threat research. Although stereotype threat may operate differently for different groups and in different contexts, it is possible that adopting learning goals may help in other situations, perhaps because, despite the powerful threats participants experience, they are all the more willing to find ways to be at ease in these important settings.\nIt may be important to note that a shift away from an entitative framework with regard to stereotypes is also a shift away from an essentialist framework of that stereotype. That is, understanding a generalization about one\u2019s group as something other than innate and unchangeable is a departure from the dominant view of stereotypes\u2014that they are related to some essential essence of group members (Cosmides, Tooby, & Kurzban, 2003; Eberhardt & Goff, 2005). This is important because it means that any group-based stereotypes for gender, race, and other \u201cbiologistic\u201d groups are, by default, likely to produce higher levels of stereotype threat owing to the essentialist conception of the group and the consequent stereotypes. A focus on learning may cause evaluations to seem less dire, or it may cause stereotypes to be seen in less essentialist\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nterms, and either of these outcomes may protect one from the negative consequences of stereotype threat. Therefore, regardless of how learning goals protect individuals against the negative consequences of stereotype threat, their utility deserves further investigation.\nApart from advances regarding stereotype threat, the present research suggests that studying racial distancing behavior\u2014 separate from racial prejudice\u2014has utility. Though perceivers are capable of distinguishing between racially prejudiced intent and racial harms (Swim, Scott, Sechrist, Campbell, & Stangor, 2003), social psychologists sometimes do not make this distinction. That is, by conflating racial harms (such as distancing) with racial prejudice, researchers run the risk of ignoring important causes of racial harms. And, though moving a chair may not constitute dire racial injury, it is easy to imagine how similar subtle behaviors could lead to feelings of isolation, or worse, when experienced in the aggregate. In some contexts, such as in an interview or when solving problems as a team, nonverbal behaviors have even been demonstrated to produce racial harms in the moment (Dovidio et al., 2002; Sanchez-Burks, 2002; Word et al., 1974). The present research suggests, then, that racial harms occurring in the absence of racial animus may be no less damaging for their lack of intent."

Although racial prejudice remains a persistent feature of the U.S. social landscape, the present research suggests that there exist contexts that can overwhelm one\u2019s racial biases\u2014or lack thereof. That is not to say that these individuals lack racial prejudice or that racial prejudice is not an important predictor of racial discrimination. But in contexts such as those in the present research, is it objectionable to fear being seen as racist?\nThis question is particularly important if calling an action racist can lead to further racial disparities (e.g., by causing distancing behavior). However, using the term racism might also have certain advantages. For example, it seems difficult to imagine that terms such as stereotype threat, contextual factors, or racial disparities would inspire the kind of moral outrage or rush to respond that the term racism occasions. The fact that participants in these experiments seemed so vigilant to the possibility of appearing racist indicates that they may also be motivated to reduce racism where they observe it.\nFraming racial disparities as racism may influence an agent\u2019s desire to alleviate those racial disparities as well as that individual\u2019s level of stereotype threat. Consequently, framing racial disparities in terms of racism could influence how and even whether the disparity is confronted. It is possible, then, that the term racism itself is due for reexamination. Although racism has been defined in many different ways (for a review, see Collins, 1991; Jones, 1997), it is rare that scholars or laypeople distinguish between racism and racists. Perhaps it is possible to construct a conception of racism that foregrounds the harm being done to one group without simultaneously castigating the members of another. Regardless, although the question of what to call racial harms without racist actors is beyond the scope of this empirical project, it seems an important question for researchers of racial disparities to con-\nsider, as changing our conception of the problem may allow us to form better solutions to it."

            "text": "The present research is a contextual approach to interracial difficulties and is therefore an optimistic one. A stereotype threat approach to interracial contact does not locate racial problems in the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of prejudiced agents. Rather, it suggests that certain features of an interracial context can create identity threats that lead to distancing. And, because the threat is contextual, so too may be the solution. Though social psychologists frequently examine racial discrimination by investigating problems in the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of racist actors, it may be that the metaphorical racial divide is amenable to subtle changes in context. Creating a context in which individuals are free to act out their desire to learn may be enough to bring people together\u2014or at least have the beginnings of a comfortable conversation.\nReferences\nAllport, G.

Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process. As a reviewer, you would gain valuable experience in publishing. The P&C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process.\nIf you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write to the address below. Please note the following important points:\n\u2022 To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review.\n\u2022 To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research.\n\u2022 To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, \u201csocial psychology\u201d is not sufficient\u2014you would need to specify \u201csocial cognition\u201d or \u201cattitude change\u201d as well.\n\u2022 Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1\u20134 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly.\nWrite to Journals Office, American Psychological Association, 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly ."
