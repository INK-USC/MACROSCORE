    "abstractText": "The authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner\u2019s acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners\u2019 inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner\u2019s authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance\u2019s expressions of emotion (Study 5). Relational insecurity may be perpetuated via the intrapersonal cognitive consequences of expressing it.",

Clark Yale University\nThe authors present a model positing that when people are insecure about a relationship partner\u2019s acceptance, they often express emotional vulnerabilities to the partner, which causes them to believe the partner views them as highly vulnerable and insecure. In turn, this belief causes them to doubt the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard, which may perpetuate the experience and expression of insecurity that initiated the process. Prototypes of interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals included partners\u2019 inauthentic expressions of regard (Study 1). Suggesting that these prototypes are applied to personal relationships when vulnerabilities are expressed, those who claimed to have expressed vulnerabilities doubted the partner\u2019s authenticity because they believed that they were viewed as vulnerable (Studies 2A, 2B, and 4). Authenticity doubts in turn predicted perceptions of rejection (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn predicted partner derogation and subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Study 4). An experimental manipulation of reflected appraisals of vulnerability increased doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance\u2019s expressions of emotion (Study 5). Relational insecurity may be perpetuated via the intrapersonal cognitive consequences of expressing it.\nKeywords: close relationships, egocentrism, relationship security, acceptance, emotion expression\nPeople have a strong need to belong in stable and caring relationships (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Reis, Clark, & Holmes, 2004). The perception that a relationship partner values and has positive regard for the self is critical to the perception that one has such relationships, as it fosters confidence in the partner\u2019s motivation to maintain the relationship and to attend to one\u2019s needs (Holmes & Rempel, 1989; Murray, Holmes, & Collins, 2006; Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). Unfortunately, this belief is not a feature of all close relationships. Instead, in some relationships, people chronically doubt that their partners value, accept, and care for them. This is the case even when these doubts are not reflected in the partner\u2019s actual thoughts and affections; many people seem to underestimate a close partner\u2019s acceptance of and regard for the self (Murray, Holmes, Griffin, Bellavia, & Rose, 2001; Murray, Holmes, MacDonald, & Ellsworth, 1998). When it persists, this pessimistic interpretation of a partner\u2019s thoughts and feelings undermines the quality of the relationship both for the self and for the partner (Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri, 1998; Lemay,\nClark, & Feeney, 2007; Murray, Bellavia, Rose, & Griffin, 2003). Moreover, it deprives the self of a potentially important source of self-esteem and affirmation (Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Murray et al., 1998). The current research proposed and tested a theoretical model of a normative process explaining how this type of relationship insecurity persists, even when it is confronted with a truly valuing, loving, and accepting partner.\nThe Expression-Based Authenticity Doubts Model\nWe posit a model of expression-based authenticity doubts. According to this model, when people are, for whatever reason, insecure about a partner\u2019s regard and acceptance, they typically believe that they have behaved in ways that have communicated insecurity and emotional vulnerability to the partner. These beliefs about expressing insecurities and vulnerabilities trigger other cognitions that ultimately perpetuate relationship insecurity. In particular, the knowledge that one has communicated interpersonal vulnerabilities regarding acceptance and rejection in the past causes reflected appraisals of vulnerability, which are beliefs that a partner views the self as interpersonally vulnerable\u2014easily hurt, emotionally volatile, and overly dependent on approval and positive feedback. These reflected appraisals of vulnerability in turn create authenticity doubts\u2014that is, beliefs that a partner expresses more positive regard than he or she truly feels and conceals negative regard. In other words, partners who are presumed to be aware of one\u2019s vulnerabilities are thought to \u201cwalk on eggshells.\u201d These authenticity doubts encourage underestimation of the partner\u2019s actual acceptance and perpetuate the experience of insecurity and expression of vulnerability that initiated this process. Although it is inspired, in part, by research on individual differences, this model posits a normative relationship process; feelings of insecurity in a particular relationship should trigger this process indeEdward P.

This in turn causes her to believe that Jerry is walking on eggshells around her, feigning more positive regard and acceptance than he truly feels, and concealing negative sentiments. In other words, when interpreting his positive expressions, Amanda tends to think that Jerry is \u201cjust saying that\u201d because he views her as sensitive. Ultimately, these doubts about the authenticity of Jerry\u2019s expressions of regard maintain those insecurities regarding Jerry\u2019s acceptance that Amanda initially expressed. Our model is displayed in Figure 1. We describe each path in detail."

            "text": "When people feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance\u2014that is, when they doubt whether they are truly accepted by a partner and when they feel especially emotionally vulnerable to the prospect of rejection by the partner\u2014they often behave in ways that express this insecurity and vulnerability to the partner. During times of high threat, when rejection is currently perceived, they often do so by defensively rejecting the partner in return. Indeed, according to Murray and Holmes\u2019s dependency-regulation model, when people anticipate rejection by a partner, they tend to protect themselves by distancing from the partner and the relationship, which is thought to blunt the pain of rejection (see Murray et al., 2006, for a review). Supporting this model are studies showing that people who doubt a partner\u2019s regard and love react to these insecurities by self-protectively derogating their partner and denying the importance of the relationship (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000; Murray et al., 2001). This self-protection also appears to be expressed behaviorally. For example, those with chronic doubts about a partner\u2019s regard appear to enact cold and hurtful behaviors toward the partner (e.g., criticizing or insulting the partner; Murray et al., 2003) and engage in more conflict (Murray et al., 2000).\nOther indices of insecurity regarding acceptance also predict behavioral expressions of insecurity. Those with attachmentrelated anxiety, who tend to worry about rejection and abandonment from their close relationship partners, appear especially emotionally and behaviorally volatile in response to partner transgressions. They report feelings of anger and hostility and\nappear anxious and stressed when discussing major relationship conflicts with their romantic partners (Simpson, Rholes, & Phillips, 1996). They express intense anger when their partners do not respond supportively to their anxiety (Rholes, Simpson, & Orina, 1999; see also Mikulincer, 1998), and they intend to punish or hurt the partner when the partner responds in ways that may not be seen as supportive (Collins, 1996). Similarly, men high in rejection sensitivity\u2014a disposition to anxiously expect rejection from others\u2014are perceived by their partners as jealous, and rejectionsensitive women are perceived as hostile and unsupportive (Downey & Feldman, 1996, Study 3). Although some of these reactions to felt insecurity may blunt the pain of rejection in the present or provide a short-term sense of vindication, we consider these reactions to be expressions of one\u2019s vulnerability that, when reflected upon later, may initiate cognitions that ultimately perpetuate insecurity.\nDuring times of low threat (when people are willing to risk dependency on a partner because a partner\u2019s rejection is not perceived to be certain), those who feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance may express their vulnerabilities by seeking reassurance regarding their personal qualities and the partner\u2019s affections. According to Coyne\u2019s (1976) interpersonal model of depression, depressed individuals regularly seek this type of reassurance from their relationship partners, and many studies have revealed a strong relationship between depressive symptoms and reassurance seeking (Joiner, Metalsky, Katz, & Beach, 1999). In addition, other indices of chronic insecurity about acceptance, such as anxious attachment (Davila, 2001; Shaver, Schachner, & Mikulincer, 2005) and low self-esteem (Joiner, Katz, & Lew, 1999), also predict seemingly excessive reassurance seeking. In our view, although this behavior may sometimes assuage insecurities about a partner\u2019s regard and affections in the present, upon reflection, it likely initiates cognitions that perpetuate the insecurity.\nOf course, some reactions to relational insecurity may be unconscious (DeHart, Pelham, & Murray, 2004; Sommer & Baumeister, 2002). However, this does not negate our model\u2019s assumption that people are usually aware that they have expressed some of their vulnerabilities in the past. Their awareness can derive from situations in which they consciously expressed vulnerabilities, from reactions of their partners or third-party observers, or from their own reflections on their past reactions. Indeed, the fact that many of the studies reviewed above utilized selfreports supports our assumption that, when people tend to feel insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance, they often believe that they have expressed their insecurity and emotional vulnerability to the partner."

            "text": "The knowledge that one has expressed vulnerability in the past ought to promote reflected appraisals of vulnerability\u2014beliefs that a partner views the self as especially interpersonally vulnerable, including easily hurt, emotionally volatile, and overly dependent on approval and affection. Quite simply, once people think they have expressed heightened vulnerability or sensitivity to a partner, they tend to believe that the partner views them as especially vulnerable or sensitive.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nThe belief that a partner views the self as vulnerable may arise from a purely subjective, intrapersonal process. First, their partners may not have noticed the expressions of vulnerability. Instead, reflected appraisals of vulnerability may arise from egocentric biases such as the spotlight effect and the illusion of transparency. The spotlight effect refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others attend to their behavior (Gilovich & Savitsky, 1999). This bias presumably arises because people presume that what is salient to them\u2014their own behavior\u2014is salient to others (Gilovich, Medvec, & Savitsky, 2000). Similarly, the illusion of transparency refers to the tendency for people to presume that their emotional reactions are more observable than they are (Gilovich & Savitsky, 1999; Gilovich, Savitsky, & Medvec, 1998), an illusion that might be pronounced in close relationships (Vorauer & Cameron, 2002). For those who believe that they have expressed vulnerabilities in the past, these biases may cause them to believe that they are viewed as vulnerable independently of whether the partner actually attended to those expressions.\nSecond, their partners may have attended to the expressions but may not have interpreted them as expressions of an underlying vulnerability. Although perceivers often do infer dispositions from observable behavior, people think that perceivers do this much more than perceivers actually do it (Van Boven, Kamada, & Gilovich, 1999). Indeed, people tend to overestimate the extent to which others make dispositional attributions regarding their attitudes (Van Boven et al., 1999, Study 1) and personality traits (Van Boven et al., 1999, Study 2), and they overestimate the effects of their social blunders or failures on observers\u2019 evaluations (Savitsky, Epley, & Gilovich, 2001).\nThese egocentric processes are likely to mediate the link between expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability. One\u2019s behavioral reactions to insecurity regarding a partner\u2019s acceptance\u2014whether fishing for a compliment, privately derogating the partner following a perceived transgression, avoiding the partner, directly seeking reassurance about the partner\u2019s affections, or openly insulting the partner\u2014are likely salient responses to insecurity in one\u2019s own mind, but the partner may not notice or remember the behavior, may draw fewer dispositional inferences than one assumes, or may interpret the behavior not as an expression of interpersonal vulnerability but rather as evidence of a temporary state caused by situational factors (\u201cshe just had a bad day\u201d). Nevertheless, a focus on one\u2019s own reactions to insecurity may cause one to believe that one is viewed as especially vulnerable. This is not to say that partners do not sometimes detect one\u2019s vulnerabilities. Indeed, there appears to be a kernel of truth in such perceptions (Ruvolo & Fabin, 1999). Rather, our point is that the process by which people conclude that they are viewed as vulnerable and insecure may not depend on the partner\u2019s actual views and often may operate through egocentric perception."

            "text": "The belief that a partner views the self as vulnerable should in turn produce authenticity doubts\u2014suspicion that the partner expresses insincere positive thoughts and feelings, conceals negative thoughts and feelings, and is generally cautious during interaction.\nThis is likely to be the case because people have shared expectations regarding how others react to interpersonally insecure and vulnerable individuals. These expectations, colloquially referred to as walking on eggshells, involve caution about behaving in a manner that would cause the individual to feel rejected. People may expect this type of reaction because of normative desires to have rewarding interactions and avoid negative interactions (see Kelley & Thibaut, 1978; Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996) and to adhere to norms dictating that people should care about and avoid hurting partners\u2019 feelings (see Clark & Mills, 1993). When interacting with an individual who is especially insecure and vulnerable regarding rejection and acceptance, these goals may be facilitated by expressing positive regard, concealing negative thoughts or feelings, and maintaining a cautious stance. Supporting the idea that people perceive others\u2019 expressions as cautious when such caution seems warranted are empirical studies suggesting that people doubt a person\u2019s authenticity when the person appears dependent on incentives controlled by others (e.g., Jones, Jones, & Gergen, 1963; Vonk, 1998, 2002) or when the person appears motivated to avoid hurting others\u2019 feelings (DePaulo & Bell, 1996; Pataki & Clark, 2004).\nThus, people may have prototypes that one person\u2019s interpersonal vulnerability elicits his or her interaction partner\u2019s caution. Such prototypes may become relevant to interpreting a partner\u2019s behavior for those who, as a result of their own prior expressions, believe they are viewed as vulnerable and insecure. Applying such prototypes to their own relationships, they may suspect that their partner is walking on eggshells around them, cautiously suppressing negative thoughts and feelings, and exaggerating their positive thoughts and feelings. By frequently expressing heightened insecurity and emotional vulnerability, what was once a na\u0131\u0308ve theory about how people react to fragile, volatile individuals has become a suspicion about the partner\u2019s behavior."

            "text": "Doubts about the authenticity of a partner\u2019s expressions of regard can undermine confidence in the partner\u2019s regard by creating a disjuncture between the partner\u2019s positive expressions and one\u2019s inferences of the partner\u2019s true thoughts and feelings. Specifically, beliefs that a partner is concealing some negative sentiment or is feigning some positive sentiment allow and even encourage people to perceive more negative regard and less positive regard than is indicated by the actual features of the partner\u2019s behavior.\nIndeed, a tenant of attribution theory is that people view another person\u2019s behavior as a product of his or her dispositions and the external factors that constrain or facilitate that behavior (Heider, 1958; Jones & Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967). People are less likely to infer corresponding attitudes or traits from a target\u2019s behavior if there is another plausible explanation for the behavior, such as a situational constraint on the behavior or a perceived ulterior motive (e.g., Fein, Hilton, & Miller, 1990; Gilbert, Krull, & Pelham, 1988; Jones & Harris, 1967; Miller, Visser, & Staub, 2005). More specifically relevant to the present point, studies suggest people discount expressions of positive feedback when situational factors appear to render targets motivated to provide false feedback (e.g., DePaulo & Bell, 1996; Major, Carrington, & Carnevale, 1984).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nThus, when people believe that their partners are behaving cautiously, they may discount the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard and acceptance as due to this caution rather than seeing such expressions as reflecting authentic positive sentiment. That is, in response to a partner\u2019s compliment or expression of affection, they may think the partner is \u201cjust being nice.\u201d\nLikewise, mundane acts that could signal the partner\u2019s negative regard (i.e., a negative mood) may be perceived as implying more negative regard than is the case because they are thought to occur in a relational context that impedes such behavior. Behaviors are perceived as especially diagnostic of internal dispositions when they contradict observed situational pressures (Gilbert, Krull, & Pelham, 1988; Gilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1988; Jones, Davis, & Gergen, 1961; Kelley, 1967; Schwarz et al., 1991). Thus, when one believes that a partner sees oneself as vulnerable and believes that the partner is cautious about communicating negative regard, partner behaviors that nonetheless are seen as communicating even a tinge of negative sentiment are perceived as indicative of the partner\u2019s more extremely negative latent sentiment (i.e., acting in an apparently cold way despite the presumed countervailing forces).\nIn addition, authenticity doubts may threaten relational security even when the partner\u2019s behavior cannot be perceived as communicating any negative regard whatsoever. People often imagine the presence of dispositions that are perceived to be behaviorally extinguished by situational constraints (Miller et al., 2005). That is, people infer dispositions from behavior in which actors did not engage but very well might have had the situation permitted. The belief that one\u2019s own vulnerability has caused partners to be cautious about communicating any negative thoughts or feelings may serve as a perceived relational constraint that evokes this counterfactual correspondence bias, causing those who believe that partners are cautious to perceive that partners have more threatening sentiments lurking below a constrained congenial surface."

            "text": "We suggest a distinction between the interpersonal processes posited by our model and effects of relatively chronic tendencies to feel secure or insecure regarding acceptance by others in general. Indeed, prior research supports such a distinction. Beyond individual differences in tendencies to feel secure in relationships, people seem differentially (in)secure about acceptance and care from one relationship partner to the next (Barry, Lakey, & Orehek, 2007; Lakey, McCabe, Fisicaro, & Drew, 1996; Lemay & Clark, in press). Moreover, insecurity regarding a particular partner\u2019s acceptance and care tends to predict behavioral expressions of that insecurity independently of individual differences in self-esteem (Murray et al., 2003), which are thought to reflect general tendencies to be secure or insecure about others\u2019 acceptance (Leary & Baumeister, 2000).\nNevertheless, individual differences in interpersonal security are likely to affect our model variables. Indeed, our model is in part derived from and inspired by research involving individualdifferences variables. Individual-differences variables reflecting chronic insecurity about acceptance in general do predict doubts about a specific partner\u2019s regard (Downey & Feldman, 1996; Murray et al., 2000, 2001), expressions of insecurity and vulnerability to partners (Downey & Feldman, 1996; Murray, Rose,\nBellavia, Holmes, & Kusche, 2002; Shaver et al., 2005; Simpson et al., 1996), and discounting of others\u2019 expressions of acceptance (Collins, Ford, Guichard, & Allard, 2006; Marigold, Holmes, & Ross, 2007; Stroebe, Eagly, & Stroebe, 1974). Those who are chronically insecure also may assume that their insecurity is known by partners without thinking that they have previously expressed it, perhaps through a process of projecting their own self-views onto the views others hold of them (Kenny & DePaulo, 1993). Although not the primary focus of our model, we illustrate the possible effect of individual differences (trait insecurity) on model variables in Figure 1. We expect to find evidence for the paths of our process model (Paths a, b, c, and d in Figure 1) even after controlling for these individual differences. In the current research, we tested model paths while controlling for individual differences in self-esteem and attachment-related anxiety."

The belief that they are viewed as vulnerable in turn casts doubt on the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard and acceptance, which is likely to cause individuals who hold such doubts to underestimate their partner\u2019s true regard for and acceptance of them, perpetuating the insecurities and vulnerabilities that they initially expressed.\nWe present six studies testing our model. In Study 1, we tested whether inauthentic expression of regard toward interpersonally vulnerable partners is a normative belief. That is, do people think others in general walk on eggshells around insecure and vulnerable individuals? We expected that people do think this, regardless of whether they themselves tend to be secure or insecure in relationships. In Studies 2A and 2B, we tested effects of knowledge that one has expressed vulnerabilities on reflected appraisals of vulnerability and in turn authenticity doubts, controlling for individual differences in self-esteem (Study 2A) and attachment-related anxiety (Study 2B). In Study 3, we examined effects of authenticity doubts on perceived rejection in romantic and nonromantic relationships, controlling for individual differences in self-esteem. In Study 4, we tested the effects implied by our model using longitudinal data and examined effects after controlling for individual differences in self-esteem and the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity, and regard. In Study 5, we tested one aspect of the model using an experimental methodology, expecting to find effects of experimentally manipulated reflected appraisals of vulnerability on doubts about the authenticity of a new relationship partner\u2019s expressions of emotion.\nStudy 1: Do People Think Others Walk on Eggshells Around Vulnerable Individuals?\nOur model presumes people believe that expressions of regard toward those who are especially insecure and emotionally vulnerable to rejection lack authenticity. This should be the case regardless of whether people themselves tend to be vulnerable (i.e., low self-esteem). Thus, before testing the specific paths of the model in Figure 1, in Study 1, we tested whether people do associate interpersonal vulnerability with partners walking on eggshells.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nMethod"

He or she appears to worry about what other people think about him/her. He/she often \u201creads into things,\u201d thinking that other people see him or her negatively when they actually might not. His/her feelings are easily hurt and he/she often gets angry or upset with others.\nThen, they provided written responses to the prompts \u201cIn your own words, please describe how most people would act around such a person\u201d and \u201cWhy do you think people act this way around this type of individual?\u201d\nPerceptions of general authenticity with a vulnerable individual. Participants read the description presented above and completed a 10-item measure assessing their perceptions of others\u2019 authenticity with this individual using 7-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 7 strongly agree). The items included five that assessed authentic responses (i.e., \u201cPeople would freely express any negative thoughts they have about this person,\u201d \u201cPeople would freely give this person negative feedback or criticism,\u201d \u201cPeople would be honest about how positively they view this person,\u201d \u201cPeople would not worry about upsetting this person,\u201d and \u201cPeople would not really think twice about what they say to this person\u201d) and five that assessed inauthentic responses (\u201cPeople would hide any negative thoughts they have about this person,\u201d \u201cPeople would be reluctant to give this person negative feedback or criticism,\u201d \u201cPeople would pretend that they view this person more positively than they actually do,\u201d \u201cPeople would be cautious about upsetting this person,\u201d and \u201cPeople would be overly careful not to say anything that would upset this person\u201d). The order of items was determined randomly for each participant. Responses to items were averaged to create authentic responding ( .68) and inauthentic responding ( .81) indices.\nPerceptions of general authenticity with a secure individual. Participants were asked to imagine a secure individual using the following instructions:\nSuppose that there is a person who appears to be very confident. He or she does not appear to be overly concerned about what other people think about him/her. He/she tends to assume that other people see him/her positively. He/she tends to not let what other people say bother him/her.\nThen, participants completed the same five authentic items ( .79) and five inauthentic items ( .81) described above.\nPerceptions of specific authenticity with vulnerable individuals. We also included measures to assess the perceived likelihood of specific authentic and inauthentic responses in specific situations.\nParticipants read the following three scenarios depicting interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals: \u201cImagine that someone is very sensitive about his/her appearance. On one particular day, this person doesn\u2019t look all that attractive\u201d; \u201cImagine that someone is very sensitive about whether or not other people like him/her. This person tells a joke that is not very funny\u201d; and \u201cImagine that someone is very sensitive about whether or not other people like him/her. This person says something that offends his/her friend.\u201d For each scenario, two potential responses of the interaction partner were provided, one that was authentic and negative and the other that was inauthentic and more positive. Participants indicated the likelihood of an authentic response (i.e., \u201cHis/her boyfriend/girlfriend tells the truth and tells him/her that he/she doesn\u2019t look attractive,\u201d \u201cHis/her friend doesn\u2019t laugh,\u201d and \u201cThe friend tells this person that he/she was upset,\u201d respectively) and an inauthentic response (i.e., \u201cHis/her boyfriend/girlfriend lies and tells him/her that he/she looks attractive,\u201d \u201cHis/her friend forces a laugh, pretending that it was funny,\u201d and \u201cThe friend says nothing to this person about the incident,\u201d respectively) using 4-point rating scales (1 very unlikely; 2 unlikely; 3 likely; 4 very likely). Whether the authentic or inauthentic response was presented first was randomly determined for each participant and scenario.\nPerceptions of specific authenticity with secure individuals. The same scenarios as described above were presented again, except that the individual was depicted as secure (i.e., \u201cImagine that someone is not overly concerned about his/her appearance,\u201d \u201cImagine that someone is not very worried about what other people think of him/her,\u201d and \u201cImagine that someone is not overly concerned about what other people think of him/her,\u201d respectively). Participants then completed the items described above assessing their perceived likelihood of authentic and inauthentic responses.\nSelf-esteem.

Feigning positivity was defined as statements reflecting a belief that people are overly polite, nice, or complimentary to the vulnerable individual. Caution was defined as statements reflecting a belief that people are cautious about upsetting the vulnerable individual or tailor their communications in such a way as to avoid upsetting the individual. For purposes of comparison, two other types of responses\u2014support and avoidance\u2014also were tallied. These were chosen because other theoretical perspectives suggest that they also may be common reactions to a partner\u2019s insecurity (Clark & Mills, 1993; Collins & Feeney, 2000; Coyne, 1976). Support was defined as statements reflecting a belief that people would provide help or desire to help the insecure person, including behavior (e.g., trying to help the person with his or her insecurity, providing reassurance), motivation (i.e., a desire to help the person or a concern for the other\u2019s welfare), and emotion (i.e., feeling sym-\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npathetic or empathic). Avoidance was defined as statements positing that others would avoid interaction or intimacy with the individual. These categories were not exclusive; a participant\u2019s response could be coded as indicating more than one type of reaction. Intercoder reliability was moderate to substantial for feigning positivity (percent agreement .85; Cohen\u2019s .43), caution (percent agreement .85; Cohen\u2019s .78), avoidance (percent agreement .88; Cohen\u2019s .81), and support (percent agreement .84; Cohen\u2019s .57). The coders subsequently discussed and reconciled their disagreements.\nAs expected, a large proportion of participants (45%) freely indicated that people would behave in a cautious manner around the vulnerable individual. A smaller proportion (18%) freely indicated that people would feign positive sentiment. Many participants (50%) also claimed that others would desire to avoid the insecure individual, and a smaller proportion (21%) indicated that people would be supportive. Thus, cautious responding was perceived to be a common reaction to insecurity, just as common as the outright avoidance emphasized in other models of reactions to insecure and vulnerable individuals (e.g., Coyne, 1976; Downey et al., 1998; Joiner, Metalsky, et al., 1999). Examples of cautious responses include \u201cWould be overly nice to the person so they would not get upset\u201d; \u201cI think most people would be extra careful around this person, as if they were walking on eggshells. I think they would treat this person with \u2018kid gloves\u2019\u201d; \u201cI think most people would tend to either \u2018tip-toe\u2019 around someone like this, trying not to upset them OR be frustrated and just ignore that aspect of the person\u201d; \u201cI would probably act very diplomatically and make a point to choose my words very carefully\u201d; \u201cMost people will treat the person in the same way as one would treat a child- lightly\u201d; and \u201cMost people would be nervous\u2014afraid of doing or saying the wrong thing and \u2018setting him/her off.\u2019\u201d\nA limitation to these data is that most participants provided only one response, likely the most accessible response. Thus, the openended response format may have underestimated the degree to which people expect inauthentic responses. Results from analyses of rating scale data, described next, are not subject to this limitation."

Inauthentic responses were judged to be more likely when with a vulnerable partner than when with a secure partner, F(1, 139) 73.49, p .001, 2 .35, whereas authentic responses were judged to be more likely when with a secure partner than when with a vulnerable partner, F(1, 135) 117.81, p .001, 2 .47.\nThe three-way Interaction Partner Type of Response Type of Scenario interaction was not significant ( p .12), suggesting that this pattern pertained to all three of the situations. Indeed, the Type of Response Interaction Partner two-way interaction was significant in an analysis of each situation: attractiveness situation, F(1, 140) 95.31, p .001; joke situation, F(1, 139) 75.37, p .001; and offense situation, F(1, 139) 45.44, p .001.\nModeration by self-esteem? We retested the ANOVAs described above after including self-esteem as a main effect (a continuous covariate) and as a moderator of all of the other effects. Self-esteem did not moderate the Response Partner interaction predicting general authenticity ( p .45). Self-esteem also did not significantly moderate effects in the specific scenario analysis ( ps .20), and self-esteem was not correlated with any of the open-ended responses ( ps .31).\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nThese results support the idea that walking on eggshells is part of people\u2019s prototypes of interactions with vulnerable people. People appear to believe that others are less willing to express negative thoughts and feelings and are more likely to feign positive thoughts and feelings to especially interpersonally insecure and vulnerable people than to secure people. This was the case using both abstract measures of responding and perceived likelihood of providing specific forms of authentic and inauthentic responses in specific situations. These beliefs were held by people with low and high self-esteem, suggesting that people believe that others walk on eggshells and sugarcoat their responses around interpersonally vulnerable individuals regardless of their own tendencies for interpersonal vulnerability and insecurity.1\nStudies 2A and 2B: Expression and Reflected Appraisals of Vulnerability Predict Authenticity Doubts\nStudy 1 revealed that people tend to expect expressions of regard toward vulnerable individuals to lack authenticity. Our model posits that these expectations are applied to existing relationships when people believe that they have expressed their insecurity and vulnerability to partners. That is, when people believe that they have expressed a high degree of insecurity and vulnerability to partners, they tend to believe that they are viewed as especially vulnerable, volatile, and insecure by the partner (Path b in Figure 1). These reflected appraisals of vulnerability then render these expectations or prototypes relevant to interpreting the partner\u2019s behavior, stirring doubts about the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard (Path c in Figure 1). We expect these effects even after controlling for individual differences in trait insecurity. In Study 2A, we tested these predictions using reports of romantic and nonromantic relationships while controlling for trait self-esteem. In Study 2B, we controlled for attachment-related anxiety\u2014that is, individual differences in worries about abandonment and rejection from close relationship partners (e.g., Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Collins & Read, 1990)."

Two items assessed expressions of negative emotion (i.e., \u201cI have frequently expressed hurt or angry feelings toward this person,\u201d and \u201cI have often acted upset or angry toward this person because of something he/she did or said\u201d); two assessed knowledge of reassurance seeking (i.e., \u201cI often ask this person how he/she truly feels about me,\u201d and \u201cI frequently seek reassurance from this person as to whether he/she really cares about me\u201d), adapted from the reassurance-seeking subscale of the Depressive Interpersonal Relationships Inventory (Joiner & Metalsky, 2001); and one assessed general expression of vulnerability (i.e., \u201cI have often reacted to this person in ways that suggest that I am sensitive about rejection\u201d). Items were completed on 6-point response scales (1 strongly disagree; 6 strongly agree; Study 2A .82; Study 2B .86).2\nReflected appraisals of vulnerability.

Participants completed a 4-item measure of authenticity doubts.

Participants completed a shortened version of the Experiences in Close Relationships\u2014 Revised Adult Attachment Questionnaire (Fraley, Waller, & Brennan, 2000). This scale measures attachment-related anxiety (tendencies to worry about rejection and abandonment) and attachment-related avoidance (discomfort with closeness and intimacy). The five items with responses that were most weakly related to their respective subscale during scale development (see Tables 2 and 3 in Fraley et al., 2000) were eliminated from the questionnaire. The remaining items were completed in a random order. The anxiety measure exhibited adequate internal consistency in Study 2B (anxiety .95). The avoidance scale was not used in the current analyses (but it should be noted that controlling for avoidance did not eliminate any of the effects predicted by our model). Instructions prompted participants to respond according to how they feel about close relationships in general."

A hierarchical regression analysis tested effects of expressions of vulnerability on authenticity doubts in Step 1. We then added reflected appraisals of vulnerability in Step 2. Selfesteem or attachment-related anxiety was controlled in both steps. Results are displayed in Table 1.\nIn both studies, expressions of vulnerability predicted increased authenticity doubts in the first step (Study 2A expression of vulnerability, f 2 0.15; Study 2B expression of vulnerability, f 2 0.03).

Indeed, when we regressed perceived rejection on both self-esteem and general authenticity doubts, general authenticity doubts predicted perceived rejection ( .29, p .05) independently of self-esteem, which was also predictive ( .34, p .01; general authenticity doubts, Cohen\u2019s f 2 0.10). Likewise, when we regressed perceived rejection on both selfesteem and perceived honesty of specific positive feedback, the perceived honesty measure predicted perceived rejection ( .44, p .01), whereas self-esteem did not ( p .17; perceived honesty, Cohen\u2019s f 2 0.16).\nThis study suggests that authenticity doubts predict insecurity regarding the partner\u2019s acceptance independently of the effects of self-esteem (Path d in Figure 1).\nStudy 4: Dyadic and Longitudinal Effects\nStudy 4 was a dyadic longitudinal friendship study that extended the prior studies in three ways. First, we assessed each partner\u2019s regard and care for the other partner. This allowed us to test whether authenticity doubts predict underestimation of the partner\u2019s regard and care (which we expected; Path d in Figure 1). This also allowed us to test whether the subjective perceptions of negative regard and lack of care that are thought to occur as a result of authenticity doubts (Path d in Figure 1) in turn predict derogation of and reduced care for the partner. Derogating and distancing from a partner as a result of relationship threats appear to reflect attempts to protect the self from impending rejection. They co-occur with behavioral forms of distancing, such as responding in a hostile, unsupportive manner (Murray et al., 2006). This distancing response to the insecurity brought about by authenticity doubts may be one means by which relationship-specific insecurity feeds back to affect subjectively felt expressions of vulnerability that initiate our hypothesized cycle (Path a in Figure 1). We controlled for trait self-esteem when testing these links.\nSecond, the longitudinal aspect of Study 4 permitted a test of the cyclical aspect of our model. We expected that the reduced security in the partner\u2019s acceptance presumably brought about by authenticity doubts (Path d in Figure 1) would be carried into the future, perpetuating the cycle by promoting subsequent expressions of vulnerability (Path a in Figure 1). In turn, these subsequent expressions of vulnerability should predict temporal increases in reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts.\nThird, in addition to assessing each partner\u2019s authenticity doubts, we assessed each partner\u2019s appraisals of the other\u2019s vulnerability and each partner\u2019s felt authenticity of his or her own expressions. This allowed us to test our expectations that those who think that they have expressed vulnerabilities believe that they are viewed as vulnerable independently of the partner\u2019s actual views (Path b in Figure 1) and that those who believe they are viewed as vulnerable subjectively construct an inauthentic partner independently of the partner\u2019s reported authenticity (Path c in Figure 1)."

Most analyses using each of these variables produced similar results (except where noted), and responses to these two measures were moderately to highly correlated (T1 r .38, T2 r .55). To simplify presentation of results, they were standardized and averaged to create composite indices of perceived caring and regard (i.e., relationship security) for use in most analyses.\nCaring and regard for partner. Participants also indicated their perceptions of the partner on the same 16 traits using the same 9-point response scales (T1 .82, T2 .85), and they completed an analogous measure of their own caring for the partner (e.g., \u201cI care about this person\u201d; T1 .86, T2 .81). Responses to the two measures were highly correlated (T1 r .45, T2 r .56), and analyses using each of these variables produced similar results. Thus, responses were standardized and averaged to create composite indices of own regard and caring for partner for use in most analyses."

            "text": "A series of path analyses (tested with the SAS CALIS procedure; Hatcher, 1994; SAS Institute, 2002) was used to test our primary hypotheses. Responses were standardized to facilitate comparison of the effects of variables measured on different scales (and doing so did not affect any of our conclusions). First we present concurrent analyses testing hypothesized links among expressions of vulnerability, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity doubts, underestimation of the partner\u2019s caring and regard, and caring and regard for the partner. Second, we tested longitudinal predictions. Third, we tested whether effects of expressions of vulnerability on reflected appraisals of vulnerability\nare independent of the partner\u2019s actual appraisals of vulnerability and whether reflected appraisals of vulnerability in turn predict authenticity doubts independently of the partner\u2019s reported authenticity.\nThe current dyadic dataset involves interchangeable dyad members. That is, there is no consistent, unequivocal way to separate the two members of each dyad. We adopted recommendations by Olsen and Kenny (2006) to test path models involving interchangeable dyads. Specifically, we constrained intercepts, paths, variances, error terms, and any modeled within-member and across-member covariances to be equal for the two members. This appropriately models the members as interchangeable. We initially modeled covariances of the same variable across partners to account for dyadic nonindependence of responses, although insignificant covariances were deleted from the final models (noted as we proceed).\nAs further suggested by Olsen and Kenny (2006), fit indices were modified to remove from the final estimate of fit the influence of modeling interchangeability. The traditional model chisquare test implicitly compares the specified model with a saturated model, one in which all variances and covariances are modeled. An insignificant chi-square typically indicates that the fit of the specified model does not differ significantly from the observed variance\u2013covariance matrix. For interchangeable dyads, the comparison is changed from the observed sample variance\u2013 covariance matrix to a variance\u2013covariance matrix with equality constraints on all covariances, variances, and intercepts across partners (and modeling dyadic interdependence by including cross-partner covariances), termed the I-SAT model (for interchangeable saturated model) by Olsen and Kenny. The modified model chi-square, 2 , is obtained by subtracting the chi-square for the I-SAT model from the chi-square of the tested model, and the modified model degrees of freedom, df , are similarly obtained by subtracting the degrees of freedom of the I-SAT model from the degrees of freedom of the tested model. Hence, this modified chi-square test essentially removes from the fit estimate the effect of modeling interchangeability, and it does so by comparing the specified model with the saturated model after parameters have been constrained to be equal across partners in both models. An insignificant 2 suggests that the estimated model adequately fits the equality-constrained data. Likewise, the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), a measure of model misspecification, must be adjusted for our modeling of dyadic interchangeability by reducing the model 2 and df upon which the test is based by the 2 and df of I-SAT. The modified index, RMSEA , suggests a close approximate fit of the estimated model to the equality-constrained observed data if it is less than or equal to .05, and it suggests a reasonable fit if it is less than or equal to .08 (see Kline, 2005). 2 and df also must be used when computing incremental fit indices that compare the specified model with an independence model specifying no relations among model variables. The independence model also must be revised. For instance, the modified Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI ; also called the nonnormed fit index) compares the fit of the tested model (reduced by the I-SAT model) with the fit of an adjusted independence model, which specifies no relations among model variables but constrains intercepts and variances to be equal across partners (also reduced by the I-SAT model). A TLI greater than or equal to .90 suggests a good fit of the model (see Kline, 2005). This index adds a penalty\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nfor model complexity.

            "text": "Figure 4 displays results of path analyses testing concurrent predictions. We included paths from self-esteem to all model variables to control for effects of self-esteem, and we modeled perceived caring and regard as having some degree of truth, predicted by the partner\u2019s caring and regard. Controlling for this degree of truth allowed us to test our expectation that authenticity doubts predict subjective perceptions of the partner\u2019s caring and regard independently of the partner\u2019s actual caring and regard. We also modeled an effect of perceived partner caring and regard on own caring and regard for the partner to test whether the relational insecurity that is presumably brought about by authenticity doubts in turn evokes a distancing response and reduces one\u2019s own responsiveness to the partner (see Murray et al., 2006).8\nThe effects were consistent with our model at both assessment waves. Participants\u2019 beliefs that they had expressed vulnerability predicted their reflected appraisals of vulnerability (Path b in Figure 1). That is, when people believed they had expressed vulnerability and insecurity to a partner in the past, they believed the partner viewed them as vulnerable and insecure. In turn, these reflected appraisals of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts (Path c in Figure 1). In other words, those who believed that they were viewed as vulnerable and insecure thought that partners were walking on eggshells around them through hiding negative regard and feigning positive regard. Authenticity doubts in turn predicted insecurity in the partner\u2019s caring and regard (Path d in Figure 1), suggesting that, through discounting expressions of acceptance and inferring more rejection than is expressed, these doubts undermine security in the partner\u2019s affections. This was the case after controlling for trait self-esteem, which had independent effects. This was also the case after controlling for the partner\u2019s reported caring and regard, suggesting that authenticity doubts lead to unwarranted insecurity in the partner\u2019s caring and regard, independently of the partner\u2019s claimed caring and regard. In addition to being predicted by authenticity doubts, perceived caring and regard also was predicted by the partner\u2019s reported caring and\nregard, suggesting that insecurity also held some degree of truth (see Lemay et al., 2007; Murray et al., 2000). Moreover, doubts about the partner\u2019s caring and regard in turn predicted one\u2019s own reduced caring and regard for the partner, suggesting that the undermining of security due to authenticity doubts might further promote the reactivity to insecurities that initiated the process (Path a in Figure 1). This model was an acceptable fit to the data at T1 (TLI .98, RMSEA .05, 2 26.28, df 23, ns) and at T2 (TLI .99, RMSEA .04, 2 25.15, df 24, ns).9\n7 Our sample size may be considered somewhat small in light of conventional recommendations for path analysis (see Kline, 2005). With smaller samples, chi-square tests may lack the power needed to reject the specified model, although the other goodness-of-fit tests are less affected by sample size (Bentler, 1990; Hu & Bentler, 1998). Moreover, because each dyad contributes two observations to the modeled effects, the true sample size is somewhere between the number of dyads and the number of individuals (Olsen & Kenny, 2006). For the interchangeable dyadic analyses that we used, Olsen and Kenny (2006) recommended that, at minimum, the number of dyads plus one should be twice as great as the number of variables in the model. Our models meet this criterion. Reassuringly, a series of multilevel models (modeling the two individuals nested within dyads) testing each path in isolation produced similar support for our model.\n8 Although it is not immediately apparent, the model displayed in Figure 4 posits a feedback loop (one\u2019s perceptions of the partner\u2019s caring and regard affect one\u2019s own caring and regard for the partner, which is detected by the partner, which affects the partner\u2019s reciprocation of caring and regard, which affects one\u2019s perceptions of the partner\u2019s caring and regard). We followed recommendations for testing nonrecursive models (Berry, 1984; Kline, 2005), including initially modeling the four covariances of the error terms of the four variables in the loop. In both T1 and T2 models, these covariances were not significant and were dropped.\n9 Several insignificant cross-partner covariances (initially included to test dyadic nonindependence of all model variables) have been deleted from the models presented in Figure 4. In the T1 model, these include reflected appraisals of vulnerability, perceived caring and regard, caring and regard for partner, and self-esteem. In the T2 model, they include authenticity doubts and perceived caring and regard. The T1 model also estimates the residual covariance between expression of vulnerability and authenticity doubts.\n-.28**/ -.18\u2020\n-.26**/ -.34**.27 **/ .59***\n.37***/ .19*\n.20*/ .29** -.24***/ ns\n.73***/ .75*** Perceived\npartner's caring and regard\nCaring and regard for partner Authenticity doubts\nPartner's caring and regard\n.57***/ .66***\n-.32***/-.26* -.14\u2020/ns\nExpresson of vulnerability\nReflected appraisals of vulnerability\nSelf-esteem\nFigure 4.

Specifically, we predicted that the reduced security in the partner\u2019s acceptance brought about by authenticity doubts (Path d in Figure 1) would be carried into the future, predicting temporal increases in expressions of vulnerability (Path a in Figure 1), which should in turn predict temporal increases in reflected appraisals of vulnerability (Path b in Figure 1) and, in turn, authenticity doubts (Path c in Figure 1). We also modeled all T2 variables as predicted by their T1 assessments. Doing so renders T2 variables reflective of residualized temporal change.\nResults of the analysis involving the perceived regard measure are displayed in Figure 5.10 The pattern of effects regarding relations among T1 variables is similar to that displayed in Figure 4. In addition, Figure 5 suggests that the T1 insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard that was predicted by authenticity doubts in turn predicted T2 insecurity, which then predicted residual change in expressions of vulnerability (Path a in Figure 1). These increased expressions in turn predicted temporal increases in reflected appraisals of vulnerability (Path b in Figure 1), which in turn predicted increases in authenticity doubts (Path c in Figure 1). This model adequately fit the data (TLI .95, RMSEA .086, 2 62.16, df 49, ns).11 These results suggest a cyclical process in which insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard is both an indirect consequence of expressing insecurity (through effects on reflected appraisals of vulnerability and, in turn, authenticity doubts) and a cause of subsequent expressions of insecurity."

We continued to control for trait selfesteem in these analyses.\nWe regressed the partner\u2019s appraisals of one\u2019s vulnerability on one\u2019s expressions of vulnerability to test whether those who expressed vulnerabilities had partners who viewed them as vulnerable. At both assessment waves, significant positive effects of\nexpressing vulnerabilities suggested that partners did appraise such individuals as vulnerable, T1 .35, t(117) 3.80, p .001; T2 .33, t(71) 2.82, p .01. These effects suggest that those who claimed to express vulnerabilities did have partners who detected those vulnerabilities to some degree. Next, we regressed own reflected appraisals of vulnerability on own expressions of vulnerability and the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability to test whether the partner\u2019s appraisals mediated the link between own expressions and own reflected appraisals. This mediation was not found; one\u2019s own felt expressions of vulnerability remained a strong and significant predictor of reflected appraisals of vulnerability at both assessment waves, T1 .50, t(116) 6.47, p .001; T2 .66, t(70) 7.18, p .001; although the partner\u2019s appraisal of vulnerability also was significant at T1, .20, t(116) 2.65, p .01, but not at T2 ( p .23).

Analyses involving the composite index produced an effect of T2 perceived caring and regard on T2 expressions of vulnerability that was in the predicted direction but did not reach conventional levels of significance ( .12, two-tailed p .16, one-tailed p .08). This was due to a null effect of perceived partner caring on expressions of vulnerability, which might suggest that some degree of perceived caring is necessary before one expresses vulnerabilities. All other effects in the model that included the composite measure are similar to the effects displayed in Figure 5.\n11 Several insignificant cross-partner covariances (initially included to model dyadic interdependence) have been deleted from the final model displayed in Figure 5.

            "heading": "Alternative Models",
            "text": "We tested several alternative mediation models. First, we tested six alternative models by changing the modeled sequence. That is, we switched the position of expression of vulnerability, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity doubts, or perceived care and regard with one of these other variables. All other aspects of the models remained the same as the models depicted in Figure 4; we continued to model the effect of perceived care and regard on care and regard for partner, the effect of partner\u2019s care and regard on perceived care and regard, the effect of self-esteem on all variables, and all residual covariances that were estimated in the original models. The models did not adequately fit the data after switching expression of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability (T1, 2 46.90, df 23, p .01; T2, 2 36.31, df 22, p .05), after switching expression of vulnerability and authenticity doubts (T1, 2 46.07, df 23, p .01; T2, 2 38.78, df 22, p .05), after switching expression of vulnerability and perceived care and regard (T1, 2 54.27, df 23, p .001; T2, 2 54.05, df 22, p .001), after switching reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts (T1, 2 64.53, df 23, p .001; T2, 2 61.57, df 22, p .001), after switching reflected appraisals of vulnerability and perceived care and regard (T1, 2 64.43, df 23, p .001; T2, 2 71.24, df 22, p .001), and after switching authenticity doubts and perceived care and regard (T1, 2 38.72, df 23, p .05; T2, 2 56.54, df 22, p .001). Hence, these alternative models could not account for the observed (equality-constrained) covariance matrix.\nSecond, we tested a more parsimonious model positing that the effects that support our model (those linking expressions of vulnerability to reflected appraisals of vulnerability, reflected appraisals to authenticity doubts, and authenticity doubts to perceived caring and regard) are all simply explained by shared variance with perceived care and regard. In other words, as direct consequences of relational insecurity, people might express vulnerability, think they are viewed as insecure, and doubt authenticity. In this model, perceived care and regard is specified as a predictor of expressions of vulnerability, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, and authenticity doubts, and we eliminated paths directly linking these three latter variables. All other aspects of the model remained the same as described above. This model was not a good fit to the data at T1\n( 2 85.48, df 23, p .001) or at T2 ( 2 96.20, df 22, p .001). Hence, it seems as if this more parsimonious model positing that all effects are simply due to shared variance with insecurity about the partner\u2019s care and regard is not supported.\nFinally, a problem with testing these alternative models is that they eliminate several model paths simultaneously. As a result, the poor-fitting alternative models do not necessarily indicate that each model path is properly specified. To test whether the model paths that are central to our theoretical model could be explained by other variables in our model, we tested multilevel models in which each critical model path was tested while controlling for other model variables, whether theoretically upstream or theoretically downstream. Controlling for self-esteem, authenticity doubts, and perceived caring and regard, expression of vulnerability predicted reflected appraisals of vulnerability, T1 .48, t(115) 5.85, p .001; T2 .50, t(63) 5.31, p .001. Controlling for self-esteem, expression of vulnerability, and perceived caring and regard, reflected appraisals of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts, T1 .22, t(110) 2.42, p .05; T2 .47, t(66) 3.96, p .001. Controlling for self-esteem, expression of vulnerability, and reflected appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity doubts predicted perceived caring and regard, T1 .19, t(110) 1.85, p .07; T2 .41, t(69) 3.06, p .01. Hence, even at the level of individual model paths, alternative mediation models were not supported by the data. For instance, it was not the case that insecurity about a partner\u2019s caring and regard explained the relation between expression of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability or the relation between reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts."

Independently of self-esteem, when people claimed to have expressed their interpersonal vulnerabilities and insecurities to their friends, they believed that their friends viewed them as easily hurt and volatile (Path b in Figure 1). In turn, the belief that one was viewed in this way predicted doubts about the authenticity of the friend\u2019s expressions of regard and acceptance (Path c in Figure 1). In turn, these authenticity doubts predicted insecurity about the friend\u2019s caring and regard (Path d in Figure 1). Importantly, these effects were observed even when controlling for the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability, authenticity, caring, and regard, suggesting the operation of cognitive processes linking expressions of vulnerability to authenticity doubts and insecurity, as posited by our model. Doubts about the partner\u2019s regard in turn appeared to perpetuate the doubter\u2019s reactivity that initiated the process. That is, these doubts about the partner\u2019s regard predicted derogation of and reduced care for the partner and predicted subsequent insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard, which in turn predicted temporal changes in expressions of vulnerabilities (Path a in Figure 1). These changes in expressions of vulnerabilities then predicted changes in reflected appraisals of vulnerabilities, which in turn predicted changes in authenticity doubts. Such a pattern suggests a cyclical process in which expressing heightened interpersonal vulnerability and insecurity is an indirect cause and direct consequence of felt relational insecurity.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nStudy 5: Experimental Manipulation of Reflected Appraisals of Interpersonal Vulnerability\nThe last study examined effects of experimentally manipulated reflected appraisals of vulnerability on doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance\u2019s emotional expression.

They posited that expressions of happiness ordinarily serve as expressions of social interest but that people may tailor these expressions to avoid hurting others\u2019 feelings. Moreover, as this is a normative tendency, targets of these exaggerated expressions of happiness, such as unattractive individuals, typically know that people tend to do this and, consequently, discount the meaningfulness of these expressions.

            "text": "As they arrived at the laboratory, participants walked by one of three confederates (two women, one man) who was apparently waiting in the hallway for an appointment. The experimenter ushered the participant into a laboratory room and then provided a cover story, explaining that the experiment was about how first impressions can affect perceptions of social interactions, that the participant would have a brief interaction with another participant (really a confederate), and that the procedure required one of the two participants to receive information about the other participant before the interaction to examine the effects of first impressions. The experimenter further explained to the true participant that, because he or she was the first to arrive at that session, the other participant (the confederate) would be the one to receive this information and that this information may or may not be true of the participant. The experimenter also added that, to preserve the\nvalidity of the study, he could not disclose the details of the information (to the true participant) until the interaction was over but that he would be sure to explain the nature of the information at that time. After assuring that participants understood this information, the experimenter left the room, ostensibly to wait for the other participant and provide him or her the information. In reality, the confederate was not given any information about the participant and was unaware of the experimental condition.\nA few minutes later, the experimenter returned to the room and ushered the confederate into a seat across from the participant. The experimenter explained that the study was about how people perceive their social interactions, that they would have a semistructured 10-min interaction, and that they then would go to separate rooms to complete measures of their perceptions of the interaction. After completing consent forms, participants completed a short questionnaire in which they provided demographic information and responses to a self-esteem scale. The confederate acted as if he or she also was completing the consent forms and questionnaire.\nFollowing this, the participant and confederate took part in the Relationship Closeness Induction Task (RCIT), a 9-min guided and timed interaction task designed to induce feelings of closeness (Sedikides, Campbell, Reeder, & Elliot, 1999). The task consists of three lists of questions presented on three separate pages. The questions gradually become more personal, with questions regarding things such as name, age, and hometown appearing on the first page, hobbies and personal goals on the second page, and childhood memories and emotional experiences on the third page. Participants and confederates took turns asking and answering each question. When they reached the time limit for the page, the experimenter returned to the room to prompt them to turn to the next page.\nOnce the participants were finished with the RCIT, the experimenter returned and explained that the interaction was over and that now participants would go to separate rooms to complete a survey assessing perceptions of the interaction. He then ushered the confederate out of the room.\nAt this point, the procedure varied depending on random assignment to one of three experimental conditions. For participants assigned to the no-information control condition (n 62), the experimenter returned and administered the final questionnaire without saying anything about the information that had ostensibly been given to the other participant before the interaction.\nFor those assigned to the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition (n 63), the experimenter returned and explained that, now that the interaction was over, he could describe the information that he had given the other participant before the interaction. He then explained, \u201cI told the other participant that you were sensitive about what other people think about you, that you care a lot about that sort of thing.\u201d The experimenter then explained that the other participant had read a memo conveying this same information and provided the participant with a copy of the memo. On university letterhead, the memo read as follows:\nDear participant, you are about to interact with a very sensitive person. Based on prior in-depth interviews and completion of personality inventories, it appears that the participant with whom you are about to interact is extremely sensitive about how he/she comes across to others. This person constantly worries about what other people think, whether other people accept him/her, and whether other people\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nwill want to start a friendship.

Sincerely, Research Staff.\nThe experimenter explained that the other participant was in a room completing a survey assessing his or her perceptions of the interaction. The experimenter added that he also wanted to assess the (real) participant\u2019s perceptions so that he could compare them with the other participant\u2019s responses. He then administered the final questionnaire.\nA second control condition also was administered to control for other differences between the two conditions described above (n 61). For instance, factors such as activation of constructs related to vulnerability, sensitivity, and insecurity; suspicion or demand due to disclosure of information ostensibly given to the other participant; and a longer duration between the interaction and completion of dependent measures might serve as alternative explanations of our expected effect. Thus, we also desired to compare the vulnerable condition with an invulnerable condition that differed in terms of the reflected appraisal but did not differ in terms of these other factors. In addition, this condition allowed us to examine effects of inducing reflected appraisals of invulnerability, but we did not have strong predictions regarding such effects because participants in the no-information condition likely assumed that they were not viewed as vulnerable, which is what participants in the invulnerable condition were explicitly told. The experimenter explained that he had told the other participant before the interaction that \u201cyou were not sensitive to what other people think about you, that you could really care less about that sort of thing.\u201d The memo read as follows:\nYou are about to interact with a very insensitive person. Based on prior in-depth interviews and completion of personality inventories, it appears that the participant with whom you are about to interact is extremely insensitive to social cues. This person is oblivious to what others are thinking, is largely unaware of social norms, and cares little about appearance. This person tends to be unaware of signs of rejection and acceptance from others. In addition, this person appears to be unaffected by what other people think, has little ability to take others\u2019 perspectives on things, and does not understand others\u2019 feelings.\nFollowing completion of the final questionnaire, all participants were debriefed. One participant (in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition) expressed suspicion regarding the cover story. Preliminary analyses revealed that exclusion of this participant\u2019s responses did not alter the pattern of results. Thus, his responses were included in the analyses presented below."

A significant main effect for type of rating, F(1, 182) 47.65, p .001, suggesting that, on average, participants viewed the confederate as expressing more happiness than was truly felt, was qualified by the Type of Rating Condition interaction, F(1, 182) 5.24, p .05, 2 .03. As expected, in the vulnerable condition, participants believed that the confederate\u2019s expressions (M 5.14) were happier than the confederate\u2019s private feelings (M 4.7), t(62) 5.50, p .001, d .46. This tendency was reduced in the control conditions (Ms 4.8 and 4.6, respectively), t(120) 4.01, p .001, d .23. Thus, consistent with our expectations (Path c in Figure 1), participants perceived the confederate\u2019s expressions of happiness as less authentic when they were told, after the interaction, that the confederate had been informed beforehand that participants were especially vulnerable to rejection.12\nThis result is particularly impressive given that (a) participants could not use reflected appraisals of vulnerability to bias their online perceptions during the interaction but instead had to retrospect in light of information received after the interaction, (b) reflected appraisals of vulnerability were communicated via a third party, and (c) these manipulated reflected appraisals competed with any behavior expressed by the confederate that may have communicated authenticity. Indeed, many other studies suggest that, when causes are presented sequentially, people tend to anchor their judgments on the initial cause and fail to sufficiently discount the initial cause when presented with the alternative cause (see McClure, 1998, for a review). Our effects might have been stronger if participants held reflected appraisals during encoding of the other\u2019s behavior, if reflected appraisals were derived naturally from one\u2019s self-perceived vulnerability-expressive behavior, and if the other\u2019s behavior was constrained so that authenticity was more\n12 Additional analyses also compared the vulnerable condition with each of the other conditions.

The obtained interaction pattern was the same in both of these analyses. Additional mixed ANOVAs comparing the invulnerable condition with the other two conditions or with only the control condition produced no significant interactions ( ps .21). These results suggest that it was participants\u2019 beliefs that they were viewed as vulnerable, rather than factors such as activation of insecurity-related constructs, differences in time to complete dependent measures, or suspicion due to receiving information about what the confederate ostensibly had been told, that caused authenticity doubts.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nambiguous.13 However, as the manipulation was administered after the interaction, our design eliminates the alternative explanation that participants in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition elicited inauthentic expressions of happiness from the confederate.\nGeneral Discussion\nWhy do some individuals chronically feel insecure about a particular partner\u2019s regard and acceptance? We have proposed that individuals\u2019 own reactions to their insecurity initiate cognitions that perpetuate that insecurity. Specifically, our model posits that, when people feel insecure about a partner\u2019s regard and acceptance, they often judge their own prior behavior as having communicated insecurity and emotional vulnerability to the partner. Consequently, they come to believe that they are viewed as especially insecure and vulnerable. Then, due to shared beliefs that people walk on eggshells around insecure, vulnerable others, such reflected appraisals of vulnerability elicit doubts about the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard and acceptance. Once authenticity is doubted, positive expressions are discounted, negative expressions are augmented, and hidden negative regard is inferred even when partners are accepting and actually hold positive regard. This results in continued insecurity in the relationship. Hence, one reason why some people chronically feel insecure in particular relationships is because their own prior reactions to their insecurity have undermined their capacity to trust the partner\u2019s expressions of acceptance and positive regard.\nStudy 1 demonstrated that people believe expressions of regard toward interpersonally insecure and vulnerable others are relatively inauthentic. That is, walking on eggshells does appear to be a common perception of what people do when confronted with especially vulnerable and insecure interaction partners. Studies 2A, 2B, and 4 suggest that, when people believe they have expressed vulnerabilities to a romantic partner or friend, they believe they are viewed as especially vulnerable, which in turn predicts their suspicion regarding the authenticity of the other\u2019s expressions of positive regard and acceptance (Paths b and c in Figure 1). Independently of self-esteem and attachment anxiety, reflected appraisals of vulnerability, induced by one\u2019s own prior expressions of vulnerability, appear to turn the expectation of walking on eggshells around vulnerable and insecure individuals into suspicion about the partner\u2019s behavior.\nStudy 4 suggests that this process can operate independently of the partner\u2019s appraisals of vulnerability and reported authenticity. Study 5 provides additional evidence for the role of subjective reflected appraisals of vulnerability in producing authenticity doubts, showing that directly inducing these reflected appraisals caused participants to doubt a new acquaintance\u2019s expressions of happiness despite the fact that the new acquaintance actually did not view them as especially vulnerable. According to our model, egocentric biases to focus on one\u2019s own behavior and internal experiences and to believe that others make more dispositional attributions for one\u2019s behavior than they actually do cause individuals who feel especially insecure in a relationship to believe that they are viewed as vulnerable by partners independently of whether partners actually view them this way. Once this belief is in place, the corresponding belief that others walk on eggshells around vulnerable individuals (demonstrated in Study 1) incites\ndoubts about the authenticity of the partner\u2019s expressions of regard, even if partners have not responded by delivering inauthentic feedback.\nIn turn, Studies 3 and 4 showed that these doubts about the authenticity of a romantic partner\u2019s or a friend\u2019s regard predicted more pessimistic perceptions of the other\u2019s regard and caring (Path d in Figure 1). In Study 4, this effect was obtained after controlling for the friend\u2019s reports of regard and caring, suggesting that authenticity doubts initiate cognitive processes that undermine felt interpersonal security independently of partners\u2019 actual thoughts and feelings. According to our model, an individual\u2019s authenticity doubts create a disconnection between the partner\u2019s valuing and accepting behavior and the individual\u2019s inferences of value and acceptance. In particular, authenticity doubts may result in a downward estimation of the partner\u2019s true regard and acceptance, as expressions of positive regard are presumed to be exaggerated and clandestine rejection can be inferred from the partner\u2019s presumed cautious orientation. Thus, our findings suggest that one way in which people unwittingly remain insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance is that they behave in ways that ultimately and subjectively invalidate the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard and foster perceptions of negative regard despite the lack of confirmatory behavioral evidence and even in the presence of contradictory evidence.\nAlthough our studies support our model, we are not positing that our theorized predictors of each model variable are the only predictors. For instance, in addition to insecurity about a partner\u2019s regard and acceptance, perhaps insecure self-esteem engenders reactivity to esteem-threatening events (Kernis, 2003), which independently predicts reflected appraisals of vulnerability and, in turn, authenticity doubts. We found evidence for our model while controlling for low self-esteem, and insecurity about a partner\u2019s regard in particular did predict expressions of vulnerability and was predicted by authenticity doubts, but it may be the case that our model applies to events that threaten self-esteem just as well as it does to events that threaten relational security. Indeed, these two types of events seem to be highly confounded (MacDonald, Saltzman, & Leary, 2003; Murray et al., 1998, 2001). That is, events that threaten self-esteem tend to be events that threaten relational security and vice versa."

Additional mixed ANOVAs found no effects of condition on evaluation of the vulnerable or invulnerable feedback, more positive evaluations of the vulnerable feedback than of the invulnerable feedback in all conditions, and the same interaction after controlling for evaluation of the vulnerable feedback and its interaction with expressed versus felt happiness. These results suggest that negative evaluation of the feedback involved in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability manipulation did not account for the effects.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\nself-protection. They may protect the self from perceived impending rejection by derogating the partner and the relationship (Murray et al., 2006) or seek reassurance to alleviate self-doubt (Coyne, 1999; Joiner, Metalsky, et al., 1999). In addition, vulnerabilities may be strategically expressed in an effort to suppress a partner\u2019s negative feedback, especially when one anticipates negative feedback and fears that it will be painful.\nHowever, whatever emotional gratification is conferred by such strategies may be only temporary. Responding to insecurity with use of these short-term emotion-regulation strategies may increase the probability of experiencing threats that create a need for similar regulation responses in the future. That is, by lashing out in response to perceived rejection or by seeming especially desirous of or dependent on a partner\u2019s approval, people cannot be sure whether subsequent apologies, affections, or approval reflect the partner\u2019s private sentiments. Burdened with this distrust, similar threats and insecurities are all the more forthcoming. Indeed, Study 4 showed that initial insecurity about a partner\u2019s regard, which was predicted by authenticity doubts, in turn predicted derogation of the partner and indirectly predicted later expressions of vulnerability, suggesting that authenticity doubts contribute to the experience and expression of insecurity that initially produced them (Path a in Figure 1). Seeking self-protection by derogating or punishing a partner (see Murray et al., 2006) or seeking interpersonal security by asking for reassurance, accompanied by inadvertent expressions of heightened insecurity and vulnerability to rejection, appears to be an example of a self-defeating tendency to prioritize short-term emotion regulation over self-regulation that promotes long-term interpersonal well-being (see Baumeister & Scher, 1988, for a review).\nShould Insecurities Be Suppressed?\nOur model and findings suggest that expressing interpersonal insecurities can perpetuate them. Does this mean that those who feel insecure within particular relationships should avoid disclosing their concerns to their partners? We believe the answer is no.\nSuppressing insecurities could result in those who are insecure never testing the reality of their partner\u2019s affections. In addition, by suggesting to the self that the partner cannot be trusted and by not sharing important aspects of the self, the suppression likely undermines feelings of intimacy. Other theoretical perspectives and findings suggest that self-disclosure, especially disclosure of emotions, enhances felt intimacy (Laurenceau, Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998; Reis & Shaver, 1988) and that emotional disclosure is more likely, is more desired, and elicits helping more in communal relationships than in noncommunal relationships (Clark, Fitness, & Brissette, 2000; Clark, Ouellette, Powell, & Milberg, 1987; Clark & Taraban, 1991). Suppressing insecurities and vulnerabilities, then, may deprive both partners of an intimate and optimally communal relationship. Moreover, actively attempting to suppress insecurities may have the ironic effect of making them all the more salient (Wenzlaff & Wegner, 2000).\nInstead, the cognitive consequences of expressions may need to be changed. Self-disclosure builds communal and intimate relationships when partners respond to the disclosure in ways that leave disclosers feeling valued and cared for (Reis & Shaver, 1988). We have argued that perceiving that one has expressed vulnerabilities causes authenticity doubts that interfere with such\nfeelings. However, the cycle of insecurity perpetuation that we have emphasized might be undermined by modifying the links between disclosure and authenticity doubts. If this were possible, those who express their vulnerabilities might be better able to perceive their partners as responding supportively. An accumulation of such interactions may then reduce the experience of relationship insecurities and, consequently, their expression.\nHow might these links be changed? We have posited particular cognitive distortions as mediating mechanisms. These distortions include a tendency to believe that one\u2019s behavior and internal experiences are more observable than they are and a tendency to exaggerate the extent to which others respond with dispositional attributions. Indeed, beliefs about being perceived as vulnerable largely accounted for the link between expressions of vulnerability and authenticity doubts. Thus, altering these cognitive distortions seems to be a promising strategy.\nMoreover, this strategy appears possible. Savtisky et al. (2001) argued that the illusion of transparency may be due to a focusing illusion\u2014the tendency to focus on specific stimuli and give undue weight to other stimuli when making predictions. That is, people mistakenly assume that their own behavior is just as salient to observers as it is to the self. Manipulations designed to eliminate this focusing illusion can change the way people believe they are viewed by others. For example, the tendency to feel negatively evaluated by others following public display of inadequacies or social blunders was reduced by instructing participants to defocus\u2014to consider the many factors that might affect the observer\u2019s evaluations (Savitsky et al., 2001, Studies 3 and 4). In addition, relative to control participants, those who were informed about the illusion of transparency\u2014in this case, the tendency to overestimate the extent to which others can observe one\u2019s anxiety\u2014gave better speeches and appeared more relaxed both from their own perspective and from the audience\u2019s perspective (Savitsky & Gilovich, 2003, Study 2). Perhaps those who are insecure about a partner\u2019s acceptance can learn to broaden their focus and consider the many other factors that may determine whether partners perceive them as excessively interpersonally vulnerable. This may convince them that their interpersonal vulnerability is not as salient to their partners as they have presumed.\nFurther in the posited cycle, perhaps insecure individuals can learn to trust their partner\u2019s expressions of acceptance and positive regard despite the reflected appraisals of vulnerability. Although walking on eggshells appears to be a widely held belief about how people respond to others\u2019 insecurity, there may be individual differences. For example, people who are chronically attentive to social cues appear better able to detect others\u2019 ingratiating behavior (Jones & Baumeister, 1976). Such individuals are likely aware of the situational factors that motivate deceptive social behavior. Perhaps insecure individuals can learn to attend to and later remember cues suggesting the partner\u2019s authenticity. For example, they could take a partner\u2019s willingness to sometimes behave badly (i.e., selfishness, irritability) as evidence that their partners are authentic, rather than presuming rejection and maintaining authenticity doubts. They also could view relationship longevity and the partner\u2019s tolerance of one\u2019s transgressions as evidence that the partner must truly accept the self and value the relationship. These tactics also may involve a form of broadening one\u2019s focus, actively considering the partner\u2019s motives for authentic responding (e.g., the partner\u2019s desire for intimacy, the partner\u2019s values, or the\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly .\npartner\u2019s desire to provide help through honest feedback) that may be operating alongside the presumed motive to provide inauthentic feedback."

            "text": "Our model is distinct from other perspectives on the maintenance of insecurity. Prior perspectives have posited either a perceptual confirmation process biased by individual differences or a behavioral confirmation process. A perceptual confirmation process occurs when prior expectations bias attention to and processing of social information in a manner that confirms those initial expectations (Snyder & Stukas, 1999). Several models positing that this type of bias is driven by individual differences have been proposed and empirically supported. For example, the sociometer model construes trait self-esteem as a barometer of one\u2019s value as a relationship partner over the long run (Leary & Baumeister, 2000). Moreover, because people with low self-esteem have a history of rejection, they are thought to be particularly vigilant for and likely to detect social rejection. Indeed, people with low self-esteem tend to perceive others as less accepting than do people with high self-esteem (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs, 1995; Lemay & Ashmore, 2006; Srivastava & Beer, 2005), and they substantially underestimate their romantic partner\u2019s love and regard for them (Murray et al., 2000, 2001). Individual differences in attachment-related anxiety and rejection sensitivity also have been viewed as sources of bias in perceiving rejection (e.g., Collins, 1996; Downey & Feldman, 1996).\nOther models have posited that insecurity is perpetuated through behavioral confirmation, such that insecure individuals behave in a manner that actually brings about rejection from relationship partners. Doubting a dating partner\u2019s regard, for example, predicts temporal decreases in that partner\u2019s trust and satisfaction (Murray et al., 2000), and rejection-sensitive individuals have partners who report less satisfaction and commitment and more anger following conflict (Downey et al., 1998). Coyne\u2019s (1976) interpersonal model of depression similarly posits that depressed individuals\u2019 excessive reassurance seeking is distressing to partners and may cause them to reject depressed individuals.\nOur model suggests another type of process that may perpetuate insecurity. In particular, although individual differences in general expectancies for rejection may predict felt insecurity and behavioral reactions to that insecurity, these reactions may exert effects on subsequent feelings of security independently of those initial expectancies and independently of the partner\u2019s reactions. This view is distinct from the individual-differences view in its emphasis on the biasing effects of one\u2019s own behavior within particular relationships. Moreover, our studies provide an empirical distinction; one\u2019s own expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts, and authenticity doubts predicted perceived rejection, independently of the general expectations for rejection reflected in low self-esteem and attachment-related anxiety. This view also is distinct from a behavioral confirmation view. Although both views emphasize the role of behavior in perpetuating insecurity, our model suggests that behavior may be a source of perceptual bias in addition to bringing about actual rejection by a partner. Our findings that one\u2019s own expressions of vulnerability predicted authenticity doubts and per-\nceived rejection independently of the partner\u2019s reactions support this distinction, as does our experimental study.\nThe current research is just one example of how people\u2019s own interpersonal behaviors and their cognitions about their behaviors can influence their felt security. Some of our other findings also fit with this view\u2014people induced to believe that they have not been responsive to the needs of relationship partners and people who chronically felt that they were not responsive perceived that their relationship partners did not care for them (Lemay & Clark, in press; Lemay et al., 2007) independently of their partners\u2019 reports of their actual caring and independently of depression, self-esteem, and attachment-related anxiety and avoidance. That is, selfperceptions of one\u2019s own communal behavior affected perceptions of the other\u2019s caring even after accounting for the effects predicted by perceptual confirmation guided by individual differences and behavioral confirmation. A full understanding of how security is perpetuated may require use of several models, considering that individual differences in expectations for rejection may exert a direct bias on perceptions of rejection, that they may guide behavior that actually elicits rejection from others, and that they may guide behavior that itself independently biases subsequent perceptions.\nAlthough our model posits a normative relationship process that is initiated by and perpetuates relationship-specific insecurity, individual differences are likely to be important. Individual differences in proclivities to feel secure or insecure in relationships, such as low self-esteem, attachment-related anxiety, or rejection sensitivity, do predict felt security in particular relationships. They also likely predict reflected appraisals of vulnerability and authenticity doubts. Hence, these individual differences may act as distal predictors of any of our model components, which may then trigger the normative, cyclical relationship process we have emphasized. For example, those with low self-esteem or attachment anxiety may project their own insecurity onto the views they believe their partners hold of them. Once they believe they are viewed as highly insecure and vulnerable, the normative process we have emphasized may become operative; they may discount the partner\u2019s expressions of positive regard, infer less positive regard than is the case, and express this insecurity about the partner\u2019s regard to the partner, which only reaffirms their belief that they are viewed as insecure. Indeed, in addition to finding evidence in support for our normative process model, we also found that low self-esteem and attachment anxiety predicted expressions of vulnerability and reflected appraisals of vulnerability. Low selfesteem also predicted authenticity doubts and insecurity about a partner\u2019s caring and regard. Hence, all else being equal, our normative model may especially pertain to the relationship dynamics of those who tend to be insecure in relationships generally because, through other processes not emphasized in the current research, such individuals are especially likely to intensely and frequently express vulnerabilities, believe they are viewed as vulnerable, and doubt authenticity. However, the process we have emphasized may describe specific relationships involving individuals who nevertheless tend to be secure in their other relationships."

Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process. As a reviewer, you would gain valuable experience in publishing. The P&C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process.\nIf you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write to the address below. Please note the following important points:\n\u2022 To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review.\n\u2022 To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research.\n\u2022 To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, \u201csocial psychology\u201d is not sufficient\u2014you would need to specify \u201csocial cognition\u201d or \u201cattitude change\u201d as well.\n\u2022 Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1\u20134 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly.\nWrite to Journals Office, American Psychological Association, 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242.\nTh is\nd oc\num en\nt i s c\nop yr\nig ht\ned b\ny th\ne A\nm er\nic an\nP sy\nch ol\nog ic\nal A\nss oc\nia tio\nn or\no ne\no f i\nts a\nlli ed\np ub\nlis he\nrs .\nTh is\na rti\ncl e\nis in\nte nd\ned so\nle ly\nfo r t\nhe p\ner so\nna l u\nse o\nf t he\nin di\nvi du\nal u\nse r a\nnd is\nn ot\nto b\ne di\nss em\nin at\ned b\nro ad\nly ."
