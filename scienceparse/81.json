    "abstractText": "The authors propose that conflict threatens different psychological resources of victims and perpetrators and that these threats contribute to the maintenance of conflict (A. Nadler, 2002; A. Nadler & I. Liviatan, 2004; A. Nadler & N. Shnabel, in press). On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one\u2019s status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one\u2019s image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties\u2019 willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.",

            "text": "A Needs-Based Model of Reconciliation: Satisfying the Differential Emotional Needs of Victim and Perpetrator as a Key to Promoting\nReconciliation\nNurit Shnabel and Arie Nadler Tel Aviv University\nThe authors propose that conflict threatens different psychological resources of victims and perpetrators and that these threats contribute to the maintenance of conflict (A. Nadler, 2002; A. Nadler & I. Liviatan, 2004; A. Nadler & N. Shnabel, in press). On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one\u2019s status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one\u2019s image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties\u2019 willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.\nKeywords: reconciliation, conflict resolution, emotional needs, victims, perpetrators\nThe study of conflict and its resolution has generated much theoretical and empirical interest in the last few decades (Jones, 1998; Pruitt, 1998). Most of the research in this field is based on the realist approach to conflict and its resolution, according to which disputes between persons and groups are grounded in conflicts over material interests (Scheff, 1994). Consequently, most of the literature in this field assumes that conflicts are resolved once the relevant parties are able to agree on a formula for redistributing contested resources. In the present article, we focus on reconciliation between opponents as distinguished from conflict resolution. Reconciliation, in contrast to conflict resolution, \u201cmust include a changed psychological orientation towards the other\u201d (Staub, Pearlman, Gubin, & Hagengimana, 2005, p. 301) and may occur only once the parties have resolved the emotional issues that may have left them estranged (Nadler, 2002; Nadler & Liviatan, 2006).\nTheories of reconciliation stress that an end to a conflict cannot be achieved merely by satisfying the instrumental motivations of opponents (such as the motivation to maximize one\u2019s outcomes; Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996). Instead, satisfying the emotional needs of the parties (such as the need to take revenge; Frijda, 1994) is necessary as well. Similarly, theoreticians of negotiation stress that although focusing on tangible issues such as money or property and ignoring intangible issues that relate to the psychological needs of the adversaries is a common practice, it often deadlocks the negotiation (Zubek, Pruitt, Peirce, McGillicuddy, & Syna, 1992). In other words, as long as these emotional needs remain unsatisfied, they block the path to reconciliation. The process of satisfying these emotional needs that impede reconciliation was\ntermed by Nadler (2002) the socio-emotional route to reconciliation. One major way these emotional barriers can be removed is through the apology\u2013forgiveness cycle (Tavuchis, 1991), that is, when a perpetrator apologizes to the victim and when the victim reciprocates by granting forgiveness.\nThe processes of socio-emotional reconciliation has received little attention in social psychology research, and the few studies devoted to this subject have mostly explored factors at the intrapersonal level. Some of these have included attention to affective states (e.g., feeling empathy toward the offender; McCullough, Worthington, & Rachal, 1997) and personality traits (e.g., psychological femininity; McCullough et al., 1998). Others have focused on how parties to a conflict perceive the relationship between them (e.g., perceived quality of alternatives) or the profitability of maintaining the relationship (Rusbult, 1983; Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996; Rusbult, Verette, Whitney, Slovik, & Lipkus, 1991). Consequently, these studies focused on only one side of the conflict (i.e., either on the perpetrator or the victim) and thus have overlooked the interaction between the victim and the perpetrator and the role of this interaction in promoting interpersonal reconciliation. The present research seeks to amend this shortcoming by proposing a model of reconciliation as the outcome of the simultaneous and reciprocal satisfaction of the emotional needs of the perpetrator and the victim.\nReconciliation as an Act of Social Exchange\nThe needs-based model of reconciliation is predicated on the idea that following an episode in which one side has been victimized by another, both the victim and the perpetrator are deprived of certain unique psychological resources. This deprivation brings about different emotional needs in victims and in perpetrators, and until these needs are satisfied they serve as barriers to reconciliation.

In this manner, socio-emotional reconciliation can be framed as an act of social exchange: Reconciliation is facilitated when victims and perpetrators receive needed emotional \u201ccommodities\u201d through postconflict interactions.\nIn a victimization episode, the impairment to the psychological resources of victims and perpetrators is asymmetrical. Victims feel inferior regarding their power (Foster & Rusbult, 1999), honor (Scheff, 1994), self-esteem (Scobie & Scobie, 1998), and perceived control (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Heatherton, 1994) and may experience feelings of victimization or anger (McCullough et al., 1998). In contrast, perpetrators suffer from moral inferiority (Exline & Baumeister, 2000; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002) and may feel guilt (Baumeister et al., 1994), shame (Exline & Baumeister, 2000), or repentance (North, 1998). This myriad of emotional states has been said to reflect the perpetrators\u2019 \u201canxiety over social exclusion\u201d (Baumeister et. al., 1994, p. 246) because they face the threat of being rejected from the moral community to which they belong (Tavuchis, 1991).\nFrom a broader perspective, these impaired emotional resources can be subsumed under the human need for power and the human need for love and belonging, two needs that constitute the core of interpersonal experience (Bennis & Shepard, 1956). Using the terminology of resources theory, which classifies the resources that are exchanged in social interactions into six categories (love, status, services, goods, information, and money; Foa & Foa, 1980), we suggest that the resource that is threatened in victims falls into the category of status (i.e., the need for relative power), whereas the resource that is threatened for perpetrators is associated with the category of love (i.e., the need for relatedness).\nDeprivation of the above resources leads to a corresponding motivational state in which the individual experiences his or her deprivation as a need that must be fulfilled. For victims, this emerges as an enhanced need to restore their sense of power and an increase in power-seeking behavior (Foster & Rusbult, 1999). To achieve this goal, victims are likely to want perpetrators to acknowledge their responsibility for the injustice that they have caused. This acknowledgement creates a kind of \u201cdebt\u201d that only the victim can cancel, and thus returns control to the hands of the victim, who may then determine whether the perpetrator will be forgiven and reaccepted into the moral community (Akhtar, 2002; Minow, 1998; Scho\u0308nbach, 1990). For this reason, victims often try to induce guilt among perpetrators: Perpetrators\u2019 guilt serves as an admission of the debt they owe victims (Baumeister et al., 1994).\nThe perpetrator, unlike the victim, exercises more power and control during the victimization episode. Nevertheless, when perpetrators are accused of violating conventional moral standards or deviating from group norms, they may fear exclusion from the designated moral community to which they belong (Tavuchis, 1991). The anxiety over social exclusion increases perpetrators\u2019 motivation to perceive themselves as acceptable people (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Wotman, 1990) as well as their need to have others express understanding and empathy regarding the circumstances that compelled them to act in a socially unacceptable way (Nadler & Liviatan, 2004, 2006) and empathy for their emotional distress (McCullough et al., 1997). This understanding, in turn, restores perpetrators\u2019 public moral image (i.e., their sense of being perceived as moral individuals) and helps them feel \u201crehumanized\u201d\n(Staub et al., 2005). Empathy and understanding for the perpetrator\u2019s perspective are therefore a kind of \u201cgift\u201d that victims give to those who have offended them, which culminates in their explicitly granting forgiveness (Enright, Freedman, & Rique, 1998). Forgiveness mitigates the moral inferiority engendered by the role of perpetrators (Exline & Baumeister, 2000) and is a reassurance that they belong to the moral community to which their membership was questioned.\nIn line with this reasoning, Carlsmith and Gross (1969) reported that participants who delivered an electric shock to a confederate tended to offer more help to the confederate following the experiment than those who did not deliver the shock. This behavior may be interpreted as a reaction by perpetrators aimed at balancing the impairment to their resource of love (Foa & Foa, 1980).\nThe impairment to the perpetrators\u2019 resource of love consists of a threat to their moral image in the eyes of relevant others (i.e., threat to public moral image) rather than to their feelings of guilt. Research that indicates that victims and perpetrators have different perspectives on the same victimization episode is consistent with the idea that concerns about one\u2019s moral image may be disassociated from perpetrators\u2019 guilt. In fact, while perpetrators are concerned as to whether others view them as moral actors, they often avoid feelings of guilt by minimizing the moral implications of their actions or by denying responsibility for them (Mikula, 2002); in fact, even actions that seem senselessly cruel may be perceived by perpetrators as having at least some redeeming purpose or merit (Baumeister, 1996). This contrasts with victims\u2019 tendency to emphasize the injustice that they suffered and the perpetrator\u2019s responsibility for it. This phenomenon, labeled by Exline and Baumeister (2000) as the magnitude gap underscores the idea that the impairment to perpetrator\u2019s resource of love, which is posited in our model, reflects a threat to perpetrators\u2019 moral image that is relatively independent of their feelings of guilt.\nWhen a successful social exchange takes place between victim and perpetrator, both sides satisfy their emotional needs and cease to feel weaker than or morally inferior to their counterpart. This generates a process of symbolic erasure of the roles of victim and perpetrator, which places the involved parties on a more equal footing (North, 1998) and thus leads to a greater willingness to reconcile with one\u2019s opponent (cf. Nadler & Shnabel, in press). The progress of the socio-emotional route to reconciliation is summarized in Figure 1.\nThe present research was designed to test this model. The first two hypotheses center on the psychological resources that are impaired in the victim and the perpetrator and the needs that result from this impairment. The third and fourth hypotheses focus on the way in which messages of empowerment and acceptance affect victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 views of themselves and their subsequent willingness to reconcile. Accordingly, the major hypotheses are as follows:\nHypothesis 1: For victims, the primary psychological resource that is impaired following a victimization episode is their sense of power, whereas for perpetrators, the primary impairment is to their public moral image (i.e., their perception that others view them as being relatively immoral).\nHypothesis 2: This differential impairment elicits different emotional needs: Perpetrators will express a stronger need for\nsocial acceptance (i.e., that victims should try to understand and accept their perspective), whereas victims will express a stronger need for power.\nHypothesis 3: After receiving a message of empowerment from perpetrators, victims will perceive themselves as more powerful. After receiving a message of acceptance, perpetrators will perceive that others view them as relatively more moral (i.e., will have a higher public moral image).\nHypothesis 4: Restoring victims\u2019 sense of power will enhance their willingness to reconcile with perpetrators. Similarly, restoring perpetrators\u2019 public moral image will enhance their willingness to reconcile with victims.\nWe conducted four studies to test these hypotheses. The first two studies used laboratory experiments: Study 1 tested Hypotheses 1 and 2 (these hypotheses were also tested in naturally occurring situations, in a study briefly described in the Discussion section of Study 1), and Study 2 tested Hypotheses 3 and 4. Study 3 again tested Hypotheses 3 and 4 by using vignettes describing real-life situations. Finally, Study 4 used vignettes in a role-playing methodology to test the whole model (Hypotheses 1\u20134).\nStudy 1\nThe first study was designed to test the first part of our theoretical model: In the course of an offense, victims primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of power and consequently have a stronger need to restore power. By contrast, perpetrators primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of moral worth and hence have a higher need for social acceptance. Unlike past research on victim\u2013perpetrator relations that has investigated this topic through the use of roleplaying techniques (e.g., Foster & Rusbult, 1999) or recall of relevant life situations (e.g., McCullough et al., 1997), we chose a laboratory setting to test our hypotheses. The use of the experi-\nmental method allowed us to randomly assign participants to the victim or perpetrator role in the same controlled social situation. This created two major methodological challenges: The first was to provide a cover story that was ethically sound, given that classical paradigms that produce victims and perpetrators such as the teacher\u2013student paradigm (Milgram, 1974) or the jail paradigm (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973) are unacceptable. The second was to have all participants in the perpetrator condition hurt their victim and believe that they had done so of their own volition. The experimental design was a 2 2 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) Condition (experimental vs. control).\nMethod"

All instructions and procedures were computerized.\nParticipants were told that they would take part in a \u201ccreativity test\u201d meant to identify participants who had a high potential to work in the advertising industry. To enhance the value of success on the creativity test, participants were told that if they succeeded on the test they could advance to a second and rewarding phase of the study.\nParticipants were then randomly assigned to be either \u201cwriters\u201d or \u201cjudges.\u201d The writers\u2019 task was to write slogans for a list of products that were presented to them, and the judges\u2019 task was to evaluate these slogans. To advance to the second phase of the study, writers had to achieve an average score of at least 85. Judges were told that their advancement to the second phase depended on an assessment by an IAA representative of the quality of their judgment and their ability to evaluate creativity potential. To maintain a high level of psychological relevance of the interaction with the partner, all participants were led to believe that after the test they would have to work together with their partner on a common task.\nJudges in the experimental condition were advised to be strict in their evaluations and to judge the slogans by real-world standards, whereas judges in the control condition were advised to be lenient and regard the slogans as preliminary drafts. It was stressed that following this advice for lenient or strict assessments of the slogans would increase the judges\u2019 chances of passing to the next phase of the experiment, which was presented as highly rewarding. Thus, judges in both conditions were free to choose which grades to give their partners, but in the experimental condition they knew that being too nice to their partner might harm their chances of moving to the next and rewarding phase of the experiment. As a result of these instructions, judges in the experimental condition gave their partners lower grades, and the experimenter later informed them that the writers had failed the test due their harsh\nevaluations. Judges in the control condition gave their partners higher grades, and the experimenter later informed these judges that despite their positive evaluations, the IAA committee declined to advance the writer to the second phase due to external considerations. Writers in the experimental condition received low scores from their partners throughout the exam and consequently failed the test, whereas writers in the control condition received relatively higher scores from their partners but were informed that they failed the test due to the decision of the IAA representatives.\nAfterward, the experimenter asked participants to complete questionnaires, which included the dependent measures. These were presented as a standard feedback procedure required by the university\u2019s ethics committee. Upon completion, participants were thanked and debriefed."

Ratings for the first two items were highly correlated (r .85) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of victimhood. Ratings for the third and fourth items were also highly correlated (r .86) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of perpetration.\nSense of power. Three 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 self-perception of power: (a) During the interaction with my partner, I felt relatively weak to I felt relatively strong; (b) I did not have a lot of influence on the interaction with my partner to I had a lot of influence; and (c) I had the lower hand to I had the upper hand. Another three items measured the public image of power (i.e., the extent to which participants thought their partners viewed them as powerful): My partner perceives me as. . . (a) relatively weak to relatively strong, (b) not having a lot of control over the interaction between us to having a lot of control, and (c) having relatively low influence on the interaction to relatively high influence. Ratings for the 6 items were averaged to obtain a single measure of sense of power (Cronbach\u2019s .92).\nPublic moral image. Three 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 public moral image (i.e., the extent to which participants believed that their partners viewed them as moral): My partner perceives. . . (a) me as not being completely moral to me as being completely moral, (b) my behavior as not 100% appropriate to my behavior as 100% appropriate, and (c) my behavior as not ethically flawless to my behavior as ethically flawless. Ratings for the three items were averaged to obtain a single measure of public moral image (Cronbach\u2019s .92).\nEmotional needs. Four 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 need for power: I would like to. . . (a) have more influence on the test and its procedure, (b) have more power in the role to which I was assigned, (c) increase my level of control over the interaction between myself and my partner, and (d) have more say during joint work. Participants rated these items from 1 (not particularly) to 7 (very much). Ratings for the four items were\naveraged to obtain a single measure of need for power (Cronbach\u2019s .95).\nFive 7-point scale items measured participants\u2019 need for social acceptance: I would like. . . (a) to explain my considerations during the task to my partner, (b) my partner to understand the reasons for my behavior, (c) my partner to know that I tried to act fairly during the test, (d) my partner to know that I did not act out of thoughtlessness, and (e) my partner to understand that I am not a harsh person. Ratings for the five items were averaged to obtain a single measure of need for social acceptance (Cronbach\u2019s .89).

            "text": "In general, the results of Study 1 support our theoretical model. First, the manipulation was successful in producing perpetrators and victims: Judges in the experimental condition perceived themselves as perpetrators to a greater extent than did the participants in the other three conditions, and writers in the experimental condition perceived themselves as victims to a greater extent than did the participants in the other three conditions. Furthermore, our predictions regarding most of the dependent variables were supported: For victims, the primary psychological resource that was impaired was their sense of power, and for perpetrators, the primary impairment was to their public moral image. The results also supported our predictions that the differential impairment of psychological resources would elicit different emotional needs: Victims expressed a stronger need for power, whereas perpetrators expressed a stronger need for social acceptance (i.e., wanting victims to understand and accept their perspective).\nHowever, there was one empirical inconsistency with our predictions that needs to be considered. The unpredicted finding was that writers in the experimental condition expressed a higher need for social acceptance compared with writers in the control condition. This finding does not contradict our theoretical model (because perpetrators nevertheless exhibited the greatest need for social acceptance). Because the victims\u2019 need for social acceptance was related to their need for power (these two measures were strongly correlated, r .37, p .01), it is possible that victims felt that if they could spell out their perspectives to perpetrators, the perpetrators would realize the extent of their wrongdoing and would try to compensate them for this mistreatment.\n1 Here, as well as in all other t tests reported in this article, we conducted Levene\u2019s test for homogeneity of variances and decided whether to assume equal variances accordingly. For the sake of brevity, we do not report the results of the Levene\u2019s tests, but these can be deduced by the reported degrees of freedom of the t tests.\nIn order to extend the generalizability and external validity of our findings, we tested the same hypotheses in a real-world context. Participants in this study were 107 university undergraduates who were instructed to recall a situation in which they had hurt a significant other (perpetrator condition) or were hurt by a significant other (victim condition). Following this, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed (a) self-ratings of power, (b) public moral image, and (c) emotional needs (i.e., the needs for power and social acceptance). The results replicated the findings of Study 1: Victims perceived themselves as weaker than perpetrators and exhibited a higher need for power, whereas perpetrators perceived themselves as having an inferior public moral image compared with victims and exhibited a higher need for social acceptance.2 Taken together, the findings of both studies support the first part of our theoretical model, which asserts that in a victim\u2013perpetrator interaction different psychological resources are impaired for victims and perpetrators and that this leads to the arousal of different emotional needs.\nStudy 2\nStudy 2 tested the second part of our model, which asserts that satisfying the differential emotional needs of victims and perpetrators will facilitate reconciliation between them in the setting of a laboratory experiment. The experiment used the experimental condition of the creativity test paradigm used in Study 1, which was proven effective in producing victims and perpetrators. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the victim condition (i.e., writer) and the other half were assigned to the perpetrator condition (i.e., judge). At the end of the session (i.e., after they were informed of their success or failure in passing to the next phase), participants received messages allegedly sent by their partners. The content of the message emphasized either social acceptance or empowerment or neither social acceptance nor empowerment (i.e., the control condition). Thus, the experimental design was a 2 3 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) Message (empowerment vs. acceptance vs. control). We hypothesized that messages emphasizing empowerment would render victims readier to reconcile, whereas messages emphasizing acceptance would render perpetrators readier to reconcile.\nMethod"

Participants completed the feedback form electronically and ostensibly exchanged feedback with their partner by pressing a Send or Receive button.3\nThis feedback consisted of ratings on two subscales, each containing four items. The first subscale rated the participants\u2019 competence on four measures (talent, creativity, originality, and quality of ideas), and the second subscale rated the partners\u2019 agreeableness and interpersonal skills (the extent to which the participant was perceived as kind, agreeable, pleasant to work with, and having good social skills). The manipulation of empowerment through competence feedback and acceptance through feedback on agreeableness and interpersonal skills is consistent with Foa and Foa\u2019s (1980) resource theory as well as with research in the field of empowerment, which treats competence as one of its components (Brookings & Bolton, 2000; Menson & Hartmann, 2002; Vardi, 2000; Yiannakis & Melnick, 2001), and research in the field of agreeableness, which associates this trait with the feeling of being accepted by others (Buckley, Winkel, & Leary, 2004). On the empirical level, the competence feedback was designed to increase participants\u2019 sense of power, and the feedback was aimed at increasing their public moral image; these manipulations were successful in inducing the intended psychological effects.\nIn the empowerment condition, participants received feedback implying that they were perceived by their partners as very competent and creative (receiving an average competence score of 6.5) but mediocre on agreeableness (receiving an average agreeableness score of 3.5); in the acceptance condition, the partners\u2019 feedback implied that they perceived the participant as very agreeable (receiving an average agreeableness score of 6.5) but mediocre in terms of competence (receiving an average competence score of 3.5). In the control condition, the partners\u2019 feedback implied that participants were perceived as mediocre on competence and agreeableness (both average scores were 3.5). After participants finished reading the feedback, they were asked to fill in the dependent measure questionnaire in a manner similar to Study 1 (assessing the manipulation checks as well as the dependent variables: sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile with the partner).4 Upon completion, participants were thanked and debriefed."

Receiving a message of empowerment from an opponent positively affected participants\u2019 sense of power, but this change was associated with increased willingness to reconcile only among victims; perpetrators\u2019 willingness to reconcile was not affected by the change in their sense of power. By contrast, receiving a message of acceptance from an opponent positively affected perpetrators\u2019 public moral image, and this change was associated with an increase in their willingness to reconcile. Receiving a message of acceptance did not enhance victims\u2019 public moral image. This result might reflect a ceiling effect; that is, because victims\u2019 public moral image had not been impaired in the first place (as suggested by our model and as indicated by the finding that victims\u2019 average score on public moral image was 5.94 on a 7-point scale), it could not be raised much further. Furthermore, as our claim is that the resources that are damaged for victims and perpetrators are their sense of power and public moral image, respectively, it makes sense that the extent of change in these resources following messages of empowerment or acceptance would be different due to the differences in their perspectives. To replicate the findings of Study 2 and to extend their generalizability, we assessed the next two experiments and the same hypotheses by using vignettes that described real-life situations.\nStudy 3\nStudy 3 tested the same hypotheses tested in Study 2 in the context of a real-life situation. To accomplish this task, we used two versions of the same vignette. Both depicted exactly the same situation but from opposite perspectives: In the perpetrator condition, the protagonist was the offender and the antagonist was the offended party, whereas in the victim condition, the roles were reversed. In the story, the antagonist approached the protagonist after the offense occurred and conveyed a message of empowerment, acceptance, empowerment and acceptance, or none of these.\nIt should be noted that it was highly important for the different messages to be meaningful and relevant for both victims and perpetrators. It is likely that a uniform message such as I understand your perspective or I acknowledge violating your rights without any further reference to the specific context of the incident would be perceived as too general and therefore artificial and even condescending. We therefore decided to phrase different messages for victims and perpetrators that would refer to the specific context and details of the victimization episode and thus be perceived as natural and meaningful for both victims and perpetrators. Despite the different phrasing of the messages, they nevertheless manipulated the same variables (i.e., acceptance and empowerment); furthermore, the measurement of the dependent variables was identical for victims and perpetrators. We therefore conducted the\nanalyses for victims and perpetrators together; the advantage of conducting such an analysis (in contrast to conducting separate analysis for each role) is that it makes it possible to detect a Role Message interaction.\nThe experimental design was thus a 2 2 2 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) Empowerment (included vs. not included) Acceptance (included vs. not included). Because the same theoretical constructs were manipulated differently, this study could have been presented as two 2 (acceptance vs. empowerment) 2 (included vs. not included) experiments (i.e., for perpetrators and victims separately). The cost of such a strategy would have been an inability to assess the statistical significance of the Role Message interaction, which is the central theoretical prediction of this study. We therefore opted for the above 2 2 2 factorial design. The dependent variables (sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile) were identical to those measured in Study 2.\nOn the basis of our theoretical model, we hypothesized that although a message of empowerment would increase sense of power for all participants, it would be associated with greater willingness to reconcile only among victims. In contrast, a message of social acceptance would enhance the public moral image of all participants but would facilitate reconciliation only among perpetrators.\nMethod"

Then we compared the two regression coefficients by computing the difference between them and dividing it by the standard error of their difference.\nWillingness to reconcile. The significant main effects for role, F(1, 147) 15.16, p .001, 2 .09, acceptance, F(1, 147) 45.37, p .001, 2 .24, and empowerment, F(1, 147) 23.74, p .001, 2 .14, were qualified by a Role Acceptance interaction, F(1, 147) 13.68, p .001, 2 .09, and a Role Empowerment interaction, F(1, 147) 4.39, p .05, 2 .03. Planned comparisons probing the Role Acceptance interaction indicated that the effect of acceptance on willingness to reconcile was significant for perpetrators, F(1, 147) 69.68, p .001, 2 .47, but only approached significance for victims, F(1, 147) 3.53, p .07, 2 .05. In contrast, receiving a message of empowerment significantly increased willingness to reconcile for victims, F(1, 147) 18.25, p .001, 2 .20, but not for perpetrators, F(1, 147) 2.23, ns, 2 .03."

A Sobel test of mediation confirmed that the indirect effect of empowerment on willingness to reconcile significantly differed from zero (z 6.47, p .05). This indicated that among victims, sense of power mediated the relationship between receiving a message of empowerment and willingness to reconcile, as predicted by our theoretical model.

After we regressed willingness to reconcile simultaneously on acceptance and public moral image, the relationship between acceptance and willingness to reconcile decreased ( .23, p .05). A Sobel test of mediation confirmed that the indirect effect of acceptance on willingness to reconcile significantly differed from zero (z 4.67, p .001). This result indicates that among perpetrators, public moral image partially mediated the relationship between receiving a message of acceptance and willingness to reconcile, as predicted by our theoretical model.\nFor victims, by contrast, the relationship between receiving a message of acceptance and willingness to reconcile approached significance ( .22, p .06) as did the relationship between public moral image and willingness to reconcile ( .24, p .07).

            "text": "In general, the results of Study 3 support our hypotheses. Receiving a message of acceptance increased participants\u2019 public moral image, but the increase in public moral image was related to an increase in willingness to reconcile only among perpetrators; victims\u2019 public moral image was not related to willingness to reconcile. By contrast, receiving a message of empowerment increased participants\u2019 sense of power, but the increase in sense of power was related to willingness to reconcile only among victims; perpetrators\u2019 sense of power did not affect their willingness to reconcile. These findings support the main assertion of our model that willingness to reconcile is mediated by satisfaction of victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 different needs.\nIn addition to these findings, which lend direct support to our model, we also found that the Role Empowerment interaction had a significant effect on both the empowerment manipulation check and the sense of power measurement. These findings indicate that victims were more affected by a message of empowerment than were perpetrators. This might reflect victims\u2019 stronger motivation to restore their sense of power: Because victims\u2019 sense of power is impaired in the victimization episode, they might be more sensitive to messages that remedy this impairment and therefore might be more affected by empowerment messages than might perpetrators, whose sense of power has not been similarly affected.\nSimilarly, the Role Acceptance interaction had a significant effect on both the acceptance manipulation check and the public moral image measurement. These results indicate that perpetrators were more affected by a message of acceptance than were victims. This might reflect perpetrators\u2019 stronger motivation to restore their public moral image; that is, because perpetrators\u2019 public moral image is harmed in the victimization episode, they might be more sensitive to messages that remedy this harm and therefore might be more affected by such messages than might victims, whose public moral image has not been similarly affected. These results are consistent with our theoretical model.\nAnother intriguing finding is that although the manipulations of acceptance and empowerment were perceived as intended, their effects were not orthogonal. Participants perceived messages of acceptance as expressing some amount of empowerment and messages of empowerment as expressing some amount of acceptance. This nonorthogonality was also found in a study that assessed the effects of receiving messages of empathy and responsibility (i.e., acceptance and empowerment in terms of the present study) on participants\u2019 willingness to reconcile in the context of intergroup conflict (Nadler & Liviatan, 2006). Consistent with Nadler and Liviatan\u2019s (2006) suggestion, such nonorthogonality may be unavoidable in the context of a conflict when the opponent makes an unexpected positive gesture. However, this nonorthogonality represents an unavoidable partial overlap rather than equivalence in\nthe effects of these two independent variables. The fact that the magnitude of the effect of each independent variable on its corresponding manipulation check (i.e., acceptance on perceived acceptance and empowerment on perceived empowerment) was higher than its effect on the noncorresponding measure (i.e., empowerment on perceived acceptance and acceptance on perceived empowerment) supports this view. Also, the effects of these two variables on the main dependent measures were consistent with our predictions. This suggests that our manipulations are better seen as emphasizing empowerment or acceptance rather than as excluding one or the other.\nStudy 4\nStudy 4 tested the complete needs-based model of reconciliation, from the differential impairment of the psychological resources of victims and perpetrators through the fulfillment of victims\u2019 and perpetrators\u2019 emotional needs, resulting in the increased willingness of the two sides to reconcile. Unlike the previous experiments, which assessed participants\u2019 perceptions following a victimization episode (Study 1) or their perceptions following the receipt of a message from their adversary (Studies 2 and 3), Study 4 assessed participants\u2019 perceptions and willingness to reconcile before and after receiving a message from their rival. Thus, it examined the full range of the model\u2019s hypotheses. The major prediction of this study was that willingness to reconcile should be characterized by a three-way Role Message Time of Measurement interaction."

The experimental design followed a split plot factorial design: a 2 (role: victim vs. perpetrator) 2 (message: empowerment vs. acceptance) between-subjects design, combined with a withinsubject design (time: before vs. after receiving the message from the antagonist).\nIn addition, in order to replicate the findings of Study 1, we measured participants\u2019 needs for power and social acceptance before receiving the message from their partner. We predicted that, as in Study 1, before receiving the message, victims would perceive themselves as weaker than perpetrators and would therefore express a higher need for power, whereas perpetrators would perceive themselves as having a worse public moral image compared with that of victims and would therefore express a higher need for social acceptance.\nOn the basis of our theoretical model, we also hypothesized that participants who received a message of acceptance from their partner would exhibit higher ratings for public moral image than would those who received a message of empowerment. In contrast, a message of empowerment should enhance participants\u2019 sense of power more than should a message of acceptance. Further, we predicted that the increase in participants\u2019 public moral image would be related to an increased willingness to reconcile only for perpetrators, whereas an increase in participants\u2019 sense of power would be related to an increased willingness to reconcile only for victims.

            "text": "The results of Study 4 support our theoretical model. First, this study replicated the findings of Study 1 that being a perpetrator threatens one\u2019s public moral image, resulting in a greater need for social acceptance, and that being a victim threatens one\u2019s sense of power, resulting in a greater need for power. Second, the repeated measures analyses revealed that the messages of acceptance and empowerment had the expected effect on the restoration of participants\u2019 psychological resources: The increase in participants\u2019 sense of power was higher following a message of empowerment than following a message of acceptance; in contrast, the increase in participants\u2019 public moral image was higher following a message of acceptance than following a message of empowerment. Third, as expected, the increase in victims\u2019 willingness to reconcile was higher in the empowerment condition than in the acceptance condition, whereas the reverse pattern was true for perpetrators, whose willingness to reconcile increased in the acceptance condition more than it did in the empowerment condition. Thus, the restoration of the differentially impaired psychological resources of victims and perpetrators promoted their willingness to reconcile.\nThe finding that across conditions (i.e., after receiving any positive message from their partner, either acceptance or empowerment) victims\u2019 sense of power increased, whereas that of perpetrators\u2019 decreased, which may imply a regression to the mean effect on the second measurement. Alternatively, for victims, this increase in sense of power may indicate that their greater need for power led them to interpret any positive message from their partner as affirming their power. The parallel finding that the increase in public moral image across conditions was significantly higher for perpetrators than for victims may be similarly explained as reflecting perpetrators\u2019 greater need for signs of acceptance, which may have led them to interpret any positive gesture from their partner as implying acceptance. Finally, the perpetrators\u2019, but not the victims\u2019, greater increase in willingness to reconcile across conditions, which cannot by explained as a regression to mean effect (as perpetrators\u2019 initial level of willingness to reconcile was higher than that of victims), may be interpreted as reflecting their relatively greater need to restore social harmony with the victim, which finds expression in willingness to reconciliation in response to any positive indication from the other side.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe above four experiments support the hypotheses of the needs-based model of reconciliation. Taken together, these studies indicate that a victimizing episode makes victims feel less powerful and perpetrators feel more morally inadequate. Thus, the main psychological resource that is damaged for victims is their sense of power, whereas the main psychological resource that is damaged\nfor perpetrators is their sense of belongingness and social acceptance. Consequently, a social exchange interaction that restores the respective psychological resources of the adversaries facilitates their willingness to reconcile. These findings support the main tenet of our model, which states that reconciliation between adversaries depends on satisfying relevant emotional needs and restoring their damaged psychological resources.\nThe empirical support for our hypotheses is underscored by the methodological differences that existed between the five studies: Studies 1 and 2 tested the hypotheses in the context of a laboratory experiment in which the social role (victim or perpetrator) was determined ad hoc, whereas Studies 3 and 4 were role-playing experiments in which participants imagined how they would feel and act in a vignette they had read; yet another study (mentioned in the Discussion section of Study 1) used the context of real-life situations. The studies also differed on the following dimensions: (a) the characteristics of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, such as whether these were relationships between strangers who had not met before (Studies 1 and 2) or imagined relationships in the workplace that were either hierarchical (Study 3) or equal (Study 4); and (b) the type of harm caused, such as limiting the victim\u2019s capacity to influence the situation (Study 3), harming the victims\u2019 self-esteem (Studies 1 and 2), or a combination of the two (Study 4).\nThe primary contribution of the model is that it presents a motivational perspective on socio-emotional reconciliation processes. Although existing models of conflict resolution address the motivations of adversaries in conflict, these motivations are usually conceptualized in general and unspecific terms, such as the motivation for maximization of outcomes (Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996). In contrast, the present model outlines specific motivations and pinpoints how they are related to the impairment of psychological resources among parties in conflict. Furthermore, the model differentiates between the emotional motivations of victims and perpetrators, as opposed to prior studies that have focused on only one side of the conflict\u2014usually the victim. In place of this one-sided focus, the current perspective focuses on the interaction between victims and perpetrators and how this may facilitate (or inhibit) reconciliation between them. Naturally, such a perspective is theoretically and empirically more complex. The main assertion of the model\u2014that reconciliation requires a successful emotional \u201cbarter\u201d between victims and perpetrators integrates intrapersonal processes with interpersonal processes in a manner that is characteristically absent from social psychology (Semin, 1997).\nThe needs-based model of reconciliation offers a general theoretical framework for understanding the findings of other studies in the field. Findings that the effectiveness of an apology increases when accompanied by an admission of guilt by the perpetrator (Darby & Schlenker, 1982) might be interpreted as reflecting the fact that an admission of guilt satisfies victims\u2019 need for empowerment. Fatal quarrels instigated \u201cover nothing,\u201d which are the focus of Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, and Schwarz\u2019s (1996) study on the Southern culture of honor, are not conflicts over the division of contested resources. In terms of our model, these are conflicts over the emotional resources of acceptance and empowerment. Similarly, the social needs for vengeance (discussed by Frijda, 1994) and for forgiveness (Enright et al., 1998) may be conceptualized as reflecting victims\u2019 need to restore their sense of power and perpetrators\u2019 need to restore their public moral image and sense of belonging to the community."

            "text": "Because our model addresses the interaction between parties in conflict, it was important to be able to randomly assign participants to the role of perpetrator and victim in both laboratory experiments and the role-playing vignettes. Random assignment to the role of victim is relatively easy because of the passive nature of this social role. The induction of the perception that one is a perpetrator is more difficult. It requires that participants view themselves as having volitionally hurt another person who had done them no harm. Situations in which the victimization is done unintentionally (e.g., the perpetrator looked after the victim\u2019s child and did not pay attention to the child\u2019s drinking of a poisonous substance\u2014a vignette used by Scho\u0308nbach, 1990) are inadequate for this purpose as they do not follow the conditions required for the attribution of blame, that is, that the perpetrator will be able to foresee the consequences of his conduct, have control over his behavior, and behave intentionally in a given way (Shaver, 1985). Situations in which a person hurts another person with no immediately available justification (e.g., a sadistic act) are also problematic as it would have been impossible to randomly place participants in an experimental setting in which they hurt another person for no apparent reason or justification; similarly, in the case of role-playing studies, it does not make sense that such situations would produce an appropriate level of identification. Thus, the induction of perpetration that holds moral responsibility is possible only if viewed by the average person as related to contextual demands such as job requirements or conflicting interests (such as when favoring selfinterest involves hurting the partner and vice versa).\nAlthough at first glance this characteristic of the present research may seem to limit the generalizability of the findings and the model, closer scrutiny reveals that this is not the case. First, most daily real-life interactions between victims and perpetrators have characteristics that are similar to the ones in our research. In fact, when we asked people to report on real-life episodes in which they had caused harm to another person (i.e., see description of the study in the Discussion section of Study 1) they reported episodes in which there had been some justification to hurt the other person, such as preferring one\u2019s own interests over the other\u2019s interests, retaliation for previous harm done to them, doing an honest job of criticizing the other, unwillingness to have the extent of proximity desired by the victims (such as in breaking up with a romantic partner), et cetera. Although one could argue that such accounts represent selective reporting, research indicates that perpetrators tend to deny their culpability, even when their behavior is judged as blameworthy by others (Baumeister, 1996; Mikula, 2002). The gap between victims and perpetrators in their perceptions of the latter\u2019s culpability is consistent with current literature on justice, which suggests that people\u2019s affective reactions (e.g., anger or satisfaction) to the outcome of a certain situation influences their judgments of its fairness rather than the other way around (in other words, justice judgments are emotionally, rather than cognitively, based; Mullen & Skitka, 2006). It makes sense that because victims and perpetrators experience different emotions following a victimization episode, their perceptions of it as unjust, and consequently, their perceptions of the perpetrator\u2019s blameworthiness/culpability, will be different in a predictable/consistent\nmanner. For this reason, it is claimed that \u201cevil is in the eyes of the beholder\u201d (Baumeister, 1996, p. 1).\nSecond, this characteristic of our research does not affect the major claim of our model. It should be recalled that the model suggests that regardless of feelings of objective or subjective justifications and the associated feelings of guilt that one has for having harmed another person, perpetrators have a need to ameliorate the perception that others view their behavior as wrong and relatively immoral. This perception represents a threat to inclusion in one\u2019s moral community that a message of acceptance is argued to ameliorate. Such perceptions of threat to inclusion in the moral community were successfully induced in our experiments as is evidenced by the decrease in public moral image suffered by participants who had been randomly assigned to the role of perpetrators."

            "text": "The present model suggests a number of issues that may be researched in the future. The first of these is that the dependent variable measured in Studies 2, 3, and 4 was a self-rated willingness to reconcile. Because the success of the reconciliation process is highly dependent upon the adversaries\u2019 attitudes (e.g., their willingness to be involved in such a process, their perceptions of future relations) we believe this measure to be adequate for testing our model\u2019s hypotheses. However, because we aim to apply our model to real-life conflicts, it remains for future research to determine the extent to which self-rated willingness to reconcile predicts actual reconciliatory behavior.\nSecond, our model and research focuses on situations in which there is a relative consensus regarding who the victim is. Yet, in many real-life situations in which such consensus does not exist, both parties may perceive themselves as victims, and there may even exist a degree of competition over who is the \u201creal\u201d victim (Nadler, 2002). Although we assume that our model also applies to such complex situations, it remains for future research to address this issue empirically.\nThird, applying the needs-based model of reconciliation to intergroup contexts might provide a broad framework to test variables, such as strength of ingroup identification, collective guilt (Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, & Manstead, 1998), and level of social categorization (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005), which have been found to influence the willingness of group members to reconcile. Nadler and Liviatan (2006) provided partial support for the model\u2019s applicability to the intergroup level in a study that tested the willingness of Jewish Israelis to reconcile with Palestinians. The researchers found that in predicting willingness to reconcile, Jewish Israeli subjects (who belong to the more powerful party in the conflict and are therefore likely to be viewed as the guilty oppressors) were more responsive to Palestinians\u2019 expressions of empathy with Israelis (which can be viewed as a manifestation of social acceptance) than to Palestinians\u2019 acceptance of responsibility for hurting them (which can be viewed as a manifestation of empowerment). However, further research is required in order to provide more comprehensive support for the model\u2019s applicability at the intergroup level.\nFinally, on the practical level, the needs-based model of reconciliation can contribute to the advancement of emotionally intelligent justice (a term suggested by Sherman, 2003) through the\ndevelopment of restorative practices, that is, practices that restore relationships, connections among people, trust, and mutual understanding and thus make cooperative problem solving possible (Wachtel & McCold, 2001). These practices involve nurturing the expression of vulnerable emotions (Braithwaite, 2006), and our model can cast light upon the nature of these emotions as well as on the psychological needs that lie beneath them.\nIn conclusion, our focus on the emotional motivations underlying the reconciliation process comes on the heels of a relatively long period during which these motivations were neglected in favor of more instrumental concerns. However, understanding the factors that help to repair relationships between victims and perpetrators has practical meaning for the fields of conflict resolution and reconciliation.\nReferences\nAkhtar, S.
