    "abstractText": "People are more forgiving toward transgressors if they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses, as demonstrated in 7 studies. Methods included hypothetical scenarios, actual recalled offenses, individual and group processes, and correlational and experimental designs. Three factors mediated the link between personal capability and forgiveness: seeing the other\u2019s offense as less severe, greater empathic understanding, and perceiving oneself as similar to the transgressor. In terms of predicting forgiveness, it was important that people\u2019s own offenses were similar to the target offense in terms of both severity and type. The personal capability effect was independent of other established predictors of forgiveness and was more pronounced among men than women.",

Baumeister and Anne L. Zell Florida State University\nAmy J. Kraft Arizona State University\nCharlotte V. O. Witvliet Hope College\nPeople are more forgiving toward transgressors if they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses, as demonstrated in 7 studies. Methods included hypothetical scenarios, actual recalled offenses, individual and group processes, and correlational and experimental designs. Three factors mediated the link between personal capability and forgiveness: seeing the other\u2019s offense as less severe, greater empathic understanding, and perceiving oneself as similar to the transgressor. In terms of predicting forgiveness, it was important that people\u2019s own offenses were similar to the target offense in terms of both severity and type. The personal capability effect was independent of other established predictors of forgiveness and was more pronounced among men than women.\nKeywords: forgiveness, vengefulness, humility, empathy, gender\nForgiveness can be a powerful means to heal emotions and relationships after a transgression (see Worthington, 2005a, for a review), and it may also promote physical health (e.g., Lawler et al., 2003; Witvliet, 2001, 2005; Witvliet & McCullough, 2007; Worthington & Scherer, 2004). In spite of its potential benefits, however, forgiving can be costly in terms of pride and immediate self-interest (Exline & Baumeister, 2000). Forgiveness requires that people forego bitter feelings and desires for vengeance (Enright & Fitzgibbons, 2000), perhaps even replacing them with positive emotions (Worthington, 2005b). The process of forgiving can be a strenuous one, especially in cases of deep hurt.\nPeople are most likely to forgive when certain conditions are met: when offenses are minor (Boon & Sulsky, 1997; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002); when offended parties cultivate empathic feelings toward their offenders (Fincham, Paleari, & Regalia, 2002; McCullough et al., 1998; McCullough, Worthington, & Rachal,\n1997); and when offenses occur within close, committed relationships (Finkel, Rusbult, Kumashiro, & Hannon, 2002; Karremans, Van Lange, Ouwerkerk, & Kluwer, 2003). One means of facilitating these positive perceptions and feelings might be to focus on one\u2019s own potential for a similar misdeed. Our central hypothesis was that people would show greater forgiveness to the extent that they could recall or envision themselves committing similar offenses. This article presents seven studies to test this hypothesis.\nSelf-Enhancement as a Response to Transgression\nWhen faced with violations of social rules, one common response is to make judgments, asking the following: How serious is this offense? Should the offender be punished? Is forgiveness conceivable? Unfortunately, objective and dispassionate appraisals of transgressions may be relatively rare and difficult. Cognitive judgments are often clouded by emotion (Haidt, 2001), and emotion can be intense in the wake of transgression. As described by Goffman (1955), people who offend others push them down in symbolic terms, treating them with disrespect. To combat their feelings of rage and shame, victims typically feel a need to reestablish a position of strength and safety, and they often want to punish wrongdoers as well (Darley & Pittman, 2003; Tripp, Bies, & Aquino, 2002).\nIn cognitive terms, one way to accomplish both goals might be to see oneself as righteous and innocent while viewing the offending party as morally inferior: \u201cI would never do anything so horrible!\u201d Downward comparison, which involves comparing oneself to others who are faring worse, is a recognized method of bolstering the self (Wills, 1981; Wood, Taylor, & Lichtman,\nJulie Juola Exline, Department of Psychology, Case Western Reserve University; Roy F. Baumeister and Anne L. Zell, Department of Psychology, Florida State University; Amy J. Kraft, Department of Psychology, Arizona State University; Charlotte V. O.

Particularly when feeling threatened, people may derogate others to turn them into targets of downward comparison (Gibbons & Gerrard, 1991). By focusing on the contrast between one\u2019s own qualities (or actions) and those of the offending party, the evaluator can enjoy the comforts of self-enhancement while creating a safe sense of moral distance from the offender.\nHow might self-enhancing comparisons affect attitudes toward an offender? One likely consequence is that the offender\u2019s misdeeds will seem to grow in size. When people adopt a victim\u2019s perspective, they often exaggerate the severity of the offense (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Wotman, 1990). Such biases can be so strong that people may be unable to override them even if given strong incentives, such as monetary compensation (Stillwell & Baumeister, 1997). Adopting a victim stance might also promote the demonization of offenders (Ellard, Miller, Baumle, & Olson, 2002), whose acts are viewed as monstrous and inexplicable. People often understand transgressions on the basis of what Baumeister (1997) termed the myth of pure evil, a belief that those who commit serious offenses are rotten to the core\u2014and fundamentally different from good people such as oneself.\nSelf-enhancing strategies may benefit offended parties by helping them to feel safe, strong, and morally good. But if people create a sense of moral distance between themselves and their offenders, how might such a stance affect decisions about forgiveness? If people demonize their offenders and see their actions as being rooted in pure evil, it seems likely that their responses will center on self-protection or retribution rather than forgiveness.\nReflecting on One\u2019s Personal Capability for Similar Offenses\nTo understand how people move from grudge holding to forgiveness, we believe that it is crucial to identify alternatives to the processes of demonization and distancing that commonly occur in response to an offense. One possibility is that people might reflect on their own capability for committing similar offenses\u2014a perception that we term personal capability throughout this article. Our main hypothesis is that personal capability will prove to be a robust predictor of forgiveness. Why? We propose three possible mechanisms."

            "heading": "Enhanced Sense of Similarity",
            "text": "Identifying with an offender, even in a minimal way, should help to break down psychological barriers that people erect to distance themselves. Focusing on themes of common humanity can facilitate forgiveness (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005). Seeing the similarities between oneself and an offender is also likely to be humbling, and humility should work against a self-righteous, judgmental mindset that distances the perpetrator from the victim (Exline, Campbell, et al., 2004; Tangney, 2000, 2002).\nRelevant Findings From Prior Research: Forgiveness and Empathy\nAs described above, we proposed that personal capability would predict forgiveness through several distinct pathways. Two of these pathways\u2014deepened understanding of the other\u2019s offense and a sense of similarity to the offender\u2014involve processes related to empathy. Many studies have revealed positive associations between empathy and forgiveness (e.g., Brown, 2003; Fincham et al., 2002; Konstam, Chernoff, & Deveney, 2001; Macaskill, Maltby, & Day, 2002; McCullough et al., 1997, 1998; Toussaint & Webb, 2005; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002). Treatment models of forgiveness by Enright and Fitzgibbons (2000) and Worthington (1998) also include a focus on one\u2019s own offenses (see also Malcolm, Warwar, & Greenberg, 2005).\nMost of the studies in this area have framed empathy as a disposition (Brown, 2003; Konstam et al., 2001; Macaskill et al., 2002; Toussaint & Webb, 2005) or in emotional terms, tapping feelings of warmth or sympathy (Fincham et al., 2002; McCullough et al., 1997, 1998). Researchers have devoted less attention to the cognitive, perspective-taking aspect of empathy that would take place in relation to a specific offense, and it is this more cognitive aspect of empathy that seems most relevant to personal capability.\nSeveral forgiveness researchers note the lack of attention to cognitive facets of empathy (McCullough et al., 1997; Toussaint & Webb, 2005). Although McCullough et al. (1997) did include a cognitive measure, results from that measure were inconclusive, and subsequent studies focused on emotional empathy (McCullough et al., 1998). Brown (2003) found that dispositional forgiveness correlated positively with the cognitive, perspective-taking facet of empathy. However, the perspective-taking measure used was dispositional rather than situation specific.\nWitvliet, Ludwig, and Vander Laan (2001) compared the effects of an empathic perspective-taking manipulation with conditions involving forgiveness, rumination, and grudge holding. The empathy condition had a cognitive emphasis, asking participants to focus on the humanity of the offender, factors in the offender\u2019s life that may have contributed to the offense, and/or times when the participants themselves had needed to be forgiven. Compared with the rumination and grudge-holding conditions, empathic perspective taking significantly reduced anger, arousal, and negative emotion as well as heart rate, blood pressure, sweat, and brow electromyography. Empathy also increased perceived control, pleasant relaxation, and joy. Yet, in terms of facilitating positive emotion and reducing negative emotion and arousal, the forgiveness manipulation was even more effective than the empathy manipulation.\nThe closest empirical precedent for our work on personal capability comes from several scenario-based experiments. Takaku\n(2001) and Takaku, Weiner, and Ohbuchi (2001) found that perspective taking (asking participants to recall prior offenses of their own) made participants more likely than controls to accept imaginary apologies from hypothetical offenders. Although clearly relevant to our ideas about personal capability, these studies had a circumscribed focus: They emphasized hypothetical situations in which apologies were being offered.\nIn summary, prior research on empathy and forgiveness provided some empirical backing for the hypothesized connection between personal capability and forgiveness. Our aim here was to perform a much more systematic and intensive examination of the proposed connection, including tests of the three proposed mediators, consideration of potential confounds, and use of both interpersonal and intergroup offenses. The use of experimental designs also allowed us to examine several important boundary conditions, which we describe next.\nPossible Pitfalls of Focusing on One\u2019s Own Offenses\nEven if seeing one\u2019s own capability for wrongdoing is associated with forgiveness (in correlational terms), does it follow that prompting people to focus on their own offenses will promote forgiveness? It might, if such self-reflection facilitates the kinds of empathic, humbling, and offense-diminishing processes described earlier. But it also seems possible that being asked to reflect on one\u2019s own misdeeds could backfire. First, a person might recall an offense of a very different type (e.g., an academic cheating situation as opposed to an ethnic slur). Any subsequent comparisons may not facilitate understanding of the target offense because the two situations are so different. Second, because of the prevalence of self-enhancement motives (e.g., Sedikides & Strube, 1997), it seems likely that many people would recall offenses that are less severe than the target offense. Seeing one\u2019s own offense as less severe could lead to a contrast effect, magnifying the other\u2019s offense rather than diminishing it. To facilitate forgiveness, then, it may be important for people to recall offenses that are truly similar to the target in terms of both severity and type. We examined these issues in Studies 5 and 6.\nA second problem is that reflecting on one\u2019s own offenses could bring up self-focused negative emotions. Earlier studies have shown that asking people to recall humbling situations can prompt feelings of shame and weakness. These self-focused negative emotions, in turn, can make people less generous (Exline & Fisher, 2005) and more aggressive (Exline & Zell, 2006). Simply being in a bad mood could make people harsh in their judgments. If people also feel ashamed and defensive regarding their own offenses, the resulting desire to repair their self-images might increase the tendency to derogate others rather than fostering forgiveness. We examined this possibility in Study 5.\nThe Potential for Gender Differences\nWhen we launched this line of research, gender was of peripheral interest to us. We tend to err on the side of not focusing on gender differences unless there is some clear conceptual reason for doing so (see Baumeister, 1988). However, some recent findings persuaded us to take a closer look at gender. For example, several studies examined whether recalling humbling events would affect responses to betrayal in a laboratory game (Exline & Zell, 2006).\nMen were less aggressive in response to the betrayal if they had written about a time when they felt humble (vs. proud or important). Women did not show this pattern. Another recent study found that within married couples, emotional empathy was a stronger predictor of forgiveness by husbands than by wives (Fincham et al., 2002). Likewise, a questionnaire study found that dispositional empathy predicted forgiveness by men but not by women (Toussaint & Webb, 2005).\nGranted, the above findings had only indirect relevance to our work. Our interest was in personal capability, a situation-specific construct with a cognitive emphasis. We were not studying humility, emotional empathy, or dispositional empathy. Nonetheless, the prior findings suggested that gender might moderate the effects of humbling or empathic processing in ways relevant to personal capability. Specifically, they raised the possibility that reflecting on one\u2019s own misdeeds might facilitate forgiveness more among men than among women.\nThe Present Research\nIn the studies presented here, our goal was not only to see whether a link exists between personal capability and forgiveness but also to examine potential mediators (Study 2) and rule out other third-variable explanations (Studies 2 and 6). We wanted to determine whether the pattern was specific to college students (Study 1) and whether it might generalize to severe intergroup offenses (Study 3). We also used experimental designs (Studies 4\u20137) to examine the effects of having people focus on their offenses, and we paid particular attention to the possibility of gender differences in those studies.\nStudy 1: Comparing Forgiveness and Unforgiveness in Two Samples\nWe started with a simple design to test whether forgiven offenses, relative to unforgiven offenses, would be associated with a higher sense of personal capability. Because generalizability concerns were particularly important to us in this initial study, we used two samples to test our hypothesis: an undergraduate sample and a more diverse Internet-based sample.\nMethod"

Internet participants also reported more forgiveness in the forgiveness condition (M 5.0, SD 1.2) than in the unforgiveness condition (M 2.1, SD 1.4), t(100) 18.23, p .01, 2 .77.\nWe predicted that when compared with unforgiveness cases, forgiveness cases would be associated with a greater sense of one\u2019s own capability for committing a similar offense. This prediction was strongly supported in both the undergraduate sample (forgiveness case, M 3.0, SD 1.6; unforgiveness case, M 1.8, SD 1.8), t(140) 6.61, p .01, 2 .24, and the Internet sample (forgiveness case, M 2.4, SD 1.7; unforgiveness case, M 1.5, SD 1.2), t(100) 4.59, p .01, 2 .17. No significant interactions were found on the basis of age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, or student versus nonstudent status.\nWe also examined correlations between forgiveness and personal capability within each condition. In both samples, personal capability correlated positively with forgiveness in the unforgiveness case\u2014undergraduate, r(142) .23, p .01, and Internet, r(103) .22, p .05\u2014 but not in the forgiveness case\u2014 undergraduate, r(147) .10, ns, and Internet, r(110) .07, ns. The nonsignificant associations in the forgiveness case may have been partly due to ceiling effects. It is also possible that cultivating a sense of personal capability is particularly relevant early in the\nforgiveness process, when the natural tendency is often to demonize one\u2019s offender.\nStudy 1 offered preliminary evidence for our hypothesis: Relative to cases of unforgiveness, cases of forgiveness involve acts that people see themselves more capable of committing. This association applied to both students and nonstudents. Study 1 also raised the possibility that personal capability predicts forgiveness mainly in cases in which people still harbor considerable anger toward their offenders.\nStudy 2: A Closer Look at the Capability\u2013Forgiveness Link\nStudy 1 demonstrated a link between personal capability and forgiveness. Next, we wanted to follow the strategy of a previous article on narcissistic entitlement and forgiveness (Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004). Specifically, we hypothesized that personal capability would still have unique predictive power when other robust predictors of forgiveness were controlled. First, we examined situational predictors of forgiveness that were discussed in the introduction: relationship commitment and apology. We also examined several individual-difference factors that have been linked with forgiveness in prior research.\nEarlier studies have shown that forgiveness levels correlate with the Big Five factors of personality, particularly low Neuroticism and high Agreeableness (e.g., Brown, 2003; McCullough & Hoyt, 2002). Some other forgiveness predictors include high dispositional forgiveness (e.g., Berry, Worthington, O\u2019Connor, Parrott, & Wade, 2005), high self-esteem (e.g., Miller, 2003), low narcissism and entitlement (e.g., Brown, 2004; Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004), high religiosity (see Worthington, 2005a, for a review), and high social desirability (e.g., Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004).\nWe reasoned that several of these factors might correlate with personal capability as well. For example, a willingness to focus on one\u2019s flaws would seem unlikely in narcissistic people or those with a high sense of entitlement, because they tend to be defensive about focusing on their faults (e.g., Campbell, Bonacci, Shelton, Exline, & Bushman, 2004). Competing predictions could be made about selfesteem: Given their positive self-views, people with high self-esteem could tend to downplay their potential for wrongdoing, much as narcissists do. However, their basic sense of security and confidence could enable them to admit shortcomings as well. Neurotic individuals might be highly aware of their personal capability for transgression, given their predispositions to focus on negative information (John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991), whereas conscientious people may carefully monitor their behavior and be quick to notice deviations from social rules. Because many religions emphasize the need to be accountable for transgressions, personal capability might correlate positively with religiosity. Finally, we reasoned that admitting moral flaws would be negatively linked with social desirability. Because any of these personality variables might serve as a confound, we examined whether the link between capability and forgiveness would remain significant when these factors were controlled.\nWe also evaluated the three potential mediators of the capability\u2013forgiveness association outlined in the introduction: If personal capability is indeed linked with forgiveness, is this because offenses seem smaller when people can relate to them? Or is the link due to empathic understanding or seeing oneself as similar to the offender? We predicted that all three mediation explanations would be supported.\nMethod"

We started by testing each variable as an individual mediator using the method popularized by Baron and Kenny (1986). Baron and Kenny\u2019s procedure involves three regression analyses: (a) Does the supposed predictor (or independent variable) X actually predict the criterion (or dependent variable) Y? (b) Does X also predict the supposed mediator M? (c) When X and M are both included in a regression equation predicting Y, does M continue to predict Y while X\u2019s contribution drops substantially? If all three criteria are met, and assuming that the proposed model makes conceptual sense, then the results can be said to support the hypothesis of mediation.\nTable 2 summarizes the hierarchical regressions used to test for mediation. The data met the first criterion, as shown in Model 1: Personal capability predicted lower TRIM (unforgiveness) scores. Criterion two also found support, as shown in Table 1: Personal capability was linked with lower severity ratings, higher perceived similarity to the offender, and higher empathic understanding. To test the third criterion, we ran three separate hierarchical regressions, as shown in Models 2A\u20132C in Table 2. In each model, the hypothesized mediator explained unique variance. The magnitude of the personal capability coefficients decreased in each case, although not to 0, suggesting partial mediation. (The coefficient for personal capability did drop to nonsignificance in model 2A, but not to 0.)\nTo provide a significance test for the question of mediation, we added a final column in Table 2 providing a z score. The z score came from the product of coefficients strategy, sometimes called the Sobel test (e.g., Sobel, 1982; see Preacher & Hayes, 2007, for a recent review). The strategy compares the indirect effects of X on Y (through M) with the standard error of these indirect effects. The\nresulting z score allows significance tests that evaluate whether the supposed mediator can truly be called a mediator\u2014that is, whether it statistically accounts for a significant part of X\u2019s prediction of Y. As shown in the final column of Table 2, all three hypothesized mediators met criteria for mediation using the Sobel test.\nWe had proposed what Preacher and Hayes (2007) described as a multiple mediation model. Our prediction was that severity, empathic understanding, and perceived similarity to the offender would each serve as distinct mediators of the link between personal capability and unforgiveness. In order to test for unique effects, we needed to consider all three mediators simultaneously. The three mediators did correlate highly with each other: severity and similarity, r(214) .39; severity and empathic understanding, r(215) .39; and similarity and empathic understanding, r(215) .47, all ps .01. Thus, it was conceivable that one or more of the mediation links would disappear when all three mediators were considered simultaneously.\nPart of the mediation question could be addressed through hierarchical regression. In Model 3 of Table 2, we added the three mediators to the equation. As predicted, all three continued to predict unique variance in unforgiveness when considered simultaneously, and the role of personal capability was no longer significant. Although these results were consistent with multiple mediation, we needed to see significance tests of mediation to draw firm conclusions. To address the question of multiple mediation, we turned to an SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes (2004). First, the macro used the product of coefficients strategy to compute a total indirect effect: Did the three proposed mediators, considered as a group, mediate the personal capability\u2013 unforgiveness link? The answer was yes, as indicated by the highly significant z score in the last column of Table 2. The macro then evaluated each of the proposed mediators, and each one yielded a significant z score (see Table 2). Taken together, these data provided strong evidence for the proposed multiple mediation pattern\ninvolving three distinct mediators: empathic understanding, perceived similarity to the offender, and offense severity.3"

            "text": "Because of the potential for bias in self-report scales, we also examined whether the link between personal capability and forgiveness would emerge using another forgiveness measure, one closer to actual behavior. As described in the Method section, we coded participants\u2019 open-ended reports of what they would like to say to the other person (assuming that they could speak openly with no fear of the other person\u2019s response). The more personal capability people expressed, the less hostility they expressed in these statements, and the more positive emotion they expressed. (See Table 1 for correlations.)\nAs with the TRIM, we wanted to see whether personal capability would predict unique variance in the behavioral forgiveness measures when other robust predictors of forgiveness were controlled. When we controlled for prerelationship closeness, personal capability continued to predict less expressed hostility, pr(189) .29, p .01, and more positive emotion, pr(189) .20, p .01. When we controlled for apology, personal capability still predicted less hostility, pr(188) .21, p .01, and marginally more positive emotion, pr(189) .13, p .10. When we controlled for all dispositional variables that predicted either positive emotion or hostility (Neuroticism, Extraversion, dispositional forgiveness, and religiosity; see Table 1), personal capability continued to predict more expressed positive emotion, pr(116) .22, p .05, and less expressed hostility, pr(116) .28, p .01. (When we controlled for each disposition individually, partial correlations ranged from .29 to .32, ps .01, for hostility and from .17 to .23, ps .07, for positive emotion.)\nFinally, we examined whether perceived similarity, empathic understanding, and severity would mediate the links between personal capability and expressed positive and negative emotion (as they did with TRIMs). For brevity, we report only the z scores relevant to mediation. When we assessed each proposed mediator individually, the hypothesis of mediation was supported for all three proposed mediators when predicting both positive emotion and hostility, with zs ranging from 2.41 ( p .05) to 4.58 ( p .01). When we considered all three mediators simultaneously in a model predicting positive emotion, perceived similarity met criteria for mediation (z 3.57, p .01). The mediational role of empathic understanding was marginal (z 1.82, p .10), whereas severity did not meet criteria for mediation (z 1.36, ns). In the case of negative emotion, all three proposed mediators met criteria for mediation when considered simultaneously (similarity, z 2.60, p .01; empathic understanding, z 2.38, p .05; severity, z 2.21, p .05.)\nIn summary, all three proposed mediators (similarity, empathic understanding, and severity) did meet criteria for mediation when considered individually. These associations held for both expressed hostility and positive emotion. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that when considered together, all three variables were distinct mediators of the link between personal capability and expressed hostility, just as they were in the case of TRIM scores. In the case of expressed positive emotion, perceived similarity to the offender emerged as a clear mediator, with empathic under-\nstanding playing a marginal role and offense severity not being significant."

            "text": "As in Study 1, results from Study 2 suggested that people will be more forgiving toward others if they see themselves as capable of a similar wrongdoing. Note that this link was shown not only with a standard self-report measure (the TRIM) but also with written statements of what people would like to say to their offenders. Personal capability continued to predict forgiveness even when we controlled for other robust predictors such as apology, relationship closeness, offense harmfulness, and several major dispositional factors.\nMultiple mediation analyses suggest that the link between capability and forgiveness can be explained through at least three proximal factors: First, seeing oneself capable of committing a certain offense may imply that the offense is not seen as very serious in moral terms. Second, seeing oneself as capable of committing a similar misdeed is associated with feeling similar to the offender. Third, personal capability is also linked with seeing the offense as more understandable. All three of these factors, in turn, predict greater forgiveness.\nStudy 3: From Personal Offenses to Intergroup Atrocities\u2014Responses to the September 11 Attacks\nStudies 1 and 2 demonstrated that in terms of everyday offenses, seeing oneself as capable of committing a similar offense is associated with greater forgiveness. Yet, there may be an upper limit to this association. What about cases involving heinous offenses such as the murder of innocent people? Could most people see themselves as capable of committing such an act? The attacks of September 11, 2001, provided an opportunity to examine people\u2019s responses to an extremely severe offense. Furthermore, this offense was one that was experienced at the group level, in contrast to the individual offenses in Studies 1 and 2. We reasoned that in the case of the events of 9/11, people\u2019s forgiveness-related judgments might reflect group-level thinking more than individual-level thinking. Specifically, we predicted that people would feel more forgiving toward the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks to the extent that they saw the United States government (rather than the individual self) as capable of a similar offense."

Undergraduates were asked to reflect on the 9/11 attacks, a situation that tested the limits of empathy. People had great difficulty seeing themselves as capable of committing an act as heinous as this one, and their personal sense of capability did not predict forgiving attitudes. As predicted, however, participants reported more forgiving attitudes to the extent that they saw their own government as capable of a similar offense. These associations remained significant after we controlled for participants\u2019 level of support for military action.\nStudies 4\u20137: Experimental Designs\u2014Does Reflecting on One\u2019s Own Offenses Promote Forgiving Attitudes?\nStudies 1\u20133 confirmed the link between personal capability and forgiveness in both interpersonal and intergroup contexts. Our next aim was to shift to an experimental approach: Is it possible to facilitate forgiving attitudes by prompting people to consider their own misdeeds?\nOur strategy was to ask people to focus on similar offenses of their own. We chose this technique for two reasons. First, there was an empirical precedent for this procedure in several apology\u2013 forgiveness studies (Takaku, 2001; Takaku et al., 2001). Second, pilot studies suggested that reflection on past offenses was more potent and engaging than techniques such as imagining hypothetical future offenses, listing reasons why one might commit a similar offense, or recalling situations involving temptation but no misdeed. Our primary aim was to evaluate whether recalling a similar offense would facilitate forgiving attitudes. We began with scenario methods (Studies 4 and 5) before turning to real-life offenses (Study 6).\nAs described in the introduction, we also considered two potential moderator variables in these experiments. In Studies 5 and 6, we considered whether it would be important to recall a truly similar offense of one\u2019s own. In all four experiments (4\u20137), we examined the role of gender. Our prediction was that in terms of facilitating forgiveness (or reducing vengefulness), the similar offense technique would be more effective for men than for women.\nStudy 4: Responses to a Standardized, Hypothetical Offense\nThe aim of Study 4 was to see whether asking people to recall a similar offense of their own would make them less harsh in their\njudgments of another\u2019s offense. We chose to start with a standardized, hypothetical offense in which participants were not personally victimized, and we did so for two reasons. First, a scenario design provided considerable experimental control through use of a standardized situation. Second, we wanted to see whether reflecting on personal offenses could affect the \u201ccold\u201d cognitive judgments that people make as outside observers\u2014that is, when they read or hear about other people\u2019s offenses but do not suffer harm themselves. In line with several recent studies (Cohen, Malka, Rozin, & Cherfas, 2006; Farrow & Woodruff, 2005; Wohl & Branscombe, 2005), we asked participants to rate the extent to which they saw the offense as forgivable.4\nMethod"

One night they are talking, getting to know each other better, and Lee confides in Chris about some very painful and embarrassing childhood memories. Suddenly feeling ashamed and afraid of the word getting out, Lee swears Chris to secrecy. Chris agrees, reassuring Lee that the secret is safe. A few weeks later, Chris is talking with some other friends. The conversation eventually turns to gossip about fellow students. One friend makes a joking reference to something that Lee did, and the gossip starts to center on Lee. A few of the friends turn to Chris and say, \u201cWell, you\u2019re Lee\u2019s roommate. What dirt have you picked up?\u201d Chris then blurts out Lee\u2019s secret, and everyone laughs. Word eventually gets back to Lee that Chris revealed this sensitive information.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions.

Men rated the offense as more forgivable in the experimental condition than in the control condition, suggesting that the prompt to consider their own misdeeds made them less harsh toward the hypothetical offender. Women gave equivalent forgivability ratings in both conditions.\nThese results supported the hypothesis that reflecting on one\u2019s own offenses can indeed soften judgments of hypothetical offenses, but only for men. Men, but not women, gave higher forgivability ratings if they were primed to consider a similar offense of their own.\nStudy 5: Multiple Scenarios\nStudy 5 built on the scenario methods of Study 4, with a primary prediction being that the Study 4 gender interaction would replicate across a wider set of situations. Study 5 also included new items that enabled closer inspection of underlying processes. Participants in the similar offense condition were asked to directly compare their offense with the target offense in terms of severity and type. They also reflected on whether writing about their own offense seemed to affect the forgivability, understandability, and size of the target offense. By tracing participant reports of what they had experienced, we could evaluate whether the underlying psychological processes fit with the mediational findings from Study 2. Participants also answered questions about the emotions that they experienced while reflecting on their own offenses. On the basis of prior research suggesting that negative emotion inhibits generosity (e.g., Exline & Fisher, 2005), we predicted that negative feelings about one\u2019s own offense (e.g., shame, guilt, embarrassment) would be linked with lower forgivability judgments."

Setting aside the gender interaction for the moment, we focused on another question: Under what conditions would recalling a similar offense of one\u2019s own make a target offense seem more forgivable? We made the following predictions, which are summarized in the Figure 1 path diagram.8\nStudy 2 revealed that the link between personal capability and forgiveness was partly mediated by empathic understanding and offense severity. In Study 5, we asked participants directly about whether writing about their own offenses led to changes in understanding and offense size (a proxy for severity). If recalling one\u2019s own offense is indeed linked with increased understanding and a sense that the target offense seems smaller, we reasoned that both shifts in perception would predict reports that the target offense seemed more forgivable.\nIn order to set these empathic and offense-shrinking processes in motion, a person might need to recall an offense that is truly similar to the target. We predicted that two domains of similarity would be important: First, to the extent that people recall an offense that is similar in type (e.g., gossip; betrayal), they should report that reflecting on their offense made the target offense seem more understandable. Second, to the extent that people recall an offense that is similar in severity, they should report that focusing on their own offense made the target offense seem to shrink. As reported earlier (see the Method section), most people recalled offenses that were less severe than the target. Recalling a lesser\n7 Specifically, the scenario in which the babysitter\u2019s error allowed the child to drink cleaning fluid was seen as more harmful (M 7.9, SD 2.4) than the gossip scenario (M 6.1, SD 2.4) or the post office scenario (M 6.6, SD 2.3), omnibus F(2, 300) 10.24, p .01, 2 .09 (for contrasts, p .01, with Bonferroni correction). The gossip offense was seen as more intentional (M 5.0, SD 2.9) than the post office offense (M 2.9, SD 2.4), which in turn was seen as more intentional than the babysitter offense (M 0.7, SD 1.3), omnibus F(2, 201) 60.09, p .01, 2 .37 (both comparisons significant at p .01 with Bonferroni correction).\n8 In Studies 5 and 6, the chain of proposed connections was more complex than in Study 2. This is why we used path analysis rather than the multiple mediation procedures outlined in Study 2.\noffense of one\u2019s own could lead to contrast effects, making the target offense seem to grow rather than shrink. We expected certain people to be more likely to recall offenses that were truly similar in severity and type: people who reported high levels of personal capability for committing a similar offense.\nThe proposed pattern of associations met with strong support, as shown in the path diagram in Figure 1. We used AMOS (Version 4; Arbuckle, 1999). Although we tested several alternate models, we show only the best-fitting model for simplicity: 2(8, N 160) 7.83, p .45; 2/df 0.98, normed fit index (NFI) .99, comparative fit index (CFI) 1.0, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) .00. As predicted, personal capability predicted greater odds of recalling offenses that were similar to the target in terms of both severity and type. Similarity in type predicted marginally ( p .07) greater understanding (see note below), whereas similar severity predicted a perception that the target offense had shrunk. Both increased understanding and decreased offense size predicted a sense that the target offense seemed more forgivable. These associations were generally consistent with the hypotheses.\nTo optimize model fit, we included one path in the model that was not originally proposed: a direct link between personal capability and increased understanding. Without this path, several indices suggested a mediocre fit: 2(9, N 160) 17.76, p .04; 2/df 1.97, NFI .98, CFI .99, RMSEA .08. However, it is worth noting that when this nonhypothesized path was deleted, the link between similar type and increased understanding was highly significant ( .25, p .01) rather than marginal ( .15, p .07)."

            "text": "Study 5 showed that when people recalled their own offenses, it was important that they chose offenses that were similar in severity and type to the target offense. Recalling an offense that was similar in type was linked with reports of increased understanding, whereas recalling an offense that was similar in severity was linked with reports that the target offense seemed to shrink. People high in personal capability were more likely to recall offenses that were truly similar to the target in terms of severity and type. Complementing the results of Study 3, these findings suggest that there may be an upper limit on the use of the similar-offense technique for many people. If people do not recall similar offenses of their own (and many people in this study did not), the resulting contrast effects could make the target offense seem even larger.\nStudy 5 replicated the gender differences of Study 4. For men, drawing attention to their own offenses led to higher forgivability ratings of a target offense. Reflecting on an offense of one\u2019s own did not affect forgivability ratings for women. Women were more likely than men to report that focusing on their own offense made the target offense seem to grow in size. Also, when asked how it felt to focus on their own offenses, women reported marginally more self-focused negative emotion than men. Negative emotion, in turn, predicted harsher judgments.\nStudy 6: A Return to Real-Life Offenses\nStudy 6 was designed to see whether the main findings of Study 5 (gender interaction; path model in Figure 1) would replicate in cases involving actual offenses. In several important respects, Study 6 presented a much tougher test of our hypotheses than the scenario studies: First, use of real-life situations would provide a broad range of offense types, features, and consequences, all of which would increase extraneous variance. Second, because the offenses occurred in the past, people might have already decided whether they wanted to forgive. Third, whereas the scenario studies had focused on \u201ccold,\u201d cognitively based judgments about forgivability, the next set of studies emphasized \u201chot,\u201d emotionally charged motivations related to forgiveness and vengefulness. Furthermore, the offenses examined in Studies 6 and 7 were ones in which people were personally engaged. All of these factors would make it harder for a brief manipulation to influence forgiveness ratings, thus providing a challenging testing ground for our hypotheses.\nA secondary aim was to build on Study 2, in which we examined whether various dispositional factors might explain the association between forgiveness and personal capability. Although Study 2 addressed many dispositional variables, two potentially important ones were omitted: empathy and humility. Because humility focuses on acceptance of personal limitations (Exline, Campbell, et al., 2004), it could be linked with personal capability. The humble\nperson\u2019s ability to transcend self-interest might also predict greater forgiveness. Envisioning oneself performing wrongful actions might also involve empathic processing, and there is evidence that dispositional empathy predicts greater forgiveness (e.g., Brown, 2003; Konstam et al., 2001; Macaskill et al., 2002; Toussaint & Webb, 2005). In Study 6, then, we examined whether dispositional humility or empathy might subsume the capability\u2013forgiveness link.\nMethod"

However, men who recalled a similar offense showed substantially less vengefulness and grudge holding, dropping to levels similar to those of women. Women\u2019s TRIM and Vengefulness scores were not affected by the manipulation.\nAs shown in Figure 2, all three mediators of the capability\u2013 forgiveness link that were identified in Study 2 emerged once again as important mechanisms.

Recalling truly similar offenses, in turn, was linked with the increased understanding and offense shrinking that predicted higher forgivability ratings. Personal capability was also linked with a greater sense of similarity to the offender. This sense of similarity, combined with increased understanding, predicted lower TRIM scores.\nFinally, Study 6 ruled out two potential dispositional confounds that Study 2 did not address: empathy and humility.

Rather than going through the conscious step of writing about one\u2019s own offense or envisioning the other person\u2019s perspective, could it be useful to simply answer questions involving personal capability and empathic understanding?

Personal capability distinguished between forgiven and unforgiven offenses (Study 1), predicted unforgiveness of actual transgressions (Study 2), and predicted greater forgivability ratings of hypothetical offenses (pilot study before Study 4). The association between personal capability and forgiveness was robust across procedures and samples. First, the association extended beyond college students (Study 1). Second, the link remained strong when we controlled for other robust predictors of forgiveness: relationship closeness and apology (Study 2). Third, the association was found not only on self-report rating scales but also on a more behavioral measure: people\u2019s written statements of what they would like to say to the other person (Study 2). Last, the association could not be reduced to individual-difference factors such as the Big Five, narcissism, entitlement, religiosity, or social desirability. Humility and empathy were also ruled out as dispositional confounds (Study 6).\nAt least three pathways mediate the link between personal capability and forgiveness (Studies 2, 5, and 6). First, people can more easily see themselves committing minor offenses compared with major ones, and minor offenses are easier to forgive. In fact, another\u2019s offense may seem to shrink in size when evaluators recall truly similar offenses of their own (Studies 5 and 6). The logic seems to be, \u201cIf I could do it, then it can\u2019t be that serious.\u201d\n10 Because of multiple types of counterbalancing and various hypotheses in the original study, there were unequal cell sizes in the data set. The condition with capability\u2013empathy measures first had 110 participants, and the condition with the TRIM first had 45 participants.\nThe other two mediators focus on empathic connection: If people see themselves as capable of a similar wrongdoing, this belief is linked with greater empathic understanding and a sense of being similar to the offender. Both of these perceptions, in turn, predict greater forgiveness.\nThe association between personal capability and forgiveness also applies at an intergroup level, as shown in Study 3\u2019s assessment of responses to the September 11 attacks. When faced with a heinous offense against one\u2019s ingroup, seeing oneself as capable of a similar offense did not predict forgiveness. There may have been a floor effect here, because most people simply could not envision themselves doing something so horrible. However, seeing members of one\u2019s ingroup (in this case, the U.S. government) as capable of a similar wrongdoing predicted more forgiving attitudes. Notably, this sense of ingroup capability predicted not only forgiving attitudes but also less support for specific aggressive actions, including strikes against civilian targets, the death penalty for perpetrators, and perpetrators being shot on sight. It is important to note that these associations remained when we controlled for support for strikes against military targets, which could be seen as a proxy for general military attitudes, attitudes toward the current administration, or support of the decision to go to war."

The experimental manipulations used in our studies did not influence forgiveness-related responses among women, who tended to be less vengeful than men in the control conditions (Studies 6 and 7).\nIn terms of facilitating forgiveness, why might personal capability prompts be especially effective for men? One possibility might be a basic gender difference in motivational orientation. Baron-Cohen (2002) and others have argued that male brains are oriented toward systems\u2014that is, they strive to analyze rules that govern behavior (or other systems, such as mechanical ones), with an ultimate goal of prediction or control. Female brains, in contrast, are proposed to assign higher priority to empathic concern for individuals. If so, then the primary male concern in response to another\u2019s offense would involve justice, whereas females would be more concerned with relationship repair.\nIn support of this reasoning, a recent study by Singer et al. (2006) using brain imaging techniques suggested that women and men responded differently to the punishment of a transgressor. Participants witnessed the punishment of a person who had played selfishly in a group resource game. Men showed activity in the reward centers of their brains, suggesting that they found pleasure or satisfaction in the punishment of the transgressor, whereas female brains showed activation in emotional and empathic sections, indicating concern for the individual\u2019s suffering. To the extent that a personal capability prime would shift men out of a predominant \u201csystems mode,\u201d instead facilitating relational or empathic thinking, it could lead to sharp decreases in punitive behavior. Among women, personal capability primes might have little or no effect because they do not represent much of a shift from the predominant relational mode.\nA complementary explanation centers on the distinction between agency and communion, with agency usually seen as masculine and communion as feminine (Bakan, 1966; Spence & Helmreich, 1978). The assumption of gender differences along those lines may be especially relevant when the choice is between seeking revenge and forgiving. Forgiveness would support a communal concern with maintaining social bonds, whereas agency would be linked to revenge seeking, which is a highly active form of unforgiveness. Our findings complement prior work showing that males favor revenge more strongly than females do (e.g., Stuckless & Goranson, 1992), which may reflect their concerns with justice and agency, respectively. Among males, then, reflecting on one\u2019s own offenses (or capability) might weaken vengeful motives by fostering a more reflective, communal stance. Women\u2019s low levels of vengefulness may have led to a floor effect.\nAnother possible explanation received indirect support in Study 5: Focusing on one\u2019s own offenses opens the door for self-focused negative thoughts and emotions, which tend to inhibit prosocial responses (Exline & Fisher, 2005). Women did report marginally more negative emotion than men regarding their offenses. Self-focused rumination has been linked with shame and personal distress (Joireman, 2004), and women tend to ruminate on negative thoughts more than men (Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, & Grayson, 1999). Women were also more likely than men to report that focusing on their own offense made the target offense seem to grow in size (Studies 5 and\n6). If the goal is to facilitate forgiving attitudes, then, it may be counterproductive to break women\u2019s predominant relational stance by encouraging them to focus on their flaws.\nIt is noteworthy that gender differences emerged only in the experimental studies\u2014those in which some people were primed to focus on personal capability. The correlational link between personal capability and forgiveness was not moderated by gender (Study 2). Both men and women were more forgiving to the extent that they saw themselves as capable of similar offenses. These findings contrast with prior work on empathy, which suggested that the magnitude of empathy\u2013forgiveness correlations might differ for men and women (Fincham et al., 2002; Toussaint & Webb, 2005). However, those studies focused on emotional empathy (Fincham et al., 2002) and dispositional empathy (Toussaint & Webb, 2005), variables with only indirect relevance to the situation-specific, cognitive factor of personal capability."

            "text": "Given the role of personal capability in predicting forgiveness, it seems important to pinpoint variables that predict personal capability. As shown in Study 2, personal capability correlated positively with the extent of apologies received. In terms of dispositional predictors, personal capability was linked with introversion as well as marginally lower narcissism and social desirability. Perhaps surprisingly, personal capability did not correlate with any of the other Big Five factors, religiosity, or dispositional forgiveness. Study 6 demonstrated that humility predicted personal capability but that dispositional empathy did not.\nForgiveness Versus Minimization of Offenses: Ethical Implications\nOur studies have considered personal capability and empathy as potential facilitators of forgiveness. Before we conclude, it seems important to clarify that we are not suggesting any type of value judgment about whether forgiveness is morally appropriate. To use an extreme example, one murderer might reflect on the actions of another murderer and think, \u201cOh, murder isn\u2019t so serious. After all, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d Such minimization of the offense could indeed facilitate a forgiving attitude. But it could also serve as justification for one\u2019s own future crimes, and it could work against justice by leading people to condone serious offenses. In the case of everyday offenses, a softening of one\u2019s attitude toward an offender may bring a sense of peace and help to heal damaged relationships. But in an abusive or exploitative situation, a premature softening of attitudes might contribute to a decision to stay in a dangerous situation.\nWhen dealing with these sorts of examples, forgiveness theorists are quick to point out that true forgiveness is not the same thing as condoning, minimizing, or excusing offenses (e.g., Enright & Fitzgibbons, 2000). We definitely agree. But, as some have pointed out (Belicki, Rourke, & McCarthy, 2007), the empathic thinking that often accompanies forgiveness can also lead people in the direction of minimizing offenses. Our own data also support the potential for minimizing: Reflecting on a similar offense of one\u2019s own often did promote softer judgments of the other party\u2019s offense. Clearly, there are situations in which demands for justice and safety might not be served if people are too quick to shrink the offenses of others. Our aim here was to consider whether reflecting on one\u2019s own dark side can\nfacilitate more forgiving attitudes\u2014regardless of whether such attitudes are seen as an asset or a liability."

            "heading": "Limitations and Future Directions",
            "text": "Although we have tried to be thorough, the work presented here has some clear limitations. Most of our data were based on student samples (except Study 1) and self-report instruments. Study 2 revealed that the findings did extend to a quasi-behavioral measure\u2014a statement of what participants would like to say to the other person. Future studies will ideally include more behavioral measures.\nOur research revealed some evidence that the link between capability and forgiveness may apply at an intergroup level. Clearly, however, our work has only scratched the surface in terms of intergroup processes. In future work, it will be important to consider ways of facilitating empathy in cases of severe intergroup offenses\u2014cases in which people may find it difficult to empathize. Looking at one\u2019s own ingroup may be one useful technique, as Study 3 suggested. But there are likely to be many cases in which people cannot envision their ingroup members committing certain offenses. One good alternative may be to create a highly inclusive ingroup, such as humanity (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005). By focusing on their connections with others, people may experience not only more prosocial attitudes but also a greater sense of humility.\nWhen we started this research, our conceptualization of humility was based on the idea that people need to come to terms with their dark sides\u2014their personal limitations, offenses, and failings. Yet, our data suggest that asking people to focus on their transgressions may be risky if it fosters negative emotion or defensiveness. These risks may be especially salient for women, given their tendencies toward negative rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1999). In fact, recent theorizing suggests that the open, nondefensive stance associated with humility may require a secure, stable basis of self-worth along with a positive emotional tone (Exline, Campbell, et al., 2004). If people lack these foundations, directing them to focus on their limitations might merely stimulate shame, which tends to prompt defensive reactions (e.g., Tangney & Dearing, 2002). Future forgiveness work should examine techniques to help people face their limitations in constructive ways. In addition to humility, topics such as self-affirmation (Steele, 1999) and selfcompassion (Neff, 2003) seem highly relevant to this effort."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "This research suggests that when people evaluate the offenses of others, their attitudes are more forgiving when they see themselves as capable of committing similar offenses. A sense of personal capability can make another\u2019s offense seem less severe, and it is also linked with empathic understanding and a sense of similarity to the offender. As shown in Studies 4\u20136, asking people to recall similar offenses of their own may facilitate forgiveness\u2014but primarily for men. Across all four experimental studies, men became more forgiving when prompted to reflect on their personal capability for similar offenses. Women did not show this effect. In fact, there was some evidence that for women, focusing on their own offenses prompted negative emotion and actually made the other person\u2019s offense seem to grow in size. To deepen our understanding of humility and forgiveness, future studies might\nincorporate positive features such as security, connectedness, and positive emotion. People may need to have these resources available before they can face their limitations and offenses in constructive ways.\nReferences\nArbuckle, J. L. (1999). AMOS 4.0 [Computer software].
