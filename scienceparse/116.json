    "abstractText": "A crowd often possesses better information than do the individuals it comprises. For example, if people are asked to guess the weight of a prize-winning ox (Galton, 1907), the error of the average response is substantially smaller than the average error of individual estimates. This fact, which Galton interpreted as support for democratic governance, is responsible for the success of polling the audience in the television program \u2018\u2018Who Wants to be a Millionaire\u2019\u2019 (Surowiecki, 2004) and for the superiority of combined over individual financial forecasts (Clemen, 1989). Researchers agree that this wisdom-of-crowds effect depends on a statistical fact: The crowd\u2019s average will be more accurate as long as some of the error of one individual is statistically independent of the error of other individuals\u2014as seems almost guaranteed to be the case. Whether a similar improvement can be obtained by averaging two estimates from a single individual is not, a priori, obvious. If one estimate represents the best information available to the person, as common intuition suggests, then a second guess will simply add noise, and averaging the two will only decrease accuracy. Researchers have previously assumed this view and focused on improving the best estimate (Hirt & Markman, 1995; Mussweiler, Strack, & Pfeiffer, 2000; Stewart, 2001). Alternatively, initial estimates may represent samples drawn from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministic best guesses. According to this account, the average of two estimates from one person will be more accurate than a single estimate, so long as the noise contained in the two estimates is at least somewhat independent. Ariely et al. (2000) predicted that such a benefit would accrue from averaging probability judgments within one individual, but did not find evidence of such an effect. However, probability judgments are known to be biased toward extreme values (0 or 1), and averaging should not reduce the bias of estimates; if guesses are sampled from an unbiased distribution, however, averaging should reduce error (variance; Laplace, 1812/1878; Wallsten, Budescu, Erev, & Diederich, 1997). Probabilistic representations have been postulated in recent models of memory (Steyvers, Griffiths, & Dennis, 2006), perception (Kersten & Yuille, 2003), and neural coding (Ma, Beck, Latham, & Pouget, 2006). It is consistent with such models that responses of many people are distributed probabilistically, as shown by the wisdom-of-crowds effect. However, despite the theoretical appeal of these models, there has been scant evidence that, within a given person, knowledge is represented as a probability distribution. Finding any benefit of averaging two responses from one person would yield support for this hypothesis.",

This result indicates that subjects did not produce a second guess by simply perturbing the first; rather, the error of the two guesses was somewhat independent. This benefit of averaging cannot be attributed to subjects\u2019 finding more information between guesses, because second guesses were less accurate than first guesses (see Fig. 1a) in both the immediate condition, t(254)5 3.6, p < .01, and the delayed condition, t(172) 5 2.8, p < .01. Moreover, the benefit of averaging was greater when the second guess was delayed by 3 weeks than when it was immediate; that is, the difference in error between the first guess and the average was greater in the delayed condition than in the immediate condition, t(426)5 2.12, p< .05. The 95% confidence intervals for percentage of error reduced relative to the first guess were [2.5%, 10.4%] in the immediate condition and [11.6%, 20.4%] in the delayed condition. Thus, one benefits from polling the \u2018\u2018crowd\u2019\u2019 within, and the inner crowd grows more effective (independent) when more time elapses between guesses.\nWe compared the efficacy of within-person averaging and across-person averaging via hyperbolic interpolation (see Fig. 1b). The error of the average guess across all people corresponds to the bias of the distribution of beliefs in the population. According to the central limit theorem, if different subjects\u2019 deviations from the group bias are independent, the mean squared error of the average of N guesses from N people should\nbe a hyperbola that converges to the group bias as N goes to infinity. This hyperbola fits the across-person averages perfectly (R2 5 1). However, N guesses from one person are not as beneficial as N guesses from N people. The reduction in mean squared error from averaging N guesses from one person can be described as 1/[1 1 l(N 1)], where l is the proportion of an additional guess from another person that an additional guess from the same person is worth; when l is 1, averaging in a second guess from the same person confers the same benefit as averaging in a second guess from a different person; when l is 0, averaging in a second guess from the same person confers no benefit at all. The value of l can be estimated by interpolating the benefit of within-person averaging onto the hyperbola representing the benefit of across-person averaging. Thus, we computed howmany different-person guesses one would need to average together to attain the same error as in the average of two guesses from one person. This value is 1.11 (l 5 0.11) for two immediate guesses and 1.32 (l5 0.32) for two delayed guesses. Simply put, you can gain about 1/10th as much from asking yourself the same question twice as you can from getting a second opinion from someone else, but if you wait 3 weeks, the benefit of reasking yourself the same question rises to 1/3 the value of a second opinion. One potential explanation of the cost of immediacy is that subjects are biased by their first response to produce less independent samples (a delay mitigates this anchoring effect).\n646 Volume 19\u2014Number 7\nat GEORGIAN COURT UNIV on March 6, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from"

This observed benefit of averaging multiple responses from the same person suggests that responses made by a subject are sampled from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministically selected on the basis of all the knowledge a subject has.\nTemporal separation of guesses increases the benefit of within-person averaging by increasing the independence of guesses, thus making a second guess from the same person more like a guess from a completely different individual. Beyond having theoretical implications about the probabilistic nature of knowledge, these results suggest that the benefit of averaging two guesses from one individual can serve as a quantitative measure of the benefit of \u2018\u2018sleeping on it.\u2019\u2019\nAcknowledgments\u2014This work was supported by the Institute\nof Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education (Grants\nR305H020061 and R305H040108 to H.
