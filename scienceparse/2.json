    "abstractText": "Repetition blindness (RB) for nonwords has been found in some studies, but not in others. The authors propose that the discrepancy in results is fueled by participant strategy; specifically, when rapid serial visual presentation lists are short and participants are explicitly informed that some trials will contain repetitions, participants are able to use partial orthographic information to correctly guess repetitions on repetition trials while avoiding spurious repetition reports on control trials. The authors first replicated V. Coltheart and R. Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords (Experiment 1). When all participants were encouraged to utilize partial information in a same/different matching task along with an identification task, a repetition advantage was observed for both words and nonwords (Experiment 2). When guessing of repetitions was made detectable by including non-identical but orthographically similar items in the experiments, the repetition advantage disappeared; instead, RB was found for both words and nonwords (Experiments 3 and 4). Finally, when experiments did not contain any identical items, participants almost never reported repetitions, and reliable RB was found for orthographically similar words and nonwords (Experiments 5 and 6).",

Still Iowa State University\nRepetition blindness (RB) for nonwords has been found in some studies, but not in others. The authors propose that the discrepancy in results is fueled by participant strategy; specifically, when rapid serial visual presentation lists are short and participants are explicitly informed that some trials will contain repetitions, participants are able to use partial orthographic information to correctly guess repetitions on repetition trials while avoiding spurious repetition reports on control trials. The authors first replicated V. Coltheart and R. Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords (Experiment 1). When all participants were encouraged to utilize partial information in a same/different matching task along with an identification task, a repetition advantage was observed for both words and nonwords (Experiment 2). When guessing of repetitions was made detectable by including non-identical but orthographically similar items in the experiments, the repetition advantage disappeared; instead, RB was found for both words and nonwords (Experiments 3 and 4). Finally, when experiments did not contain any identical items, participants almost never reported repetitions, and reliable RB was found for orthographically similar words and nonwords (Experiments 5 and 6).\nKeywords: repetition blindness, nonwords, lexical, sublexical, word recognition\nShort-term repetition effects, such as those found by using masked priming paradigms, currently constitute a major source of information concerning the types of representations thought to mediate early stages of word recognition. Accordingly, questions about the role of lexical versus sublexical representations in repetition effects are often investigated by comparing priming effects for words and nonwords, because words, by definition, are listed in the lexicon, and nonwords are not. Although the question of whether masked repetition priming can be found for nonwords as well as words appears to be straightforward, the results have been mixed, largely because much of the evidence to date has been obtained by using the lexical decision task\u2014a task influenced by lexicality and familiarity (Balota & Chumbley, 1984; Bodner & Masson, 1997; Bowers, 1994; Feustel, Shiffrin, & Salasoo, 1983; Forster, 1998). Similarly, demonstrations of reliable masked repetition priming for nonwords in the naming task (Masson & Isaak, 1999) may simply reflect facilitation of articulatory processes (Forster, 1998).\nRepetition blindness paradigms (RB; Kanwisher, 1987) offer another opportunity to investigate the role of lexical and sublexical representations in short-term repetition effects. When a series of words is displayed in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP; Forster, 1970) at a rate of approximately 8\u201310 items per second, and viewers are asked to identify all the words shown, a repeated word will often go unreported if the two instances of the word\nappear in close temporal proximity (usually less than 500 ms). Although RB is strong for identical words, non-identical words with similar orthography such as cap and cape (Kanwisher & Potter, 1990), home and hose (Bavelier, Prasada, & Segui, 1994), brace and crack (Harris & Morris, 2000), and even martini and tactile (Harris, 2001) also show robust RB. These findings as well as those of Morris and Harris (1999) and Harris and Morris (2001b) have suggested that some RB effects might have a sublexical locus.\nHowever, questions have been raised as to whether RB between orthographically similar items (orthographic RB) reflects the same phenomenon as RB between identical items (identity RB). Chialant and Caramazza (1997) argued that RB for identical words is strictly a lexical-level phenomenon, whereas RB for non-identical words stems from inhibitory processing that occurs during recognition of a single word. On this view, RB between home and hope occurs because during the process of recognizing home, the representations of orthographically similar words such as hope are inhibited. When hope is subsequently displayed, its representation is affected by residual inhibition and therefore the word may not be recognized. Chialant and Caramazza further suggested that identity and orthographic RB differ in time course; that is, whereas identity RB decreased with increasing lag (number of items intervening between the critical words), orthographic RB showed the reverse pattern. Unfortunately, their experiments manipulated lag between items, introducing potential confounds. By using a within-items design and a greater number of stimuli, Harris and Morris (2001a) obtained a monotonic decrease in RB with increasing lag for both identity and orthographic RB. Thus, there is as yet no unequivocal evidence that the mechanisms underlying identity and orthographic RB differ.\nFurthermore, an experiment from Morris and Harris (2004) provided evidence against the lexical inhibition account of orthographic RB. In that experiment, orthographically similar words\nAlison L. Morris and Mary L.

When a blue question mark appeared, participants were to report all the words in the sentence (serial report condition); however, when \u201cword?\u201d appeared in a red font, participants were to perform a lexical decision on a word appearing after the sentence (lexical decision condition). Large RB effects were found in the serial report task, but in the lexical decision task, equal amounts of priming were obtained in the repeated (beef, beer) and nonrepeated (rice, beer) conditions when compared with control conditions in which beer was not displayed. In other words, the representation for beer was activated to the same extent in the repeated and nonrepeated conditions. This result is not what one would expect if RB for beer stemmed from lexical inhibition occurring during the process of recognizing beef.\nAn additional test of the role of sublexical representations in short-term repetition involves investigating the presence of RB for nonwords. If Chialant and Caramazza (1997) are correct, and RB occurs only for items that are lexically identical, then RB should be readily demonstrated for words, but not for nonwords (Coltheart & Langdon, 2003). On the other hand, if RB is not restricted to lexical representations, it should be possible to demonstrate RB for nonwords. Harris and Morris (2004) obtained significant RB for nonwords in four experiments with only two items per trial (two words, a word\u2013nonword pair, or two nonwords) to minimize encoding and memory demands for the nonwords. Masson, Caldwell, and Whittlesea (2000), using longer RSVP streams, found RB for nonword\u2013word pairs such as choif\u2013chief when the nonword was displayed for a sufficient duration (600 ms). However, two published reports (Campbell, Fugelsang, & Hernberg, 2002; Coltheart & Langdon, 2003) failed to find RB for nonwords. The Coltheart and Langdon findings are particularly noteworthy in that across several experiments they consistently found RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; that is, the joint report of the critical items (known as the \u201cboth\u201d score, meaning that both critical items were reported) was actually higher for repeated trials than for control trials.\nBecause nonwords are difficult to read in RSVP displays, Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of a repetition advantage for nonwords might seem intuitive; it might take two opportunities to read a nonword in order to encode it accurately. If this were the case, one would find that the second of the repeated nonwords (C2) would be correctly reported more often than would a nonrepeated nonword in the same position in the RSVP stream (a control C2). For example, when comparing performance on narp jeal narp with snoy jeal narp, one might expect the second narp to be reported more accurately in the repeated condition than in the nonrepeated condition. However, this is not what Coltheart and Langdon found. They found an increase in the joint report of C1 and C2. This distinction (between increased report of C2 and increased report of both C1 and C2) is important.\nColtheart and Langdon (2003) couched their findings within the token individuation hypothesis of RB originally proposed by Kanwisher (1987). According to this hypothesis, each stimulus item activates its type representation (an abstract representation), but an item is consciously identified only if spatiotemporal information (a token) is bound to its type. In this framework, RB occurs when the first instance of the item is bound to a token, but its type becomes temporarily unavailable for additional tokenization. This means\nthat participants will often fail to report the second occurrence of the repeated item. However, in cases where C1 is not tokenized (therefore not reported), C2 is free to be tokenized, and there is no RB; in fact, C2 may be reported more often than a nonrepeated item. Note that this explanation still assumes that only one of the identical items is reported; it does not explain how a repetition advantage in the both score might be obtained. Coltheart and Langdon explained the finding of a repetition advantage for nonwords as follows:\nWhen the items are nonwords, because these have no preexisting types, token individuation is likely to be slower, and it might even require copies of multiple, smaller orthographic segments. Thus, at high rates of presentation, these items\u2019 probability of being represented in tokens is much lower. However, if the first critical item is successfully tokenized, the repeated item, as a consequence of priming, will be recognized more quickly, and its orthographic segments will be able to participate in token formation more rapidly than will the segments of an unrelated nonword for which the recognition and orthographic segmentation processes must begin anew. (Coltheart & Langdon, 2003, p. 183)\nThis explanation raises a number of questions. If token individuation for nonwords requires copies of smaller orthographic segments, then why aren\u2019t these sublexical tokens subject to the same limitations as lexical tokens; that is, why isn\u2019t there a time window during which identical types cannot be retokenized? Similarly, why does successful tokenization of words result in RB while for nonwords it results in priming? According to Kanwisher\u2019s theory, priming for C2 is observed when C1 consistently fails to be tokenized (Kanwisher, 1987).\nA more recently proposed theoretical account of short-term repetition effects, known as the competition hypothesis (Morris, Still, & Caldwell-Harris, 2007), may prove more helpful in understanding the differences between performance on words and nonwords in RB experiments. The competition hypothesis is in part derived from two well-known findings from neurophysiological studies. The first is that repetition of a stimulus often results in a decrease in the total amount of activation associated with that stimulus. This has been demonstrated in fMRI studies using human participants (e.g., Buckner et al., 1998; Dehaene et al., 2001) and in electrophysiological recordings from macaque monkeys (e.g., Baylis & Rolls, 1987; Miller & Desimone, 1994; Miller, Li, & Desimone, 1993). Some electrophysiological studies further have suggested that although the overall neural activity decreases with repetition, the activity of the cells most critical for representing the stimulus actually increases (Ringo, 1996). A stimulus representation containing increased activity of critical cells combined with decreased activity of noncritical cells is known as a \u201csharpened\u201d representation (Desimone, 1996; Wiggs & Martin, 1998).\nThe second neurophysiological finding on which the competition hypothesis is based concerns the neural correlates of perceptual awareness. Several investigators have suggested that transient activation of a stimulus representation beyond a particular threshold is not sufficient for conscious awareness. At a minimum, sustained activation of a representation for several hundred milliseconds is required for the item\u2019s occurrence to be stabilized in working memory; synchronized activity involving a larger network may also be required (for further discussion of these ideas, see Dehaene & Naccache, 2001; Dehaene et al., 2001; Subrama-\nniam, Biederman, & Madigan, 2000; Summerfield, Jack, & Burgess, 2002; Tononi & Edelman, 1998; Ward, 2003).\nIf stimulus representations require sustained activation to reach consciousness, it is therefore not surprising that some items fail to be reported from even short RSVP displays, or that viewers often have a sense of fleeting awareness accompanied by rapid forgetting (Wolfe, 1999). In addition, the rapid display of successive items creates competition between the item representations for access to conscious awareness (Enns & Di Lollo, 2000). If the sustained activation of an item\u2019s representation is interfered with by competing representations, the item may go unnoticed, or the viewer may be aware that a target item occurred but may be unable to identify the item (Park & Kanwisher, 1994).\nSpecific predictions of the competition hypothesis are best illustrated by a computational implementation, which is more completely described in Morris et al. (2007). In the competition model, type representations for single letters are overlapping distributed representations consisting of both signal and noise nodes. Five premises guide the predictions: (a) Type representations are activated sequentially and their activity decays over time; (b) forward masking consists of residual activation from the previously encoded item which is incorporated into the type activation of the current item; (c) backward masking (in conjunction with forward masking) induces competition for access\nto awareness between adjacent items; (d) when a letter is repeated, its type representation is sharpened\u2014that is, the representation has increased signal relative to noise and decreased total activation; (e) each item representation competes with adjacent items for access to awareness, and the type representation with the larger summed activity (type representation attention) wins the competition. Because the sharpened representations of repeated items carry less total activation, they lose the competition for access to awareness more often than do nonrepeated items. Thus, RB is an emergent property of competitive interactions between items displayed in RSVP.\nFigure 1 illustrates the difference between the type representations for repeated and nonrepeated items according to the competition model. Under rapid or brief display conditions, some of the activation from C1 fails to decay prior to display of C2, and this persisting activation is added to the type representation for C2. In the case of nonrepeated items, the result is a noisier type representation which sometimes results in misidentification. When C1 and C2 are identical, however, forward masking has the effect of sharpening the representation. A sharpened representation is produced when the activation of the signal node reaches an upper limit, while the activation of the noise nodes decreases. Sharpened representations are most often associated with repetition priming; however, they can also\nproduce RB when multiple items are competing for access to awareness.1\nAlthough the competition model was designed to simulate RB for single letters, similar principles could be applied to RB for words by assuming that the total activation associated with a word is in part determined by the activations associated with the representations of its constituent letters. Because the degree of orthographic overlap is greater for identical words than for similar words, the competition hypothesis predicts that RB for orthographically similar words should generally be smaller than RB for identical words; this is in fact the typical finding (Harris & Morris, 2000).2 The competition hypothesis also provides a principled explanation for the probabilistic nature of RB; because of noise in the system, repeated items will sometimes exceed adjacent items in total activation and consequently will gain access to awareness.\nWhat are the implications of the competition hypothesis concerning RB for nonwords? It is generally accepted that nonwords are encoded more poorly than are words in RSVP displays; thus, nonword representations have a smaller signal-to-noise ratio than do more familiar stimuli (e.g., words). This means that the signal node of a nonword C1 generally has a lower activation level than that of a word C1. Consequently, when a nonword is repeated, its signal node will increase in activation but may not reach ceiling (as it would if C1 had been better encoded; see Figure 1). The lack of a ceiling effect means that there is no decrease in total activation associated with C2\u2019s representation. In other words, under conditions of poor encoding, there will be a benefit associated with repetition (increased signal-to-noise ratio), but no cost; there will be priming of the type representation, but no RB. In sum, the competition hypothesis predicts that RB should be more difficult to demonstrate for nonwords than for words. However, it should be possible to obtain RB for nonwords if they are sufficiently well encoded. This requirement explains why Harris and Morris (2004) and Masson et al. (2000) were able to demonstrate small RB effects when short lists or long display durations were used. Most important for the present discussion, a repetition advantage in the joint report of C1 and C2 for nonwords coincident with RB for words is not generally predicted by the competition hypothesis.\nHowever, it is possible that the repetition advantage for nonwords found by Coltheart and Langdon (2003) could be explained as the result of a participant guessing strategy that is separate from the RB phenomenon itself. For example, if participants tended to guess repeated items when recall of the stimuli was poor (as it was for nonwords in their experiments) this may have inflated the both score in the repeated condition for nonwords, masking any indication of RB and producing an apparent repetition advantage. Coltheart and Langdon did consider the possibility that their obtained repetition advantage for nonwords reflected a guessing bias in favor of repeated items, but they rejected it because spurious reports of repeated items on control and two-item trials were infrequent.\nUnfortunately, attempting to control for guessing of repetitions by considering only spurious repetition reports on control or twoitem trials may be inadequate, because it assumes that participants cannot discriminate between repeated and control trials, or between two- and three-item trials. In Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) procedure, participants were warned to expect repeated items; RSVP lists had only two or three items that were to be reported; and repetitions occurred frequently and always involved\nthe first and last words or nonwords. This means that participants were likely to be able to discriminate potential repeated trials from control trials simply on the basis of partial identification of the items.\nFor example, if the nonrepeated control stimulus %%%% #### gerb foat sulp @@@@ was displayed, and participants were able to identify \u201cgerb, foat, and something beginning with s,\u201d they would not have enough information to obtain credit on the both score but would have enough information to know it was not a repeated trial; consequently, they would not be likely to guess a repetition. Similarly, participants would not be likely to report three items following a two-item list if they simply observed that symbols always intervened between the two words or nonwords in such lists. However, if the repeated stimulus %%%% #### sulp foat sulp @@@@ was displayed, and the participant identified \u201csulp, foat, and something else,\u201d there would be the possibility of a repetition, and so they may have guessed a second sulp with some probability P. We propose that fleeting awareness of a third item coupled with a lack of evidence that the item differed from the others could be sufficient to support accurate guessing of repetitions.\nGuessing of repetitions with probability P on repeated trials but not on control or two-item trials would inflate the both score for repeated trials (for both words and nonwords) while having no effect on the both score for control trials. If several participants guessed repetitions, the both scores across participants on repeated trials would tend to equalize across words and nonwords (e.g., 40% accuracy) while the both scores for control trials would remain high for words (e.g., 60% accuracy) and low for nonwords (e.g., 20% accuracy) because nonwords are less easily identified than words. The result would be that the repeated score would be higher than the control score for nonwords (repetition advantage) but would still be lower than the control score for words (RB). This is exactly the pattern obtained by Coltheart and Langdon (2003; Experiments 1, 2, and 6).\nIn this article, we examined the possibility that \u201cinformed guessing\u201d strategies could account for the finding of RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; we also investigated RB for non-identical nonwords. To anticipate, in Experiment 1 we replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; in Experiment 2, we encouraged all participants to employ an informed guessing strategy by including a same/different discrimination task, producing a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords; in Experiments 3 and 4, we discouraged the use of such a strategy by including orthographically similar trials, eliminating the repetition advantage for nonwords and producing RB for both words and nonwords; and\n1 In addition, attention can increase the total activation associated with a representation, making it more competitive against adjacent items. If attention is applied at the beginning of an RSVP stream and is allowed to decay, items near the beginning of the stream will have an advantage over later items; if the level of attention is low, or the RSVP stream consists of many items, the performance function will tend to be U-shaped.\n2 Phonological and semantic overlap may also play a role in RB; however, these effects are generally small compared with the effects of orthographic overlap.\nin Experiments 5 and 6, we conducted additional investigations of RB for orthographically similar nonwords.\nExperiment 1\nTo examine the possibility that an informed guessing strategy was responsible for producing the outcome of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords, we first needed to replicate this finding. In the majority of Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) experiments, word and nonword trials were presented in separate blocks. Unfortunately, this complicates the interpretation of results from these experiments, because presenting words and nonwords in separate blocks can lead to the use of different strategies for reporting words and nonwords. Accordingly, Experiment 1 was designed as a replication of Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s Experiment 6, in which word and nonword trials were intermixed."

            "text": "Participants. Twenty-four Iowa State University undergraduates participated for course credit. All were native speakers of English; 3 were bilingual.\nMaterials. Following Coltheart and Langdon (2003), we selected 72 monosyllabic words and 72 pronounceable nonwords; nonwords were selected from the ARC Nonword Database (Rastle, Harrington, & Coltheart, 2002). All items were 4 letters in length and were monosyllabic. Orthographic neighborhood size (orthographic N) was included as a factor in the design; half the words and nonwords had an orthographic N of 12 or greater, and the other half had an orthographic N of 5 or less. High-N and low-N words were similar in print frequency (15 per million; Francis & Kuc\u030cera, 1982). On the basis of the literature investigating N effects in naming tasks (see Andrews, 1997, for a review), we did not expect large differences in report of high-N and low-N words, but considering the difficulty of reporting nonwords displayed in RSVP, we expected that high-N nonwords would be better encoded than would low-N nonwords. Thus, we predicted that it might be easier to demonstrate RB for high-N nonwords than for low-N nonwords.\nThe high-N and low-N items were each divided into three sets of 12 items for counterbalancing purposes, and the sets were matched on N and print frequency (mean N sizes per set were 14.8, 14.7, and 14.3 for the high-N words; 13.9, 13.9, and 13.9 for the high-N nonwords; 3.8, 3.8, and 3.8 for the low-N words; and 3.1, 3.2, and 3.1 for the low-N nonwords). Sequences of 3 words or 3 nonwords were created with the first and last words or nonwords designated C1 and C2. These were then made into 6-item RSVP streams by displaying rows of symbols (e.g., %%%%, ####) as the first, second, and sixth items in each RSVP stream. The words or nonwords occupied the third, fourth, and fifth positions in each RSVP stream. Stimulus sets 1 and 2 were used to create the repeated condition, where C1 and C2 were identical. The control condition was created from the repeated condition by substituting a word from Stimulus set 3 for C1. Words or nonwords intervening between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 5 and 12. Two versions of the stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed 12 three-word lists in the high-N repeated condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, 12 in the low-N repeated condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition. The same was true for the 3-nonword lists. Each\nparticipant also viewed 40 RSVP streams with only 2 words or nonwords (a row of symbols was substituted for the intervening word or nonword). Each participant saw each critical word or nonword only once. In both versions of the stimulus list, word and nonword lists were randomly intermixed. All stimulus items used in Experiments 1 and 2 are shown in the Appendix (additional stimulus items used in Experiments 3\u20136 may be obtained from Alison L. Morris).\nApparatus and procedure. The stimuli for all experiments reported in this article were presented on a Macintosh G4 with display controlled by the PsyScope experimental control software (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993). The procedure was similar to that of Coltheart and Langdon (2003) except for the mode of response. In the Coltheart and Langdon studies, participants wrote down all the words or nonwords they had seen, whereas in the present experiment, participants named all words or nonwords displayed and the experimenter coded the response into the data file by using the computer keyboard (keys were labeled C1, C2, N, and B, thus providing minimal feedback to participants). In both cases, participants were warned that some of the RSVP lists would contain repeated items, and they were to report these twice.\nEach trial began with a \u201c \u201d displayed in the middle of the computer screen for 560 ms, followed by a blank interval of 560 ms. The RSVP stream was then displayed with each item appearing for 126 ms. Following the RSVP stream, a \u201c?\u201d was displayed to indicate that the participant should report the items. The next trial began immediately after the experimenter keyed in the participant\u2019s response. All stimuli were displayed in a white font (36 pt. Chicago) on a black background. The experimental trials were preceded by 10 practice trials."

            "text": "Critical pair recall. Following Coltheart and Langdon (2003), we measured RB by comparing the percentage of trials in which both C1 and C2 were reported for the repeated condition compared with the control condition. The results are shown in Figure 2. Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the factors condition (repeated or control), lexicality (word or nonword), and neighborhood size (high-N or low-N) revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (47.0% vs. 18.9%), F1(1, 23) 66.22, F2(1, 92) 201.99, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than repeated pairs (38.4% vs. 27.4%), F1(1, 23) 4.63, p .05, F2(1, 92) 33.18, p .001. There was no main effect of neighborhood size (both Fs 1). The main effect of condition was qualified by a significant crossover interaction between condition and lexicality, F1(1, 23) 110.85, F2(1, 92) 103.43, both ps .001. There was also a significant interaction between lexicality and neighborhood size, F1(1, 23) 7.58, F2(1, 92) 5.68, both ps .05. The Condition Lexicality interaction reflects an RB effect for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords; the Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction reflects superior recall of low-N words compared with high-N words, with the reverse pattern for nonwords. The Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction was qualified by a significant Condition Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 6.44, F2(1, 92) 4.28, both ps .05. As can be seen in Figure 2, the triple interaction reflects the fact\nthat the Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction is seen only in the control trials and not in the repeated trials; the same pattern was found by Coltheart and Langdon (2003). The finding of higher accuracy for low-N words compared with high-N words is often observed in perceptual identification tasks; although this finding is sometimes attributed to inhibitory effects of higher frequency neighbors during word recognition, it has also been attributed to a guessing process. If participants guess when the identities of words are poorly encoded, high-N words will be associated with incorrect guesses more often than will low-N words (Snodgrass & Mintzer, 1993; see also Andrews, 1997).\nMost important, we replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s finding of a significant crossover interaction between condition and lexicality in critical item recall. Further analysis of this interaction revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 7.83, p .05, F2(1, 46) 102.54, p .001. Nonwords showed a significant repetition advantage in the item analysis, F(1, 46) 12.75, p .005; although not in the subject analysis, F(1, 23) 2.57, p .12.\nIntervening item recall. To further investigate RB in this experiment, report of the item intervening between C1 and C2 was examined. Recall of the intervening item, on both word and nonword trials, was increased when it appeared in the context of repeated items. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in Table 1.3 Correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 236.19, F2(1, 94) 318.49, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, such that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when it appeared in the context of repeated items, F1(1, 23) 62.33, F2(1, 94) 62.85, both ps .001. The main effect of condition was qualified by a Condition Lexicality interaction, F1(1, 23) 15.22, p .005, F2(1, 94) 8.47, p .01. The interaction reflects a larger increase in intervening item recall for nonwords versus words. Our finding of increased recall of the intervening item on repeated trials mirrors that of Coltheart and Langdon (2003); however, our explanation for the intervening item effect is different from theirs.\nRecall that according to the competition hypothesis, adjacent items compete for access to awareness on the basis of the summed neural activity for each item (Morris et al., 2007). Because a repeated C2 is generally associated with less summed neural activity than is a nonrepeated C2, a repeated C2 will compete less effectively against the preceding item (the item intervening between C1 and C2). The result will be an increase in report of the intervening item in the repeated condition compared with that in the control condition. If both RB for C2 and the intervening item effect are indeed driven by the same process (reduced competitiveness of repeated items), the presence of an intervening item effect for nonwords suggests that RB might have been observed if there had not been any guessing of repetitions on repeated trials. Coltheart and Langdon (2003) attempted to reconcile the cooccurrence of a repetition advantage and the intervening item effect on nonword trials by arguing that the intervening item effect stems from a decrease in processing resources needed at the type identification stage. Thus, by their account, the increase in report of the intervening item in the repeated condition occurs because type identification of C2 is easier when it is a repeated item.\nSome might claim a memory locus for this intervening item effect in that when an item from the RSVP stream is missed, there are fewer items that one has to hold in memory\u2014thereby giving an advantage to any other item that appeared in the list. While this is a reasonable hypothesis, we (along with Luo and Caramazza, 1996) argue that such a memory benefit should occur for any of the items from the list, not just those immediately adjacent to C2. Although the results of this experiment cannot rule out a memory effect, other investigations, using five-item displays, have observed a significant increase in report of the item immediately preceding a repeated C2 (Luo & Caramazza, 1996; Morris et al., 2007). Thus the intervening item effect is more localized than would be predicted by a memory account.\nIn sum, Experiment 1 successfully replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) main findings even though a different response format was used (verbal responses were used as opposed to handwritten responses). In contrast to Coltheart and Langdon, however, we suggest that the repetition advantage for nonwords reflects the use of an informed guessing strategy based on partial orthographic information and/or fleeting awareness of the stimuli. Informed guessing would tend to selectively inflate the both scores on repeated trials; this could in turn mask any RB for nonwords and reduce RB for words. Our finding that the repetition advantage for\n3 Intervening item data are presented collapsed across the factor of neighborhood size.\nnonwords was significant in the item analysis but not significant in the subject analysis is consistent with the idea that some participants may have employed such a strategy to a greater degree than others did.4 Most important, such informed guessing would not be detectable by examining spurious reports of repetitions on control trials or two-item trials. We propose that participants would be unlikely to guess repetitions on control trials as they may have access to partial information pertaining to the repetition status of the trial and the number of items appearing in the trial. Spurious repetition reports were in fact rare in Experiment 1 (reports of repetitions occurred on 2.5% of control trials and 4.3% of two-item trials).\nAlthough the results of Experiment 1 are consistent with our proposal that the repetition advantage for nonwords is produced by some participants using an informed guessing strategy, the results are also consistent with Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) contention that identity at the lexical level is required to produce RB. Additional support for our claim that participants have sufficient access to partial stimulus information to reliably discriminate repeated from control trials (and from two-item trials) would be found if we could demonstrate that more widespread use of partial information can produce a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords. This possibility was investigated in Experiment 2.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, a second task was introduced that encouraged participants to use partial information about the stimuli in making their recognition judgments. As we have mentioned, participants could reliably discriminate repeated from three-item control trials if they simply gleaned enough partial orthographic information from each of the items to know that they differed. However, to effectively use a strategy of guessing repetitions, participants must also discriminate repeated trials from two-item trials. There are at least two ways that participants could make this discrimination in the absence of explicit identification of both of the repeated items. The first is to note that on two-item trials, a symbol string always intervened between the target items, whereas on three-item trials, the three words always appeared in succession. The second method involves a process of low-level visual matching between the target items; it may be the case that participants can detect a match or mismatch between C1 and C2 even when awareness of C2 is insufficient to support explicit identification.\nPerformance on cross-field matching has been demonstrated to be significantly higher than forced-choice identification performance in patients with visual neglect (Verfaellie, Milberg, McGlinchey-Berroth, & Grande, 1995). According to Verfaellie et al. (1995), one explanation for the dissociation is that only a fleeting awareness of visual information is required for the matching task but a more stable record is required for identification. It is possible that a similar dissociation occurs when participants view RSVP streams; participants may sometimes have access to sufficient information to judge whether C1 and C2 match in the absence of explicit identification of C2. Of course, if C1 is identified and C2 is judged a match, then the identity of C2 can be inferred.\nIn Experiment 2, in addition to asking participants to identify all the RSVP items, participants were asked to judge whether the first and last words or nonwords on each trial were the same or\ndifferent. The same/different task allows a more direct assessment of the amount of partial information available on repeated and control trials; specifically, it allows us to determine the extent to which participants can discriminate potential repeated trials from control trials. Furthermore, if participants often have access to partial information about the stimuli, drawing their attention to this information via the same/different judgment should increase the accuracy of their reports of repeated items in the identification task. Making increased use of partial stimulus information should not increase participants\u2019 identification accuracy for control trials because explicit knowledge of the identities of both items is needed. However, partial orthographic information on control trials should prevent false reports of repeated items on these trials. Similarly, false reports of repeated items on two-item trials (which are always nonrepeated trials) should be low if participants can ascertain that only two words or nonwords were presented, and that they differed orthographically.\nIf the available partial stimulus information is sufficient for most participants to make accurate same/different judgments about the stimuli, and they apply this knowledge to the identification task, their reports of repeated items (on repeated trials) should be increased for both words and nonwords in comparison with those of Experiment 1. Identification accuracy for control trials, however, should not differ significantly from that observed in Experiment 1."

During the first block, half the participants first made the same/different judgment and then identified the words or nonwords; the other participants first identified the words or nonwords and then made the same/different judgment. During the second block, the respective task orders were reversed. Block was a between-items variable, that is, half the items were assigned to the first block and the other half to the second block. Each block contained equal numbers of trials defined by the factors condition (repeated or control), lexicality (word or nonword), and neighborhood size (high-N or low-N).\nProcedure. The procedure was similar to that in Experiment 1, but with the addition of the same/different task. When the same/ different task occurred first, the cue \u201csame or different?\u201d appeared following the RSVP stream.

            "text": "Initial analyses on results from the same/different and identification tasks revealed that task order (a between-subjects variable) did not show a main effect, nor did it interact with any other factor; therefore, subsequent analyses were collapsed across task order.5 Results from the same/different and identification tasks in the two blocks are shown in Figure 3.\nSame/different task. Participants were highly accurate on the same/different task (89.4% correct overall on the repeated and control trials, with only 4 of the 24 participants scoring less than 80%). A repeated-measures ANOVA on the percentage of correct scores with the factors condition, lexicality, neighborhood size, and block revealed a significant main effect of lexicality, with slightly higher scores for words (90.8%) than for nonwords (88.0%), F1(1, 23) 4.73, F2(1, 88) 5.40, both ps .05; and a significant main effect of block, with higher scores in the second\nblock (92.8%) than in the first block (86.0%), F1(1, 23) 10.63, p .005, F2(1, 88) 37.92, p .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, with higher scores on control trials (97.2%) than on repeated trials (81.6%), F1(1, 23) 8.57, p .01,\n5 It may initially seem surprising that task order did not have more of an influence on the results. For example, one might expect identification scores for repeated items to be more influenced by the same/different judgment when the latter was performed first. This would be the case if the judgments required for the two tasks were indeed made sequentially. However, the lack of task order effects suggests that even though the responses on the two tasks were made sequentially, the judgments driving the responses may have been interdependent rather than sequential. For some participants, regardless of task order, the same/different judgment may have influenced the identification judgment, while for others, the reverse may have been the case.\nF2(1, 88) 130.39, p .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 6.52, F2(1, 88) 6.90, both ps .05; as was the Condition Block interaction, F1(1, 23) 5.22, p .05, F2(1, 88) 16.09, p .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction indicated that the main effect of lexicality was driven by the scores in the repeated condition (84.7% correct for words, 78.5% correct for nonwords), whereas the scores in the control condition were equivalent (96.9% for words, 97.6% for nonwords). The Condition Block interaction indicated that the difference in accuracy between the repeated and control scores was reduced in the second block. No other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses.\nThe high accuracy level on the same/different task for both words and nonwords suggests that participants were largely able to discriminate potential repeated trials from control trials. In particular, participants were very unlikely to report \u201csame\u201d on control trials, possibly because they had access to sufficient partial orthographic information to rule out a repetition on these trials. However, in order for one to reliably use partial orthographic information as part of an informed guessing strategy, one must also be able to discriminate two-item trials from three-item trials. The mean probability of report of \u201csame\u201d on two-item trials was 12.7%, which is higher than the 4.3% obtained in Experiment 1. However, the rate of spurious reports of repetitions on two-item trials varied greatly among the participants. Four of the participants should be considered outliers, as they reported repetitions on 32.5%\u201377.5% of two-item trials. The mean percentage of spurious repetition reports on two-item trials for the remaining 20 participants was only 4.5%, comparable with the rate found in Experiment 1. Thus, the majority of participants were able to effectively discriminate repeated from control trials and two-item trials.\nIdentification task: Critical pair recall. As in Experiment 1, we measured RB by comparing the percentage of trials in which both C1 and C2 were reported (both scores) for the repeated condition compared with the control condition. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with the factors condition, lexicality, neighborhood size, and block revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (73.9% vs. 42.1%), F1(1, 23) 263.87, F2(1, 88) 243.99, both ps .001; and repeated pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were control pairs (74.2% vs. 41.8%), F1(1, 23) 72.23, F2(1, 88) 316.15, both ps .001. Although the finding of greater joint report of words than of nonwords is consistent with the results of Experiment 1, the finding of greater report of repeated items than of control items (a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords) is not. The repetition advantage in Experiment 2 was greater for nonwords than for words, as revealed by a significant interaction between condition and lexicality, F1(1, 23) 54.97, F2(1, 88) 94.05, both ps .001. Follow-up comparisons revealed that the repetition advantage was significant for words, F1(1, 23) 15.06, p .005, F2(1, 44) 35.63, p .001; and for nonwords, F1(1, 23) 99.30, F2(1, 44) 348.54, both ps .001. We also found a significant Block Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 6.76, F2(1, 88) 4.60, both ps .05. In the first block, high-N words were correctly reported at a higher rate than were low-N words, whereas low-N nonwords were correctly reported at a higher rate than were high-N nonwords; in the second block, the opposite pattern was found. A significant Condition Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 14.42, F2(1, 88) 10.52,\nboth ps .005, further indicates that for control trials, low-N words were correctly reported at a higher rate than were high-N words, whereas high-N nonwords were correctly reported at a higher rate than were low-N words; the opposite pattern was found for repeated trials.\nIdentification task: Intervening item recall. As in Experiment 1, recall of the intervening item on both word and nonword trials was increased when it appeared in the context of repeated items. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in the three-item lists for both blocks of trials and both task orders is shown in Table 2. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with the factors task order, condition, lexicality, and block revealed that correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 22) 405.84, F2(1, 92) 356.36, both ps .001. The main effect of condition was significant such that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when it appeared in the context of repeated items, F1(1, 22) 74.48, F2(1, 92) 110.70, both ps .001. There was also a significant Task Order Block interaction, F1(1, 22) 7.15, p .05, F2(1, 92) 15.60, p .001, which indicates that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when the identification task occurred first. This likely reflects the effect of rapid forgetting of the intervening item when the identification task was performed following the same/different task. Finally, there was a significant Condition Lexicality Block interaction, F1(1, 22) 8.95, p .01, F2(1, 92) 9.57, p .005. This interaction reflects the fact that the intervening item effect for words was greater in the first block than in the second block, whereas the intervening item effect for nonwords showed a tendency to increase in the second block. No other main effects or interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses.\nThe results of Experiment 2 were as predicted; when all participants were required to make a same/different judgment in addition to identifying the words or nonwords, both words and nonwords showed a repetition advantage in the identification task. The implication is that participants are able to use partial orthographic information and/or fleeting awareness of the stimuli to reliably\nNote. For Task Order 1, in Block 1 the same/different task was performed first, and in Block 2 the identification task was performed first. For Task Order 2, in Block 1 the identification task was performed first, and in Block 2 the identification task was performed first.\ndiscriminate repeated from control trials. When they use this information in their identification reports, any RB that might have been evident, whether for words or nonwords, can be masked by guessing of repetitions. Most important, such guessing is not detectable as spurious reports of repetitions on control trials (these occurred on less than 3% of control trials in Experiment 2). Therefore, the usual type of guessing correction based on false reports of repeated items on control trials may be inadequate.\nCould spurious reports of repetitions on two-item trials still be used to correct for guessing? One might surmise that the 4 participants who produced large numbers of spurious repetition reports on two-item trials were the source of the repetition advantage found for words in Experiment 2. Accordingly, we conducted additional analyses on the critical item recall scores, excluding the 4 participants in question. These analyses produced the same pattern of results as those computed over all participants; that is, a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords was exhibited by participants who were able to reliably discriminate repeated from control trials and two-item trials.\nThe results of Experiment 2 support our proposed explanation for the finding of a repetition advantage for nonwords in Experiment 1. If several participants used an informed guessing strategy in Experiment 1, this would have raised the level of repetition reports on repeated trials enough to produce a repetition advantage for nonwords (which exhibited low accuracy on control trials) but not for words (with much higher accuracy on control trials). When all participants were encouraged to use an informed guessing strategy in Experiment 2, the level of repetition reports on repeated trials was raised still further, producing a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords.\nSome might argue that the addition of the same/different task in Experiment 2 changed the way participants processed the stimuli, making it difficult to draw inferences about the findings of Experiment 1 from those of Experiment 2. We suggest that such inferences would be warranted if performance on Experiment 2 closely resembled that on Experiment 1, with the exception of the increase in repetition reports on repeated trials. Figure 4 demonstrates that the addition of the same/different task in Experiment 2 served to increase correct reports of repeated items but left reports of control items unchanged from the level obtained in Experiment 1. This was confirmed by two cross-experiment ANOVAs. For repeatedcondition trials, a significant main effect of experiment showed that the joint report of critical items was higher in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1, F(1, 46) 38.63, p .001, whereas for control trials there was a null effect of Experiment (F 1).\nAdditional evidence supporting our contention that the stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2 were processed in a similar manner can be found by comparing identification performance for the item intervening between C1 and C2. Participants may have attended to the critical items at the expense of the intervening item in Experiment 2 because the same/different task required comparison of only the critical items. However, inspection of the data in Tables 1 and 2 reveals that performance on the intervening item was similar in the two experiments; if anything, performance was slightly better in Experiment 2.\nFinally, one might wonder whether the same/different task provided participants with feedback regarding the correctness of their responses on this task, which could then influence performance on the identification task. There are two reasons that this is unlikely.\nThe first is that the participants\u2019 same/different responses were keyed in as \u201csame\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d rather than \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d The second is that there was no effect of task order on identification performance; that is, performing the same/different task first did not result in an improvement in performance on the identification task.\nIn sum, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants could make use of partial and/or fleeting information from the display to accurately discriminate repeated from control trials. If sufficient numbers of participants in Experiment 1 used an informed guessing strategy on a sufficient proportion of trials, the amount of measurable RB would be reduced for both words and nonwords, but the effect on nonwords would be much greater because the identification score for control nonwords tends to be much lower than that for words. Thus, the net effect would be a reduction in RB for words, and a complete reversal of the RB effect for nonwords, just as was found in Experiment 1.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to determine which participants in Experiment 1 may have been using such a strategy, and to what extent. The results of Experiment 2 make it clear that applying a\nguessing correction based on false reports of repeated items on control trials is not adequate, because participants can glean sufficient information from control trials to avoid making false reports of repetitions. A similar limitation applies to the use of false reports on two-item trials to correct for guessing, as most participants can reliably discriminate two-item from repetition trials.\nWhat is needed is a type of trial in which RB occurs, but in which guessing a repetition is an incorrect response. Recall that a number of experiments have demonstrated RB for words which are similar but not identical (e.g., Bavelier et al., 1994; Harris & Morris, 2000; Kanwisher & Potter, 1990; Morris & Harris, 1999). Trials in which C1 and C2 are orthographic neighbors (e.g., cart and cast, slan and slad) may provide a way of gauging the degree to which participants are guessing repetitions. If participants experience RB on some of these trials, they may guess a repetition; and unlike on trials in which C1 and C2 are identical, such a guess would be counted as incorrect. In addition to providing a means of documenting guessing of repetitions, including the neighbor trials may have the effect of discouraging such guessing because the ability to determine which trials are potential repeated trials is reduced. If the amount of guessing of repetitions is reduced sufficiently, this may in turn allow RB for identical nonwords to be revealed.\nExperiment 3\nIn Experiment 3, trials in which the critical words were orthographic neighbors (e.g., cart and cast, slan and slad) were included in an attempt to decrease guessing of repetitions on repeated trials. If guessing of repetitions does persist, it may be apparent on these trials; a report of cart and cart would be an incorrect response if cart and cast had actually been displayed. Participant\u2019s scores can then be corrected for guessing by subtracting the proportion of spurious repetitions on neighbor trials from the proportion of repetition responses on repeated trials."

Each item in Experiment 3 appeared in three conditions: repeated, control, and neighbor. To create the neighbor condition, words and nonwords from Experiments 1 and 2 were paired with an orthographic neighbor C1 (e.g., cast was paired with cart). The control condition was created from the repeated condition by substituting an orthographically nonsimilar word or nonword for C1.6 Words or nonwords intervening between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 4 and 12; these words were orthographically dissimilar to C1 and C2. Four versions of the stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed 6 three-word lists in the high-N repeated condition, 6 in the high-N neighbor condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, 6 in the low-N repeated condition, 6 in the low-N neighbor condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition.

            "text": "The major purpose of Experiment 3 was to discourage guessing of repetitions by adding neighbor trials to the design and by cautioning participants that some of the words and nonwords would look similar to each other. A second purpose was to provide a means of estimating the probability of guessing of repetitions should they still occur. The top half of Table 3 shows the percentage of participants reporting 0, 1, 2, or 3 false repetitions on control, two-item, and neighbor trials for words and nonwords in Experiment 3. Each participant viewed only six word and six nonword neighbor trials, so even one spurious report of a repetition amounted to a significant percentage (16.7%) of those trials. As can be derived from the table, 42% of participants reported a repetition on a neighbor trial at least once on word trials, and 37% reported a repetition at least once on nonword trials. Spurious reports of repetitions on control or two-item trials were rare. Thus, even though Experiment 3 was designed to discourage the use of an informed guessing strategy, many participants appear to have used such a strategy nonetheless.\nCritical pair recall. Figure 5 shows the uncorrected mean percentage of joint recall of critical items for all conditions in Experiment 3. Separate analyses were conducted on repeated and neighbor trials (each in comparison with control trials) to examine RB for repeated and orthographically similar words and nonwords. Turning first to the repeated items, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (repeated vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (66.1% vs. 31.2%), F1(1, 23) 170.47, F2(1, 92) 169.13, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were repeated pairs (55.2% vs. 42.2%), F1(1, 23) 8.89, p .01, F2(1, 92) 25.07, p .001. There was no main effect of neighborhood size (both Fs 1). The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 20.78, F2(1, 92) 26.45, both ps .001; but all other interactions were nonsignificant (all Fs 1). Further analysis of the critical Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for repeated words, F1(1, 23) 17.52 p .001, F2(1, 46) 50.23, both ps .001; but a null effect for repeated nonwords (both Fs 1). It appears that including neighbor trials in the design may have discouraged guessing of repetitions to the extent that the repetition advantage for nonwords was eliminated, but not enough so that RB for repeated nonwords could be shown with the uncorrected scores.\n6 Adding the neighbor condition necessitated altering several of the stimuli from Experiments 1 and 2.\nAlthough guessing of repetitions has the potential to reduce the appearance of RB for the repeated nonwords, it should not mask RB for the orthographically similar nonwords because such guesses would not be counted as correct. Turning to the neighbor trials, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (neighbor vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (65.5% vs. 25.0%), F1(1, 23) 177.29, F2(1, 92) 214.52, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than neighbor pairs (55.2% vs. 35.2%), F1(1, 23) 41.63, F2(1, 92) 58.91, both ps .001. The main effect of neighborhood size was not significant, F1(1, 23) 2.71, p .10, F2(1, 92) 2.06, p .15. The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 7.83, p .05, F2(1, 92) 8.53, p .005; whereas the Condition Neighborhood Size interaction was significant in the\nsubjects analysis, F1(1, 23) 5.91, p .05; but only approached significance in the items analysis, F2(1, 92) 2.88, p .09. The Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction was significant in the subjects analysis, F1(1, 23) 4.49, p .05; but not in the items analysis, F2(1, 92) 1.40, p .20. The Condition Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction was not significant, F1(1, 23) 1.07, p .30, F2(1, 92) 1.33, p .25. Further analysis of the Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for neighbor words, F1(1, 23) 43.22, F2(1, 46) 60.38, both ps .001; as well as a significant RB effect for neighbor nonwords, F1(1, 23) 12.16, F2(1, 46) 10.56, both ps .005.\nIn sum, the uncorrected critical item recall scores from Experiment 3 revealed RB for repeated words, a null effect for repeated nonwords, and RB for neighbor words and nonwords. The finding of RB for neighbor nonwords but not for repeated nonwords is consistent with the notion that the scores for repeated nonwords (and, by extension, repeated words) were inflated by guessing. Furthermore, the pattern of reports of repetitions on neighbor trials shown in Table 3 suggests that the use of an informed guessing strategy may have been widespread in Experiment 3, despite attempts to discourage it.\nCorrected scoring. Would a significant RB effect for repeated nonwords emerge if the scores were corrected for guessing? To investigate this, false reports of repetitions in the neighbor condition were subtracted from the uncorrected score for the repeated condition for each participant (and each item in the item analysis). The results are shown in Figure 6. Planned comparisons revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 29.51, F2(1, 46) 69.18, both ps .001; and an effect of RB for nonwords that approached significance, F1(1, 23) 3.04, F2 (1, 46) 3.10, both ps .09. These data show that when a more appropriate guessing correction is applied, a small amount of repetition blindness for repeated nonwords becomes apparent.\nIntervening item recall. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in the top half of Table 4. Correct report of intervening words was higher\nNote. In Experiment 3, all stimulus items were displayed for 126 ms. In Experiment 4, when the first critical item was a nonword, it was displayed for a longer duration (252 ms) than when it was a word (126 ms).\nthan correct report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 201.12, F2(1, 94) 462.78, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, F1(2, 46) 23.46, F2(2, 188) 22.12, both ps .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant (both Fs 1). Planned comparisons indicated that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate in the context of repeated items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 40.54, F2(1, 94) 63.32, both ps .001; and at a higher rate in the context of neighbor items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 5.73, F2(1, 94) 4.09, both ps .05. Thus, intervening item effects were found for both the repeated and neighbor conditions relative to the control condition. This finding is relevant to the debate concerning the mechanism underlying RB for orthographically similar words. If orthographic RB stems from residual lexical inhibition occurring during the process of recognizing C1, there is no reason to expect an intervening item effect for the neighbor trials. If, on the other hand, orthographic RB stems from the same mechanism as identity RB, one should find an intervening item effect in both cases (although the intervening item effect associated with orthographic RB should be smaller because the representations of C1 and C2 are not identical\u2014thus only a portion of the representation of C2 is sharpened). The results of the intervening item analysis provide support for our contention that the same mechanism underlies both identity and orthographic RB.\nTaken together, the results of Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that the finding of a repetition advantage depends on the widespread use of an informed guessing strategy. Experiment 2 demonstrated that when participants are encouraged to use such a strategy (by drawing their attention to the frequent repetitions in the experiment) a repetition advantage can be obtained for both words and nonwords. Experiment 3 demonstrated that when an informed guessing strategy is made less efficacious, even the repetition advantage for nonwords disappears.\nIt is important to note that the results of Experiment 3 do not reflect only a decrease in guesses of repeated items. If that were the case, the magnitude of the RB effect for repeated words should have been higher in Experiment 3 than that in Experiment 1. Furthermore, there should not have been a difference between the two experiments in the accuracy of report of control items. In contrast, a comparison of the results from Experiment 3 (shown in Figure 5) with those from Experiment 1 (shown in Figure 2)\nsuggests that overall accuracy on both repeated and control trials was considerably higher in Experiment 3. Thus, although the main goal of Experiment 3 was to decrease guessing of repetitions, the result may be more properly characterized as a decrease in reliance on guessing accompanied by an overall increase in attention to the stimuli.\nExperiment 3 further demonstrated that RB can be obtained for neighbor nonwords, whereas RB for repeated nonwords was weak (only approaching significance in our sample of 24 participants). The finding of more RB for neighbor nonwords than for repeated nonwords is puzzling, as more RB is generally found for identical items than for orthographically similar items (e.g., Harris & Morris, 2000). However, it is possible that the amount of guessing of repetitions on repeated trials was underestimated. Recall that the estimate of guessing was based on spurious repetition reports on the neighbor trials, so if a participant is highly accurate on those trials, the amount of guessing that can be measured is constrained. A few participants were indeed highly accurate on their reports of neighbor nonwords, so the estimate of guessing of repetitions based on errors in the neighbor condition could be too low. If RB for repeated nonwords is generally small, it may still be masked by any residual guessing of repetitions not accounted for in the corrected scores.\nHowever, if the size of the RB effect could be increased, it should be possible to demonstrate more reliable RB for repeated nonwords even when all guessing is not accounted for in the corrected scores. As discussed previously, the competition hypothesis predicts that little to no RB will be found when items are poorly encoded (Morris et al., 2007). An estimate of the relative encoding effectiveness of words versus nonwords can be derived from the percentage of correct reports of these items in the control condition. In Experiment 3, report of C1 words was highly accurate (92.5% correct), whereas report of C1 nonwords was less accurate (67.2% correct). If the effectiveness of nonword encoding were somehow increased, the amount of RB for repeated nonwords should also be increased.\nExperiment 4\nIn Experiment 4, type encoding of the C1 nonword was increased by doubling its display duration relative to that used in the previous experiments. Although this manipulation also increased the SOA between the critical nonwords, the increase in RB from improved type encoding was expected to outweigh any diminution of the RB effect stemming from the increased SOA. In addition, whereas the competition hypothesis predicts an increase in RB with increased encoding effectiveness of the C1 nonword, Coltheart and Langdon (2003) would appear to predict the opposite. According to their explanation of the repetition advantage for nonwords, successful report of the first nonword results in priming of the repeated nonword. On their view, therefore, an increase in the ability to correctly report C1 might result in an increase in the repetition advantage for nonwords."

Correct report of C1 nonwords (86.6%) was nearly as high as correct report of C1 words (89.9%). Although Experiment 4 was designed to increase the encoding effectiveness of nonwords, guessing of repetitions was not expected to decrease relative to Experiment 3. The bottom half of Table 3 shows the percentage of participants reporting 0, 1, 2, or 3 false repetitions on control, two-item, and neighbor trials for words and nonwords in Experiment 4. As can be derived from the table, 46% of participants reported a repetition on a neighbor trial at least once on word trials, and 41% reported a repetition at least once on nonword trials, a guessing rate that was comparable with that seen in Experiment 3. Spurious reports of repetitions on control or two-item trials were again quite rare.\nCritical pair recall. Figure 7 shows the uncorrected mean percentage of recall of both critical items for all conditions in Experiment 4. Separate analyses were conducted on repeated and neighbor trials (each in comparison with control trials) to examine RB for repeated and orthographically similar words and nonwords. Turning first to the repeated items, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (repeated vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (54.7% vs. 28.5%), F1(1, 23) 104.57, F2(1, 92) 70.93, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were repeated pairs (49.6% vs.\n33.5%), F1(1, 23) 8.54, p .01, F2(1, 92) 24.09, p .001. There was no main effect of neighborhood size (both Fs 1). The main effect of condition was qualified by a significant Condition Lexicality interaction, F1(1, 23) 26.74, F2(1, 92) 15.68, both ps .001. No other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses. Further analysis of the critical Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 16.22, p .005, F2(1, 46) 33.21, p .001; but a null effect for nonwords (both Fs 1).\nTurning to the neighbor trials, a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors condition (neighbor vs. control), lexicality, and neighborhood size revealed that joint report of words was higher than that of nonwords (53.0% vs. 24.8%), F1(1, 23) 113.04, F2(1, 92) 99.66, both ps .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than were neighbor pairs (49.6% vs. 28.1%), F1(1, 23) 43.17, F2(1, 92) 42.42, both ps .001. The main effect of neighborhood size was significant in the subjects analysis, F1(1, 23) 6.30, p .05; but only approached significance in the items analysis, F2(1, 92) 2.90, p .09. The Condition Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) 20.43, p .001, F2(1, 92) 10.43, p .005; as was the Lexicality Neighborhood Size interaction, F1(1, 23) 8.10, p .01, F2(1, 92) 5.07, p .05. No other interactions were significant in both the subjects and items analyses. Further analysis of the Condition Lexicality interaction revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 49.00, F2(1, 46) 36.64, both ps .001; as well as a significant RB effect for nonwords, F1(1, 23) 11.91, p .005, F2(1, 46) 7.65, p .01. In sum, the uncorrected critical pair recall scores from Experiment 4 revealed RB for repeated words, a null effect for repeated nonwords, and RB for neighbor words and nonwords. This is the same pattern found for the uncorrected scores in Experiment 3.\nCorrected scoring. As in Experiment 3, we corrected the critical pair recall scores for guessing by subtracting false reports of repetitions in the neighbor condition from the uncorrected score for the repeated condition for each participant (and each item in the item analysis). The results are shown in Figure 8. Planned comparisons revealed a significant RB effect for words, F1(1, 23) 31.54, F2(1, 46) 44.68, both ps .001; and a significant RB effect for nonwords, F1(1, 23) 4.80, F2(1, 46) 4.32, both ps .05. Thus, the corrected scores for Experiment 4 revealed that RB can be demonstrated for repeated nonwords as well as for repeated words.\nIntervening item recall. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in the bottom half of Table 4. Correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 257.76, F2(1, 94) 175.40, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, F1(2, 46) 33.41, F2(2, 188) 22.65, both ps .001. The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant in either analysis. Planned comparisons indicated that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate in the context of repeated items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 76.83, F2(1, 95) 45.30, both ps .001; and at a higher rate in the context of neighbor items than in the context of control items, F1(1, 23) 7.54, F2(1, 95) 5.36, both ps .05."

            "text": "We have suggested that the spurious reports of repetitions on neighbor trials indicate the use of an informed guessing strategy. However, some might argue that a false repetition report merely represents misreading of an item as an orthographically similar item, as has been observed to occur in RSVP (e.g., Kanwisher & Potter, 1990). Perhaps the participants reporting high numbers of repeated items in the neighbor condition were simply poorer at reading rapidly presented words and nonwords. To further investigate the source of spurious repetition reports, we divided the participants in Experiments 3 and 4 (combined) into low repetitions (0 repetitions on neighbor trials, n 23) and high repetitions ( 0 repetitions on neighbor trials, n 25) groups; the results are shown in Figure 9. As can be seen in the figure, the high repetitions participants were not less accurate than the low repetitions participants at reporting words and nonwords in the control or neighbor conditions. In fact, the scores for the high repetitions participants were numerically higher than the scores for the low repetitions participants, although these differences did not reach statistical significance for the control condition, F(1, 46) 1.98, p .15; or for the neighbor condition, F(1, 46) 2.27, p .10. However, the two groups did differ significantly in accuracy of report in the repeated condition, with greater accuracy for the high repetitions group, F(1, 46) 24.58, p .001. It is also noteworthy that for the high repetitions group, RB for repeated words (12%) was much smaller than that for neighbor words (29%); as noted previously, RB for repeated words is generally larger than RB for orthographically similar words. Although it is post hoc, this analysis reinforces our contention that spurious reports of repetitions on neighbor trials were largely guesses rather than misreadings of otherwise correctly perceived stimulus items.\nIn sum, increasing the encoding effectiveness of the C1 nonword in Experiment 4 by increasing the exposure duration enabled statistically significant RB to be demonstrated for the repeated nonwords when the scores were corrected for guessing. It is also\nimportant to note that increasing the percentage of correct report of the C1 nonwords did not restore the repetition advantage for nonwords obtained in Experiment 1. Thus, the results of Experiment 4 provide additional evidence in support of our argument that the repetition advantage for nonwords is an artifact of informed guessing strategies rather than a result of successful tokenization of the C1 nonword.\nTaken together, the experiments thus far demonstrate the difficulties in estimating the magnitude of the RB effect for repeated nonwords when guessing of repetitions is prevalent. Guessing of repetitions has also posed problems in correctly estimating the magnitude of RB for repeated words when a similar words-andsymbols paradigm has been used (Harris & Morris, 2001a). One strategy to reduce guessing of repetitions is to refrain from informing participants that many trials will contain repeated items; however, this could result in an overestimation of the RB effect by introducing a response bias. A second strategy is to use longer RSVP lists and vary the serial positions of the repeated items. Although this may be an effective strategy for investigating RB for words, the use of longer lists would likely drive report of nonwords to floor levels, making it impossible to obtain measurable RB.\nUsing non-identical items rather than repeated items in investigations of RB appears to significantly decrease the use of guessing strategies (although it may not eliminate them altogether).7 Harris and Morris (2004) were able to obtain reliable RB for nonidentical nonwords by using a two-word display with intervening symbol masks. However, it is important to establish that RB for non-identical nonwords is replicable across different display formats. Although significant RB for neighbor nonwords in threeitem displays was demonstrated in Experiments 3 and 4, those experiments also included repeated items. Accordingly, Experi-\n7 If rhyming items compose a significant proportion of the stimuli, participants may adopt the strategy of guessing rhyming items (Harris & Morris, 2000).\nment 5 investigated whether RB for neighbor nonwords occurs when no repeated items are present in the experiment.\nExperiment 5\nExperiment 5 examined RB for words and nonwords that are orthographic neighbors (e.g., swim and slim; kerg and kerp); no repeated items were present in the experiment. The use of orthographic neighbors rather than repeated items should make it more difficult for participants to use an informed guessing strategy to overcome RB for words or nonwords. As a significant amount of guessing was not anticipated, we did not increase the exposure duration for the C1 nonword; all words and nonwords were displayed for the same duration (126 ms)."

Only 1 participant reported a repetition on a neighbor trial, and no repetitions were reported on two-item or control trials. These results support our contention that the repetition reports noted on neighbor trials in Experiments 3 and 4 indicated the use of an informed guessing strategy in those experiments.\nIntervening item recall. The percentage of correct report of the second word or nonword in each three-item list is shown in the top half of Table 5. Correct report of intervening words was higher than report of intervening nonwords, F1(1, 23) 402.35, F2(1, 94) 353.23, both ps .001. There was also a significant main effect of condition, such that the intervening item was reported at a higher rate when it appeared in the context of neighbor items, F1(1, 23) 10.19, F2(1, 94) 11.51, both ps .005. The Condition Lexicality interaction was not significant (both Fs 1). The significant intervening item effects found in Experiments 3, 4, and 5 for neighbor items compared with control items are predicted by the competition model; when C2 is orthographically similar to C1, C2\u2019s representation will be associated with less activation than will a control C2, and therefore will compete less effectively against adjacent items. The result is a net gain in competitiveness for the item immediately preceding the orthographically similar C2. Note also that the intervening item effect in Experiment 5 cannot be attributed to lexical priming from C1 to C2; in the case of neighbor words, C1 and C2 are not the same lexical item, and in the case of nonwords, neither one is a lexical item.\nIn sum, Experiment 5 revealed that reliable RB can be demonstrated for non-identical nonwords in three-item displays when no repeated items are present in the experiment. RB was obtained for nonwords even though performance on control trials was relatively low (19% correct joint report), and participants were explicitly told to expect similar-looking items. In Experiment 6, we provide a replication of this effect, using a different response format and additional analyses to further examine nonword recall from RSVP displays.\nExperiment 6\nIn each of the experiments described thus far, participants viewed the RSVP stream and immediately reported what they saw to an experimenter, who then keyed in the response. Pilot studies\nindicated that having participants type in their responses rather than report them to the experimenter resulted in an overall decrease in performance, perhaps because this response mode tended to be slower and some of the stimuli were forgotten before they could be typed. However, a typed record of the participants\u2019 responses can be useful in obtaining a better estimate of partial orthographic information obtained from the stimuli. Our claim is that the guessing strategy assumed to be operating in Experiments 1\u20134 was effective (and largely undetectable on control trials in Experiments 1\u20132) because most participants could glean sufficient partial information from a trial to determine whether it was a potential repetition trial or not. The both score, while providing a good estimate of the RB effect, may severely underestimate the amount of partial information available. Accordingly, in Experiment 6 we attempted to replicate the RB effect for neighbor nonwords obtained in Experiment 5, but participants were instructed to type their responses in addition to reporting them to the experimenter."

In sum, Experiment 6 successfully replicated the results of Experiment 5, in that reliable RB was found for neighbor nonwords as well as words, and both types of stimuli showed an intervening item effect. We next report the results of additional analyses designed to further investigate RB for words and nonwords.\nAdditional analyses. To provide a better estimate of the availability of partial orthographic information from three-item RSVP displays, we calculated the percentage of trials on which at least two letters of a word or nonword were reported correctly. For example, suppose the stimulus item bink juff rast was reported as\nbink just raff. With the standard scoring, neither the joint report of critical items nor the report of the intervening item would be scored as correct. With the alternative scoring, however, all three items (C1, C2, and the intervening item) would be scored as correct. Table 6 shows the alternative scoring results from the control condition of Experiment 6. As can be seen in the table, participants were able to report a significant percentage of the letters from the word and nonword displays in the control condition. The implication is that a strategy of guessing repetitions will be effective for many participants because their access to partial orthographic information will be sufficient to avoid spurious reports of repetitions on control trials.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe six experiments reported in this article demonstrate that previous failures to find RB for identical nonwords shown in RSVP streams could be due to participants\u2019 use of \u201cinformed guessing\u201d strategies combined with poor encoding of nonwords. Experiment 1 replicated Coltheart and Langdon\u2019s (2003) finding of RB for words but a repetition advantage for nonwords. In Experiment 2, participants performed a same/different matching task in addition to identifying all the items; this task revealed that participants can reliably discriminate between repeated and control trials, perhaps on the basis of partial orthographic information. Thus, participants who would be likely to guess repetitions on repeated trials would not tend to do so on control trials because they would have gleaned enough partial information from the control trial to rule out a repetition. Indeed, encouraging the use of informed guessing via the same/different task produced a repetition advantage for both words and nonwords.\nIn Experiments 1 and 2, it was not possible to distinguish correctly perceived repetitions from guesses. Accordingly, in Experiments 3 and 4 we included trials containing orthographic neighbor pairs; if participants were using informed guessing to report repetitions, they might report cast and cast following a trial containing the words cast and cart, providing evidence of guessing. Alternatively, including the neighbor trials might be expected to discourage guessing by making it less efficacious. In fact, both goals were achieved; the repetition advantage for nonwords found in Experiments 1 and 2 was eliminated, suggesting that guessing was decreased compared with that in the previous experiments, but a substantial proportion of the participants still reported a repetition on at least one neighbor trial, validating our claim that participants guess repetitions when they are informed that some\ntrials will contain repeated items. In Experiment 4, we improved the encoding effectiveness of the first critical item on nonword trials by increasing its exposure duration. Significant RB was found for repeated words, neighbor words, and neighbor nonwords in both Experiments 3 and 4; significant RB was also found for repeated nonwords in Experiment 4 when scores were corrected for guessing.\nOne additional finding corroborates our contention that the repetition advantage found in Experiments 1 and 2 was the result of informed guessing. In the control condition of Experiments 1 and 2, low-N words were reported more accurately than were high-N words, a finding that is thought to be an indicator of guessing in perceptual identification (Snodgrass & Mintzer, 1993). However, when guessing of repetitions was made less efficacious via the inclusion of neighbor trials (Experiments 3 and 4) both the repetition advantage and the low-N word advantage disappeared. Thus, it appears that participants relied less on guessing of repetitions (and less on guessing in general) in Experiments 3 and 4 than in Experiments 1 and 2.\nFinally, Experiments 5 and 6 demonstrated that RB for orthographic neighbor nonwords could still be obtained when no repeated items were present in the experiment. In addition, in Experiment 6, participants were asked to report the contents of each trial aloud and to type their responses. This additional response format allowed for further investigation of the partial orthographic information available to participants in the control condition. Liberal scoring of these responses (counting an item as correct if at least two letters were reported correctly) showed that although participants had great difficulty reporting nonwords correctly, they did perceive most of the letters from the nonwords. This enabled them to avoid spurious repetition reports.\nThe results of these experiments have several important implications. First and foremost, these experiments show that RB can be obtained for nonwords if appropriate procedures are used to detect and correct for informed guessing of repetitions. Second, the finding of RB for nonwords is consistent with the notion that RB can have sublexical effects (Harris & Morris, 2001b, 2004; Morris & Harris, 1999). Third, these results provide additional support for the claim that orthographic and identity RB stem from the same processes. Recall that some have claimed that identity RB should only be found for lexically identical stimuli (Chialant & Caramazza, 1997; Coltheart & Langdon, 2003) and that other forms of RB must be driven by a different process, such as residual lexical inhibition. Evidence bearing on this claim comes from our analyses of report of the item intervening between C1 and C2. In each of our experiments, we found a benefit for report of the intervening item when it was displayed in the context of identical items or orthographically similar items compared with control items. Coltheart and Langdon (2003) associated this intervening item effect with priming; that is, processing of an identical C2 is facilitated, leaving more resources for processing the intervening item. If, however, orthographic RB represents lexical inhibition (rather than priming) of C2, there should be no processing advantage for the intervening item. Thus, we propose that finding an advantage for the intervening item in identical and orthographically similar trials is further evidence against the lexical inhibition account.\nOur preferred account of RB phenomena is a more parsimonious one. RB, whether for identical or orthographically similar words or nonwords, is driven by sharpening of stimulus representations,\nwhich confers a benefit within the type recognition system but a cost in the competition for awareness when items are rapidly displayed (Morris et al., 2007). The competition hypothesis proposes that the intervening item effect emerges from these competitive interactions, wherein a repeated or orthographically similar C2 is associated with less total activation than is a nonrepeated C2. Because items must compete with adjacent items for access to awareness, a C2 with relatively low activation will be outcompeted by the intervening item or by the following pattern mask more often than will a nonrepeated C2, resulting in RB for C2 and facilitation for the intervening item. Furthermore, the benefit for the intervening item that emerges out of this competitive interaction should be smaller when C1 and C2 are merely orthographically similar than when they are identical, because similar items contain some nonrepeated letters (the lack of identity at phonological and semantic levels may also decrease the size of the intervening item effect).\nThe competition hypothesis also provides a principled explanation for the seemingly sporadic presence of RB for nonwords. According to this account, the potential magnitude of RB is related to the encoding effectiveness of the critical items. For example, when C1 is well encoded, large RB effects are possible; conversely, a poorly encoded C1 will not produce RB (refer to Figure 1 for an illustration). Because nonwords are infrequently encountered, they are more difficult to encode than are words; thus the potential RB one can find for nonwords is smaller than the potential RB for words. Furthermore, poor encoding effectiveness for nonwords means that performance in the control conditions is generally low, meaning that even a small amount of guessing of repetitions will have a much larger effect on RB for nonwords than for words.\nIn addition to the clear implications that our results have for theories of RB, they may also have implications for interpreting results from priming paradigms comparing words and nonwords. Although many researchers have focused on the most obvious difference between words and nonwords\u2014lexicality\u2014this difference may bring with it other, perhaps unanticipated, differences. For example, briefly displayed nonwords are encoded more poorly than words; thus, dissociable performance between words and nonwords on a task might not tell us as much about interactions within the lexicon as it tells us about the effects of differing amounts of noise in initial encoding. We believe this is the case in the comparison of RB for words and nonwords.\nReferences\nAndrews, S. (1997).
