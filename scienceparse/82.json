    "abstractText": "First impressions are powerful and rich sources of information about other people, and studies have demonstrated that they predict performance in numerous domains, such as teaching (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993) and electoral success (Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, & Hall, 2005). Much of this work, however, has employed outcome variables that are subjective. For example, in the study of teacher effectiveness, both the predictor (naive observers\u2019 ratings) and the outcome (teaching evaluations) were based on subjective opinions. Similarly, electoral success is based on voters\u2019 impressions of candidates, which are also responsible for which candidates are elected. In the current study, we examined the relation between a subjective predictor and an objective performance outcome: Are impressions of chief executive officers (CEOs) related to the performance of their companies? Despite the ubiquitous perception of the CEO as the embodiment of a company, there is no clear evidence of any relation between CEOs\u2019 personalities and their companies\u2019success (Ranft, Zinko, Ferris, & Buckley, 2006). Although some studies show that mediating factors, such as environmental context, can link factors like CEOs\u2019 charisma to companies\u2019 performance, no direct relation between CEOs\u2019 personalities and companies\u2019 success has been found (Agle, Nagarajan, Sonnenfeld, & Srinivasan, 2006; Tosi, Misangyi, Fanelli, Waldman, & Yammarino, 2004). Previous research, however, has shown that personality traits associated with the evaluation of leadership overlap with traits that can be judged reliably from the face. These traits include competence, likeability, and trustworthiness (Todorov et al., 2005) and dominance (Hess, Adams, & Kleck, 2005). Another facial feature related to judgments of leadership is facial maturity (Zebrowitz & Montepare, 2005). Are these variables that can be gauged from facial information also associated with leaders\u2019 success and performance? To answer this question, we asked participants to make naive personality judgments from the photographs of the CEOs from the 25 highest and 25 lowest ranked companies of the Fortune 1,000 and examined whether these judgments related to measures of the companies\u2019 financial success.",

            "text": "Trait and leadership ratings were averaged across participants for each CEO. Data for one CEO were removed from analysis because his score was more than 3 standard deviations below the mean for all CEOs. For the five personality traits, we conducted a principal components analysis with varimax rotation and obtained two factors: Power (competence, dominance, and facial maturity; 47% variance explained) and Warmth (likeability and trustworthiness; 39% variance explained). Hence, for each CEO, we computed composite power and warmth scores by averaging the scores for the traits loading on each factor.\nWe then calculated partial correlations between the independent measures (power scores, warmth scores, and leadership scores) and dependent measures (mean company revenues for FY 2004\u20132006 and mean company profits for FY 2004\u20132006), controlling for attractiveness, affective expression, and age. Table 1 summarizes the results.\nRatings of power-related traits from CEOs\u2019 faces, after controlling for age, affect, and attractiveness, were significantly related to company profits, r(41) 5 .36, p < .025. Thus, some element of financial success seems to be communicated through\nfacial appearance. Further, ratings of CEO leadership were also strongly related to company profits, r(41) 5 .30, p < .05; however, power and leadership were not significantly related to one another, r(41) 5 .08, p 5 .60. Similarly, the relation between profits and leadership remained significant after controlling for power, r(40) 5 .36, p < .025, and the relation between profits and power remained significant after controlling for leadership, r(40) 5 .40, p < .01.2 Thus, participants\u2019 naive perceptions of leadership ability from CEOs\u2019 faces are significantly related to how much profit those CEOs\u2019 companies make. Moreover, these judgments of leadership are not related to judgments of perceived power.\nThese findings suggest that naive judgments may provide more accurate assessments of individuals than well-informed judgments can. Our results are particularly striking given the uniformity in the CEOs\u2019 appearances. All the CEOs were male, of approximately the same age, and ostensibly Caucasian. Even when we controlled for age, affect, and attractiveness, CEOs from more versus less successful companies could be distinguished via naive judgments based solely on perceptions of the CEOs\u2019 facial appearance. Of course, we cannot draw any causal inferences as to whether more successful companies choose individuals with a particular appearance to be their CEOs or whether individuals with a particular appearance emerge as more successful in their work as CEOs. We can conclude, however, that naive inferences from facial appearance may provide information not only about subjective preference, but also about objective performance.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank Preeti Mehta, Sanjiv Mirchan-\ndani, Susan Pinto, and Mathew Sullivan.
