    "abstractText": "People are able to explicitly resist using knowledge about one person to evaluate another person from the same group. After learning about positive and negative behaviors performed by one individual from each of two different groups, participants were introduced briefly to new individuals from the groups. Implicit evaluations of the original individuals readily generalized to the new individuals; explicitly, participants resisted such generalization. Days later, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals generalized to the new individuals. The results suggest that associative links (e.g., shared group membership) are sufficient for implicit attitude generalization, but deliberative logic (e.g., individual group members are not necessarily the same) can reduce explicit generalization by association. When knowledge distinguishing who did what is unavailable, such as after forgetting, associative knowledge provides the basis of explicit evaluation. We conclude that a simple association linking one individual to another can produce implicit attitude generalization immediately and explicit attitude generalization eventually. Moral intuition and legal theory indicate that it is unacceptable to judge a person on the basis of the actions of another. Ancient and modern jurisprudence reject the notion of guilt by association (see Banaji & Bhaskar, 2000). Individuals are not deliberately punished for the crimes of others who share the same group membership\u2014whether the group is defined by kinship, friendship, or social category. Nevertheless, everyday thinking and judging provide occasions for evaluative generalization in which the actions of one individual are used in evaluating another. Crawford, Sherman, and Hamilton (2002) demonstrated that transferring the traits perceived about one individual to another group member depends on perceived group entitativity\u2014the extent to which a collection of individuals is perceived as being a unified entity (Campbell, 1958). Participants were given positive or negative information about an individual group member and were then given an opportunity to apply that information to other groupmembers (or not). The keymanipulation was whether the group to which the individuals belonged was described as having high entitativity (similar people with shared background, attitudes, and personalities) or low entitativity (diverse people with different backgrounds, attitudes, and personalities). When the group was perceived as being highly entitative, participants transferred traits from one groupmember to another. But when the social group was thought to be large and diverse, participants recognized that one individual is not representative of all group members and resisted generalizing their attitude from one person to another person in the same group. A nuanced understanding of group diversity overrides a more basic relation\u2014that individuals are associated by simply belonging to the same group. To avoid using evaluations of one person in judging another requires a deliberate judgment that group association is not a sufficient basis for generalization. Despite the conscious thought involved in resisting attitude generalization, the mental presence of a group association might be sufficient for observers to generalize even when they have no intention of doing so. In other words, even when attitude generalization is explicitly resisted, associations between group members may still exist and lead to generalization anyway.

PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Volume 19\u2014Number 3 249 Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND on November 11, 2014 pss.sagepub.com Downloaded from THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF ASSOCIATIVE RELATIONS A variety of modern dual-process models suggest that qualitatively distinct cognitive processes are involved in social evaluation. Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2006) and other researchers (Sloman, 1996; Smith & DeCoster, 2000; Strack & Deutsch, 2004) have suggested that both associative and propositional processes contribute to evaluation. Associative evaluations are activated automatically when a person encounters a relevant stimulus. Propositional processes, in contrast, influence deliberate, reflective decisions that involve the manipulation of symbolically represented rules. Gawronski and Bodenhausen have further proposed that the most important distinction between associative and propositional reasoning is that associative relations can be activated regardless of whether a person believes those associations are accurate or inaccurate, whereas propositional processes allow for the deliberation involved in conscious declarations of truth or falsity. For example, according to classical and modern conceptions of cognitive balance, if one learns that Oscar has many negative characteristics and then learns that Elmo belongs to the same group that Oscar belongs to, Elmo should become associated with negativity because of his association with Oscar (Greenwald et al., 2002; Heider, 1958). However, consciously applying propositional logic that Oscar\u2019s actions should not reflect on Elmo should inhibit associative transference. Deliberation allows for the rejection of the associative generalization and for Elmo to be judged on his own merits. Recent work showing the distinctiveness of implicit (associative) and explicit (deliberative) evaluations provides evidence that people can possess multiple evaluations of a single target\u2014even evaluations they would reject as false if given the opportunity to deliberate (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Nosek, 2007). In the present study, participants read about behaviors performed by two individuals who belonged to distinct, heterogeneous groups. One individual performed mostly negative behaviors, and the other performed mostly positive behaviors. Immediately after reading about these two individuals, participants were introduced briefly to two new individuals from the same groups.We predicted that the induced evaluations of the original individuals would generalize to the new individuals associatively, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), but that participants would resist generalizing from the original to the new individuals when given the opportunity to deliberate via self-reported evaluations. RESOURCES PREVENTING GENERALIZATION FADE WITH TIME The existing studies showing that people resist generalizing attitudes from one person to another have typically measured evaluations immediately after an attitude induction. Observers in these circumstances have ample resources with which to deliberate and prevent generalization. In particular, clear memory for who did what is necessary for observers to keep their evaluations straight and enables them to prevent the actions of one individual from influencing their judgments of another. With time, however, the details that maintain clear distinctions between the behaviors of different individuals are forgotten (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993). Brainerd and Reyna\u2019s fuzzy-trace theory, for example, distinguishes between gist memory (memory for the general meaning of informational inputs) and verbatim memory (more exact representation of the specific content of informational inputs; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995). According to this theory, verbatim memory is forgotten and becomes inaccessible quickly, leaving people to rely on gist memory (Clark & Clark, 1977). The quicker loss of verbatim memory relative to gist memory suggests that, over time, the specific information used to deliberately distinguish group members will fade. If the associations between group members still exist in memory without the conscious individuating information, then the passage of time should increase the difficulty of avoiding associative generalization from one person to another. To test this possibility, we reassessed implicit and explicit evaluations toward the novel individuals days after the induction. We expected that participants would be able to resist explicit (but not implicit) generalization when tested immediately, but that they would not be able to explicitly resist generalization following a delay. Thus, we predicted that after the delay, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals would generalize to the new individuals.",

In particular, clear memory for who did what is necessary for observers to keep their evaluations straight and enables them to prevent the actions of one individual from influencing their judgments of another.\nWith time, however, the details that maintain clear distinctions between the behaviors of different individuals are forgotten (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993). Brainerd and Reyna\u2019s fuzzy-trace theory, for example, distinguishes between gist memory (memory for the general meaning of informational inputs) and verbatim memory (more exact representation of the specific content of informational inputs; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995). According to this theory, verbatim memory is forgotten and becomes inaccessible quickly, leaving people to rely on gist memory (Clark & Clark, 1977).\nThe quicker loss of verbatim memory relative to gist memory suggests that, over time, the specific information used to deliberately distinguish group members will fade. If the associations between group members still exist in memory without the conscious individuating information, then the passage of time should increase the difficulty of avoiding associative generalization from one person to another. To test this possibility, we reassessed implicit and explicit evaluations toward the novel individuals days after the induction. We expected that participants would be able to resist explicit (but not implicit) generalization when tested immediately, but that they would not be able to explicitly resist generalization following a delay. Thus, we predicted that after the delay, both implicit and explicit evaluations of the original individuals would generalize to the new individuals."

            "text": "The study took place in two sessions. In the first session, participants read about behaviors performed by two individuals, Reemolap and Vabbenif (adapted from Gregg, 2000), each of whom was described as belonging to a large and diverse social group (low in entitativity). One of the individuals performed primarily positive behaviors, and the other performed primarily negative behaviors. Next, participants read brief introductions to two new individuals, Bosaalap and Ibbonif, who belonged to the same social groups as the original individuals. The information about the new individuals was minimal, and pretesting showed it to be relatively neutral.We then used the IATand semantic differential ratings to measure participants\u2019 implicit and explicit attitudes, respectively, toward either the original individuals or the new individuals. We manipulated the individuals to be evaluated between participants so that the act of reporting attitudes toward one pair would not influence reports of attitudes toward the other. The IAT is widely used to measure conditioned associations (Baccus, Baldwin, & Packer, 2004; Gregg, Seibt, & Banaji, 2006; Olson & Fazio, 2001; Rydell, McConnell, Mackie, & Strain,\n250 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND on November 11, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\n2006), and, because of its demonstrated reliability and sensitivity, it was particularly useful for assessing associations in this study (for a review of the psychometric properties of the IAT, see Nosek, Greenwald, & Banaji, 2007).\nWe predicted that people would explicitly refrain from using the information about the original group members in making immediate judgments of the new group members; this finding would replicate demonstrations that people can recognize that one individual\u2019s behavior is not representative of all group members if their group is large and diverse (Crawford et al., 2002; McConnell, Sherman, & Hamilton, 1997). In contrast, we predicted that implicit attitudes toward the new individuals would be as strong as if the new individuals were the targets of the original induction. That is, we expected the induced evaluations of the original individuals to immediately transfer associatively to the new individuals as a consequence of their shared group membership.\nThree days after the first study session, we invited participants to return to complete the implicit and explicit attitude measures again.We hypothesized that days after the initial learning episode, participants would show not only the implicit attitude generalization predicted for the first session, but also full explicit attitude generalization. That is, after the delay, we expected the attitudes induced toward the original individuals to provide the basis for explicitly evaluating the new individuals."

Ibbonif is kind and thoughtful, but tends to be slightly greedy at times.\nBosaalap is a painter and very much enjoys cooking, hiking, and listening to music. Bosaalap is warm and considerate, but tends to be slightly dishonest at times.\nIn pretesting, these descriptions were judged to be evaluatively equivalent.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Even when people deliberately resist using the behaviors of one individual to make explicit judgments about another individual from the same group, the simple association due to shared group membership is sufficient for implicit evaluations of one group member to generalize to another. Further, generalization occurs even explicitly when evaluations are measured days after the original induction. Despite participants\u2019 ability to consciously resist using group information as a basis of evaluation immediately, associations between group members still exist in memory and influence evaluation as time passes.\nBalance principles predict that if one person who is viewed negatively is associated with a second person by group membership, then the second person is likely to inherit the negative evaluation (Greenwald et al., 2002; Heider, 1958). We assume that resisting transferring attitudes from one person to another requires the ability to differentiate distinct knowledge about group members and the cognitive capacity to deliberately refrain from generalization. As information individuating two group members fades, resisting generalization becomes more difficult. As suggested by fuzzy-trace theory (Reyna & Brainerd, 1995), the details that distinguish knowledge about one group member from knowledge about another are forgotten, leaving conscious evaluation reliant only on the associations that are available in memory.\nLike the other studies that have used the IAT to measure conditioned associations, ours rests on the assumption that the IATmeasures associations (see also Greenwald, Nosek, Banaji, & Klauer, 2005). Rothermund and Wentura (2004) argued that the IATmay be influenced by salience asymmetries as well. However, it is unlikely that our conditioning paradigm induced salience asymmetries because we used novel groups and presented the same amount of information about each individual. The only difference between the individuals was that one was associated with positive behaviors and the other with negative behaviors.\nThe present results inspire a host of new questions concerning boundary conditions and variables that may moderate the influence of associative generalization on evaluation. For example, explicit generalization across individuals within a group should increase as a function of perceived similarity, but does implicit generalization occur even following trivial means of associating individuals? Also, this paradigm might be adapted to investigate when individuating or generalizing processes will dominate, and under what conditions automatic processes will lead to generalization despite conscious intentions otherwise.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 253\nat UNIV PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND on November 11, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nThe present work suggests that associative processes influence propositional processes in social evaluation and is a significant step in specifying the importance of associative relationships.\nEven if people believe that it is unacceptable to judge people on the basis of the actions of others, associative relations provide a subtle means of inducing guilt or accolade by association. This research demonstrated immediate and automatic evaluation of little-known social targets based on evaluations of associated individuals. An encounter with one member of a group can have lasting effects on evaluations of other members of the same group. In social judgment, generalizing evaluations from one person to others provides a simple heuristic for assessment. However, the potential cost is that individuating information that would enable more accurate assessment may be missed because of a propensity to generalize qualities that group members may not hold in common.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We would like to thank Tony Greenwald,\nLee Hendricks, Colin Tucker Smith, and the Implicit Cognition\nLab at the University of Virginia for their helpful comments.
