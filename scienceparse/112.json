This metaphor may have some surprising literal truth. If asked, for example, whether \u2018\u2018murder is sometimes justified,\u2019\u2019 individuals may be inclined to both agree and disagree with the statement. Here, we document, for the first time, the pull toward contrasting responses during evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining the trajectory of participants\u2019 reaching movements toward different response options.\nOur results suggest that a decision process is not necessarily completed in the brain\u2019s cognitive subsystems before it is shared with other subsystems, as has been traditionally assumed. Rather, simultaneous \u2018\u2018pull\u2019\u2019 frommultiple response alternatives seems to influence the execution of movement itself. This finding suggests that a dynamic approach to mental processing\u2014an approach that has already provided descriptions of perception, attention, and categorization (e.g., Abrams &Balota, 1991; Gold & Shadlen, 2000; Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Eriksen, &Donchin, 1988; Hovland & Sears, 1938; McClelland & Rogers, 2003; Spivey, 2007; Tipper, Howard, & Houghton, 1999)\u2014may shed new light on high-level cognition (Roe, Busemeyer, & Townsend, 2001; Townsend & Busemeyer, 1989)."

            "text": "The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants (97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions presented in random order over headphones. The questions were derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel project and had varying truth values (defined as the proportion of participants who responded that they were true). Examples of the questions include \u2018\u2018Should you brush your teeth everyday?\u2019\u2019\n(1.0 true), \u2018\u2018Is murder sometimes justifiable?\u2019\u2019 (.6 true), \u2018\u2018Is the sky ever green?\u2019\u2019 (.3 true), and \u2018\u2018Is a thousand more than a billion?\u2019\u2019 (.0 true).1\nWe tracked the x and y pixel coordinates of the movements of the computer mouse that participants used to respond to each question. Like other reaching actions, reaching movements made with a computer mouse provide a continuous two-dimensional index of which regions of a scene are guiding action plans (Spivey, Grosjean, & Knoblich, 2005). To initiate each question, participants clicked on a small start box at the bottom of a computer screen. Boxes labeled \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 then appeared in the top left and top right regions of the screen, and a recorded voice read a question (exactly 2 s in duration). Participants moved the mouse to click on their chosen response box as quickly and accurately as possible. To ensure that any effects were not due to the direction of movement, we reversed the positions of the \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 boxes for 54 participants."

Each individual trial\u2019s trajectory was interpolated into 101 time bins. The data from the 54 participants with reversed response positions did not differ from the data from the rest of the sample, and therefore were mirror-reversed to permit overlay. The mean question trajectories fell in a relatively orderly array from left to right (from \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019), their positions corresponding to Mindpixel truth values (see Fig. 1a). There was a robust relation between final x coordinate and truth value, r5 .91, F(1, 9)5 42.8, p 5 .0001, prep 5 .998.\nFor each trajectory, the degree of curvature was calculated as maximum deviation (in pixels) relative to a straight line from the starting position to the final position (response click). A histogram of trajectory curvatures (see Fig. 1b) shows that questions with lower truth values had greater absolute curvature and\nbroader distribution (lower kurtosis).

The trajectories for lowtruth-value questions showed significantly more curvature than the trajectories for high-truth-value questions, paired t(140) 5 6.0, p < .0001, prep > .999. Low-truth-value trajectories also exhibited a broader distribution around the curvature mean, showing significantly lower kurtosis than high-truth-value trajectories (95% confidence interval for K5 0.08 0.23 for low-truth-value trajectories and 1.09 0.24 for high-truthvalue trajectories).\nTrajectory velocity was computed using the distance (in pixels) covered per second over a moving window of six x,y pixel coordinates. Figure 1c shows the peak velocity for questions with low, medium, and high truth values, respectively. Peak velocity was highest for the high-truth-value group and lowest for the low-truth-value group, F(2, 278) 5 4.2, p < .05. Thus, \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 responses showed both greater attraction toward the alternative and reduced velocity compared with \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 responses.\nAlthough low-truth-value questions resulted in trajectories with the greatest curvature and the lowest peak velocity, a par-\nVolume 19\u2014Number 1 23\nat MARQUETTE UNIV on August 20, 2014pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nallel-competition account predicts that middle-truth-value questions, for which the response probabilities are equibiased, should induce the most competition. The motoric component of this competition was reflected in trajectories\u2019 sample entropy. Sample entropy is a measure representing the \u2018\u2018disorder\u2019\u2019 of a time series. For each trajectory\u2019s sequence of x-axis changes (Dx), we computed this measure by first determining the number of windows of size 3 (M3) that stayed within a given tolerance (the standard deviation of Dx). We then counted the number of sequences that were retained when the window size was extended to 4 (M4). Sample entropy was then given by ln (M4/M3) (Dale, Kehoe, & Spivey, 2007; Richman & Moorman, 2000). Sample entropy was higher for middle-truth-value questions than for low- and high-truth-value questions (see Fig. 1d), quadratic r 5 .70, F(1, 9) 5 8.7, p < .05, prep 5 .939. These results show that both the spatial extent (see Figs. 1a and 1b) and the temporal dynamics (see Figs. 1c and 1d) of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition (Rosenbaum, 2005). Our results are consistent with previous claims regarding proposition verification (Barres & JohnsonLaird, 2003; Clark & Chase, 1972; Gilbert, 1991). Specifically, we found that evaluating a proposition as false exhibits more difficulty compared with evaluating a proposition as true. Not only were \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 responses slower than \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 responses, but the \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 alternative conspicuously competed with the \u2018\u2018NO\u2019\u2019 alternative.\nThus, reasoning about the truth value of a proposition exhibits a significant a priori bias toward \u2018\u2018truth,\u2019\u2019 and this bias must be overcome before a \u2018\u2018false\u2019\u2019 response can come to fruition. These continuous arm-movement data are consistent with a dynamic decision process that continuously flows into the parallel competition and continuous blending of evolving motor commands (Cisek & Kalaska, 2005). Therefore, theoretical frameworks based on dynamic, embodied, and distributed processing may apply not only to perception, attention, and categorization (Dale et al., 2007; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Song & Nakayama, 2006; Spivey et al., 2005), but also to high-level cognition. Put simply, when actions accompany thinking, they are part and parcel of it.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank David Rosenbaum and Jerome\nBusemeyer for comments, and Nick Hindy for data collection."
