    "abstractText": "When learning new words, do children use a speaker\u2019s eye gaze because it reveals referential intent? We conducted two experiments that addressed this question. In Experiment 1, the experimenter left while two novel objects were placed where the child could see both, but the experimenter would be able to see only one. The experimenter returned, looked directly at the mutually visible object, and said either, \u2018\u2018There\u2019s the [novel word]!\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the [novel word]?\u2019\u2019 Twothrough 4-year-olds selected the target of the speaker\u2019s gazemore often on there trials than on where trials, although only the older children identified the referent correctly at above-chance levels on trials of both types. In Experiment 2, the experimenter placed a novel objectwhere only the child could see it and left while the second object was similarly hidden. When she returnedandasked, \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the [novelword]?\u2019\u2019 2through 4-year-olds chose the second object at abovechance levels. Preschoolers do not blindly follow gaze, but consider the linguistic and pragmatic contextwhen learning a new word. When learning an object name, young children often assume that the name refers to the object the speaker is looking at, even if the children themselves are looking at a different object when the word is used (e.g., Baldwin, 1991). Eye gaze cannot be a necessary cue for word learning; blind children can learn object names, after all, and children can infer that a word refers to an object even if the speaker is not looking at it (e.g., through mutual exclusivity\u2014Markman &Wachtel, 1988; when learning names for absent referents\u2014Akhtar & Tomasello, 1996). Even so, eye gaze does seem to be sufficient for word learning. What does this indicate about how children learn the meanings of words? Such results are often taken as demonstrating the importance of social cognition in word learning, under the assumption that children use a speaker\u2019s eye gaze as a cue to referential intent (e.g., Bloom, 2000). According to another account, however, children attend to a speaker\u2019s line of regard because of simpler, possibly unlearned, orienting responses (e.g., Moore & Corkum, 1994; but see Woodward, 2003); once they have done so, they come to associate the object they are attending to and the word they are hearing (Smith, Jones, & Landau, 1996; Plunkett, 1997). The precise details of such claims differ, but they share the view that, regardless of what role social cognition plays in other aspects of word learning, this primary and early-emerging sensitivity to eye gaze is unmediated by any inferences about the speaker\u2019s referential intent. The two accounts can be distinguished by what they predict about how mandatory this sensitivity to eye gaze is. If children use gaze cues out of an understanding that eye gaze reflects the speaker\u2019s meaning, gaze information should be exploited when it reveals the speaker\u2019s intent, but ignored when it is irrelevant or uninformative. We tested this hypothesis in two studies. EXPERIMENT 1: VISUAL PERSPECTIVE In Experiment 1, the child and the speaker explored two novel unnamed objects together. Then, in the speaker\u2019s absence, the objects were placed such that the speaker would be able to see only one of them, although the child could see both. The speaker returned, looked at the mutually visible object, and said, \u2018\u2018There\u2019s the [novel word]!\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the [novel word]?\u2019\u2019 If children mandatorily follow eye gaze to a target object when learning a new word, they would be expected to map the word to the mutually visible object in both conditions. Alternatively, if children are sensitive to the speaker\u2019s visual perspective and use gaze information in word learning only when it is informative, they would be expected to disregard eye-gaze cues on where Address correspondence to Erika Nurmsoo, University of Bristol, Department of Experimental Psychology, 12a Priory Rd., Bristol, BS8 1TU, Great Britain, e-mail: nurmsoo@aya.yale.edu.

The younger children, although uncertain of the correct answer in the where condition, nevertheless did not err by selecting the target of the speaker\u2019s eye gaze when it was uninformative.

            "text": "In our experiments, children ages 2 to 4 were able to take the perspective of a speaker (Experiments 1 and 2), and 3- to 4-yearolds were able to override eye-gaze cues when they were not relevant (Experiment 1). These findings might seem surprising, given that older children and adults have difficulty with similar tasks. For example, Epley, Morewedge, and Keysar (2004) explored perspective taking by having a speaker ask participants to move objects from one location to another in an upright array of boxes. They found that 6-year-olds and even adults often failed to take into account the speaker\u2019s visual perspective, responding as if the speaker could see an object that was visible\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 213\nat UNIV OF MICHIGAN on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nonly to the participant (but see Nadig & Sedivy, 2002). This task differs from our own in that it involves a much more complex array of objects and requires participants to determine the referents of existing words, not to make sense of new ones. Our study shows that 4-year-olds, and to some extent 2-year-olds, are able to consider the speaker\u2019s perspective in a referential task when given a simpler context.\nOur findings are consistent with those of Moll and Tomasello (2006), who found that when an adult asked for help searching for an object, 2-year-olds did not offer the object in plain view, but instead fetched the object visible to the child but hidden from the adult. In this task, however, the adult\u2019s eye gaze alternated between the visible object and the location of the hidden object, whereas in the parallel condition in our Experiment 1, the adult\u2019s eye gaze was directed at the mutually visible nontarget object, making the mapping problem more difficult. Although 2-year-olds were not able to correctly select the hidden object on these trials, as a group they did not mistakenly map the novel word to the target of the adult\u2019s gaze.\nThese findings provide support for a pragmatic approach to word learning, in which children do not simply follow surface cues to the speaker\u2019s referential intent, but instead seek to understand the situation as a whole. Studies consistent with this perspective have shown that somewhat older children do not learn a new label despite clear referential cues toward a novel object when the reliability of the speaker is called into question. For example, Koenig and Harris (2005) showed that 4-year-olds, and in some cases 3-year-olds, preferred to learn a novel label from a previously reliable speaker rather than from one who claimed ignorance of the names of familiar objects or who labeled them inaccurately (see also Birch, Vauthier, & Bloom, in press; Jaswal & Neely, 2006; Nurmsoo & Robinson, in press). And Sabbagh and Baldwin (2001) found that when a speaker explicitly claimed ignorance about the correct referent of a novel word (e.g., \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know what a blicket is. Maybe it\u2019s this one.\u2019\u2019), 3- and 4-year-olds did not learn the word. The present set of studies adds to this body of research, by showing that even when faced with a speaker who shows every sign of competent naming, and no uncertainty about the meaning of a novel label, children do not rely solely on eye-gaze cues to determine the referent of the new word, but use additional pragmatic or linguistic information to infer the correct target.\nExperiment 2 demonstrated that when two objects were hidden from the speaker, who could be seen as ignorant about the location of only one of them, 2- to 4-year-olds correctly identified the speaker\u2019s intended referent when she asked, \u2018\u2018Where is the [novel word]?\u2019\u2019 This finding converges with research suggesting that children use other cues to a speaker\u2019s referential intent when eye-gaze information is not sufficient. For example, when preschoolers are told, \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s find the toma,\u2019\u2019 they will map toma to the object that satisfies the searcher even when multiple novel objects are examined (and rejected; Tomasello & Barton, 1994) or when the unseen novel object is hidden in a locked toy\nbarn (Akhtar & Tomasello, 1996). Somewhat older children are sensitive to a speaker\u2019s false beliefs when interpreting the meaning of a novel word used to refer to the contents of a container, mapping the word to the object that the speaker falsely believes is hidden within (Carpenter, Call, & Tomasello, 2002; Happe & Loth, 2002).\nThere is considerable evidence, then, that children will track other cues to a speaker\u2019s referential intent when there are no eyegaze cues that can be used to identify the correct target. We have shown here that preschoolers are sensitive to a speaker\u2019s referential intent even when eye-gaze cues are present and directed at an incorrect target. Preschoolers do not blindly follow the direction of gaze."
