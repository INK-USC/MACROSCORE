In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved inprocessing realmotion. Humans quickly and efficiently extract motion information from a wide range of stimuli in the environment. Even visual stimuli that do not contain motion but only imply it, such as frozenmotion photographs, lead to the rapid and automatic extrapolation of motion paths (Freyd, 1983). For example, in the top photograph in Figure 1a, it is easy to see a sprinter running to the left. The sense of motion must be inferred from prior knowledge; there is, of course, no physical motion in the photograph. Such stimuli would appear to have little in common with the drifting dots and gratings commonly used to study neural mechanisms of motion processing, other than the fact that the observer knows that both types of stimuli depict motion in some sense. In the study reported here, we investigated how the sense of motion from static photographs is represented in the visual system. The primate brain contains a number of visual areas involved in the analysis of moving objects and patterns (Maunsell & Newsome, 1987; Tootell et al., 1995). Such areas contain neurons that respond to moving images in a direction-selective manner (Dubner & Zeki, 1971; Heeger, Boynton, Demb, Seidemann, & Newsome, 1999; Huk, Ress, & Heeger, 2001). The direction of motion, however, may be inferred not just from the analysis of visual motion, but also from low-level visual form cues, such as motion streaks (Burr &Ross, 2002; Geisler, 1999), or from higher-level cues, such as the posture of a person in motion (as in the photo of the sprinter in Fig. 1a). Is the sense of motion derived from such static cues instantiated by the same neural and psychological mechanisms that subserve the perception of physical motion? In particular, we sought to test whether viewing implied-motion images recruits the same direction-selective neural circuitry used for the perception of real visual motion. For example, does viewing the still photograph of the sprinter in Figure 1a elicit responses from the same leftwardselective neurons that would respond during the perception of real leftward motion? Neuroimaging studies have shown that brain areas used to analyze physical motion are also activated by viewing impliedmotion stimuli (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000; Lorteije et al., 2006; Peuskens, Vanrie, Verfaillie, & Orban, 2005; Senior et al., 2000). In these studies, visual motion areas, such as the human middle temporal/medial superior temporal complex (MT1), responded more strongly when subjects viewed photographs or silhouettes of animals, people, objects, or natural scenes containing implied motion than when they viewed similar images that did not imply motion (e.g., a cup falling off a table compared with a cup resting on a table, or a running athlete compared with an athlete at rest). These studies demonstrate that implied motion can activate brain areas also known to be engaged by real image motion. However, one cannot infer from such studies whether viewing stimuli with implied motion elicits directional motion signals in the brain, nor whether the same subsets of neurons, with similar tunings, are activated for implied and physical visual motion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures net activity, and does not currently have the resolution to routinely resolve individual columns. Moreover, although area MT1 has been shown to carry direction-selective signals in response to visual motion (Huk & Heeger, 2002; Huk et al., 2001), it can also be Address correspondence to Jonathan Winawer, Stanford University, Psychology Department, Jordan Hall, Bldg. 420, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, e-mail: winawer@stanford.edu.

Thus, a net increase in MT1 activation need not imply the existence of a direction-selective signal, nor do multiple instances of MT1 activation confirm that the same direction-selective neurons have been activated repeatedly (Grill-Spector & Malach, 2001; Huk & Heeger, 2002). In order to infer whether the same neural circuits are employed by inference and perception in the domain of visual motion, we made use of a motion aftereffect (MAE) paradigm. The MAE is a well-studied psychophysical phenomenon (Mather, Verstraten, & Anstis, 1998; Wohlgemuth, 1911) used to infer and assess the properties of direction-selective neural mechanisms. Prolonged viewing of motion in one direction makes subsequently viewed stationary (or directionally ambiguous) patterns appear to move in the opposite direction. This illusion is believed to result from the adaptation-induced decrease in activity of directionally selective neurons that respond to the adapted-to direction of motion (Barlow & Hill, 1963; Mather et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1961). This direction-selective adaptation in turn causes an imbalance in the population activity of neurons that represent different directions of motion. Because of this postadaptation imbalance, the neural population code will indicate a net direction of motion opposite the adapted-to direction when probed with stationary or directionally ambiguous stimuli. Thus, the presence of an MAE can be used as a psychophysical test for the involvement of directionselective neural mechanisms. We predicted that if viewing photographs of implied motion relies on the same direction-selective neurons that are involved in perception of physical motion, then viewing a series of such photos depicting motion in the same direction would adapt direction-selective neurons and produce an MAE. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments in which we measured whether viewing implied motion in one direction altered the perceived direction of subsequently presented real motion. In two experiments, the motion implied from the photographs was either leftward or rightward (Fig. 1a), and in the third experiment, the implied motion was inward or outward (Fig. 1b).",

            "text": "sense ofmotion.Does the inference ofmotion fromviewing a photograph involve the same neural and psychological representations used when one views physical motion? In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved inprocessing realmotion.\nHumans quickly and efficiently extract motion information from a wide range of stimuli in the environment. Even visual stimuli that do not contain motion but only imply it, such as frozenmotion photographs, lead to the rapid and automatic extrapolation of motion paths (Freyd, 1983). For example, in the top photograph in Figure 1a, it is easy to see a sprinter running to the left. The sense of motion must be inferred from prior knowledge; there is, of course, no physical motion in the photograph. Such stimuli would appear to have little in common with the drifting dots and gratings commonly used to study neural mechanisms of motion processing, other than the fact that the observer knows that both types of stimuli depict motion in some sense. In the study reported here, we investigated how the sense of motion from static photographs is represented in the visual system.\nThe primate brain contains a number of visual areas involved in the analysis of moving objects and patterns (Maunsell & Newsome, 1987; Tootell et al., 1995). Such areas contain neurons that respond to moving images in a direction-selective\nmanner (Dubner & Zeki, 1971; Heeger, Boynton, Demb, Seidemann, & Newsome, 1999; Huk, Ress, & Heeger, 2001). The direction of motion, however, may be inferred not just from the analysis of visual motion, but also from low-level visual form cues, such as motion streaks (Burr &Ross, 2002; Geisler, 1999), or from higher-level cues, such as the posture of a person in motion (as in the photo of the sprinter in Fig. 1a). Is the sense of motion derived from such static cues instantiated by the same neural and psychological mechanisms that subserve the perception of physical motion? In particular, we sought to test whether viewing implied-motion images recruits the same direction-selective neural circuitry used for the perception of real visual motion. For example, does viewing the still photograph of the sprinter in Figure 1a elicit responses from the same leftwardselective neurons that would respond during the perception of real leftward motion? Neuroimaging studies have shown that brain areas used to analyze physical motion are also activated by viewing impliedmotion stimuli (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000; Lorteije et al., 2006; Peuskens, Vanrie, Verfaillie, & Orban, 2005; Senior et al., 2000). In these studies, visual motion areas, such as the human middle temporal/medial superior temporal complex (MT1), responded more strongly when subjects viewed photographs or silhouettes of animals, people, objects, or natural scenes containing implied motion than when they viewed similar images that did not imply motion (e.g., a cup falling off a table compared with a cup resting on a table, or a running athlete compared with an athlete at rest). These studies demonstrate that implied motion can activate brain areas also known to be engaged by real image motion. However, one cannot infer from such studies whether viewing stimuli with implied motion elicits directional motion signals in the brain, nor whether the same subsets of neurons, with similar tunings, are activated for implied and physical visual motion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures net activity, and does not currently have the resolution to routinely resolve individual columns. Moreover, although area MT1 has been shown to carry direction-selective signals in response to visual motion (Huk & Heeger, 2002; Huk et al., 2001), it can also be Address correspondence to Jonathan Winawer, Stanford University, Psychology Department, Jordan Hall, Bldg. 420, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, e-mail: winawer@stanford.edu.\n276 Volume 19\u2014Number 3Copyright r 2008 Association for Psychological Science at NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nactivated by other factors, like attention and arousal (Beauchamp, Cox, & DeYoe, 1997; Corbetta, Miezin, Dobmeyer, Shulman, & Petersen, 1991; O\u2019Craven, Rosen, Kwong, Treisman, & Savoy, 1997; Saenz, Buracas, & Boynton, 2002), that may not be directionally selective (Huk et al., 2001). Thus, a net increase in MT1 activation need not imply the existence of a direction-selective signal, nor do multiple instances of MT1 activation confirm that the same direction-selective neurons have been activated repeatedly (Grill-Spector & Malach, 2001; Huk & Heeger, 2002).\nIn order to infer whether the same neural circuits are employed by inference and perception in the domain of visual motion, we made use of a motion aftereffect (MAE) paradigm. The MAE is a well-studied psychophysical phenomenon (Mather, Verstraten, & Anstis, 1998; Wohlgemuth, 1911) used to infer and assess the properties of direction-selective neural mechanisms. Prolonged viewing of motion in one direction makes subsequently viewed stationary (or directionally ambiguous) patterns appear to move in the opposite direction. This illusion is believed to result from the adaptation-induced decrease in activity of directionally selective neurons that respond to the adapted-to direction of motion (Barlow & Hill, 1963; Mather et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1961). This direction-selective adaptation in turn causes an imbalance in the population activity of neurons that represent different directions of motion.\nBecause of this postadaptation imbalance, the neural population code will indicate a net direction of motion opposite the adapted-to direction when probed with stationary or directionally ambiguous stimuli. Thus, the presence of an MAE can be used as a psychophysical test for the involvement of directionselective neural mechanisms.\nWe predicted that if viewing photographs of implied motion relies on the same direction-selective neurons that are involved in perception of physical motion, then viewing a series of such photos depicting motion in the same direction would adapt direction-selective neurons and produce an MAE. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments in which we measured whether viewing implied motion in one direction altered the perceived direction of subsequently presented real motion. In two experiments, the motion implied from the photographs was either leftward or rightward (Fig. 1a), and in the third experiment, the implied motion was inward or outward (Fig. 1b).\nMETHOD\nEach experiment began with a baseline motion-sensitivity task using moving-dot test stimuli. Following the baseline task, subjects viewed a series of implied-motion photographs interleaved with test trials of moving-dot probes. The dot probes were used to assess whether or not an MAE resulted from viewing the\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 277\nat NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nimplied-motion photos. In the first experiment, subjects viewed pictures with implied motion to the left or to the right and were tested with dot displays containing leftward or rightward real motion, making two-alternative forced-choice judgments on the direction of dot motion (left or right). The second experiment was similar, except that after 50% of the picture sequences, selected at random, there was a 3-s delay between the offset of the last picture and the onset of the moving-dot test trial. This delay was introduced to test whether an MAE from implied motion, like MAEs from physical motion (Keck & Pentz, 1977), would decay during a brief period following adaptation. In the third experiment, mirror-reversed pairs of implied-motion photographs were shown simultaneously side by side to create implied motion either toward fixation (\u2018\u2018inward\u2019\u2019) or away from fixation (\u2018\u2018outward\u2019\u2019). In all three experiments, subjects were instructed to attend to the pictures for a memory test following the experiment; there were no instructions to imagine or attend to the motion implied in the photographs. All subjects performed above chance levels on the old/new recognition memory test at the end of the experiment."

Random dot displays such as those used in this task have been important for studying visual motion systems because they do not contain recognizable features that can be used to infer a change in location over time, and are thus thought to rely on primary motion-processing mechanisms.\nIn the first two experiments, each test stimulus consisted of 100 dots contained within a rectangular window whose length and width were 33% of the entire display (approximately 121 91 of visual angle). We manipulated the proportion of dots moving coherently in a particular direction (motion coherence) from trial to trial, and subjects were instructed to indicate the direction of global motion using a key press (left or right). On each frame, a subset of the dots, equal to the percentage of dots moving coherently for that trial, was selected to move either left or right. All other dots disappeared and randomly reappeared at any other location within the test window. A new set of dots was reselected for coherent movement on each frame, so that the\ntrajectory of single dots could not be followed throughout a trial. Each 1-s test trial consisted of 25 frames displayed for 40 ms each. Dot displacement for coherent motion was approximately 0.051 per frame. In the third experiment, the test stimuli were identical, except that they consisted of 200 dots, 100 on each side of fixation (instead of 100 total), and they moved horizontally toward or away from the vertical midline (instead of left or right). By a key-press response, subjects indicated whether the dots appeared to move inward or outward. The window of the test stimulus was the same size as in the first two experiments, so the dot density was double."

A logistic function was fitted to the responses, with \u2018\u2018leftward\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018outward\u2019\u2019 arbitrarily coded as negative coherence, and \u2018\u2018rightward\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018inward\u2019\u2019 as positive coherence.

The average of the absolute value of these two values was considered the maximal dot coherence for each subject, and defined as 1 unit of normalized coherence. For each direction of motion, stimuli with 1 unit of normalized coherence and with 50% and 25% of this coherence value were used as test stimuli in the adaptation phase of the experiment. There were thus six different test stimuli per subject; within each block, the different stimuli were repeated an equal number of times, in random order.

After viewing implied motion in one direction, subjects were more likely to see the moving-dot test stimulus moving in the opposite direction. The population means, plotted in units of dot coherence normalized to each subject\u2019s motion sensitivity (see Method), showed that the direction of adaptation shifted the motion response function. This can be seen in Figures 3a through 3c by comparing for each pair of adapting conditions the point of perceived null motion, that is, the amount of motion coherence for which subjects were equally likely to respond \u2018\u2018left\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018right\u2019\u2019 (the first two experiments) or \u2018\u2018inward\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018outward\u2019\u2019 (the third experiment). For example, in Figure 3a, the point of perceived null motion contains more actual leftward motion coherence in the test stimulus following adaptation to leftward implied motion than following adaptation to rightward implied motion, a pattern consistent with an MAE in the direction opposite to the direction of implied-motion adaptation.\nIn Figures 3a through 3c, the size of the horizontal offset between paired functions reflects the amount of real motion needed tomake a test stimulus presented following one direction of adaptation perceptually equivalent to a test stimulus presented following the opposite direction of adaptation. To quantify the MAEs across subjects, we fit separate motion response functions to each subject\u2019s data using logistic regression, and calculated the mean difference between the points of perceived null motion in paired adaptation conditions (see Fig. 3d).\nIn the first experiment, the point of perceived null motion differed by 0.22 0.06 units of normalized motion coherence, t(18) 5 3.82, p 5 .001, prep 5 .99 (unless otherwise noted, the significance of effects was assessed with two-tailed paired t tests comparing the location of the point of perceived null motion within pairs of adapting conditions). In terms of the actual (nonnormalized) test coherence, the shift in the null point was 8.7 2.5%, t(18) 5 3.48, p 5 .003, prep 5 .97. If viewing implied motion did not lead to adaptation, the motion response functions would have overlapped, and hence there would have been no difference between the points of perceived null motion for rightward and leftward implied motion.\nThe results of the no-delay condition in the second experiment closely replicated the result of the first experiment: The null point shifted by 0.27 0.09 units of normalized coherence, t(17) 5 6.47, p5 .000, prep5 .99, or 8.9 1.9% of actual test coherence, t(17) 5 4.74, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99. However, with a 3-s delay between adaptation and test stimuli, the effect of adaptation was smaller: 0.10 0.06 units of normalized coherence and 2.3 1.9% of actual coherence. The difference between the no-delay and delay conditions was significant, t(17) 5 2.75, p 5 .013, prep5 .94, and t(17)5 2.24, p5 .038, prep5 .90, for normalized and nonnormalized test coherence, respectively.\nSubjects in the third experiment showed significant adaptation to inward and outward implied motion. The point of perceived null motion shifted by 0.17 0.04 units of normalized coherence, t(28)5 4.98, p5 .000, prep 5 .99, or 5.7 1.0% of actual coherence, t(28) 5 5.48, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99."

            "text": "In each of these three experiments, the viewing of photographs depicting movement led to systematic shifts in the responses to subsequent real-motion test probes. The test probes were more likely to be judged as moving in the direction opposite the direction depicted in the previous adapting photographs than to be moving in the same direction. The transfer of adaptation from implied motion to real motion provides evidence that still images depicting movement recruit direction-selective neurons, and demonstrates that processing implied motion can affect the subsequent perception of real motion.\nOur results cannot be explained by low-level motion-energy biases in the image sequences, or by apparent motion between successive frames. The sequence of images was generated randomly on each adaptation trial. There was an equal likelihood that any particular pair of images would be seen in one order or the opposite order, and this rules out explanations based on spurious biases inmotion energy or apparent motion. Further, it is unlikely that our results can be explained by systematic eye movements (e.g., Chaudhuri, 1991). Our use of inward and outward stimuli in the third experiment preclude explanations based on optokinetic nystagmus, and the fact that the pattern of results was the same as in the previous two experiments is evidence against explanations based on directional biases in eye movements during adaptation.\nIt also appears unlikely that the results obtained in these experiments were due to a strategic or cognitive bias, rather than a shift in the perception of the test stimuli. First, had the pattern of responses in the first experiment been driven by a nonperceptual bias, we would not have predicted the decline in the MAE after a brief delay, as observed in the second experiment. Second, a debriefing following the third experiment revealed that prior knowledge of the MAE did not explain the results: Of the 24 subjects who responded to a question asking whether or not they had heard of the MAE (5 subjects did not respond), 20\n280 Volume 19\u2014Number 3\nat NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nsaid they had never heard of it.

There is evidence that mental imagery of motion can activate motion-sensitive brain areas (Goebel, Khorram-Sefat, Muckli, Hacker, & Singer, 1998; Grossman & Blake, 2001), and our own unpublished results suggest that imagery of motion can elicit anMAE.

For the first and second experiments (a and b), the frequency of responding \u2018\u2018rightward\u2019\u2019 following adaptation to rightward and leftward implied motion is plotted as a function of motion coherence in the test stimulus. For the second experiment, results are shown separately for the delay and no-delay conditions. For the third experiment (c), the frequency of responding \u2018\u2018inward\u2019\u2019 following adaptation to inward and outward implied motion is plotted as a function of motion coherence in the test stimulus. The graph in (d) summarizes the separation between the curves for each experiment. The bars show the mean separation across subjects in terms of normalized coherence; their shading indicates whether or not there was a delay between adaptation and test trials (white5 no delay, gray5 3-s delay). The triangles indicate the separation in terms of actual (nonnormalized) coherence. Positive values indicate a separation in the direction predicted by adaptation. Error bars indicate standard errors.\nVolume 19\u2014Number 3 281\nat NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2015pss.sagepub.comDownloaded from\nrequires from a few hundred milliseconds to several seconds (Cooper & Shepard, 1973; Kosslyn, 1976), and our stimulus presentation rates were relatively fast (2\u20135 Hz).\nOne might reasonably ask, nonetheless, whether viewing the photographs elicited direction-selective neural activity via automatic associative processes.We cannot rule this out, nor do we wish to. Such processes are compatible with Helmholtz\u2019s (1886/ 1924) notion of \u2018\u2018unconscious inferences,\u2019\u2019 which have been postulated to explain a wide range of perceptual phenomena (e.g., Barlow, 2001). In this view, pictorial cues to motion are learned from statistical regularities in the environment, such that static images containing familiar objects in motion can trigger motion responses via pattern-completion processes. Recently, by using explicit associative-learning paradigms, it has been shown that a previously meaningless static cue can, after training, bias the percept of an ambiguous-motion display (Qi, Saunders, Stone, & Backus, 2006) and can elicit directional signals in single neurons in macaque MT (Schlack & Albright, 2007). Moreover, when a moving stimulus repeatedly follows a predictable trajectory, direction-selective neurons in macaque parietal cortex signal the direction of that stimulus\u2019s motion when it is occluded (Assad & Maunsell, 1995).\nOur results join a growing number of findings in the human and monkey literature showing interactions between form and motion processing (reviewed by Kourtzi, 2004). One important observation has been that a very simple type of form information, orientation, can strongly affect motion perception: Two types of stimuli that do not contain directional motion but do contain spatial orientation information, motion streaks (Burr & Ross, 2002; Geisler, 1999) and Glass patterns (Krekelberg, Dannenberg, Hoffmann, Bremmer, & Ross, 2003; Ross, Badcock, & Hayes, 2000), have been shown to influence perceptual and neural visual motion processing. Because of sluggish temporal integration in the visual system, moving stimuli tend to create blur along the direction of motion, and the visual system may exploit this regularity to infer motion trajectories from orientation, including the orientation information in motion streaks and Glass patterns. We note, however, that the inference of motion from simple orientation cues and the inference of motion from high-level object and scene-related cues likely occur at different stages in the processing pathway. Motion streaks may be extracted quite early in processing (e.g., perhaps in primary visual cortex; Geisler, 1999). In contrast, inferring the direction of motion depicted in photographs likely occurs in higher-level object areas in visual cortex, as evidenced by electroencephalographic (EEG) studies showing a delayed response to impliedmotion photographs (Lorteije et al., 2006), as well as by the sensitivity to the depiction of action in neurons in anterior regions of the temporal lobe in monkeys (Jellema & Perrett, 2003).\nIn summary, we found that direction-selective motion adaptation can result from viewing static images with impliedmotion. The direction-selective adaptation we report had an effect on subjects\u2019 perception of a real-motion stimulus immediately fol-\nlowing adaptation. These findings demonstrate that inferring motion from purely form-based cues involves direction-selective motion mechanisms. Further, these mechanisms must rely on some of the same neurons used for motion perception because the adaptation transferred from implied motion to perception of real motion. That is, at least some neurons that are directionally selective for the perception of actual motion are also activated while observers view implied motion in that same direction. A very recent study has independently arrived at a related conclusion\u2014that viewing real motion can affect the neural response to subsequent implied-motion photographs\u2014using a physiological measure (EEG) instead of a perceptual measure (Lorteije et al., 2007). An exciting extension of the work reported here would be to directly investigate the neural signals involved in the perception of motion implied in static images."
